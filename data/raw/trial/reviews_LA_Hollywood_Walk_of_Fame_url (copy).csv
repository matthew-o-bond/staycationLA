30,Crowded - Decent Photo Op Though!,An iconic sight to be sure but because there are so many people walking in the area at once the crowding can obscure many of the stars and I'm sure others simply trying to move forward are irritated by the frequent stops in the middle of the walkway by tourists. I am glad I got to see it but it is a bit overhyped.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spoopty
20,"Iconic, but be prepared to be on edge","One of the standard 'must visit' tourist traps in LA. Plenty of photo opportunities with the stars but you'll be rushed out of the way but streams and streams of fellow tourists wanting the same photos.Don't expect a relaxing stroll, if there aren't lots of tourists in the way, there'll be people trying to make you part ways with your money - all the usual suspects are there trying to get your attention and cash.If you're ok with that sort of thing then go for it, you can probably walk the whole thing an hour or two, but can't see why you'd want to go more than once unless you were with someone who hasn't been.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arichards179
50,Really long,This attraction can be fascinating if you start at one end and go to the other. It's amazing how many peoples names you recognize and how many you don't. It can be fun to walk until you find somebody whose name you don't do then Google it to see why they were there on the Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame goes from run down trashy areas all the way through ritzy areas. It's really quite interesting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OldProChef
20,"A lot longer than you think, in a dive of an area.","The Hollywood Walk of Fame is fun for a while but it is well over 2 miles long, down side streets etc. If you are looking for a particular star, it could take an afternoon. Unfortunately, the area is rough and the stench of cannabis makes you sick to the stomach. Littered with aggressive street sellers. Won't be doing it again unless a hero of mine gets a star and I have nothing else to do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/queenr0ck
30,Fun but not glamourous,The walk of fame is not quite as glamorous as you’d expect! It’s like most busy dirty streets but it was fun to find the stars we wanted to see. Only other thing was being constantly hounded by tour guides got a bit annoying. We went down there twice for different things and found it much more pleasant in the morning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairemeech
50,A great fun time!,Great fun following the Walk of Fame and spotting all the stars we recognised! There were streets of them! We really enjoyed our time and took loads of photos of the stars. Our niece had particularly asked us to send her a photo of Pink’s and we didn’t give up until we found it!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tauntonholidayers
50,A must do !,"This is a must do :)A lot of walking so bring good confortable shoes. Lots of live music everywhere. Lots of churros, hot dogs and tacos for sell, highly recommend to bring cash for food. Parking was a lot of trouble. Took us approximately 30 minutes to find parking. There’s a good amount of souvenir stores all around the walk as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsgiwatravels
30,It’s a must do but an anti climax,We visited here last week and came away with mixed feelings. I’m not sure what I expected but it was probably more than this. It’s excellent seeing the stars in the walk of fame but the best part are the hand and foot prints outside the Chinese theatre. Nice to tick it off!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnclarkson
50,Can’t beat the stars,This is a must see when coming to Los Angeles. Lined up and down both sides of Hollywood Boulevard are various stars of your favorite celebrities. This is a ‘do not miss’.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seein-the-sights
40,This is actually Fun and it doesn't cost you a dime!,You can take as much time as you want and actually the more days you can add the better the experience. Map out where you want to go and who is high on your list to visit and be prepared for surprises along the way. Keep in mind that you are crossing a number of cultures so be a bit flexible for that. Many of the shopkeepers make a living from tourists so be prepared for that as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ucommit
50,Nice walk ! Loads of souvenirs shops around,"It’s cool, you get to see all the stars names but don’t expect glamorous walk way or red carpets ! It’s rather rough ! Still worth a visit !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martab_daphne
20,"Really sketchy, tacky road","For a road full of famous stars, the road itself is dirty and full of tacky erotic stores and souvenir shops. Maybe that’s fitting? I don’t know.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RBC4505
40,Crowded,"If you go in the summer make sure to bring a water bottle! The Walk of Fame was great we saw all our favorite actress and actors and singers stars and made a few stops a long the way, it also wasn't that crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheAdventurer17
30,Not what I expected....,"One of those you have to do it things to tick it off your list. It was enjoyable seeing a few favourite celbs names. It is however not what I expected. It was dirty and very run down. It's in no way glamorous. Vendors are trying to sell you stuff by tricking you into getting photos then demanding money, lots of homeless and people trying to sell their tours. I was in L.A. for work. I'd be disappointed if I paid to go to L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChampagneEyes
30,Worth a look,"It's a long footpath with a lot of stars, many of which feature celebrities you probably haven't heard of. Be prepared to be harassed by buskers, opportunists and weirdos along the way too. Fair few other attractions nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F7227FIjg
20,Meh,Dirty area and boring tourist trap but it is so well known I guess you have to see it. You'll do all you need to do around this area in 30mins def don't plan a day of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nathansZ4280BP
20,"Dirty, and underwhelming","I found the Hollywood walk of fame dirty, and smelly. It was disappointing and certainly does not look as glamorous as it is made out to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dutchdecor
30,Good for killing time,"The street is quite long. If you really want to see any specific stars of your favorite actors/actresses/singers, you should do search the location of the stars before you come here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suda-sir
40,Good experience,My only advice is to walk on the right where the big names are if you don’t have much time in LA. After that have a Japanese meal which is in the mall really nice food in there enjoy 😊,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tashac913
40,1st Walk of Fame,"It was exciting to walk along side these stars of my favorite actors/actresses. The street is very clean and neat and the stars are well maintained. The street vendors get in your face and try to force merchandise into your hand on in your shopping bag when you're not looking. I would keep an eye on younger children as they will likely take something a vendor would pass to them. Other than the vendors, it was an excellent experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acarter2020
30,Walk of fame,"Disappointed as unclean stars, homeless people on sidewalks, too many vendors, it would help if they could clean this attraction, very disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaraaT3601KE
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame - Historic! Photo Opportunities Galore!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is is the heart of Hollywood and there's plePantages Theatrenty to see besides the Stars on the Walk of Fame. You are close to Grauman's Chinese Theatre- just feet away from the El Capitan Theatre, The Jimmy Kimmel Studio , Roosevelt Hotel, famous Musso & Franks Restaurant , Pantages Theatre, and if you'd like a view....Yamashiro's ( you'll need a car or vehicle to drive you up the hill-but views and food well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShermanOaks2019
20,Disappointing,Maybe it was just me but this was not how I envisaged it. Not at all glamorous. I'm glad we saw it but wasn't impressed with Hollywood at all,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761valm
30,"But Cheesey, but fun","Did the touristy bit, well you have to really. Got a hop on and off bus to get around the city. Not cheap, 1 day $48 per adult. Only did a section of the walk of fame and headed for the Chinese Theater. Which has the hand prints as well of the older stars. Hubby found a sight which told you roughly where specific stars are ie Tom Hanks. There was a lot of beggers around the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tinkerbell1105
40,West Hollywood,"unimpressed with the HWoF.The area is tatty and full of homeless people. Dont go to Whitley Market corner shop in the small shop area, you'll be ripped off, being charged 4 x the actual amount for your goods.7/11 up the road is much better and more friendly .Walk of fame is worth the effort if only just to say youve seen it,otherwise, a bit naff.West Hollywood in my opinion, is a dump.however, we were only in that area and we didnt just stay there. LA is massive, so explore everything .its cheaper and easier for getting on the freeway to go south. If you are in the centre of LA, traffic is a nightmare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/specren
50,Good walk,Good walk although everyone stopping to look or take photos of the stars on the floor can be a bit frustrating,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agt96
40,We were just up in HollyWood- For New-to-L.A. visitors- Yep..you got-a-see-it!,"There is a lot happening up IN Hollywood and ON Hollywood Blvd- there are Shows, Plays and Exhibitions- or on a nice L.A. day, very busy on weekends- there are famous historic and trendy restaurants and people in costumes - that's how it got its name = it's Hollyweird! When exploring SoCal- it goes with the territory........",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBjeffreyl
30,Had a nice time,We had a nice time discovering the different stars. I think that the city needs to do a better job at keeping the area clean. Some of the stars were so dirty that they were barely legible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/72bridgettj
10,Stay away,"a visit is totally unnecessary, overcrowded, pure rip-off, has nothing to do with your possible ""dreams"" of Hollywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elisa_Forg
20,“Spiritual Wasteland”,"Ok, we went and can put a check mark next to it. Been there, done that. But there’s really not much to this to be excited about. Hollywood Boulevard is a slightly less crowded version version of Times Square. It’s overly hyped tourist trap. There’s really not much to do but walk the strip, look at the various stars on the ground and then it’s all like “yep, there’s that”. There are shops but they are all tourist-trap type shops, including the Scientology storefront. In front of which, sadly, there are very young folks soliciting a “free” preview film rather aggressively, urging passerby’s to come inside. (Don’t).We skipped the wax museums (having spent too much money on the like in other tourist trap locations) but did grab an ice cream float from Ghiradelies - which was quite delicious.My son actually called it a “Spiritual Wasteland” because you kind of feel an overwhelming sense that the soul has been sucked out of this area a long time ago.All that being said however... I suggest a quick visit if you’ve never been there before, just to say you have and check it off the list of places to see. But for real - plan an hour tops. Walk the strip back and forth. Do NOT go alone if you’re from out of town (unless you’re from another big crowded, crime laden city), be extra careful and smartwith your wallet, then catch an Uber to the beach for a better time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauretteLynn
50,Stroll in the HWoF,"Our 11/14 year old boys loved looking for the celeb stars, but even more than that got a kick out of the photo ops: their very own star, being grabbed by King Kong etc. most of this self guided foot tour is free. Older folks may find the Blvd seedy but both grandparents and parents enjoyed seeing this site through the eyes of the young",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M2520ABdanb
30,Walking the Walk!,Interesting but very crowded and not very clean. Better to see it on a brochure! Los Angeles not an overly pleasant place to visit. Santa Monica Pier was good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/93lynda1951

50,Amazing,"This is a very memorable place to visit, which my partner and I absolutely loved. A very busy place, but well worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shagron
30,"Typical ""Thing to do"" while in Hollywood","Look, it's exactly as you should expect. A long sidewalk with starts and celebrity names on ""stars""It's a good way to spend a couple of hours. FYI - Parking is horrible and expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spartan_fire
30,Walk of fame,It was an experience for sure. Liked to see all celebritys name. China Theatre was to much people an vannabies dressed like moviestars. When you didnt pay them there was angry and learned you a lot of bad words.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ontheway007
30,not so exciting,"You walk around the area and look at the stars. They are very mixed in dates, and areas of accomplishment. Not very exciting. Also be aware that all the people walking around the area in Star Wars or Superhero costumes will happily pose with you, but there is a fee involved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CLZA
30,Found Sinatra!,Have done the Hollywood Walk of Fame before - they're not all on Hollywood Blvd so keep an eye out for your fave! I would definitely do this activity during the day; the area isn't what it used to be - definitely a vibe shift. Tip: don't travel here with luggage; I had a few locals ask me if I was homeless and suss me up and down. Better to leave your luggage at hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatchstickLive
50,Take it in,"Although it's a very busy tourist trap, it's fun to take a walk if you are in the area. The area is a bit like Times Square so use your street smarts and enjoy it for what it is...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MG02116
30,Over rated,"Maybe if i was a teenage boy or especially girl i would also shout and scream when i would come across a star of my fav actor/singer but i just did not have such feelings when i was there, i thought maybe i would be also excited but somehow it just did not happen to me so u can try this place out and let us know how it was",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dr_usmanm

30,"Has to be done, but don’t get to excitex","You can’t go to LA and not visit Hollywood and the like but, I wouldn’t be getting to excited over it. It’s not the magical place people expect, it is literally just the stars along the pavement and you walk them of your own pace . I found some of them hard to read because they are turned all different directions and it’s not one solid path. Glad I saw it but if I went to LA just to see it I’d be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citytravels18
30,Free walk,We have fun looking for stars and also watching people. I tried to see someone famous but was none. also we found some attraction to kill some time on the way. I really love doing this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yenyok
50,Quite disappointed,"Had high expectations of Hollywood Walk of Fame unfortunately it left me very disappointed. It’s dirty, smelly and surrounded by homeless. It’s shocking. When you’re in Hollywood it’s definitely worth going and see by yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chickitos
30,Busy tourist area...,"This is a place you need to visit when coming to LA for the first time. However it didn’t live up to my expectations. It was very busy/crowded, hard to enjoy the tiles & street seemed dirty. Many performers dressed up and asking for money. Just didn’t make me feel comfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1erinb
30,Lower your expectations,"Don't get me wrong, the Walk of Fame is still something that must be done if visiting LA, but don't expect it to be as magical as many people make it out to be. When we visited in late January 2020, the area was quite deserted; we were expecting crowds of people but there was probably more homeless people and locals than tourists. Unfortunately, this was therefore an issue with the area as one finds it hard to just enjoy looking at the stars as every minute someone comes up to you trying to sell you something or asking for money so it can be a bit daunting. There also wasn't much signage, maps would've been nice, otherwise you just walk along hoping to see people's stars that you wanted to see. As aforementioned, I would still suggest visiting if you haven't been, but don't expect great things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MR_Travels1920
30,Wall of Fame,"Went for walk along Hollywood’s Walk of Fame. A lot of famous stars with actor, actress and character names on the pavement. There are also costume dressed up characters hoping to get some tips if you take a photo with them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkh_travels
40,Right in the heart of tourist LA,"The stars are an attraction that you want to see, but once you have seen them, you don't need to go back... I found the hand prints at the Chinese Theatre a lot more interesting as some of them date back to the early 1940's from some amazing old Hollywood actors and actresses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763MelissaP
40,Good to see and quite long,"Hollywood walk of fame is quite long and is on both sides of Hollywood Boulevard. If you have a car, best to park in the Hollywood & Highland parking as it is quite central and you can get discount on parking if you buy something from stores in the mall. Do check which shops offer discount on parking. Stars are on the street and hence can be dirty at times. There are heaps of food trucks along Hollywood Blvd as well, best to get food from the ones that have long queues. Dolby theatre is quite good to see as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriyaV661
50,An Icon to see,"If you are in Los Angeles, you must visit ""The Hollywood Walk of Fame"" which is an internationally-recognized Hollywood icon. You will have many chance to meet stars: both on the ground and personally😊. The idea for creating a Walk of Fame belongs to Mr.E. M. Stuart in 1953. He was a president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. In addition to the decorated side walk by the star name tags of celebrities, there are many famous buildings on the Blv of Walk of Fame such as academy awards ceremony hall, chinese theatre, some famous hotels have been hosting celebrities during their life time. You can visit the area by yourself or take a tour. Please enjoy the glamourous life of celebrities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/797ebrua
50,Fun times,We lived walking the strip especially at night. It's lots of people performing and selling their goods.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FairportMom

30,Be prepared and keep your head on a swivel,"It's interesting and it can be a lot of fun . But I really was not prepared for the amount of homeless that was in the area and it came along with the filth ,unfortunately. I'm just not sure if this is going to create a dip in the tourist industry for that area and LA as a whole .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardhI8912KH
30,Bigger than you think,I’ve always thought it was a relatively small area where these stars would be but it’s massive. You have to plan it out if you want to see them all. It’s fun taking a picture with your favourite stars name and there’s even blank ones so you could digitally add a name if you wanted to ;) people are accommodating and you can squat down and take pictures. Some of the popular ones have people milled around them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanessaM646
30,You have to look and walk but....,"As a first time visitor it surprised me the length of the walk of fame, but the superhero photographs, the tackiness of some parts I just wasn't taken with. The central element at the Chinese theatre with the hand and footprints in cement was worth a walk and trying to explain to younger ones who people where, but nothing much more to see or do, other than avoid scammers. As per the title, you have to go and see it for sure, but you will question how many people you don know, and it is living on yesteryear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rhys_H24
50,The starry walk of fame,"Hollywood Blvd gets very busy as most can imagine. It's best to get there early in the morning when you can enjoy all the Stars and scenes without interruption and not fighting for a spot to see. We visited prior to an LA tour and it was very nice in the morning. We got to see everything we Wanted before crowds formed. It is a very touristy area rich with history, but a fun thing to do while in LA. Each person's star is denoted with a symbol fir which they recieved their star for. We had a good time, but it's probably a one time thing, as I wouldn't see the need to revisit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LawyerBaeRenee
40,Hollywood Walk Of Fame,"February 14, 2020 I took my nephew and niece to see the world’s most famous sidewalk boasts 2,500 stars and counting. Hollywood Walk of Fame is practically a rite of passage—and it’s also one of the city’s most beloved free attractions.Honoring luminaries in motion pictures, television, radio, live theatre, and recording since 1960, the famous sidewalk includes both sides of Hollywood Boulevard from Gower to La Brea, plus both sides of Vine Street from Yucca to Sunset. While you’re there, you’re a short walk from such big Hollywood Boulevard attractions as Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre, and Madame Tussauds Hollywood.Be aware of your surroundings because there are a lot of homeless people harassing others for money or even worst you see characters in costumes trying to get you to take pictures with them and then they will harras you for money as well. So just say no and save yourself the trouble. There are plenty of restaurants on the Hollywood blvd and they are all pretty good.On Hollywood Blvd and N Highland Ave, there's Huge garage parking underneath Loews Hotel and Dolby theater building. The entrance of parking is on N highland Ave. I usually pay under $10 for two hours parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikegannaway
20,Busy,"A busy, unpleasant environment in which the people asking for photos with costumed super heroes and the like were inescapable , also the overlooking tent for a show was disruptive to the entire walk, a real shame for a national landscape well known globally !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harvb100
30,"again, just checking off the list","This area was kinda fun to see, but it's the Grand Canyon of Hollywood (think Chevy Chase's reaction to the Grand Canyon in Family Vacation).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CR141
20,Not what we expected.,"I’m not sure what we expected from going to the walk of fame, but what we experienced certainly wasn’t it.It’s obviously a large area, but all of it smelt like pee and was generally dirty. It was not a well looked after area as we assumed it would’ve been.It was nice to experience it and was cool to see the different stars but we were disappointed at the atmosphere and the area.There is a large homelessness problem around there, so we were often approached for money or drugs (weed is legal there).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethH0506

50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"It’s a nice in a lifetime experience to stroll down the sidewalk looking at the Stars. You do kind of have to brace yourself for “look-a-like” Power Girl, Batman and other character actors who eke out a living getting photos made with tourists. Of course I didn’t mind a bit coughing up 5bucks to have a snap of me cuddling up wit Poer Girl. lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gandalfgrey1
30,It was interesting but,"It is interesting to see all the stars (as in the sidewalk) and the cement in the Chinese Theatre vestibule, but it is dirty and it is filled with a melting pot of very different people. I guess it is ok, easy parking nearby but not really all that great kind of a giant tourist trap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimT15
30,Everyone has to do it when in LA.,"I stay in Hollywood often. I feel at home around there. There is some good shopping, coffee and food to be found. Access to the trains means greater LA is accessible to you. The walk of fame itself goes a fair way and I guess everyone who go to Hollywood for the first or second time can enjoy reading a few of them. There are some famous names there and I guess the walk of fame is a valid part of the whole Hollywood ""thing"". Lots of normal tourists doing normal tourist things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdNoble58
40,Nice to have done,Walk of fame was actually a very long walk. Both sides of Hollywood Blvd has theeee stars in the sidewalk. Stars from the beginning of film and also music stars where namned. Nice experience when weather let’s you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hansk882
40,"Tons of tourists, watch your purse but worth it",Lots of tourists but so interesting to see people’s comments and sizes of hands and feet by Graumans Chinese Theatre and all the stars names you walk over. Some make you shake your head trying to remember who they are. Lots of sales people trying to sell you tours or dressed in costume for you to pay them to have your picture taken. Still visitors should absolutely come. Just be mindful of your valuables while in that area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AuntTink
30,Walking down Hollywood Boulevard,Walking down Hollywood Boulevard Can be pretty crazy. You do have to be careful because there are some homeless people that unfortunately are high on drugs or have a mental challenges so beware. But it still is a lot of fun to put your hands in the hand prints of the famous stars at the Chinese theater. Try to take a show in at the Pantages it’s a beautiful place to go inside to see a play. The wax museum is a lot of fun and so is the Guinness book of records museum. It’s fun to walk down and see all of the stars on the sidewalks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/700terriel
10,Nothing much,You will be literally greeted by neon lights from the 70s. It’s power packed with baskers of all sorts. Please consider to skip if you are energy sensitive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850jiayanc
30,Walk of Fame,It is completely worth the trip. Walking down Hollywood Blvd. is enjoyable. There are a number of homeless people. It is very different than it was 10-15 years ago. It is not the Hollywood that is often pictured.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherryscheline
50,The Walk of Fame,"I took my teenage son and he enjoyed it. Not only is it free, there is a star for everyone. We had fun searching for stars as well and you can get a map streetside that shows where each star is places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizp739
50,Safe Day and Night,Nice police presence and really just friendly people everywhere. Was never approached or made to feel uncomfortable. A lot of history and a lot of fun everywhere. West Hollywood is alive and about to thrive!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LGS4LIFE
30,Not sure what I think about this attraction,"The cement footprints/handprints outside the Grauman's Chinese Theatre are the only things worth looking at. So many iconic movie premieres took place there. Perfect for Star Wars fans. Funny to see Slyvester Slallone misspelt forever. (Oops.) A tonne of 50s/60s references to 'Sid' (Sid Grauman) too. He's really popular, but I'd never heard of him before. The actual Hollywood star walk itself is a mixture of fending off street hawkers, and stepping over people sleeping rough and politely refusing persistent Hollywood Homes tour salespeople. ""Do you want to a tour???"" ""Ah, no, we did one just two hours ago..."" ""Do you want to do it again?"" Stuff like that. Tiresome. If I return to Hollywood I'll visit the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, 6067 Wilshire Boulevard which opens in Dec 2020. I'm not sure what I think about the stars on the footpath attraction. Maybe they could replace it with a VR/AR app? Then you could take a walk down a more pleasant location without all the hassle that comes with it in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterm608
20,Beware of soliciting,"I was minding my business and looking for the star of certain celebrities. Then I was stopped by a person who literally handed me his CD and said he was an upcoming artist and signed the envelope to my name. I thought he was promoting his music and asking me to check it out, but it turned out that he expected to get monetary support. He said he usually gets $20 usd. I was coerced into giving $10 usd for his CD. Then his friend came at me and shoved his CD into my hand, and said I supported his first friend so I needed to support him too. He wouldn’t take back his CD and once again I was coerced into giving $10 usd. A third friend of theirs came towards me and I quickly walked away before he came close enough to shove a CD at me.

40,Every Tourist Must Visit,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a fun place to see the stars of all you favorite stars. We had fun visiting The Chinese Theatre and finding handprints of famous celebrities. We even watched the filming of a tv show from across the street. We used the metro to get back to our B&B downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddosbeck
30,A classic Hollywood Experience,"If you are in Hollywood you have to stop by the Hollywood Walk of Fame at least to say you've been there. After seeing the stars on TV it was great for a quick stop to see them in person and snap a few pictures of your favorite stars. If you are packing a lot into your day, you can do this in 30 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mccarthk2018
10,Pointless and dirty.,Absolutely pointless and dirty. Avoid. Just a row of shops and fast food littered everywhere on the stars. I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time on this. The ultimate 'Is this it?' feeling.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polarbear559
10,Really bad.. full of crooks and people ready to swindle you !,"I’ve promised in the past never come back . However bringing the kids to town had to go. Worst mistake . The place hasn’t changed.. actually has gotten worse. Full of crooks “ trying “ to sell you stuff.. Never seen so much lack of Food safety from the sellers on the walk of fame. And then the extra heavy weighted Batman, the Tiny Superman.. or the Hangover guy with filthy T-shirt.. Don’t bother..to come.. you will feel disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jordi-cr7
30,Sad And Seedy,"I expected Hollywood's greatest would have been better memorialized than this and I guess back in the day this was a classy street. But that was a long time ago...now it's a rundown, seedy strip with little to reccomend itself, it's also amazing how many of the stars have names on them that ate lost to living memory. Unless you're desperate for a selfie with a favorite of yore this is not a site worth going out of the way for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/88AVANTI
20,Not what you would expect,"Looks just like a regular street, maybe even a bit shabby. Not as pretty and nice as you see it on the television.

No I do not want to have my photograph taken with Catwoman, fat Superman or skinny Spiderman. No I don't want a CD of the next big group that hasn't made it yet.Lots of souvenir shops selling authentic Hollywood keepsakes made in China.See it, get a Starbucks coffee and catch the Metro back to downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ANON1Huddersfield

Amazing place but can be very expensive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganmY1811SZ
50,Cant miss This!!,"Staying at the Roosevelt Hotel ...the ""Stars"" were the first thing you saw leaving and last thing your saw when you got back... its so exciting walking all the way up and down looking for your favorite film stars.Mind you the best ones are those infront of the Chinese Theatre ...where it can get very crowded.... while the ""Walk "" is open 24/7 the concrete area in front of the Theatre is roped off at night...so getting there at 9 am, when it opened ,was good if one wanted a better photo opportunity of the most famous hand prints",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alex198876
30,Worth stopping by if you're in Hollywood,"We visited on an evening, shortly after sunset. I was worried that it might be too dark, but there was plenty of lighting around. There's currently some construction nearby, but we were able to walk along and see many of the stars in the sidewalk, plus spend time near the Chinese theater. The sidewalk areas in front have fun signatures and foot/hand prints from various stars. Overall this was a fun stop for about 15 minutes to see the stars. On this evening in February, it wasn't overly crowded. There were plenty of people around, but we weren't shoulder to shoulder and at times could take photos of multiple stars together without other people in the photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SnowyShasta
30,"Nice to See, Too Much Soliciting","Came here while at a conference to see the walk of fame. While it was nice to see, the amount of soliciting put a huge damper on the experience. People in costumes that look like they have never been washed (spider-man, mickey mouse, etc.) trying to get you to take a photo with them so they can then make you give them money for the photo. Others trying to force their CD into your (music comedy, etc.), to then expect you to pay them for it. Personal space in non-existent in this area and I felt the need to sanitize my hands constantly. Wish it had been a better experience, but I will definitely not be going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snow8791

10,"Very Dirty , stinks of drugs",Very disappointed in visiting the Walk of Fame. So sad that the sidewalks are a mess. Very dirty. Full of homeless people that urinate on the stars and surrounded by vendors trying to sell you their tours. The wax museums and mall only good thing about Hollywood that we could see. Would never go again but absolutely love San Diego!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianmT5998JF

10,INCREDIBLY DISSAPOINTING,"I had an image in my mind of what it would be like to go to Hollywood and unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations, incredibly underwhelming , homeless people walking around with there belongings in shopping trolleys , the smell of cannabis in the air , didn’t feel safe.. hated it so much I only managed one day in Los Angeles before I got an early flight to my next destination (Orlando). Would never bother visiting the west coast again and would advise anybody else to not do so to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaygio
50,Fun Must Do!,Hollywood Walk of Fame is a must do for your visit to the LA area. You will get to see the hand and footprints if so many stars. I’m sure you will find your favorite stars there. Such a neat thing to see. I was amazed at the tiny feet of some of the stars! Wow!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingwinetaster
40,Gotta do it,"Love the history of Hollywood , movie magic, great actors and actresses ,nostalgia. Then there are the seedy dirty parts to take into account. Husslers dressed as super heroes and ripping off tourists for cash. Hey we all have to hussle to pay the bills but some of those guy's are a bit too aggressive and intimidating , so beware. Don't take a picture thinking you can simply walk away they'll come right after you . Tourists be on your A game .A lot of tacky merchandise but the odd acceptable one too. Ya gotta do it once to say you've been there and see the Kodak theatre where they hold the Oscars these days. Just be vigilant and enjoy in the day rather than later at night .HURRAY FOR HOLLYWOOD!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaytraditionsjax
40,"worth seeing, but one and done","This is a famous site, worth seeing once. Take the metro to get here, and walk up and down the street. about 1 hour visit. More worthwhile if you get tickets to be a studio member at one of the shows (available free by reservation) and then combine going to the show, with a walk on the Hollywood walk of fame. Much less impressive than would be expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goldsmanh
50,Famous for a reason,I've been hanging out in Hollywood since the 80's. It's a city on the edge but draws thousands of tourists every year. It's not the perfect place but those sidewalk stars are just part of the draw of this crazy part of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creeping_Death_LA
30,Lots of stars,"Visited as part of a tour. There are five different categories of stars, it costs a lot of $$$ to get one, and the recipient has to be physically present at the unveiling ceremony.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheBowtieClub
30,Such a big deal about this.,"Come on, really do you want to walk the pavements with names of stars on it?Maybe if I was a crazy Hollywood buff I'd get a kick out out this.Watch it on youtube.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anita1104
30,It's just a bunch of people's names,I guess I am a cynic but it takes a lot more than someone's name on a file to be impressive. Yes peeps have to be picked but and I guess it's a nod to the old days but seriously..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolynp24
20,Massive disappointment,"Don't believe all the glitz and glamour you see in the movies. Most stars are dirty or cracked, seem to go on forever in less well lit streets. Every 2nd store seems to be a tacky souvenir shop or attraction, every 3rd person homeless asking for handouts. Definitely worth a look to see the stars...but don't expect bright lights and glamour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer39211992994
50,Honouring artists and entertainers,"It was fun picking out entertainers of all kinds, along the lengths of this unique tradition and tribute.Composers, singers, actors are honoured amongst the more than 2,500 plaques. Each year more worthy names continue to be added.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
10,I was very disappointed.,"What a dirty street. I have always wanted to take a trip here, thinking it would impress me in some way. My expectation were way to high. I would not go back and would recommend you google the glamorous photos, you will get more out of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I4478PDchriss
50,Friends,Fun and crazy but don’t take cds or take a picture with characters you have to pay for that and you get better deals on tours on the street than online,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L156OFmariar
10,Walk of stars,"We were really disappointed in our Hollywood experience. The area was filthy, homeless people had tents set up on the street just down from the stars. Parts of the foot path around the stars are cracked and breaking apart. It wasn’t a special experience. We were worried about being approached by homeless asking for money and food etc. The smell was disgusting. Would not recommend it to anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1476UUkimt
50,Good sight seeing,This was our first time walking down the area and it was amazing seeing all the stars that were there. The area has other things to see and can spend hours there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mitul29
30,Fun to spot famous names,This is a pretty cool attraction but I can’t give it too many stars because it’s really just lots of stars that look the same. But it *is* fun to walk around spot names of famous people you admire.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhodeScholar123
50,Fun!,"It was lots of fun finding the stars in the stars and the hand and foot prints.But be wary of the costumed people who get you to take a picture with you, with your camera and then demand $20 each in tips!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisafhh61
40,Someplace you should see,"Had a good time killing some time in the day. The location is very busy and it reminds me of parts of New York, there a certain areas that are run down. There is a lot of homeless people and others selling food etc on the streets. I did not part take in any but gave donations to the musicians.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/havlyn
50,A must do in LA,"If you go to LA and don’t come here you’re not really a “proper” tourist, come on ... this is a must do and so much more interesting than I ever expected. Take your time to look at the hand and foot prints in the Chinese Theater area, they’re far more interesting than the stars on the main pavements. It’s really super interesting to browse through all those stars, some known some less so. Plus there was this guy with a fake star and letters who’d prepare your own star for the picture! I know it’s crowded but it’s definitely worth going!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eurydice2017
30,A bit underwhelming - but can tick it off my list,"The area itself is more interesting than the actual stars. There are buskers dressed as stars, street performers and yes a few charlatans so have your wits about you. We enjoyed the hand and foot prints outside the TCL Chinese Theatre more than the stars. It was fun to compare your hands and feet to the Stars. Some of them are surprisingly small. It is very busy so expect it to take a while to see all of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The-vdKs
40,Be aware,"This is a simple and free way to walk around the main area of Hollywood. The stars are laid out in the shape of a plus, so you can basically do a circle and wind up back where you started. There is a lot of shops, etc to pass, and also a lot of scammers on the street looking to talk you into stuff or steal from you, so pay attention and keep your wallet safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessieB112277
40,"Always a happening , fun area",A must if you like reminiscing about old Hollywood. All your favorite Movie and TV and radio stars have their places here. Weekend nights are always wild with lots of people.A fun people watching place. Several interesting restaurants and theaters on the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valleysteve
30,As expected,Not a great deal to say really. Walking down the crowded street trying to look at the various stars loses its fascination after a 100 yards. Some are damaged and disappointing. If you have time it would be rude not to but I wouldn’t go out of my way to make a special trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonaldworth
40,Very interesting to see so many names,"It’s very interesting to see so many names in the stars, and many I knew!!The stars are spread over a number of blocks, so it’s difficult to really know where they start and finish.Although not outstanding, this is another must see to tick off your list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/570nickm
40,A must do when in CA,Not exactly what I thought it would be but still pretty cool. Smaller than you would think but it is long and a lot to see. A must do when in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GixxerWoody
30,Interesting but don’t set expectations too high,"What it says on the tin. It’s a strip with stars of various celebs. Some shocking admissions, particularly in the music scene. The Isley Brothers being a huge omission, for one. But, it’s a nice walk. A lot of what I saw echoed similar sentiment to others - dirty and under-cared for, with a homeless issues but just ignore it. There’s a beautiful shopping area by the Dolby theatre. By chance we were here when they Bad Boys for Life premiere was taking place so that was fun to witness - what one could see anyway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonJones1601
30,homeless walk of fame,"this place can be beautiful. It has beauty but it is behind all the screaming, smelling, dirty, unemployed, homelessness that ruins it all. I would like to know how they took this picture as I was not able to walk anywhere without stepping near the homeless or getting yelled at by a homeless person or all the walking crazies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerriVice
30,What a surprise,"Was surprised at how under-cared for this area is. It was great to see some of our favourite stars stars, but shocked at the quality of some of them. I appreciate that some stars have been down a long time and are walked on an awful lot. But surely if these stars deserve a star to begin with, they also deserve to have them well kept. A lot were very dirty and even cracked. Also sad to see so many homeless people in this area. Have always been told that Hollywood isn’t the best area, but was surprised to see this for myself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJDutts
50,Just plain Hollywood fun!,This is simply a must see if you are in the area. It is fun to just browse and see the names of the stars you know. It is very very busy though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/782marilyna
30,Not what you expect,"The Walk of Fame is over a number of blocks in Hollywood. The streets are quite dirty. I really enjoyed looking at the stars hand prints, quotes and dates close to The Theatre. Closer to Madam Tussauds, Chinese Theatre and Dolby Theatre, it was difficult to see or even take pictures of some stars because of the crowds of people walking around there. It was however exciting to come across the names of stars you like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trevonican
30,"Definitely Worth Seeing, But Dirty","It’s one of those right-of-passage attractions for any tourist to Los Angeles, but many of the stars are worn and dirty from too much foot traffic and lack of cleaning. Still it’s quite the experience to see all the artists (from every form of entertainment) honored with stars. It’s interesting to see the newer stars alongside some of the greats and some of the imagined (like Winnie the Pooh or the Munchkins...but too bad there is no Yoda). Definitely worth seeing; earlier in the morning before the crowds is best!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElTouristo61
40,We have lived in Los Angeles for ever. I havwe been to Hollywood since I was little!!,"When ever we go to a play or a movie, we go to either go to a movie near our house. However sometime there are dance etc like Cats and other things on the place where all the star's names are on the walk ways in Hollywood. Over the years there have many important people on the walk ways in Hollywood. You cans see them on the walk ways and see something exciting in this area. It is very busey and not very clean on the wakj ways buut is worth the drive to see all the pople on these walk ways and see all sorts of people and places to buy from or just watchng everywear,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineA705
20,Dirty,"I had always wanted to come here. I always thought this was gonna be a glamorous and big place but actually, these side walks were actually narrow, dirty, and full of people trying to sell stuff to you. While it's nice to see the stars on the ground with the names on it, there is barely space to walk in peace without being approached by various sales man over and over again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonjah834
40,Need to take your time.,I have been here in the past and it still can be time consuming so give yourself plenty of time. A lot of people are stopped around different stars. The stars also face 2 different directions. Be aware of your surroundings at all times. Several men tried to give me CDs and one was very irate when I wouldn't take it. He had a chip on his shoulder and was ready for a fight. My granddaughter's first visit and she enjoyed seeing the famous stars. This area needs more public restrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsarbee
40,Walk of cool and crazy!,"Had a fun time looking for our favorite celebrity stars, handprints and footprints. Was sad to see all of the litter all over the sidewalks. Also a lot of sleepy homeless folks sitting on the sidewalks but they didn’t seem to bother anyone. A lot of pushy people in crazy costumes looking for handouts in front of the Chinese Theatre so keep on walking past those peeps! Lots of shops and good food places to check out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmwilliams660

40,"Its busy and long, but still fun hunting for your favorite celebs!","The stars run up and down Hollywood Boulavrd for blocks and blocks so wear some good walking shoes. There are people and characters everywhere, which if you're a people watcher like me it is always enjoyable. BE WARNED: if you take photos with the people dressed up you are expected to tip, this is what they do for a living! Also stopped at a Mexican Bar called Te'Kila, which served huge margaritas and had delicious Mexican street cuisine for a reasonable price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shenaehyder
20,Such a shame that the Hollywood streets are so dirty!,"The Walk of Fame is itself amazing and iconic - however, it was really sad to see the shape that Hollywood boulevard is in. You would expect that the sidewalks of such a well-known area would be cleaned each day, to better display and take care of the stars embedded there belonging to so many famous people. However, this was not the case and just made me very sad to see the state of this area. Hopefully the city will take note one day and do a better job with the upkeep of the Walk of Fame. The amount of homeless people and beggars on Hollywood boulevard don't help. It's a shame that the stars are located in what is now such a seedy area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArzuS

50,Must do!,Loved seeing the stars! It was like a scavenger hunt with surprises around every corner! Donald Trump's star had the longest line for pictures. I witnessed several older people get down close to have their pic made with it and needed help getting up! Took several pictures and we were on a private tour so our guide Lou gave us history and information about what it takes to get a star. Very interesting!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnottingham
30,Fun to see,While it I just a load of stars in a pavement (very crowded in places) it is fun to wonder up and down and look for people you know/like.As there are over 2000 stars and they are in no particular order it can take a while.

I peeked and saw someone posing with Michael Jackson's star, or Stark-look alike Iron Man (dont forget to pay when you pose with him), or a snake hissing around a person's neck for photo-op, or every kind of product which amazes visitors.

We snagged a picture at the beginning of the walk with the official ""Hollywood Walk of Fame"" star and then headed to the pier and beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TXKellsBells
30,"Neat to see, a bit overrated","The walk of fame is miles long. If you really want to see a star, look up the location beforehand to save time! It gets very crowded and it’s hard to walk and keep looking down 😄",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelsY501CG
50,Intersting to find stars!,It is interesting to look for the stars with the favorite celebrities! Please pay attention to the cosplayers around. I don't want to be in trouble.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CLOnTravel
30,Far from Images,"It has nothing to do with the pictures from the documentary. The neighborhood is really poor with ugly stores and a lot of homeless. If this is the most representative place for Hollywood, they should do something with the surroundings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ethan_the
40,Fun to visit.,Came to see the sights and stars. It took about 4 hours til we felt like we had enough. Parking can be a hassle. I use SpotAngel app to help find street parking to avoid fees but pay attention to the signs!Recognized lots of famous names. We stopped to eat at Hollywood and Highland. Saw the Chinese Theatre. Visited some of the unique shops. Took some fun photos at Madame Tussauds wax museum.I would recommend it for a visit but probably wouldn't stay in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyWaters711
50,Stars on stars,Finding stars was easy. There was much time to find them considering that I was on a tour that day but it was quick to find them as soon as we started looking for them before and on the tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcusv2176
20,Dirty and unpleasant in some areas,I'm a seasoned travel and I meet many people. I found some of the conmen on the walk quiet aggressive.This place wasn't for me unfortunately.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shallwegothere
50,Touristic but entertaining,Very nice walk along the walk of FameMake sure to check out the Chinese theater and watch a movie in one of the most stunning theatres I. Hollywood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elmaestro94
40,Quintessential LA,"Iconic attraction in the heart of LA right opposite Grauman's Chinese Theatre. Sidewalk covered in stars inscribed with the names of celebrities from theater, film and music, both past and present. Classic Hollywood and one of the must-see sights when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pink_Passport
20,Stroll around to see the stars,"We wanted to get the real feeling of Hollywood by walking down the walk if fame. We got disappointed.. alot of homeless people, all kind of illegal stands and people selling crap..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/360sofiam
50,Loving the experience,I love it although am really surprised as to how many unfortunate and homeless around. It's certainly an eye opening place to visit and see the glamorous and fame of the entertainment industry in the US.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dewie112
30,Don't expect much..,"Is literally a stretch of street with celebrity names embedded onto the floor. If you are one that like hunting for names, you may have fun walking along the ""walk of fame"" street. There are also many on the street that dressed up as superheroes, Mickey mouse etc and they will approach you to take a picture with them. It comes with a fees though so don't accept the request if you are not willing to pay. Beware of those that give out CD especially, is not FREE! Once accepted, they will ask you to pay a ridiculous amounts!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mic_leow
50,Name says it all,"The Hollywood walk of fame goes on for a bit, so if there is a few particular stars you want to see , locate them on a map and word out the shortest distance, well worth hunting down, or just strolling along where not too busy to see who you recognise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
20,not so fame,Good to see but left right away. Homeless people everywhere. Definitely a tourist trap. More the walk of shame than fame,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yaelita6
30,Worth a visit,We have an Air B&B right on Hollywood Boulevard which for us was excellent as so much more happening here than other areas.Yes it was dirty with lots of husslers & homeless but we still enjoyed the people watching & the buzz of the place & are glad we went!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherbsfamily
40,Fun walk.,We knew it wasn't the most glamorous part of town but it was worth a walk to see the stars. Something for everyone in the family. There are quite a few people in their own little world 91 I zeta from the requests from the homeless and from the retail tourist outlets that cannibis use is high. It's pretty dark but personally I wouldn't feel safe. Best to head in after dark. Tourist shops are good and reasonably priced though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandastewartnz
20,Random names on sidewalks,No more than that apart from a lot of crowd who constantly stop to take picture and looking for a who’s who.Not interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lambertocoppa
30,Average experience,"Cool to see it in person but don’t expect too much! Very long walk if you want to see it all, gets dodgier the further down the boulevard you go. Lots of homeless people and people asking for photos etc to scam you. Sometimes hard to stop and take photos of a star because of how busy it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellenmcg7
50,Tourism,"Full of homeless and expensive shop but funny and worth visiting, i took the scooter and had much lovely times",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2395XQmohamede
30,Fun to see once,"I mean, it’s stars on a sidewalk. It’s a long walk to see it all, and sometimes it’s hot & dirty and not through the best parts of town. If you can ignore 400 people asking you to take tours, it’s endurable. My son wanted to see it and I had a few stars I was excited about, so we walked a good chunk of it. It’s a good time-waster or thing to look at whilst walking between other locations, but not something you need to do multiple times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelliplansitall
30,"Worth a visit, but scuzzy area",Surprised at how messy this area is. Lots of litter and homelessness which is so sad for such a wealthy city. The stars are easy to walk around yourself and view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KittyinLondon
30,Don't expect too much,"Just a small street with a stars on a sidewalk, it's nice to see it with your own eyes, but don't expect too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nasuella
40,Bring a snack and a drink bottle,Cool to see but the walking is tiring after a while and the little kids get bored. You can get a map with where stars are it would of been helpful if I knew that before walking for 2 hours .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rainbowsandkids
40,Well it’s kind of a must see,Such an iconic place you have to see it. I know less than half the people but it’s interesting to see a few aussies and imagine their life,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/591larih
20,Too many people,"Too many idiot tourist getting in your way, extremely ignorant, spoil the whole experience.Got a pic of David Bowie's star which meant the world to me, all the rest is tourist tat. everything in this area is fake and overpriced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelly19182016
50,An amazing Hollywood experience,"I'm not sure what others expect from a visit to Hollywood, but all the action and excitement and life is exactly what I hoped for. I loved strolling along the Walk of Fame and finding so many of my favorite celebrities. If you appreciate feeling the pulse of a city and circulating with vibrant, creative people, hit the Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/midnightsalad
50,Look for your favorite,"If you have a favorite celebrity, you absolutely have to go look for their star - and then go look around. You can Google search the address of their star very easily. Once you've taken enough pictures of it, just walk around. The crowds, street performers and other attractions nearby are enough to fill hours with fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyC4242
50,"Cool place to visit, put don’t expect to find parking",Lovely place to visit. The atmosphere is energetic and vibrant. Performers and characters keep young kids entertained while you look at the various stars of actors from all generations. Parking is a huge challenge and you are better off getting there by public transportation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/870sandeshr
40,A nice walk,It was a nice walk but I can't say more about this. Very crowded and I couldn't see a map or a guide or how to find some celebrities. There are a lot of shops if you're interested in souvenirs. Be aware on the people who are trying to sell you things on the street. Private parking is very expensive so I chose Public parking on El Cerrito Place street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/628alinm
30,Okay,The area was dirty and we went at night. It wasn't what I expected and wasn't that nice but is worth doing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/429eviec
10,Stars,A lot of homeless people on the street walking or sitting around. A guy also started peeing in the middle of the sidewalk. We didn’t even get out of the car to walk around. Not what I thought it was going to be.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tour592164
30,Beware of your surroundings.,"The walk of fame is an iconic tribute to our celebrities and movie culture we all enjoy. It brought back some good memories of Bob Hope and John Wayne true Hollywood originals. Enjoyed Arnold Schwarzenegger star. There was a gift shop with a life size Terminator, total photo opportunity. Yes its a tourist trap but that’s why you’re there. I would say there are lots of shady people there looking to take advantage of tourists so pay attention to your surroundings. Would recommend going with friends, always helpful to have safety in numbers and avoid the area late at night. Other than that it’s worth visiting and taking it all in. Some great little restaurant on the strip if you get hungry too.Some nice attractions nearby like the Museum of Selfie, Hollywood Wax museums are fun interesting places along there as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCoxygenman
40,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"It is a fun and vibrant place especially when you are hunting for stars of your favorite actors/actresses, artists, comedians, directors, etc. because the stars are scattered all over the Hollywood Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monalisak229
20,Sketchy neighbourhood,Good to see but left right away. Tried to go to a restaurant for lunch but the waitress ignored us so we got up and left. Homeless people everywhere. Definitely a tourist trap.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Worldtraveler2911
30,Iconic must-see attraction,"This is a difficult tourist site to rate. I’d give it a 5 simply for the history, novelty, and celebrity of the attraction. However, that rating falls to a 3 due to the tourist trap surroundings. It’s like the Times Square of LA with cheap novelty shops and chain restaurants. You can only look at so many stars until interest fades. We made a game out of it. For each of the 8 people in our group, we located a star with the same name (last or first) and took a picture covering the part of the name that didn’t match. Fun memory and good pictures for the vacation photo book.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdrienneKEP
50,Worth Visiting,"I think it is worth of visiting, lots to do around! We came with small kids and it was fine. Found President Tramp across El Capitan Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katriel_D2014
30,Hyped,Nothing great here. Too much touristy and not sure what to expect from this experience. I think it is just a check mark for most of the people visiting LA. Skip it if you want.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AkshayaS1978
40,Go Out for a Nice Walk!,"You always need more exercise, so why not take a fun walk on Hollywood Boulevard? Time flies when walking the 15 blocks and searching to find your favorite stars, from both then & now. There's also 3 blocks on Vine St. with additional stars. Just make sure not to make sudden stops when you find your favorite star to photograph. I got a little too excited and bumped into someone.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chongo49
40,Very cool to look at,"Came on Hollywood Blvd last week for a walk around. Very cool to see all the stars with the names on it. The only thing is that there are plenty of dirty people walking around harassing people for money and food. Some are sleeping on the ground which in some part I wouldn't trust. Other than that, I highly recommend a walk around and visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFLeB325
40,It's interesting for tourist but that's it,"I think everyone must go there but I want to say it's not like amazing place because it's just floor with stars and nothing special . There are lots of shops , you can find there everything and really cheap , but have one problem you must be careful because they're a little bit dangerous . Anyway I have fun there I'm so happy to being there😉",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/689nazq
30,Watch out for the photo fiends,"It's a load of stars in a pavement. Meh.Watch out for fancy dressed ""superstars"" though. They want you to have a photo taken with them, then demand money - nettlesome quite aggressively.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X1468IHrichardw
30,Walk with the stars!,"Good:This is the LA we all see and hear about from the media. Although we don't know the location of each celebrity's star, you get a sense of achievement when you look down and spot you favorite celebrity's star.Bad:Crowded.Can get frustrating during evenings and weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Go64922729842
20,Not all that,Nasty people around this area trying to take advantage of tourists. A man made us give him money for a space that was free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benbowne
10,Heroine! NOT THE HERO TYPE,Dirty. Disgusting. Got to see someone do heroine on the street while I enjoyed the sunset. I can honestly say it’s a shame that a place like Hollywood is such a dump despite the potential given such great weather and location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johngQ9797VL
50,Hollywood,The hollywood walk of fame is a must to walk thru while in Hollywood many stars star to take a picture of. Lots of character on the hollywood boulevard too. Its so exciting to see your favorite stars on the walk of fame,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pau_pau_salazar
30,Nice for a quick Visit,"It is definitely worth a visit if you are in the area, just don't spend to long here! It is nice to walk down & find your favourite stars on the ground, but the area is really dirty & run down. Lots of homeless people",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thomase77
50,Fun stroll down Hollywood Blvd,"This is a free event anyone and everyone can enjoy. The Walk of Fame stretchesseveral blocks on both sides of the blvd.It’s fun to walk by and see all the stars on the ground. You can take as many pictures as you’d like , stop and admire what’s in front or behind . It’s a great people watching area as well if you want to stop and grab a drink or food and enjoy the hustle and bustle of the area.If you are from out of town this is a must see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bumble-Brig
50,Great place to vsiit,"It’s definitely worth a visit if you’re in the area! It was a fun time to search for the stars of my favorite celebrities! Be careful because the walk goes on forever, and if you’re looking down it’s easy to forget where you parked!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKordziel
50,Nice for a quick visit,To be honest I expected was much better but I understand is just a place where to spend not too much time but for sure to be visited,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/68TRAVELLER79
30,Not the hype I was hoping for.,"While it was nice to see the stars and names of hundreds of people who have made a positive impact in both TV and music, the sidewalks themselves were aged, cracked, and left nothing to the imagination. There were a lot of closed businesses along the walk, homeless people everywhere, and a good number of the stars were beat up and left to weather. Nice to see but have to leave it at that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11mmc11
50,Nice walking tour,Paid for the 1/5 hour guided walking tour and really enjoyed. Our guide was very imformative and took us to many of the important stars and expanded on local lore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LF918
40,Not as expected,"If you're expecting glitz and glamour in hollywood then you'll be disappointed. It is quite shabby with a lot of homeless people about.The dance crews put on a good show. Lots of souvenir shops that aren't expensive.Worth a visit just to say you've been, it's not bad, just not what I expected!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loveholsinthesun
50,premiere to Star Wars Mandalorian,By walking on Hollywood blvd in LAI cross by Dolby theater and guess what ..It’s the premiere to Star Wars MandalorianHere are some shoots,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielBazel
20,"Dirty, seedy and rather desperate",The only reason to visit is for the sake of saying you went to Hollywood. There's really nothing there that's worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewcJ186WE
40,Beautiful,Beautiful but unfortunately they were getting ready for some type of events and most of the areas were blocked off.. got to see a few really good ones but not all I wanted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/289farahz
30,Walk with the Stars,Had to go see the Walk of Stars in LA. Some of the greatest names in entertainment and a sore neck by the end of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gordonf927
40,"Stars, stars and more stars.","This is place felt more Hollywood than any other place. So many stars of many stars on both sides of the road. Gets very busy in the evening, with celebrity impersonators, art scenes, singers and large crowds of tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/staajabuatravel
20,Boring walk,"The walk of fame it’s very popular but to be honest there is not much to see there, you will find the name of a lot of famous people around the world but that’s all she wrote!!!You can walk the Hollywood walk of fame in 20-30 minutes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sachi1612
20,Underwhelming,"That section of Hollywood Blvd is exceedingly seedy. Lots of bums. Lots of people trying to hoodwink tourists into parting with their money. Lota of kitschy buildings, e.g. Chinese Theatre, El Capitan, ""souvenir"" stores, etc.The stars themselves are quite underwhelming. No engraved signatures, hand or footprints. Just people's names on the ground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldExplorer150
20,Very underwhelming,"After seeing this walk countless times on TV and elsewhere we were excited to visit and take a stroll with the stars. The reality was dirty and litter strewn streets, uncared for stars, and street entertainers harassing and posing themselves on you. What promised to be a great night was cut down to less than an hour and a gay retreat. Such a shame as it could be so much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pegasus928
30,Overrun By Vendors,"Fun to walk up and down to see the various names, but didn’t recall the crazy amount of vendors selling food and trinkets. Annoying as you try to navigate the other tourists and vendors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minnytravelers
50,"Go, walk, enoy","Go early if you can, great to do just after a tourist breakfast at Mels. Kids loved the handprint tiles at the Chinese Theatre more than the classic stars of the walk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kirstiewan
50,So many great musicians & actors,Walking up and down the streets is incredible to see the many greats of all time. From Michael Jackson to Jamie Foxx to Scarlett Johansson to many many others and then The Lennon Sisters which I changed to The Lennox Sisters as that goes for my sister & I.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/klennox1982
30,Must see when in Hollywood,We had a business trip to Hollywood in October. Our hotel was just off the Main Street so I visited the walk everyday.One caution is to be careful when walking to see the stars. You can walk into some not so nice areas if your not careful.Also there are so many stars that I can be frustrating if your looking for a particular star.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjswansona
40,Iconic place to visit,"Always a lot of people and many characters that want to take a picture with you. (and then ask for money after ofc) But it's an absolute place to visit in Hollywood, you should at least experience it once. Shops on both sides are expensive, as shops usually are close to popular places. A lot of fun things to look at though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/960carmend
50,History,"Be choosy about when you go. Early morning would be best if you prefer quiet and focus. Nights, especially weekends, or a bit of a circus. Especially if you have children, and especially if they are very young children, I wouldn’t go at night especially on weekend nights. People urinate in the corners, not common but did witness it (not a homeless person, a young man of about 30 out with his friends.) The stars extend for several blocks on both sides of the street. Either use your phone to find a particular store you were interested in or search them before your trip and know the location to find them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisavG7902AD
40,Hollywood ...,"The walk of fame is a must see...just to check out all who have been recognize there. Not the best area of town, but ok.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coleenb312
30,A must see place if you are into movie stars,"This is a sidewalk with some stars on the floor, nothing super interesting or exciting but it is a great place to take a few pictures if you are into actors and stars. Better to visit it during the week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F-F-7676
40,Crowded and run down,Really enjoyed walking the street and finding the stars of people we knew but it was so crowded it was hard to do. Also many of the stars are in disrepair which is a shame. There is a list of the stars and their addresses on wikipedia if you are looking doe a specific one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cruisnfamily
40,No photos with the characters dressed.,The walk of Fame is something to do once in a lifetime. Not that fancy or secure place. We enjoy it because we weren't carrying anything heavy or expensive.Do not take any pictures with the characters that are dressed because they want you to give them money (or rob something from you). Same with the people that are selling CDs or DVDs. As a safe tip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paolaj517
30,Quieter in winter,Parked in the self park for the mall behind the Chinese theatre. Noticed it was any where near as busy than when we had visited last time in the summer with less people hassling you. Good to spot all the famous stars on the pavement. Spent about an hour before moving forward on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/149stuartc
50,Walk of fame,To be honest it's a must see if you're in Los Angeles. Could do with a clean up in my opinion but maybe they put more effort in around the summer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/700craigc
20,Weird party with strange people,"Except for the fact that you see the stars names at the ground (except Mohammad Ali, that's on the wall) and that's kind of cool, the place is full of homeless people, annoying street vendors and ill advised commerce. Really disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fernandowr10
20,Felt Dodgy even during the day,My husband and I made the mistake of staying in the are. Even during the day it felt so sketchy - I’m a naturally pretty anxious person and I did not enjoy it or feel safe at all. The only place I felt safe was inside the big stores or on board the tour buses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilyjA2568CQ
50,Great experience,I think the walk of fame is super cool. Very crowded but is free and you can do it at your in pace.Cons: a lot of people and people trying to sell you CDs it gets super annoying. I almost wanna punch them lol. Just ignore them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adriel727
40,A Fun Walk,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a must and a typical activity for any visit to LA / Hollywood. It is a fun free thing to do anytime. You can purchase a map to find your favourite star(s); or use an app, but it is fun to simply walk down the street & discover the stars. You will see costumed characters willing to be photographed. It is usually very busy with tourists & tour buses so it may be challenging to get that perfect shot with your star. Likewise parking can be difficult but there are several public paid parkades, paid lots. On street parking on Hollywood Blvd itself is usually already full but a few streets / blocks over we found on street metered parking. Of course you could consider public transport or Lyft / Uber. As this area can be very busy it is always a good idea to keep a close eye on your valuables. Also check out other attractions while you are here such as The infamous Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre, and Madame Tussaud’s. Have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JULOfrVan

30,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"I don’t know what I was expecting with the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but it’s just a sidewalk with the stars... I guess I wasn’t thinking that it was actually the sidewalk and people are walking on the stars daily.. It was cool to see. I would suggest lowering your expectations so your not disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarah471

40,Walking Hollywood Blvd,"The walk of fame through Hollywood Blvd has a nice stops along the way, places to have lunch or just a cup of coffee. It really is a pleasant walk to take family that comes from out of state to visit. Inexpensive and enjoyable time in a Los Angeles weather. I hardly go to the area but it’s definitely a great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zabb2014
40,Must See,"I don't know why some people criticize the walk of fame. It's exactly what I expected, nothing more, nothing less. It's a road where the sidewalks are covered with stars highlighting actors and entertainers who left their mark in their life and career. I did not have any trouble reading the different names as most people were doing the same. That's one more thing I did on my bountiful bucket list. No regrets here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorthStar03040354425
20,Uhh,"Not impressed cannot say much about this, the stars are on the side walk (as they say here ) but the when you have so many people walking on them you feel you are in everyone’s way so don’t get time to try and find the ones you want to see. Also the hand prints outside the Chinese restaurant donot have the wow factor I was expecting, again people walking all over them while trying to look. Maybe I was expecting to much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madxhatter
50,Stars of Excellence,Hollywood Walk of fame is a street where on the Footpath Golden stars are embedded symbolizing the Artists of eminence.. This is a great honor for known and unknown great artists of all time..

Making it hard to get good pictures of some of my favorite stars.Lots of good places to buy souvenirs for friends and family back home.You can’t go to Hollywood without stopping by and seeing this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556michaelc
50,Cool experience,This was a stop on our tour throughout LA area. We had a limited time to experience it and the Chinese theater as well. Catching it is definitely worth experiencing this Hollywood walk of fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoPlaces64843
50,There is a lot of these stars...be prepared,Go in the morning on Sunday when there is not many people around. Otherwise you will be always on the way of pedestrians. If you want to see particular start you better prepare at home. Find exact address of that person since it is hard to find them when you already on the sidewalk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6378WFannag
30,Interesting visit,This is a famous sight in the world and worth a visit but do not expect anything too wonderful. Hollywood Boulevard has no real beauty it is a run down road with a lot of people trying to sell their CD's and beg for money. The stars themselves are good to see but over the top with ones of Kermit the frog and cartoon characters etc,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Felixfred
50,Stars,Stars in the stars under ur foot. Searching for ur favourite stars name is really thrilling. They are not in order.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drmayin
40,Worth a walk!,"Fairly interesting to see the names of people you have heard of, some random ones, but mostly names that people know.Not sure if its an ""attraction"" to be honest, the area seems to have become a hangout for the homeless, as quite often we would see someone simply lying on the pavement in obvious unfortunate circumstances.If you're visiting the Chinese Theatre, or taking a celebrity homes bus ride, then walk up and down each side of the road, but not really worth a special visit just to see the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanmB1799AD
20,Disappointed,"Everyone goes there, but to be honest it’s a very down market and tacky area. Personally wish I hadn’t wasted time and an Uber fare getting there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hemel1
10,Gross,Hollywood is not at all what it used to be. It is dirty and crowded. The first thing I noticed was the smell of urine🤮. We walked for a few moments before the kids asked why we were even there. Turned around and left. Nothing to see. Just feels unsafe and dirty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7772NFmelissar
40,Great!,"This is a wonderful way to spend a few hours in Hollywood You get the chance to see so many of your favourite celebrity stars whilst at the same time you will walk pass many attractions that you may be interested in. However, there is one downfall, it smells. It is not so bad on the main part of the walk of fame (where the attractions are) the further you walk though it really does smell.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smccartney17
20,Dirty,So dirty. The homeless people laying in the streets is heartbreaking. I found it difficult to appreciate the area with all the garbage thrown about. I would not recommend visiting The Walk of fame. It’s actually sad how much of a dump it has become.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mastrup16

40,Touristy but fun,"Fun to wander around and look at the celebrity names. Sometimes it's surprising what you find. I think there's an app that tells you where each star is, so you can find a specific one, if you're interested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karimmaarouf
20,Good to see once but only once,"The best part about this stop was we could look up exactly the star we wanted to see and go directly to it. Most of the reviews on this were correct. Dirty, shady characters, there was a dead homeless person being picked up by the coroner when we passed by a side street, pot smokers on a bench, and homeless peddling for money. It was a shame it has come to this at a spot so many wish to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Speer30
40,Hollywood Walk of Fame,Loved walking on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I was able to find all the stars I was looking for but one. Cool atmosphere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tduncan44
30,A Bit Disappointed,"Our son described the Hollywood and Vine area as being ""another Times Square."" And, indeed it was.The Walk of Fame was fun but it's a bit of a seedy area with lots of very interesting people.The Chinese Theater sidewalk with hand prints and footprints was likewise interesting but underwhelming.It was worth going and one of those places you have to see when in the Hollywood area, but one visit is enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sherlock60
30,Be careful with all the scammers,"This is a place that you definitely have to visit. However, it is so touristic that is the biggest LA scam.The main spot for trying to “give” you stuff and then asking for a tip.People on costumes trying to get a picture so they can ask you for “tips” (or stealing your wallet in the meantime)Enjoy looking for the star of your favourite celebrity but be careful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebecalabanda
50,Long winding walk,"We walked for 2 hours in search for my namesake, Lee Majors. I did not realize until then that this could be very tiring.. but to finally reach our intended destination was really worth it. The walk of fame is as interesting as it gets.. a good exercise while going thru all the stars and reminscing the good old-yesteryears.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/profleemajors
30,Not great not bad,"This was at the top of my boyfriend and I’s to do list and I am so glad we did however it’s very crowded, lots of people dressed up charging money for photos and lots of people trying to sell their CD’s and DVD’s and are very pushy. Its very poorly maintained but it is nice to have a walk and search for the stars you’d like to see. I think it’s worth a visit if you’re in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrhall
30,It’s a cool thing to do when you’re in town.,It’s a good way to spend an afternoon. Walk around and see all the stars. Obviously there is the people dressed up charging money of pictures. Some are dressed better than others!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bennyvsworld
40,LA Fun!,"We were in Los Angeles for a few days for a family wedding, so we did a little sightseeing. The Hollywood Walk of Fame was fun! We did have to work with the crowd to get some pictures of the stars we were interested in seeing. It was a very busy day! Overall though a fun experience that everyone should have while in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D-Arkansas
20,Needs to be maintained better,I was underwhelmed with the Walk of Fame. But it was fun seeing stars for my favorites. Of all the things we did in LA this was one I could have skipped.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelin_friend
20,Fun to find a name but that is it,It is a famous walk The fun part is you can find some name you know and take a picture with the star.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RochelleH355
50,A walk down memory lane,"Walking along the Hollywood Walk of Fame gives you a vibe of time travel as you pass by names of people who have come and gone through Hollywood. Some of the names you won't even recognize as they are long gone. Even so, the magic of walking this path lies in the sense of possibility that dreams can come true. Everyday joes and janes like us have once wondered and dreamed of becoming a star. One day, they finally got theirs, immortalized in stone.It's a loooonnnngggg walk and you won't even get to see all the stars you want to see if you don't have a map. You can plan your walk ahead of time or wing it like we did. Either way, the long walk is worth the effort if you're into all that Hollywood magic. It also helps that there are people that line up the streets dressed in some of the most famous characters popularized by Hollywood. If any of them approaches you for a picture, know that it will cost you a couple bucks.It goes without saying but I will say it anyway, wear comfortable shoes - ones that won't cause blisters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulesLarrobis
40,Can be better maintained,"The walk of fame I saw last week was dirty and worn down. Evidently, it’s in urgent need of maintenance. Nonetheless, concept is novel enough and we had decent fun there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qyqi
30,Still worth a visit but a bit overrated,"With a couple thousand stars now, they have largely inflated. Still worth a short visit to get the idea. Tons of tourists of course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hamburger64
20,Hollywood walk of fame,"Very disappointed with the Hollywood walk of fame.I would rather spend the day down Oxford Street,London.I had heard and read reviews regarding the area but was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.We arrived by Uber from our hotel just near the walk of fame.We were warned not to stop and not to take anything from any of the people offering things on the street.First impressions of the area were, dirty, untidy and uninviting.A number of the stars were cracked and you were half afraid of stopping to look at them all in case you were approached buy a ticket seller.Lots of cheap tat shops along the strip also selling the usual cheap tat souvenirs.We managed to find a shopping centre which had a really good view of the Hollywood sign so that was a plus.Not a place to visit twice in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X7112JWlouiseg
40,Celebrities,"There were so many signs of celebrities, worth visiting walk of fames. Very easy to locate. There are many places to eat and shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/79shveta
40,Good fun,"It was an awesome experience to finally get to walk down the Hollywood Walk of Fame and see all of the famous stars in the floor, a lot of which I'd never heard of but I got to see my idols when I eventually found them!I'd already been warned by friends and family that had been before me about the rather run down and dirty state Hollywood has become and the serious problem with homeless and mentally ill people so my expectations we're lower than maybe other tourists. Because of this we had a great time and the only homeless we encountered didn't bother us, they actually acknowledged us with a ""good afternoon"".People need to research an area properly and lower their expectation levels. It's LA, its a huge city, which suffers from huge city problems. It's no different to Manchester so it didn't bother us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CockerCookie
20,Disappointing,Hollywood Blvd is not how TV and movies make it seem. It's very dirty and filled with questionable people. It's so crowded at night and lots of mentally ill people. I didn't see any type of security or police presence. It reminded me of the Last Vegas strip but without the police/security. I didn't feel safe there after dark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carrieg1982

50,Just looking for one...,"...and I found it!!! Was in town to see Rocketman Live with Elton John and a Taron Egerton at the Greek Theater and wanted to find Sir Elton’s Star! Taron egerton will have his own in very short order, I’ll be back when that happens, if not before!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710gaila
40,Fun walk around Hollywood,"Take an hour or 3 and wander around Hollywood Boulevard and Vine (plus some side streets) and see if you can see your favourite Movie star, recording artist, or TV personality although I doubt the Rugrats would rate highly on anyone’s discovery list, but then again I don’t have kids. But then again they wouldn’t know Gene Kelly or Doris Day. Get the brochure to map out your favourites and save some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leahy-white
30,A must do but....,Ok so whilst visiting LA this obviously is on most people's to do list. It's ok...I was expecting more. It's a very busy and quite seedy street in places. A lot of names I hadn't even heard of (wonder if some are made up!). Go if you have time but keep expectations low. Highlight was getting an amazing vegan chocolate milkshake along the way! That made the visit worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZoeB762
20,Dirty,This place is really dirty full of takeaways and cheap shops. Hollywood certainly makes it look glossy on the TV!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewc429

50,A lot to see,Second time here and always something different to see. Especially the addition of new stars. Parking was not that difficult to find.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abuc2020
10,Tourist trap,"Just a strip of tacky souvenir stores, homeless people, lousy costumed characters accosting you to take photos with them for tips, and a sidewalk of famous people's names that they had to pay for it themselves to get there. It's as artificial of a tourist trap as celebrities are to real famous people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jon523
40,Walk of fame,I wasn’t sure what to expect but I wasn’t disappointed. Streets are maintained and tidy.Take your time to walk up and down the street exploring all the stars!Wonderful trip down memory lane,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamtamyyc
30,Good visit but busy,"Good for recognising some stars you may have forgotten about and getting that picture with your hero but pretty busy as expected so need to keep your wits about you or you’ll be apologising for walking into other people doing the same thing, also lots of street sellers trying to cash in too. Not sure how often they clean the sidewalks but they didn’t look too clean on our visit and some of the stars had seen better days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baz601
20,Not worth the hassle,"Honestly, you get hounded by people giving you cd’s, selling you trips or trying to take a photo with you I’m not sure if it’s worth even going there. I can see thirty/forty years ago it would have been at its peak but it’s clear that there has been no investment in it since then so it is a magnet for scam artist and sales reps.Yes there are a lot of homeless people there but unless you’re in the hills homeless people are all over the city. It’s unfortunately a massive problem in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/egwenlli28
20,Very busy,"Came here as it's such a landmark. Wasn't expecting the stars to look quite so grubby but I guess that's to be expected when there are so many people walking over them all the time. It was ridiculously busy, even in October, so only had a quick chance to see the stars. If there's any you particularly want to see it's work checking their location online first so you can aim for them specifically.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CB1CountyDurham
20,Get the scam artists away,"The whole ""give you a CD"" then charge money scam and the scam by people dressed up isn't nice and should be cleaned up. Tourist magnet. Nothing to see here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94christerb
50,A Must See!!,"There are too many stars to see in a day but our tour took us to the part along the Hard Rock Cafe area; many of the celebrities and stars, past and present, had dedicated stars on the walk of fame; highly recommend seeing it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrrrr5
30,I have to agree with the negative reviews,"I'm not usually a negative person , but the walk of fame wasn't special to me. Most of the stars were filthy and cracked. I would have thought that area would have been better kept. I did see a lot of homeless people and that wasn't the bad of this trip. Unfortunately there are a lot of people that are down on the luck we're can't push them aside we're supposed to help. I just hoped that Hollywood would get someone to clean the stars. Hey that's a job opportunity for some of the homeless, ijs",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikkiah
30,"Well, well, well","Been there, seen this and didn’t buy the t-shirt! Have you seen this on tv, you have seen it! Lots of people walking here with their face towards the stars in the pavement. Meaning lots of bumping into each other. Several photo wanting people dressed up as comic figures wanting your money for a photo with you. Take care here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saberejser
50,Hollywood walk of fame,What a great idea to exhibit gratitude towards our beloved artist on the foot paths. But my observation is that is it right thing to step on our beloved artist names. I don't know about whose idea was it but I would never like to step on them because they're always in my heart.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chetanjm
10,"Horrible, Don't Understand The Ratings","I visited the walk of fame a couple days ago in October 2019. It was Terrible!. Everywhere I looked there were the homeless , the mentally ill, drug addicts and beggars. There was even a guy high on drugs rolling around on the floor .I tried eating at a restaurant but there was a smoker standing right in front of the entrance blowing clouds of smoke into the restaurant. It was unfortunate that I couldn't enjoy the beautiful california breeze without inhaling large clouds of smoke.There were several street performers , and vendors blocking your ability to walk freely on the walk of fame which defeats the entire purpose and experience.I'm never visiting the walk of fame again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovelyTraveler121

40,"Very busy, lots of traffic, but if you love the stars it’s a must","If movie stars are a major interest of yours, than definitely go there. Expect huge crowds though ( mainly tourists) and lots of traffic. The best parking is at the Hollywood mall where the Oscars are taking place. The best spot to go to is right in-front the Chinese Theater where the biggest stars have “ recorded” their steps and hands. Take the tour inside the movie theater. It is a very old theater with lots of history ( LA history mind you, it is not Europe here), and it is very pretty. If you come with kids, don’t miss the Disney movie theater across the street. A very special treat for the little ones with a short live show ahead of the movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tirzahaviv
50,Must see if visiting LA,"If youre planning to come to LA this is a place you must visit. Go early as there are often free show tickets being passed out, performers all over the place and lots do do and see. There is an awesome inexpensive souvenier shop nearby and lots of places to eat. You can also take lots of tours from this location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/780mildredb
20,All hype...,"I was HYPED- the walk of fame- it’s world famous, it’s going to be epic- it’s bitterly disappointing. Stars on the floor- a fat bloke dressed as Darth Vader and plenty of pests trying to sell their “cool” music...the district is cool, shops and food- swell. Just sadly over rated.Shout out to Mickey Mouse, and Kermit the frog making the grade... guess they have more personality than some who have stars...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GowerDG
10,"A must see, but not representative of LA","The Walk of Fame is one of those things you need to check off the list when visiting LA, but it is definitely not representative of LA. Swing by quickly but don’t linger. It’s a tourist trap to the extreme. Probably best to see it as part of one of the bus tours of LA; that way you can easily get in and out, and then head off to better spots in the city and region.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carsonjfbruno
50,Soak up the glamour of hollywood,"Home of the pavement of stars. Over 2500 of them. I didnt realise until I visited that stars are awarded in several categories, acting, signing, screenwriting, directing etc so some people have several. Spotted loads of my favourite actors and it stretches for quite a few blocks. Stop off to take in the Chinese Theatre on your way, here you'll find some old hand prints too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaniceD884

Spend part of the day tracking down your fav starts and getting your photo with them, because that’s what you do....but it is a bit underwhelming, not what I pictured at all. Some areas are dirty, homeless people and people busking/selling things along the way but it’s part of the experience. I have done it 3 times and would do it again but I do wish someone told me what it’s really like because I was picturing silver screen Hollywood style.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mo71ey
20,"Creepy, dirty and underwhelming","Lots of homeless people and quite a strong smell of urine everywhere. I think if you go don’t bother walking the full length as that’s a waste of time. Just head straight to main 20meters and get your pictures. Ultimately you’re looking as someone’s name on the ground, it’s really not that good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agibbons101
40,So much fun checking out the Hollywood Walk of Fame with my children!,We had just arrived in Hollywood.... checked in to our hotel and we decided to do a walk-about of our surroundings. I hadn't really realized that we were in the midst of the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame. We checked out each star... amazed at Clint Eastwood and checked out his hand prints along with so many other stars... It was a History lesson as many of the stars my teens didn't really know who they were. It was so fun... and ending up at Ghirardelli chocolate for Hot Cocoa and a Hot Brownie with Ice Cream.... it was such a fun evening! We stayed at the Loews and it was great fyi.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/726judyg
30,If only they maintained the stars,We stayed at the Hotel Roosevelt so it was pretty easy to just take a stroll through the Hollywood Walk of Fame. We were just looking at familiar names that we have seen on tv or movies and that was interesting. Otherwise I really wished they maintained the walk and the stars as some of them looked dirty and broken. Imagine if you came for a tour and saw broken stars it just ruined the experience. Otherwise it is still good to visit as we managed to see ‘Angelina Jolie’ doing her promotion for the movie premiere of the movie ‘Maleficient’. If you are lucky you might see a set up of any movie premiere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nonanureen

30,Hollywood walk of fame,When you visited LA no matter what you want to see walk of fame and Hollywood sign. Otherwise the trip is not completed. Started at beginning of walk of fame and looked down see what i could find...no one seem families to me until i saw OLIVIA Newton John and i stopped . She is my favourite actress & singer and charity warrior. I suggest instead of having their name on the walking path why not have it on wall with their photo . This will be more appropriately showing respect to these celebrity that contribute to community / society.

40,Walk of Stars,This is far larger than we expected. It goes on literally for blocks on both sides of Hollywood Blvd AND on Vine Street. We enjoyed seeing so many familiar names and it brought back memories and created conversations as we walked. It is in the heart of Hollywood between the Chinese and Palladium Theaters which is where you want to be anyway so it is an added feature of the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brad1660

It is nice to see your favourite actors and musicians etc on the stars in the sidewalk.However, what I didn't like were the many people that approach you trying to shove cds and other things in your hand and wanting cash for it. Also people in costumes stand next to you and pose and demand 10 dollars for it.Watch out for shady characters in this area particularly after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matrickana

30,Bad atmosphere,"The actual physical walk of fame is fantastic and what a sight to see we walked along it for what felt like miles. The problem with this place is the people grabbing at you for photographs and then expecting to be paid. We never stopped once and my husband had to tell one man to let go of his arm! Not nice at all, very pushy and made me feel unsafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mehan44Lang
40,It's always a pleasure walking around the starts,"Every time more crowded and the floor dirtier, but it's a real pleasure to walk around our actors and artists names on the floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pedropD6354NC
20,Disappointing,"I don't know when the picture was taken as it seems to be clean and empty - that was not my experience! It was a dusty road full of hustlers every step of the way - a particularly bad busker who sounded like a strangled cat and who didn't know the words of the song she was struggling to sing and struggling badly at).My first thought when I got there was ""is this it?""I had hoped the magic of the stars and Hollywood itself would have taken over - alas no.If you like struggling to walk through any many many Chinese tour groups then this is for you - it certainly wasn't for me.Hollywood is an illusion - alas!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/441brigitteh
10,Just disappointed,Very small and didn’t meet the expectations at all. Also not a place to have a nice dinner out. Not recommendable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annitados
10,Thoroughly undeewhelming,"6pm on a Monday, not too busy--but what an odd place.Walk along a dirty, boring street to look at people's names on the floor. Zero atmosphere, very small and not impressive. Not what it's like in the media.To top it off, lots of homeless people and a woman pleasuring herself in her sleeping bag. Excellent job LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hharris87
10,Filled with Phonies,"When you have pay to have your own star on the W of F, it's fake, phony, and disgraceful. The area should be sanitized: remove the stars, get rid of the homeless, and start from scratch. For the people who respond...well, that's Hollywood--you're part of the growing problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/triathlete1955
40,Fun Time on the Blvd.,It was fun walking the Hollywood walk of fame. The weather was perfect. I will have to go back to see more of the stars names one day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fpoblue2
40,Day Trip if you want to see,"Really busy, and at night it’s difficult to see the stars on the walkway. Lots of gift shops, lots of people lots of places to eat. There are a few people that may give you a scare if you’re alone. Best be in a group after dark. Fun place with lots to see. Bathrooms are scarce so beware.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iluvbassfishing
50,Go early!,"We went in the morning, about 8am when it wasn't busy at all, so we could take great photos. Be aware of the people in costumes as they will ask for money straight away after taking a picture with you. Spider man was ruining our photos and then asked for $10, he was surprised later when we did the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gyorgyviktoria88
40,Iconic walk must do when in LA,Wife and I walked this historic walk it was amazing to see all the stars from years gone by!The history of Hollywood is right here for you to see...Dont miss this!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickcardo
20,Underwhelming,"When we visited they were setting up for the premiere of the Joker so a large part of it was closed off and you couldn’t get to the hand/footprints outside the Chinese theatre. Found it really underwhelming, dirty, and not the place you see in the media. Now I’ve been to see it don’t think I’ll ever feel the need to go back, but for first timers it’s worth to go take a look and make your own mind up. Disappointed as I was looking forward to seeing this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robynl1989
30,Anti-Climax,"Had always wanted to visit LA and overall it doesn’t disappoint but I was underwhelmed by the area around the Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The area seems very small with rather dirty pavements largely because of the vast numbers of visitors. You can make out the names on each star as you are propelled along by the crowd but the hands,feet etc outside the theatre look rather shabby. A shop called LaLa Land reminded me of one you could find in a seaside resort although it was good to see a car belonging to Elvis Altogether this is not an upmarket part of LA but it is a must for film buffs so not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/virginae
30,Just a crowded sidewalk,"We decided that we couldn't visit LA without a trip to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Not sure why we decided this as it really is just a sidewalk with names on it. Very crowded and touristy amd the footpath is very dirty in places. I think you need to be a huge fan of the stars or movies if you want to see this ""attraction"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teppy62
40,Vacation.,"Worth a view to see the stars.It's dirty and needs some repairs. During day, there are food vendors and artists. In evening, it's a different scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rancidsnack
10,"Over rated, over crowded, unknowns + a naked guy","Have avoided Hollywood Blvd in recent years as the tourist trap that it is but with a first time visitor thought we would show her the stars.It is still over crowded and over rated. Between the character actors posing for photos (for payment), the CD pushers (don’t accept anything from them unless you want to be harassed for money) and the crowds it is hard to see any stars anyway. Then when you do, half of them are unknowns or well below B-grade stardom.The final straw this visit was the naked man asleep on the pavement/edge of gutter at 2pm as families get the full Hollywood experience!Come on LA, isn’t it time this eye sore got a clean up?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neulara
30,Guess you need to be a bit special,"Best people watching in ages, everything else is a little lame. Happened to be there so walked the walk, let’s leave it at that",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/292charliee
20,Hustlers everywhere but experience ok,"Kinda sad, just ignore 80% of the people on the street trying to scam money with creative hussles. Folks in the costumes were just downright strange. Got to see some celebrities' stars but experience was pretty poor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robby321
20,Just a street without your usual asphalt,"Nothing special about Walk of Fame.The two streets are very crowded, also full with people trying to sell you things - which is so annoying. You cannot enjoy a nice walk in the afternoon... too crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dekadenza
30,Disappointing...,What a dump! .... you know you get that vision in your head of Hollywood .. greatness and an incredible buzzing atmosphere? .. yeah well forget it! Great to see the stars lining the street although not sure why some of them are still there????? .. yeah by all means go but don’t hold out for that amazing incredible moment! ... you’ll be disappointed ! .. and I thought the UK had serious drug and homeless issues! Very sad in places.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnsonsOnLocation
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,I loved it as I love not only current films but from yesteryear too. If you are against the clock you can check online to find where you favourite star(s) are located. Brought back great memories.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/400neilc
20,So disappointing!,This place couldn’t be further from what you imagine it to be. Yes it has the pavement with thousands of stars but each side of the road is lined with sex and tatt shops and you’re constantly pressured every step by someone trying to sell you a Hollywood tour.It’s ticked a box but we were glad to move on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FregleKid
30,Over rated,Over rated and not what she was but still worth the visit. Glitz and lights without the crowds. Stars to walk over and photos to be had,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spcvuandy
30,Interesting but it’s a little dirty,"We enjoyed this but definitely a morning or mid day activity. Had to dodge a sleeping homeless guy on the sidewalk. Many homeless people begging and it smelled like using the sidewalk as a urinal. Didn’t feel unsafe though. Lots of police presence. We parked in the mall and mall security made the parking feel very solid. Mall is clean, places to shop and eat. They don’t enforce the no smoking inside rules very well though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmlail42
50,Gotta do it,"If you come to LA this is a must do. Yes, it's a very tacky environment but going down the sidewalk and seeing the names of favorites, those whom you've forgotten, and wondering about the names you've never heard of is great fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgs5536
30,Meh...,"It was ok to walk Hollywood. Nothing there that would have me coming back again. You see it once, you’ve seen it all. It’s definitely cleaner than I thought. Not as much homelessness as I thought would be there. Panhandling was minimal. I was hoping to see more street artist but I’m new to visiting the inner city. I’m usually at the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Garypaul1256
10,What a pit,"I’ve come to hate going to Hollywood. It’s filthy, the hobos are aggressive and the parking sucks. So, how do I really feel about it? The walk of fame is overrated. My advice is to steer clear of Hollywood at all costs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lirica1
40,Surprisingly dingy,"Obviously everyone wants to see the Stars and I’m glad we did but we were surprised at how little has been made of this area. For example, Marilyn Monroe is outside Macdonalds. Lots of landmarks to see but an hour should do it. Take the train.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GailG701
30,Taking a stroll,"While I was visiting LA I decided to take a short detour and go to Hollywood Blvd and see the star studded walk. Overall it was okay but I found the street to be very congested. I asked several street vendors if they knew where I could get a map of where each star was located but was told they didn't have one. So unfortunate, I didn't get to see all those I wanted. Clearly a tourist trap with people asking for money for pics and inexpensive stuff. Definitely a one time outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/271stacyv
30,Not what I thought but fun,I was higher expectations of Hollywood blvd it kinda reminded me of a neighborhood in my hometown but all n all my wife and I enjoyed ourselves,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/862shaung
30,If your visiting it’s a must see but it is just some stars on the pavement,"We started our day off really early at Mels Drive In Diner (24hr) and then arrived at the Walk of Fame around 7ish.It was surprising how clean and tidy it was, we did see a couple of people sleeping rough though but they didn’t cause trouble.We were able to see all the stars we wanted even took the long walk to see stars like John Wayne which was a fair walk through a slightly run down area. Never felt unsafe but away from the Chinese Theatre it does start to show wear and tear.Enjoyed the experience if you don’t like crowds 7ish was definitely the time to go to see everything without tripping up over others. Saw the Hollywood sign when we got close to John Wayne’s star and the Capital Records building. Glad to have seen it but defo won’t go again. If there is a specific star you want to see I would google its location to make it a little easier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsKatieJB
30,Not as glamorous as I thought,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is somewhere I have always wanted to visit, you see it on TV all glamorous with Hollywood movie stars so to visit, you expect the same but it couldn't be further from the truth.The streets of Hollywood are full of beggars and homeless people everywhere, there is nothing glamorous about that.Everywhere you turn, someone is begging for money, CD sellers, dressed up characters, you name it, it is lurking on this street.We spend about 10 minutes here, that was enough. Very disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheNatster75
40,"""With the Stars""","We were lucky the walk of fame was not-at-all crowded, lucky I guess. Visited a gift shop where Elvis was standing next to his pink 59 Cadillac Convertible. The overall experience was one of those things you do when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore694115
40,We Saw Stars,"If you like Fremont Street in Las Vegas, you will love the “Walk of Fame”. There is something for everyone, homeless, costumed folks of many varieties (from “Minnie Mouse” to a woman with a leather outfit complete with whip) and hucksters galore. But there are the stars in the sidewalk we have all seen on television for years. It is something you should see once, but that should be enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VillagerRick
30,Not what you expect,"I was surprised at the walk of fame. Strong smell of marijuana, lots of street buskers and people trying to sell you empty cds for $10. Loved the stars and the theatre along with madame tussauds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetowineanddine17
40,Crowded unless you go early morning,During the day and especially in the evening it’s a challenge to walk along the busy part and actually be able to see the floor. We returned at about 9am one morning when there were hardly anyone about and took our photos. We found the foot/hand prints outside the Chinese theatre more interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GO50
40,Blast from the past,"Walking this area is walking movie history. Countless famous people's names embedded in the gold stars, many of whom have passed away. There are people dressed in costumes who want to take a photo with you for money. Spiderman and the big red dog were on our block. A Michael Jackson look a like was doing Jackson moves a block away.Parking will be away from the star walk. You will have to walk in.Best spot is in front of the Dolby Theater for all activity. Gift shops are around there too with cheap prices and cheap quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynnS290
40,Iconic,There's nothing new to see around but the place itself is iconic and one of those places that film lovers need to visit at least once and take a couple pics to show your friends you visited,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachealWaller
30,Stay hydrated out here!,"If you're the sort of person that loves Oxford Street in London, Times Square in New York or Old Town in Kingston-Upon-Hull then you'll love the Hollywood Walk of Fame. If, however, you'd rather not be bumped, buffeted and fleeced with every step (""ice cold water, Gaderade, stay hydrated out here!) then perhaps you should look elsewhere.I'm glad we went, but we didn't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigCol63
10,Tourist from MD,Completely disappointed. I expected this to be more upscale. The area was a filthy ghetto. The homeless and beggars were everywhere.The Hollywood Walk Of Fame was disgraceful to any level of expectations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlessF7718OY
20,Laughable,That’s what all the fuss is about? We didn’t even realize we were walking over the stars at first. The street is run down and very unassuming. Nothing special to see here really - just a bunch of tourists taking pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BMilano
30,It's okay,"It's stars on a sidewalk up one side of the street and down the other. It is nice to spot the celebrity names. We found several we knew right away but got to sore and tired before reaching Kurt Russels star which I wanted to see but gave up walking to ear at the hard rock cafe. But it is still just star names on the sidewalk. It's one of those must see's, like the statue of liberty in New York, I guess, you feel you have to do it the first time you go but you""d probably not do it again. The area is filled with shops, souvenirs shops and resterants and it is crowded with people. So busy. But yeah I did enjoy it, especially spotting some of the older names like Clarke Gabel's signature and prints outside the Chinese theatre where it all started. It's also near the Hollywood sign and if you go upstairs into the mall you get a better view of the sign than you do on the tour bus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/320bridc
30,Dirty,"Found the walk of fame dirty,a lot of cracks in the stars and a few that you could hardly read...thankfully its free as i certainly wouldnt pay to see it !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mandy0704
30,Not so bad...,"Interesting to stroll along and read the names. Not nearly as “impressive” as one might expect.Not as filthy as some folks appear to find.

It’s a part of the fabric and personality of the town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adeluciajr
20,Unfortunately its become Slum.bad representation of L A,"The only thing to see on the blvd is Chinese theater , El Capitan , Wax Museum , Ripley's , And the Mall at Hollywood n Highland. East of there the rest of the walk is a waste of time Bad neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artcz
20,Not as expected,"You have to do it when you are visiting LA but the surrounding area including parts of the Hollywood Blvd which the walk of fame is part, it is not the best or cleanest street of the world. Unfortunately the majority or the monument look abounded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vasilei0sf
20,Overrated,"The place appears unclean with people sleeping rough.Not impressed, though appears a bit glamorous when darkness settles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManishRaut

20,Dirty and full of hagglers,I am still happy I walked it but definitely won’t go again. It’s filthy and ridiculously full of hagglers in the area of Hyland Ave.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KAP1105
40,Bucketlist Item,"I have heard mixed reviews about the Walk of Fame, but it was a bucket list item for me. It almost feels like a Times Square atmosphere. It would be considered a tourist trap to some, but I personally enjoy those types of things. There are lots of shops, restaurants, and theaters along the walk. With any tourist trap, there are people looking for your money and will try to sell things to you. I just kept walking and they won't bother you. I enjoy these things every once in a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EaglesFan27
30,Mildly interesting and quite tacky. Worth and hour of your time.,A bit like a trip to Blackpool. Tacky shops and dodgy characters all over and quite intimidating. I wouldn't bother spending more than an hour here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mataverall
30,Overrated! The sidewalk is hardly anything to look forward to,"We visited the Hollywood boulevard walk of fame last august on a weekend afternoon. Being our first ever visit to the famed landmark of world renowned movie stars I have to say that I was disappointed. There are maps which take you to your favourites star’s star.... but we didn’t do that we just walked along the sidewalk and found to be not as glamorous as it is advertised to be. If you’re going there for the first time, keep your expectations low.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wolf668
20,Filthy and lots of weird people,"I live in Los Angeles and am uncomfortable even going to the Pantages Theater. The entire area is very dirty and you feel like you can’t touch anything or heaven forbid drop something and have to pick it up. The people (for the most part and certainly not everyone) are homeless or vagrants or wandering around, loaded on drugs. I make sure I put my handbag under my jacket and don’t wear jewelry. If you go, make sure to dress down- don’t attract attention by looking “together “. Just jeans. If you go, go with a group and park in a well lighted area with lots of traffic. Sorry for being so brutal- but truly this area has seen much better days... like 30 years ago!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtzs
40,Not what I thought but...,"It's a must do if your visiting to say you've been there. Stars are very spread out so you can walk all day trying to find someone specific. Maybe they have an app or something but we didn't do that. Was very dirty and alot of homeless people but no one bothered us. Paid $20 to park all day which I thought was OK. Lots of chain tourist trap restaurants. Some one of a kind if you look. Reminded me of a smaller NYC Times Sq. with tour groups everywhere and souvenir shops. Some of the stars were cracked or broken and very dirty. Guess my expectations were more than what it was. However, it's Hollywood so you have to go to say you were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiel1121
50,"Vibrant, lively and fun","This place is the same as many years ago. Lots to do, but be carfeful of people just after your money.

Make sure you are careful which tour you go on and clarify exactly what you will be seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sasasas
50,Absolutely must visit.,"For both tourists and locals - you will have a great time. Great place to spend the day for all ages (kids to the elderly).Great location (underground metro is right there)Good crowd.Great place to take pictures.Madam Tussards, Kodak Theater, Chinese Theater, Hard Rock Cafe, and many other good eateries and shopping places within walking distance.:-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllClassAllTheTime

40,VERY INTERESTING!!!,"I toured the HOLLYWOOD WALK of FAME at night so it was a bit dark, however, I googled the location of what names I wanted to see and it was not too far from where I started. The most interesting name I wanted to see and did see was Marilyn Monroe. I ran across one of my natives LOUIS ARMSTRONG (NOLA) which was cool to see. Also, I saw Whoopi; Lee Daniels; Halle and a few other names. It was a good experience and a MUST SEE!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cristalw2019
40,fun place to check out at least once,"Yes, it's a tourist trap but a fun and interesting one. We enjoyed checking out all the stars up and down the sidewalks and even found some cool rock apparel shops along the street. Had our picture taken with Darth Vader and Chewbacca - why not. Chinese Theater cool to see in person as well. The plaza next to it has some decent restaurant choices if you are hungry. Be sure to get a homemade churro from Street Churros. Delicious",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfeur66

30,A little disappointing,"After hearing a lot about the famous Hollywood walk of fame, we decided to have a look. However after arriving we found it was slightly tacky and it’s wasn’t as special as expected. The Chinese theatre was good and was more exciting to see. Also you get bombarded with dress up characters and singers that want your money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B9219WXamyh
40,Wow!,Heard so much about this over so many years so was a bit surreal to be here at last! Be prepared for ‘tourist central’ ie loads of tourists and souvenir retailers and salespeople everywhere. I started at Kodak Theatre and walked all the way to Vine St and back. After a while I’d seen all I wanted to see and personally found the hand prints and footprints outside the old Chinese Theatre to be more ‘interesting’ and ‘authentic’. Certainly this attraction has to be seen if in LA but once is probably enough!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinecK2471FF
20,Crowded and dirty,"The sidewalk is crowded and full of people staring at the sidewalk, there are tons of homeless people outside and also the occasional scientologist passing out brochures. Not to mention parking is impossible in this area and full of people with empty lots charging an obscene amount of money. If you absolutely MUST go, aim for the blocks around Pantages Theater (Hollywood+Vine) as it will be slightly less crowded and also there are better restaurants over in that section. Avoid Hollywood+Highland at all costs. This whole street is a tourist trap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danaelisabeth
30,Crowded tourist trap,Ok so everyone who visits LA I suspect wants to visit walk of fame ?. We did unfortunately on an LA day trip and I must admit it was NOT the highlight of the tour. Crowded often difficult to see the stars street sellers touting cheap souvenirs not I think the original intention to glorify the memory of stars of screen and music. Funniest thing was the damage done to the Donald's star (who ever guessed he had one).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdD836
50,Very interesting place to see,"Brought my friend to see the sights and scenes of Hollywood blvd and it was great, they have a bunch of restaurants, bars, shops and stores with some unique finds. Street entertainment was exciting and crazy! Got too see all the stars on walk of fame. It’s was a nice day outing for sure! A must see if you visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buttacup_k
10,Stars,"To be honest, it's one of those things you do because you see it on TV and everything, but I wish we hadn't bothered. Stars in a pavement with celebrity names in the middle?

Be warned....the ""visit the stars homes"" is an absolute money spinner. They over sell the tickets.....in 10 minutes the guide had our money and was sqeezing us next to another couple, who didnt want us sitting there either. No wonder given there was only enough space for one person. Im 104kg, 1.9m tall, i wouldnt even fit the seat on my own!!!!! The treatment frkm the tour guide was disgusting...."" you will be fiiiiine"", ""there is pleny if room there, cooooome ooooon"". We got off and demandex a refund. We argued for 25 minutes before getting a refund, it wssnt eady but we dug our heels in out of principle more than anything. Pick very carefully who you go with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrenc544
30,A must see but bit overrated,"It’s really cool, and you need to see that once you’re in LA, but at the same time it’s not worth the hype to me. That been said, it’s a nice walk and really characteristic! You should definitely go! But lower a bit your expectations",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theBlueChestnut
30,crowded,"Unfortuantly it's overcrowded with peddlers trying to take your money selling CD's or costumed characters being pushy for a photo. Be warned they will not tell you they ""work on tips"" and be rude and nasty to get you to pay them afterwords when you take a photo with them once they pressure you to take one with them.It's nice to see all the different stars, Marlyn Monroe in front of the McDonalds is a popular one and Michael Jackson is also. Many poor on the street begging so they may be sitting on the ""stars"" and you may not get a good photo. A little dirty, but hopefully the city can keep the sidewalks clean",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelhound711
40,The Grit and Glamour of Hollywood,"Hollywood has long been known as a destination for those seeking to see the stars. The only actual stars as you will see in Hollywood or on the sidewalks. The rest is a mix of masses of tourists, some costumes people known as Furries who will charge you to take a picture with a man dressed up in a dirty Spiderman costume, and as you get away from the crowds you’ll encounter the overwhelming homeless challenges that Los Angeles is facing. All that being said, it’s worth the trip and fun to see out your favorite stars along the sidewalks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanas1
50,Appreciation for the Stars,"When you live nearby you sometimes tend to not appreciate your what your local community offer. But who doesn't love the Hollywood walk of fame.I always enjoy driving home seeing hundreds of tourist, even on the few rainy days we have in California, bantering and gawking over these prestigious stars along Hollywood and Sunset Blvds. It is so cool. If you live in California or visit us here in Hollywood, please stop by and visit the stars of your movie favorites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherishedT

Massive tourist trap and very expensive (most of their souvenirs are cheaper of eBay).I find that the best time to visit is on a Sunday morning just before the crowds. Parking is not so much of a issue and I managed to find cheap parking on Vine Street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/De_Rycc
10,Not worth the trip,"Panhandlers. Beggars. Impostors. Greasy spoons. Horrid sweatshirt shops. No parking. I have no idea why anyone would want to come here. There are nicer places, equally iconic, all over the city. Go there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moosymooster
30,Not what I expected,I was so excited to get to the walk of fame and see the starts but honestly I was unimpressed. The starts are along regular walkways so they were dirty some cracked and unkept. The more new and popular ones were in locations that were too crowded or not accessible. I thought it would be more glitz and glamor to it... kinda disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emerald82
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"This place has really cleaned up since the last time I was here, around 10 years ago.We hired Santa Monica Limo Service (highly recommended- 10 stars) to drive us around Hollywood and the hills. We walked the streets with absolutely no problems. A really fun time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/floridabuzzman
50,Ms. Breeanna Judy was very lovely,"I did this tour at 10am and we had Ms. Breeanna Judy as our guide. She did a great job in taking us back in time. She showed us every possible Hollywood Star, the history of what the strip looked like years ago, the Egyptian Museum and the Hollywood sign. I collect Pressed pennies and had asked her in the beginning of the trip. She remembered and was kind to point out the 2 location on our walk. Very talented and very knowledgeable.Had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/virah2015
40,A must see!,"Any trip to LA would not be complete without seeing the Hollywood Walk of Fame of Fame, everyone has seen the Iconic strip in various Movies and Tv shows and a walk along the strip looking for your favourite actor or musician is simply a must whilst your in LA. The Strip is full of colourful characters all dresses up in various costumes willing to pose for a photo for a small fee. There is also plenty of bars, cafe's and restaurants along the strip that affords you the opportunity to sit and watch the passing parade of humanity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markd231
40,Worth a walk,"Great to look at acknowledgement of stars old and new in particular around Grumans Chinese theatre. Could live without the multiple Spidermen on the street, some quite aggressive. Great to feel close to Oscar territory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nick_k_uk
30,Kinda dirty.,Dirty streets with lots of smoke shops on every block. Donald Trumps star is near Ghiradelli. The star walk is designed to lure tourists. We didn’t recognize many names. Reminder of how soon fame fades.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephk302
30,Tinseltown’s walk of fame has no shine.,"Ok Hollywood walk of fame is pretty neat and longer than you think to see all the stars of those that you may really want to see. I like the glamour of old Hollywood so I really wanted to see Marilyn Monroe and Frank Sinatra’s stars - I did get to and sadly Marilyn’s is in front of the McDonald’s on Hollywood boulevard. If she was alive I am sure she would have seen the irony. We did get to see Grauman’s Chinese theatre and the Grauman’s Egyptian theatre from a distance though. Overall this Street was very dirty, and not a place for a 10 year old. We have walked the Vegas strip with our son and that seemed 80% safer, cleaner and overall more interesting then Hollywood blvd. There are lots of street vendors and the food looked amazing but overall it is a very adult experience. May have been better if we had gone down earlier in the day I am sure. There is no cost except the subway if you choose to take it. The Ripley’s museum was a strange delight but expensive at $25 US a person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soniacF4620QR
30,Busy and dirty,"A bit disappointed really- the pavements are quite dirty, the whole area needs a good clean. Very busy as you’d expect!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andalucia02
20,Crowed and manic busy,"Hollywood walk of fame is nothing like what you see in pictures or TV. It manic, crowed and not a nice place to try and visit.When you want a picture of one of the stars, you have to nearly stand over it as there are too many people walking by or taking the same picture.Best to get there, look and then leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1919IGdavet
40,Birthday trip,Nice place for sightseeing. But some of the stars are really dirty. Need to be kept clean for photo opportunities,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel829453

10,The worst of California,"While it’s interesting to see famous peoples names on the side walk, this place is populated with many homeless, it’s really dirty, feels unsafe, and has no police presence. We went at night and during the day and at both times, our family was eager to leave. In a wealthy state like California, it’s sad that a popular tourist attraction is so seedy and unsafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicksG4375ZE
20,Busy!,It is so busy and hot with people hawking everything that we did not really enjoy this experience. We saw a few cool stars but left quite quickly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSVanCity
40,Totally different to what I expected,"It is very very busy. So crowded that you don’t get to see a lot of the stars due to street performers, stalls etc.We parked off Sunset Blvd for the Ultimate Hollywood tour then walked over to the walk of fame after (10mins walk)It’s great to see the stars and to stop outside the Chinese theatre and see the handprints with signatures etc.But just be prepared for the crowds",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Basi5
10,Has Zombie Apocalypse Started?,"Oh my goodness. The walk has turned into such a hole. I wonder if the Zombie Apocalypse has started on Hollywood Blvd. Took a friend on a first time visit. The drug usage and people using the bathroom just across the street from Chinese Theater was disgusting. I watched a woman completely drop her pants and just go about 5 feet off the side walk in the street for everyone to watch. She just looked at us and said ""F... You. It's just dirty dirty dirty. I would be afraid to lay on the sidewalk to take a picture next to a star. Either you are going to get fecal matter, pee or drug stuff on you. Such a shame that LA has let this place go so bad. Do not take your kids down here. They will see things that can't be unseen! My friend almost threw up at some of the things he smelled and saw.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dem0502
10,The stars would be honored,"So many years of dedicating their lives to entertaining the world, only to have a great achievement covered with tons of trash, because the city as well as store front owners take no time to clean up with a hose. So many of my favorites could not be filmed, since I’m not good at editing out dirt and food from their star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theoneyoulove1968
20,Dirty,Its a lot better to go at night. Place is dirty and has a weird sewage smell. At least at night the brights lights are on and you can see how dirty the floors really are,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabec1384
20,Not what I expected,"Big movie fan. Always had walk of fame on my bucket list.But what I’ve seen on TV did not match reality.While you can walk over various stars stars (the footpath stars that is)It lacks the personal aspect of the literal hand/footprints outside the Chinaman Theatre. And I’ll be honest, get a taxi or an Uber here and do the theatre tour.During the walk itself expect to pass numerous entrepreneuring artist trying to sell their wears. Numerous unofficial tour guides willing to drive you past the homes of the stars. And as much as you hate seeing people in such situations, those who are homeless utilise the tourist trap.All to the backdrop of every other store being geared towards the ‘adult’ market.Was hard trying to explain to our young daughters why those sparkling new clothes had so many holes in them.And at the end of it all, you just wanna take a hot shower.Personally I recommend utilising your time.Go to Chinaman, avoid the walk, and then get a ride to another museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flight2nowhere
30,West coast,I thought this was very disappointing my expectations were to high this area is dirty and poor atmosphere not at all what I thought it we be.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sparkybat
20,Crazy hectic,Unless you research a certain star and go find it forget it. The place is far too busy you can't stop. A lot of curbside sellers/singers etc trying to sell all sorts.Not enjoyable to be honest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karen1403
50,fascinating walk,was great to see names of Hollywood stars didn't get to see a lot but what we saw was great went and looked at the outside of Chinese theatr,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaureenM2044
40,Pretty Fun overall,We went up and down on both sides with our 13 year old granddaughter. She was thrilled even though it was hot and REALLY crowded. My wife and I had seen it before and so had our granddaughter when she was really little. But the 4 stars is because the “Street” performers are rude and the vagrants are a nuisance. Not unsafe mind you just annoying.If you want to take pictures go early or late.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959edp
50,Stars,My girls have been waiting for this moment since forever. They hope to see their name one day. Stars on both side of the street. It was a fun day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charriseg2018
50,Always a staple place to visit inCA,Whenever I go to CA... I love to go to Hollywood Walk of Fame. I would love to witness a star getting a star!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillB995
30,"Cool, But Crowded","It is really neat to find a star of someone that you love. For me that was Dolly Parton. But, it is very crowded, not super safe, and one of the most unclean parts of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jolenedeon
50,Excellent fun visit!,"We had a great time visiting the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Took pictures in front of several Hollywood stars' star, and even had a rendezvous with Michael Jackson (look alike) The street was very busy and almost fair-like!! We were visiting with our young kids and they absolutely loved the trip! Also visited the Dolby Theater",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reena_Ch
30,"Fun tourist trip, Not much for locals","This area is the definition of a tourist attraction. The parking in this area is extremely difficult to come by and traffic tends to be really slow. As a visitor I would say it is a must visit as it is so iconic in movies and shows. Tons of souvenir shops, some restaurants, and also a view of the Hollywood sign. As a local I have never found a reason to visit unless I was showing it to a friend visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jacknife33
10,Terrible,"The city of Los Angels should be ashamed to show the Hollywood Boulevard to the tourist the way it is. It is dirty and disgusting wherever you look. The Boulevard is scattered with dirt, trash and dog poo... I never seen so many homeless people in my entire life, as I saw on Hollywood Boulevard in two days. It doesn't look like the tourist attraction the city advertise, it looks like a homeless shelter on a street. Tents wherever you look, and on the side streets; it's even worst.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cody307
30,Underwhelming Walk of fame,Was really excited to visit the Hollywood walk of fame but was really disappointed when we went there. It was overall very underwhelming and I would give it a miss on my next trip to LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Antsssy
50,Awesome fun!!,Head a blast visiting the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Took a picture in front of Michael Jackson's star😁. We Visited the Dolby Theater and were live studio audience members for Americas Got Talent!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L7129HRmonicas
30,Great venders/the people in costumes are pushy,"The vendors have great things and cute stuff, make sure you have at least $500 to spend.The people in costumes are pushy and encourage kids to get pics done and then make you delete the pic of you don’t tip them or they yell at you and cuss you out. I did find a few nice ones though.The guys with the snacks are jerks and Jude you because you don’t want to pay the $10 with the pics, they talk down to you.Keep your kids close by it’s very very crowded and a party spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayleeab
30,Not very impressive,"I have read several bad reviews before my trip to LA. Even tho, i was expecting better. The roads are very dirty, full of homeless people. Its dangerous at night.There is a lot of duplicate stars, so it seems bigger than it really is. Its a visit you do once in your life, but dont need to go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S3093TXcarlas
40,Good,"Walking along the walk of fame is one of LA’s must. Although is messy and full of people, you get a peek of what many movies show, and there are also a lot of famous places along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angieavilar
10,Hell Hole,If you are looking for dirty streets - beggars - tacky souvenirs and sex shops this is the place to go - we walked up to the Chinese theatre saw the teeny tiny Hollywood sign in the distance and went back to the car - we never felt safe on the streets here and never found the hands and feet stars - definitely not what we was expecting not how it’s portrayed on tv,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayneg869
40,Worth a trip if you are in Hollywood,Loved the walk of stars and the Hollywood and Highland shopping centre. Some cheap places to eat there too. Touristy but greatIf you want a good shot of the Hollywood sign you can go across the arch at the shopping centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cnash1
30,Bucket list,"I certainly managed to tick off a bucket list item by visiting, especially Michael Jackson’s star.I was however surprised and disappointed by the upkeep of some of the stars, especially Marilyn Monroe, who I assumed would have been a top attraction!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CatKing101
30,Fun half hour,"Yes it’s a tourist trap, but you’ve got to go, and our kids has fun spotting their favourite stars stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luckyaston
20,Overrated,"We went down at around 9-930 in the morning before it got too busy. It's something that you can say that you've seen, but I would skip. Even at that hour it was crowded and honestly gross. It was hard to see the different stars for all of the vendors and people standing around. Also...it's not really that exciting to see someone's name on a sidewalk. There is all day public parking on the side streets for around $20, which wasn't too bad and easy to access...however we definitely didn't stay long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganhelene1989

30,Chaos,"I have visited a number of times, and am always of the same opinion... get in and get out.. while it is great to see the iconic stars.. its a mess off people trying to sell you CD's, ask for money, it's dirty and so busy you get bumped every second step.Again.. get in and get out.. don't plan to spend too long here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alarnabell
30,A must for all tourists but beware of the sellers!,"Seen in movies and celebrates such excellently skilled entertainers. The only downside for me was the street sellers. With people standing to sell items in the middle of the sidewalk and stalls that took up a large proportion of it, it made the area cramped. This gave an unsafe environment perfect for pickpockets. This also impacted people/ tourists when taking photographs of their chosen stars. The area would look much more cleaner and give a different presence ifthis was prohibited. There are shops that sell the same items so the stalls are not needed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/124missyj
30,I was disappointed.,"I’m not really sure what I was expecting, I guess I was expecting a bit of glamour and I’m afraid there isn’t any at all.Yes they’re all the names of all of the stars on the sidewalk in pink stars with gold lettering. The area itself really isn’t very nice there’s not much you can do other than walk down the street and have a look at the footpath. No glamour to be found just tourists like me. It’s a little bit boring really.I am glad we went but I would definitely never go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valeriemD6484ND
30,11 things Hollywood Blvd needs to take note of...,"Imo, a somewhat lighthearted 11 things Hollywood Blvd needs to take note of (in no particular order):1. People in Spider Men and faux Minnie costumes need to stop asking for hugs and handshakes to solicit a photo. (Insert Ernest P. Worrell saying ewww.)2. The Walk of Fame should include creators such as authors not characters like Winnie the Pooh. Where’s A. A. Milne’s star? Who’s that you might ask? The author of course.3. On that note, L. Frank Baum’s home Ozcot was right off Cherokee Ave, walking distance to the Grauman’s theater. Yet the building was torn down and not even the kids park is named for him. Rename it the L. Frank Baum Park at the very least.4. Close off a section of Hollywood Blvd for foot traffic only. It’s so crowded perhaps if it’s an extension of the outdoor mall it would give you some space to dodge the handshakes (see above).5. Go see Richard Lael Lillard at the Beetlehouse, in a few years he’ll be bigger than sweatpants on Divine, you’ll wish you did.6. I’ve never heard any rappers getting famous selling their cds on Hollywood Blvd, please stop, besides hardly anyone has cd players anymore.7. Hollywood Wax Museum is probably fun when you are drunk. Otherwise, it is just store mannequins dressed to look like celebrities and after paying admission you’ll wish you were not sober.8. On the other hand, The Hollywood Museum is a must see. Located at the old Max Factor building. Also currently has a whole floor dedicated to the Pointer Sisters. So get your Neutron Dance on.9. Bring purell.10. Who needs to go to the Halloween Store when the Church of Scientology is down the block to give you the real heebeegeebees.11. Give some recognition to the Tongva, the first people of the area. If it’s a giant sculpture next to Marilyn Monroe so-be-it.What did I miss?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorinmorg
30,mwoah,"A must see when you are in LA, but dont expect too much of it. Really just some stars and nothing more than that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Denneman
30,"So, I've Been Here, It's Good Enough","Though my hubby and I were already aware, we still appreciated the fact that our tour bus driver warned us to be careful about other folks trying to get you in their look-alike outfits and ask you to pay for taking their photo. It was a fun experience walking the strip of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but it was too crowded and too many people trying to sell you everything you don't want or need. Just be careful you don't get scammed into paying for something you did not really expect to be charged for. Be nice but be firm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimieW
10,What A Sad and Dirty Place,"My Wife and I are movie buffs no doubt. Our personal collection of films is in the thousands. Everything from Silent era, through the Golden years up until current. The one thing the vast majority of these have in common is that they were produced in Hollywood. For as long as we can remember we have wanted to see the Walk of Fame and Chinese Theatre. It is said you should be careful what you wish for.We stopped here as part of a LA Day Tour, thank goodness we had a limited time. The street was getting set for the new Tarantino film premiere and this caused some footpath issues so it was busy but it is not the foot traffic that is the problem here. The whole area is basically a slum, dirty streets, homeless everywhere and hoards of rude scam artists and thieves wandering the footpath. 5 minutes after we got there we couldn’t wait to leave. La La Land was a good place to explore and I would recommend this for shopping and safety.Given that this is a tourist mecca why is no effort made to clean the area up ?????? We had read reviews saying it was bad but the reality was it was worse. Lucky I’m an Aussie and not scared to get into a scrap which kept a few idiots at bay.Despite getting a few pics to show we have been there it was bitterly disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prw05
20,Too crowded and tacky shops on the way,Been there now.Seen it.Not overly impressed.Tacky street vendor spoil what should be more enjoyable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardBSutton
40,Treading on the Hollywood walk of fame!,"When you step on this sidewalk what you look at is the names of Hollywood stars embedded on the street to make them come out at you as memories, ones you wondered about and even looked up to as artists, musicians, directors, actors and most importantly as some ones whom you may even have tried to copy, mimic and even had a crush on. They were once the star of stars, they were celebrities and mobbed when they may have walked on the same street or at many places in many other countries also. It makes you think that nothing is above time, star once and gone and even forgotten now-a humbling thought for each one of us who walk today.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wandrer2015
40,Walk in the walk of fame,I think that this place is great only if you first see Beverly hills or Santa Barbara. Otherwise if you go on the walk of fame first then you will think that Los Angeles is a not so beautiful. A lot of people especially after 11:00 in the morning. Not so clean area. A lot of homeless and strange people. There are a lot of shops with souvenirs. A lot of parkings,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValRal77
40,Interesting to an extent,If not exactly and the traction. But it is an activity or spending an hour or two doing. I wouldn't recommend bringing children because they won't know who the hell they're looking at. But I did find it interesting to find out whose names are actually on the sidewalk. I was surprised and how long the walk actually is. It seemed to go for miles in each Direction,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OldProChef
40,Hunting for stars,"There are more than 2600 five pointed terrazzo and brass stars embedded in the sidewalks along 15 blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and three blocks of Vine Street in Hollywood. The stars are permanent public monuments to achievement in the entertainment industry bearing the names of a mix of musicians, actors, directors, producers, musical and theatrical groups,fictional characters and others. Was nice to walk along and spot or rather hunt your stars. We found our favourites - Mickey Mouse and The Beatles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GanL
40,Great list of stars,"Pretty much what we see on the tv, lots of different stars on the sidewalkAll the tourists of course taking pictures.Worth a visit if you like the stars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danjonelson

40,Mixed feelings,"Of course we love the walk of fame and it’s a must see, but I would recommend not going at night or by yourself because there are a lot of high people who can be scary and aggressive, but if you’re in LA, it’s so famous that you must see it and during the day, it’s lively and fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherrytayte
30,Hollywood walk of fame,A must do whilst in LA if not visited before. Can get very busy by 10:30 and so becomes difficult to look at the names on the stars. We visited just after 9am and was nice to take our time to wander around. Look for Mohammed Ali on the wall to right if TCL Theatre which has an interesting back story. To reiterate it get crazy busy around the main walkway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GBItineraries
50,Nice,Glad we are able to see the hollywood stars. They stretch for blocks. Some stars are blank because the celebrities haven’t applied to pick up their stars at their award ceremony.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terryjohnson16
40,Nice little walk,The Hollywood walk of fame is fun little stroll. There are lots of famous please on the walk. So very old names and some new as well. its just a fun thing to do it like doing down memory lane. There are also some of the best people watching as this is a very diverse area. You may some Street venders and caricatures as well.Fun think to do on a nice day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garypK3165RD
30,Ehhh,"This was a must-see on our touristing list for LA. It was very crowded and kind of gross, similar to experiences in Times Square, NYC. It was neat to see the stars but we only walked about a block and then were done. Be prepared for tons of homeless. One of which we saw peeing into a grate on the street in broad daylight. I can handle such things but it was hard to explain to my 5 year old. Another sleeping by the McDonalds entrance in a puddle of urine. Cool to see but be prepared for the grungier side of things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBennett82
20,So overrated!,We thought we had to pass by the walk of fame since it is a landmark in LA (and popular back in our country) but it was underwhelming. It is the kind of extremely touristic places with all the downsides that go with them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NourHos
50,Full of fun and activities,"My family and myself stayed in the area for few days. It was really nice. We went to hall of fame area, chinese theatre and wax museum.

We had a lot of fun and memories to remember in this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1234NXammara
30,It's fine - if you can tune out the rabble!,"Wow. Now I know where ALL the tourists in Hollywood go to: The Walk of Fame. It was great to see the names in Stars and handprints, etc, of the crew of the Star Trek starship Enterprise at the Chinese Theatre, but boy, was it crowded and kinda ""grimy"" as my 25 yo daughter put it. Hustlers and pushers abound and are all over the tourists. Reminded me of a shorter Vegas strip, but just as seedy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/necowgirl
30,Over hyped place,"This place over hyped I mean if you missed it it's not a big thing. We spent about 1 hour walking the streets and there were lots of live performances but again nothing special about this place. If you have plenty of time, come & visit otherwise just skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnkitaSa
40,A must see,"Great morning, allow 3 hours to do it all. It is a 3 mile walk if you do it all(up side street past Capitol Records and down to Sunset Boulevard) Start at Hollywood/Bine Metro, turn right and follow the road.No public toilets but we used burger bars and Hard Rock Cafe after buying drinks and gifts. 2 of party were not looking forward to the day but really enjoyed it. Highlights were Elvis covered in flowers, 2 days after anniversary of his death, RuPaul covered in glitter! One member of party took 650 photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneGl12
20,Gets quite boring quite quickly,"To see the 15-20 stars names written on the floor that you want to see, you have to read about another 2000 names who may have been randomly chosen from a phone booth. Gets very busy. Constantly being bothered to go on tours or for guides to come round with us!Very quickly just becomes you walking along reading people's names on the floor, and usually upside down.Got to do it when in LA, but it's not great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thalmaco
30,A long walk!,"The walk of fame is a lot longer than we expected! After walking for 40 mins, we’d had enough. Quite difficult to see some of the stars as it’s so busy and a few had been damaged. Still worth doing though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoultFamily
30,"Must see, but not that special","There are many homeless people and the Street is not that special, you just have to see it once and I wouldnt spend more than 15 minutes there. Great tip: use the Street parking of $3.50 an hour, there are a lot of private parking “garages” which charge you $20",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacation317631
30,A must see,"A must see for anyone visiting Hollywood, but do not allow a lot of time in your itinerary. Once you’ve seen a few stars (and searched for those that you want to specifically see), you do not need any more time here and quite frankly, it’s very busy and too many street stalls have been allowed to be set up, which exacerbates this.Would recommend starting at Hollywood/Highland to get a feel for it and tick off the Grauman theatre, Dolby theatre, Hollywood sign & church from Sister Act at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dansN6381MX
40,Historical Everytime,"Not my first nor the last. Walking down both sides to see the stars, along with the businesses is entertaining. If you haven't, visit this at least once. People watching is fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saxy15
30,Not What I Expected,"When you watch TV or shows it shows the glamourous side of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, I was shocked when we got there how many bums, trash, sex toy stores, and more during the day there was. The night got worse so we left early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProfClemons

10,America 2019,"Coming from Australia ( a couple in our 20’s) we thought this was going to be super fabulous and iconic to see. However we felt like it was just an average side walk. You can’t see most of the stars because people are just walking over them to get to where they need to be. Half of them are really badly looked after, dirty and faded. The surrounds of the stars are really uncomfortable as It’s such a touristy area so there’s all the people dressed up as characters trying to get money (especially people with kids as there’s the superheroes etc) people trying to see cd’s and scam you. The road is really long as well so if you really came here to look at them, find a map of the stars which would help.Our hotel was right near the stars and we had to kind of go past to get an Uber to go places and by the end of it I wanted to avoid the area all together. I got sick of saying “no thanks” or just ignoring people asking for things. It’s right next to madam taussads aswell so it’s always busy. I wouldnt recommend. Go one day and have a look and I would avoid it as much as you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/603marissam
30,Not fancy as u might think,"Normal place, fun for the first few minutes and u get tired of not finding ur favourite stars. Yet a must see place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmanora1
30,"Very crowded, people trying to sell you their music and water all the time","We walked through the walk of fame, trying to see the names of the actors we like. It was difficult to see anything because there were so many people pushing and shoving. A man shoved a cd in my hand saying ‘here, one day I will be famous’ then before I could respond he said ‘let me sign it’, which he did. He then said ‘people give me $10 for my cd’ I said no thank you- to which he responded in anger ‘but I signed it for you! You must take it!’ Which I didn’t. There are many people doing this so be aware.The actual place would be great without this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/147kerenb
40,Must do in Hollywood,Obviously a must do in Hollywood! Difficult to find people you want to find unless you pre plan as it is extremely extensive. Can be very busy and crowded in summer but still fun! Also watch out for people trying to sell you things!! Got ripped off multiple times as they prey on tourists!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahsmc
20,Looking for your favourite star,"Basically the visit of the walk of fame is motivated by walking on both sides of the Hollywood Boulevard in search for your favourite star, and fending off the many offers from hawkers for tours around Hollywood, buying CDs, or spending your money otherwise. Not more worth than a photo stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globalbob2016
40,You need the map,"The wake of fame is a long street going on both sides, so if you don’t have the stars map will be walking and looking down for names that you don’t recognize. To give you a hit Disney characters are close by the chiradelli store. It is a must visit, but I was a little bit surprised that the area is not in the cleanness that I thought will be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelermomus
30,Starstruck!,"It was my first time and wasn’t really expecting to see the opposite. It’s too crowded, lots of vendor on the side walk that makes it narrow, congested area but once again your LA trip will not be complete without this strip. So it is a must to pay a visit and take a selfie with your fave Hollywood star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neiljaen7647
50,⭐,"A must see for all vacationers. Spend the afternoon on Santa Monica bld,between the stars,hand and footprints(of stars!) in front of the Chinese theater,the restaurants,bars,shops and other curiosities,your day will be full.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyinparistimestwo
50,What a way to spend an afternoon,We had a lot of fun walking the walk looking for familar stars. Would have spent even longer but had to leave for the airport. Biggest surprise was finding out stars you would assume have a star but actually don't!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nataleighs
30,"Very Touristy, And A Letdown!","The pavements on both sides of Hollywood Boulevard are star-studded with names of probably each and every celebrity that ever graced the American entertainment business. The area is of course very touristy, with lots of people walking up and down the boulevard, searching for their favorite celebrity’s name and having a picture taken with it. Pretty lame, right?! There are a lot of souvenir shops and fruit vendors in the area. Other landmarks of note include the several famous theatres such as TCL (formerly Mann’s Chinese) Theatre, Dolby Theatre and some others. For handprints and footprints and messages of the more famous Hollywood celebrities, visit the courtyard outside TCL theatre. There are some museums on the boulevard as well. The parking meters accept payments for only one hour, which is annoying. Wear a cap to protect yourself from the sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShoaibShawoo
10,Disappointment,I was told that it was a exciting place to see. We were disappointed on every account. The side walk where the stars are at were covered with veders carts so we couldnt see most of the stars on the side walk. It was dirty with food on the stars from venders.Garbage all over the place. It was our first time there and will be are last.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougiefresh62
20,Very busy,The walk of fame goes for a long stretch on along the road.The section outside the Chinese theatre was so busy that we could not see the names on the stars. A bit disappointing really.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaW357
50,Nice walk!,Spent the evening in a very crowded Hollywood. The walk of fame was a very cool experience. Nice to see some of our favorite actors and actresses stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rpshad
30,Worth seeing if in Hollywood,"My husband and two sons (17, 21) were in LA in Aug. 2019 and included the Hollywood Walk of Fame on our list of tourist attractions (as well as the nearby Grauman's Chinese Theater with the cement blocks of celebrity hand and footprints). If you are in Hollywood, both are iconic attractions (we found the hand/footprints more interesting due to both the span of decades of celebrities [some going back to the 1930s!] and the personal notes to Sid Grauman). Two of few FREE tourist attractions in the LA area! Plenty of parking in nearby available garages, about $10 or $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJFamilyTraveler
40,Hot but go see,"It can be very hot in the summer, but it’s a must see. So neat. See your favorite actors, actresses, musicians, even Donald Trump, on the walk of fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler902109

50,This is where the Magic Starts,"Walk the Walk... Talk the Talk. If you want a blast from the past... just pump yourself up with some coffee & liquor drinks along the way from the many bars on the strip. Do the whole walk and enjoy people watching, window shopping and Celebrity spotting. ( we saw Will Smith at the premier of ALADDIN). This is definitely on your TO DO List of the LA experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StinsonCanada
30,Holiday,I was surprised to find these aren't all together but over around 15 streets. We didn't see many other than the ones around the tour office. If I'd realised we weren't calling back I would have made more if an effort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941carolec
50,A must see whether you're a native to California or a vistor,"Everyone who either lives in California or visits must see the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and its supporting neighbor the Hollywood Sign. Both are iconic and give you a snapshot of days of old and new. It won't take you long to find one of your favorite actors and/or singers amongst the stars that line Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnawP6597FQ

30,Hollywood Walk of Fame,See it because you’re in Hollywood. Go early in the morning for an hour or two and then move on unless you like touristy things. It gets crowded and people will keep hitting you up for trips and such,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PenguinsFan1967
20,Just an illusion,"Most people from out of town (and country) have the idea of this place as being “like in the movies”, well, you’re in for a big disappointment. It is over-crowded, tiring, expensive and there’s not much to see. The fact that the Oscar’s event takes place on this area is not enough to visit. The mall is really nice but, then, there are wonderful malls everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigator828459
40,"A ‘must see’, albeit seedy in part. Concentrate on the Chinese Theatre area.","A ‘must see’ part of Hollywood.As we walked away from the Chinese Theatre the area became rapidly more dilapidated and seedy, and yet the stars continue.We preferred the area around the Chinese Theatre. Looking at the hand and foot prints. Jane Fonda rocks!We laughed at the presence of the Muppets, Alvin and Donald Duck. Cheered to see Hugh and Judy.You have to see the stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y1722HJgm
30,Shattered Expectations,"After many years of seeing the Hollywood Walk of Fame and TCL Theatre, formerly Graumans' Chinese Theatre, on TV, I really expected some glamour in the area. What I experienced walking from the parking lot to the Hollywood Walk of Fame were many homeless people, the smell of urine on the streets and so many people looking to make money having their pictures taken with costumes etc. Even with the premier of the Lion King being set up, there was no excitement around it. This visit really shattered my expectation of a glamorous Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AATrenton
50,Longer than you expected,"More longer than we expected. Many many people in the street and many people dressed up as like a character from some movies. I knocked out Captain America, so you can change the world there :)We liked that place very well and we can eat a pizza for reasonable price. There was also a free parking just a hundred meters far away (I don't known why it was a weekend or something holiday, but it was free just in the street).Sure lot of shops and etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ggecse

20,Mexican flea market comes with it the experience!,My wife who is Mexican said how can they allow this on such a prominent tourist site?It’s seriously like a flea market now!Used to be a fun experience but now you have a guy blasting water for a dollar on loudspeakers. Crazy place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tellurideplunge
30,Wonderful & Disappointing a same time.,"Wonderful, great sights, however though, we could smell Marijuana in the air, this is due to the Legalization of Marijuana. It was very unpleasant, everyone was pretty smoking it as they were walking past, and it was not a good experience. It needs to be stopped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASPASIAP3
30,"Free activity, not all as glitzy as you might think.","The walk of fame goes quite a way, so if you are looking for a certain star, it may help to know where they are located before you go. Some parts of the walk, like outside the Dolby theatre or the TCL theatre are nice and clean. Others are what I would have to say is just grotty. Beware the people there trying to get you to pay up to $20 for a photo of them dressed up as Superman etc and the people trying to hawk you for their CD's for a price higher than a CD at a store by a known artist. Look, it's free and something to see, but not very pleasant in parts and hectic. Can be hard to get a photo as the area is crazy busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kearsen

10,Hollywood Blvd is chaotic,I would not waste your time dealing with this sea of humanity. Stranger Danger at every corner for the kids. Lots of scammers and homeless making the experience a touch scary for a tourist.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/796nathang
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,This felt so unreal. I always see it on tv but never thought I’d ever get a chance to visit this great place in Hollywood. It’s definitely a once in a lifetime experience.

40,Bucket list,"Yes, this is a must-see while visiting LA. Take time to walk both sides of the street, I am certain you will find all your favorite stars.Unfortunately, in my opinion, it is very dirty and you will find a lot of people asking for money. Be specially careful after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leobs11870
50,Tour LA,Everyone has to walk the hall of fame at least once. Find your favorite stars stars or even the presidents star like them or not. It was fun to see stars from childhood to present.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janewX4430BW
30,Hollywood walk of fame,It was an amazing place to walk down lots of restaurants and gift shops.If anybody tries to hand u a CD then DO NOT!! Take they are after you paying for it basically asking for 10-20$. Also a lot of super hero's that try to get u to take a selfie and then ask for dollars. I though bit like Blackpool on steroids really but nice to have walked down and seen. Just be vigilant and keep walking - hard rock cafe best thing on here and big red bus tour. At the start of the shops one called LA gifts or something can't quite remember but very dear if you go down strip a bit can get the same stuff cheaper. Chinese theatre is also worth a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terrylT8195GE

40,Famous Walk,This 'atraction' was expected. Some stars need attention and cleaning up. Some stars are still blank.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crayonline
20,Neat but dirty,It was fun to see the Stars along the Walk of Fame however it was on the dirty side and made my kids uncomfortable. We didn't feel particularly safe there and were glad we were there during the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/442dawnk
30,A must to see if in the area,Was the reason we went to the area but was part of the overall experience. Didn’t do much for me but I get to some it is fascinating. Glad I can say that I saw & walked the streets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini6322
30,Disappointing walk,"The star names are on the pavement, so it is fun to walk and see how many you can recognise. But the street is busy with people AND with people trying to get a quick buck off you. There are people in superhero costumes offering to take a photo with you - the “fee” is requested after. Other people were pushing CDs, souvenirs etc, which spoilt the atmosphere. Souvenir stalls also can be set up on the walk, so a movie star that I liked had his star partially blocked by the stall. Anyway, it’s what you have to do at least once in on a visit to LA, so just visit and avoid the salespeople!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yss97
40,Our first stop on the AMG Tours,"We stopped for an hour in Hollywood to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Dolby Theatre, The Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood sign. The Hollywood Walk of Fame was very crowded and we were approached by many people dressed in various costumes such as Superman who wanted to us to have photos with them for a tip and others wanting us to buy CDs from them for USD1. This marred our visit to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. However, I did take photos of the Stars bearing some of famous names.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/765lesliel
40,Morning walk,"We walked from our hotel to the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Monday morning 7/29th. Walked both sides of the Hollywood Blvd. For a Monday it was busy. We also had lunch and bought several souvenirs along the way. There was a couple of spidermans, an Edward Sciccorhands and lots of people offering tours. We were done by 1:30pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/755daliar

30,Just good to say u have been there,Was nice to visit say we have seen it. Crowded and lots of people selling stuff. I wouldnt spend more than hour or so is enough. Kids had more fun renting the little birds and driving around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markandjennie
30,Kind of disappointing,"Don't get me wrong, walking down the street and finding your favorite actors and actresses is fun. But the place is dirty, you are hassled by street performers, and it reeks of drugs. Think Times Square in the 70s. I am so disappointed that the city of LA would treat such a historic area with such neglect. It's almost as if they don't want tourists to visit. And the sex shops are a really nice touch for family fun! Come on LA, clean up the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Garypeto

20,Very dissapointed,"Tawdry, dirty, people with mental issues at every corner. Didn't realise that you could basically buy your own star....On the upside, definately recommend the stars tours that you can jump on for roughly $25 per person, they last for c1.5 hours and are great value",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markcQ818QH

50,A MUST walk & SEE,Great thing to do. Drive there and park near the Pantages theater. You can see all kinds of businesses ...Restaurants and caffes along the SIDEWALK to the STARS. Stars with famous and long gone names. A must do if in the area. Many tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bajajulio
40,Less seedy than 25 years ago!!,It was fun ambling down one side of the street and up the other though my daughters seemed to know almost no one and I knew almost everyone!! Age!!

40,Fun experience,"I don't know why people are so harsh. It is literally a street, there will be trash and no one is going to maintain it perfectly. This is a very busy location with lots of tourists and homeless people. Personally, I loved walking down the street and reading all the names. Just find a section away from the chaos and enjoy the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventuresahead
20,Tacky and Crowded,"This was supposed to be one of the must see places on our California trip, but is was a big let down. We did go on a Saturday, so perhaps it was extra crowded, but once e did find a place to park ($20, which was the going rate), the place was tacky! Even more so that Time Square NY......at last the super hero costumes there looked authentic! Yes we saw some stars and yes we did have a photo taken at a couple, but the hustling and the begging made the whole thing a big let down. Even the Chinese Theatre was shabby and squeezed in between two shops......oh and the Rest Room situation was awful. Managed to find one eventually in the small ""Mall"" but for a fairly modern building they were appalling!!! My advice..............avoid, not worth it!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pazconsulting

30,Unexpected Views,"Streets were crowded not just by people walking to see the stars but also with many stalls trying to sell items. Some stars are being covered by these stalls, some stars were even dirty and cleanliness is not being kept.If you want to see the stars without much crowd, try going as early as possible, preferably before 9AM.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wjcmadonza
20,A three would have been too generous,"Okay, it was fun people watching. The teens enjoyed the three hours spent in the area.But, parking is difficult and expensive. Lots of homeless and beggars about, we were cursed at for simply walking past one without leaving money. Lot's of folks selling tours and they can get pushy about it.Ohhh- I almost forgot its pretty dirty and smelly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyt200
20,Disappointment,"This wasn’t an enjoyable experience. It was completely packed full of people and my family and I had to stay very close in order to not get lost although this was expected. There were some fun museums that my family went for (wax museum, Guinness world record museum and ripley’s believe it or not). The part that completely ruined the experience was all the drugs and the people trying to give us things saying it’s free and then demanding a tip. It was cool seeing the famous stars and all but personally I don’t think it’s worth it and I won’t be coming back soon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siobhaindoyle
40,Seen some great stars!,It's hectic at times w the crowds of ppl walking and your trying to look but at the same time worth fighting off the crowds. The ppl are really nice for the most part when you are trying to take a picture because you are all there for the same reasonings!Even while pushing strollers they were helpful and moved out the way. Was hard to keep looking down and try and read and walk at the same time.I’d been about 3 years ago and now it seems it’s much more dirtier in the area. Even the sidewalk itself was gross and dirty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlaytimewithMiss_T_e
30,Not what I expected.,"I don't know what I expected of Hollywood really. But, I was a bit let down. It is, of course, busy with sightseers but also alive with guys trying to sell cheap tours. They are everywhere and trying to get you into the cafes for lunch. The stars were a little dusty but it was nice to see and I didn't imagine there would be so many. We had a walk past the Chinese Theatre and along Hollywood Boulevard. We had a great lunch at Johnny Rockets. We had a great day but, not somewhere I would go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liketachat
50,"It’s a sidewalk, full of stars","Ok so you all know that. It is what it is. Not my first visit but the last time I was there it was cold and rainy and I didn’t get the full experience. The summer, sunny experience is different. Imagine a circus on the street. Cheesy performers doing photos for a dollar. Hispanics fruit vendors (YUM). Grilled, bacon wrapped hot dogs and people selling every light up toy imaginable. Quite an adventure of sights and sounds. A must do, find your favorite stars and try not to laugh at some people who have a star that shouldn’t!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethMorrison6
30,Seeing the sights...,"Iconic street and iconic walk of fame, be prepared to walk several blocks as the walk is longer than you think!What we didn’t expect was the number of homeless people who were clearly trying to find food along the streets and in bins. There are also a lot of very touristy gift shops - as you would expect - but these are on the cheesy side of tacky.You have to go, as it’s so iconic, but the glamour is beginning to lose its shine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/500kerryr
10,Nasty,This was so disappointing for our kids. So much crap being sold on the side walk that it takes up a lot of the space. Most stars have things set up over them so you can’t see them. Side walk was so dirty and smelled. Homeless using needles sitting on the sidewalk in view of everyone. Group of kids with signs that read drugs for money. Starbucks had a drugged up guy harassing the customers and did nothing to make him leave. He was harassing young girls. This place is just a nasty drug infested place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22Traveler87
10,Big disappointment,"It sounds great right ? And it is right outside the Dolby theatre where the pavements are cleaned, but elsewhere it's just not great.The pavements are just pavements with stars on them, at weekends they get abused like every other pavement, pizza, puke, urine and faeces. Homeless, tourists beggars, commuters, kebab vans, scooters, bikes, and promoters occupy these sidewalks on a daily basis. So they get soiled.It wouldn't cost the earth to clean the pavements occasionally but this appears not to be a priority.Fortunately for the stars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davegan61
20,Tourist trap,"As a resident of Los Angeles, I try to steer travelers away from this crowded mess. Yes, you can see the handprints in cement & stars on the sidewalk, but that's it. The rest is tacky souvenirs & crowds. There are so many other activities to do in this city. This should be at the bottom of your list. The neighborhood is not great. There are so many people crowding the sidewalk it's really unpleasant. Stay away from this away. There's nothing else in the area to do, either. Go to the Getty Museum, the Norton Simon Museum, the beach or the Santa Monica Pier, etc. You'll probably go anyway, but you were forewarned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imjuditha
30,Nice walk but not a must,"Stayed at a motel within walking distance. Did the walk one evening. Nice walk, lots of food trucks, lots of people, lots of Marvel heroes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959mattiasb
40,Met Expectations,"My daughter and I planned to visit the walk of fame and were happy with what we saw. We found that if you went in the morning it was less crowded and cooler. If you went in the afternoon/evening, there were a lot more street vendors but they added a nice touch similar to what you would find in Mexico. We don't know if there is one, but a map showing where the stars are located would have been nice to have. There are some stars we did not find and would have liked to see. We combined see the walk of fame with visiting some of the other tourist attractions like Madame Tussaud's, Guiness World Book of Records and Ripley's Believe It or Not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer284545

30,Ok,It was nice to say i had been. But it is quite a dirty street. Lots of souvenier shops. Street acts. Street vendours. Hundreds of paved stars. Very very busy. But yes i would.reccomend a visit if in la. Get on a bus tour and see the sights,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8167QZlisab

40,Nice small walk looks 1970s type,"It's really not so great as what it seems to be. Just a road with stars on the pavement each representative of an eminent cinema personality. Beverly hills is much better to look at but unless you are into Hollywood , it's a to do list that you tick-off but not really enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Medapati
50,"Stars , stars, and more stars","Beautiful walk with plenty of stars to see and also plenty of shops and restaurants. There’s also the Chinese theater to visit and take pictures of some stars’ handprints . The blvd also offers plenty of souvenirs, T-shirts, and gifts . Must visit and see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariana48

10,Terrible and dirty,Very overrated place. We went there yesterday and evening and it was a mess. Dirty and smelly street with loads of shady people- not good for kids at all. Whats the big deal if you see some artist’s name on the footpath. We did not enjoy the experience. It was rather a simple checklist chore. Been there- not going again. Some good shops but generally cheap stores peddling Chinese souvenirs of Hollywood!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nazirpri
40,Star for every Hollywood actor,"A we went on 4th July weekend. It was crowded place.. But still we could capture pics with our favorite hollywood star.. Must see... there is mall near the metro station, which has good food joints and could architecture to see.. even we could see hollywood sigh from there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderlust_Bhavna
50,Hollywood Staple,"If you’re in LA you have to visit the walk of fame. Yes, there are homeless people everywhere and random people dressed up in Superman costumes trying to get you to take a picture, but that’s part of the package. Marijuana smells permeate the air but, again, it is part of the experience. My family enjoyed all of the sights and sounds of Hollywood Blvd....traveling with two teenaged boys, an 11-year-old girl, and 73-year-old grandma we had absolutely no problems. We actually stayed in an apartment on the strip for three nights and it was great. The trick is to not engage with anyone. Smile at the people trying to sell you cd’s and things and just say ‘no thanks’. The minute you say anything other than that is when they will hound you. That’s really the only advice you need. Embrace the chaos and have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blondi1517
20,Of course! You have to see it. But disappointed,Nothing what we expected. We expected this to be a lot prettier and clean. But no very dirty and really not great. In an area which I thought was rather unkept and seedy looking.But really need to see it because it’s nice to see the stars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolineo226
50,"Well known attraction, a must see","We all have heard before the world famous Walk of Fame in Hollywood. It is indeed the most touristic street in LA and a must see attraction. In the evening it becomes overcrowded with many local people dressed up as spiderman and other superheroes. They wear cheap fake-ish costumes to be honest that they only do it for money, so it kind of ruins the whole spirit of the street. Tip: to take a nice photo attend early in the morning when it is less busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerasimosdo
40,Celebrities (Movie Stars) Hunting,"Found Bruce Lee, Michael Jackson, Celine Dion but never realized that Donal Trump is also there? Somehow, I thought these are for movie stars only. On my way back from China Theater, bumped into Donald Trump who was at his spot. Donate $3 for a hand shake and photo taking with him. Haha!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidASU
40,Good for 1st timers in LA and Hollywood,It’s a surreal experience to see Hollywood Blvd and Hollywood wake of fame in person. There were a lot of famous movie characters walking around the street that greats you. However be careful because there are also a lot of sellers that seems to be trouble maker.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F7880LPianb
30,Tacky,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is on Hollywood Boulevard and is really just one very long street filled with tacky shops selling junk to tourists and tourist type restaurants and fast food and coffee outlets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roryjdoyle
50,One of the few free things to do in LA,"In between tours, we spent some time walking down the streets that contain the stars. Good fun. So many people on the sidewalks though, so don’t expect a great picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellymQ868JN
30,Worth doing,Parts are a bit sketchy and parts are pretty cool. But it is neat to know that so many stars have been there and present where you stand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rawband
30,Not for us,"We were staying just above the walk of fame. We went for a walk around the neighbourhood and stumbled upon a Star and realised where we were. That was kind of exciting. We had our kids with us. 13 and 11 years old girls. It didn’t take long before they both wanted to go back to the hotel - and even skip the clothing stores!The streets were very active and busy — this was around 3 or 4pm on a spring day. Lots of street people - dressed up in costume, trying to get you to have a photo taken with them for a price. They were very pushy and our kids didn’t like it. My husband and I travel a lot and we are used to the hustle on the streets in many cities but our kids had never been exposed to this and it was a shock to them.Added to this was the number of drunk, homeless types - one lady lying on the concrete writhing in agony - very intoxicated, yelling and swearing while police tried to assist her. Just a lot of craziness in one spot.I don’t think the stars were worth the hassle to be honest which is a shame",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KPwhanau
50,Fun filled,The walk of fame was awesome. I only heard about it but to visit it was really wonderful. A parade was just started when we reached. It was fun to watch people dancing so lively and freely on the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duttsupriya
40,Tourism,A must go. Very special kind of a walk. Very touristic Avenue. Madam tassauds is full of all time favorites. Good time spent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ahsanij
40,Fun to walk,"I visited Hollywood for the 2nd time. The walk of fame is fun. Besides the walk itself there are a lot of shops and restaurants around and the atmosphere is really cozy. I would say a must do when you are around, but nothing spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rolfs412
40,Walk of fame,"Was quite surprised as to where the stars were, on just a normal street, nothing special, hard to take photos as people walking over them all the time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShezzaT
50,Be Near Your Favorite Star,"It is fun to walk along the Hollywood Walk of Fame - if you are seeking somebody inparticularly, google the star and it will tell you what intersection their star is located at. You never know, you may just bump into a star on your travels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/235nickit
40,FUN,Its a fun touristy spot. There is nothing much to it other than stars of your favorite celebrities..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srm8
30,Must-do but not really that spectacular,"We visited Walk of Fame with a bunch of friends on Friday evening, and it was very crowded. However, I did enjoy visiting the sight, and for a first-time visitor it's of course a Hollywood must-do.Tip: the names on the stars are difficult to see when it gets darker and street lights reflect from the golden letters. I would recommend going before the sun sets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssannamariaaa
30,"Interesting, a little creepy","If you love movies/TV, and you're in the area, how can you NOT visit here? That being said, there are lots of homeless, and kind of strange people that made my daughters a little nervous. Watch your belongings, avoid eye contact, and check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwy1
20,Disappointed,"The whole area needs a good clean up. Looks like a warm Blackpool! And at night full of gangs of locals, made our teen daughter very uncomfortable",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/592alastairm
50,It has to be done!,If in LA you have to visit the Walk of Fame. Remember it does go on for quite a while so make plenty of time to find the stars you want to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyBaker65
30,Too much tourists here,"Before i visited the walk of fame, i checked if there is a movie premiere in thia week where i will be in los angeles. İ found the premiere of hobbs and shaw. So i decides to go on that date. İt was amazing i had the chance to see jaaon statham, the rock, timberland, idris elba and eve. İ had the full hollywood feeling. İt was great. The mohammed ali sign which is not on the floor, it is on the wall was so imteresting. Read the story behind the reason of why it is like it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yasemin2323
50,Worth the Visit,"We stayed one street away from Hollywood Blvd and the Walk of Fame. Being an international visitor we wouldn’t miss it. The first and most important star for me to visit was Elvis’s star and it was right on the corner of La Brae & Hollywood Blvd (beside the Beatles of all stars!) lolWas very busy during the day and even though there’s still peeps out late at night, it was easier to see them of a night. We took a walk at about 11pm at night to see them properly.Michael Jackson’s is not far from the Chinese theatre and Mohammed Ali’s is the only star not on the sidewalk but on the wall outside Dolby Theatre! (Due to religious beliefs he apparently didn’t want people walking on it).Hollywood Blvd is a crazy place. Lots of people trying to “give” you their cds then wanting money for it and characters of all sorts wanting money for pics with them. Kind of got annoying after a few days but who knows maybe one of them will be our next big thing..Some may say it’s over rated and it’s nothing special but you’d be crazy to miss this landmark location if you’re in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynne_Verwaard
10,What is this place???,"Visited this morning and it was far from what I expected.First of all the street is dirty, smells of wee and weed every where.But the worst: we were walking along the sidewalk looking at the stars and trying to ignore the large amount of badly dressed up adults harassing people for photographs when out of nowhere a guy came, elbowed our 9 year old daughter in the neck and then played football with her cap.She was distraught and in tears. We couldn't leave fast enough.Avoid this place especially with young children.It's a disgrace!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NotinghamFrenchy
30,Way Overrated,"If you like to people watch, this is the place for you. Crowds can be intense. Even more strange at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O3993SYtomc
40,Must go,Visited on 19th JulyThis is a must-go if you are visiting California. We were at L.A and drove there. It was an easy one-hour drive from Venice beach.Many wonderful things to see and the atmosphere is great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dan-Luckyboy
30,Did it because we were there vacationing,"Walked the street and it was interesting seeing the names of some people we enjoyed over the years. One of those things that when done once, I would not do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crg428
30,Just to say we did it,"I'm not obsessed with any stars, so maybe this experience isn't as intense for me. It can get busy on the street, but it's really just a sidewalks with names of stars on stars heheh. But if you're in LA, why not! We were there during low season, I don't think I would enjoy it much during high season with all the people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/memeh613
30,Worthwhile but overated.,We visited as part of our LA holiday. Well known tourist attraction popular with tourists. Fanastic to see the stars and the Chinese Theatre. The street has alot of tourist souvenior shops offering good value souveniors. Overall though the street was disappointing with lots of hard sell of tours of celebrity homes and the opportunity to take a photo with someone dressed in fancy dress as a celebrity. Overall worth a visit but not the highlight of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niamhabroad
50,Another Achieved Dream!,"Taking pictures and walking through the stars of our movie ""heroes"" was unforgettable! I suggest to see the Walk of Fame, when the weather is sunny (as mostly of the time in Los Angeles)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Salngenito
30,Pretty gross part of LA,Cool to go see a few stars on the walk but this really is a fairly gross part of California. Very crowded as you’d expect and everyone’s after your money (also as you’d expect!),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gngj
50,Keep your eye on the Star,"Our visit to “Hollywood Walk of Fame” started on the weird side. The strip appears to be split between the touristy side and the smutty side. The area around the Chinese Theater was family friendly. Venture outside that area and there are a lot of strip clubs and pipe shops. There were homeless around, but they didn’t bother anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomrW3314LE
20,Pointless,"Would never visit this again. There is a slight joy in seeing a star from someone who you would actually recognise as a star but way over half are of obscure celebrities I've certainly never heard of. The entire area is decidedly run down, I thought they would have kept the pavement pristine at least but it just feels tacky. Oh but at least you can be harassed every 15 metres for a tour of stars homes. The highlight? For me it was finding my customary souvenir magnet in one of the many souvenir shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LancasterLads
50,Great walk down memory lane,It is great to walk down a path with such historic names and remembering what they have done. Most of the stars are in great shape but some stars are not as well taken care of. Some parts of the walk can get a little shady with the neighborhood it is in but most of the way it is fine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sp4102
40,Oh My Stars!,"It was like a history lesson walking along this path. All the movie greats were represented here. Of particular note around back where the older section is, the earliest movie stars wrote their names in the concrete and put foot and hand prints along with messages to the theater owner. It was wonderful to walk and imagine what it was like back in the Good Old Days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillR703
40,Not That Cool Than Imagination,I have been there around 1 year ago. The street is not that wide as I imagin before as per the images I had seen on TV. Anyway it is a good visit to feel the native American movie culture there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xiaodongliu1207
40,Cool to see but overrated,Obviously you wouldnt go to hollywood without seeing the walk of fame however this wasnt as extravagant as you would expect. The streets are very very crowded so its often hard to see the names or get a good picture but still a staple LA sight!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannonm148
50,Fun Place,"This is a fun tour of the names of famous folks who stand out for their category, from singers and entertainers to actors, producers, or a variety of other contributions. It was fun to discover names of favorites and take pictures of their stars. the place is pretty crowded though, so sometimes you have to get creative to snap a shot of your favorite celebrity's star, from oldy-but-goody's to newcomers on the scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jorikschells10
50,Hollywood walk of fame,"Ok you will get mixed reviews because there is good bad and the ugly.First the good walking around Hollywood can be intimidating. there are some really nice spots Like Hollywood and Highland but venture off a few blocks and you will be walking over the homeless population. The academy awards theater is really cool because they list every movie that won best picture engraved on the wall of the staircase Mann Chinese theater and across the street is the El Capitan theater which feature many Disney movies and sometimes they have some of the actual movie set downstairs.Now for the bad there are a lot of people dressed in costume portraying your favorite movie charters ( Batman, Jack Sparrow, Spiderman and so on. They will offer to take a picture with you but after the photo they will demand money some only a dollar or two others ask for $10. There have been actual fights with customers and other costume artist so just say no and walk away. Ugly - just stay in the Hollywood and Highland area and you'll be fine but venture off looking for celebrities and you be disappointed .No movie stars hand out in Hollywood, shot for Beverly Hills at a hotel or restaurant like (The Ivy) and you might get a glance but please do not bother anyone they just want to eat a meal in piece also",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dadruntrack52
50,Excellent Time,"One of many tourist attractions. A strip with stores, food, theatre, and more. People dressed up as characters. It’s a lot to do as far as sightseeing on the strip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denariusb23
50,A must in LA,"It is a must go to in LA if you want to be the ultimate tourist.We started at the beginning - sounds obvious but not everyone does, so started at the pergola (pic attached) and walked down one side and up the other spotting our favourite stars from along the years.It gets busy in certain places like outside the Chinese cinema but we never found it a problem to wait our turn and grab a pic.Not sure I would do it again but it was a fun afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O3559JIhelenc
20,Nothing exciting there unless you bump into a Movie Star.,"Basically it is a series of tiles with famous stars names which extends for a few blocks. Lots of action there! People are dressed in costumes mimicking famous people, and many vendors selling tours and discounts to local Hollywood tourist traps. There are some homeless people but they are not the majority. It is fun for a few minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maureenmT901LP
10,SKIP IT. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.,Ive worked above this block of Hollywood Blvd for most of the last two decades. It's gone from shabby to worse. Nothing but chain stores and poor mentally-ill destitute homeless people.There are names. On a sidewalk. Shrug.The Hollywood Roosevelt is a nice old hotel and the Mann's Chinese is worth going inside to see a movie. Other than that you will be disappointed and disgusted and have wasted a day of vacation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VonJonathan
40,Super fun!,"Walking down the Hollywood Walk of Fame is definitely a must do when visiting LA if you enjoy entertainment! This is such a hot spot with so much energy and buzz. If you are lucky, you may even see it set up with a red carpet near the TCL Chinese Theatre. Only downside is the parking and the traffic! And also be aware of the LA hustle, where people will do pretty much anything to make money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsjddrayton
20,Pretty,Crowded and dirty with some homeless people sleeping and lying there.Secondly having some great names beneath ones footsteps wasnt too pleasing either.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SOQ2010
40,Must do! Once anyway.,"It’s definitely a fun experience that I’m glad I did, but now that I’ve done it I’m good. Lots of interesting people and shops. Very commercialized.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jim723
30,Multiple Stars for one person,"We parked by Frank Sinatra’s star and started walking to find a second star for him on the sidewalk. Then David Niven has two. And Gene Autry has 5. Stars can get a different star for each category - films, stage, TV, music, radio.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barkus1968
40,You have to do it once,It's something you have to do just to say you've done it. Be on the lookout for sketchy people - Hollywood is not the best area. Probably best to visit during the day. It's fun to walk around and take pictures of your favorite stars. Just stay away from the marijuana bars and S&M shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamieD7902014
50,Better than expected,"After a lot of third party experiences and some reviews we will headed to Walk of Fame thinking in tourism trap with a lot of sellers and typical tourism staff.Not at all. Most of people just visit 200 meters next to Chinese theatre and forget rest of this walk. I strongly recommend to spend at least 2 hours in this street and it is a must see visit. Only TCL part is fulfil of tourist and sellers, rest is a great visit and a nice morning walk. Check script stores in this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acivipam
40,Very enjoyable,"Despite there being a lot of tourists there, me included, it was very enjoyable and everyone was very accommodating to taking pictures of your favorite stars. Plenty of souvenir shopping to be done. Not too many bathrooms around....need to look for them or buy lunch somewhere to use one. Otherwise, a very memorable experience finding all of our favorite Hollywood stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6854CLjamesl
40,Tourist must see!,"Of course if you are in Hollywood, you have to visit the Walk of Fame as a sightseer!I visited this quite early in the day and I strongly recommend to actually see the stars - you do just that. Any later in the day it is VERY busy and if an event is going on? Then you will have no chance of walking down the street to see anything as it will be crowded with people and cameras. There are many homeless people and those trying to make a buck from you so beware of this. There may also be people in costumes who convince you to take a photo - this will not be for FREE as they won't leave you alone if you do not give them some sort of tip afterwards. Seeing the stars isn't the only thing to do though...of course there are many restaurants, souvenir shops, Madame Tussauds and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Birdy1993
10,"Over crowded and rammed with hustlers , did not feel safe.","Huge let down this one. It is fascinating looking at the genuine stars immortalised . However the place gets rammed with punters which I understand , but also with hustlers trying to flog all kinds of crap and some being a little intimidating. One guy, allegedly a future rap star was trying to pass off CDs if him performing. The catch is you take one and they try to make you cough up 20-20 fillers for it. I politely declined and was then accused of racism, as he and I were of different race. I felt like telling him if he was Lionel Richie or George Benson I would have taken 20 off him but the whole vibe of the vicinity left me uncomfortable.Would avoid at all costs....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bigaitch27
20,Could be a nice place,"The stars are fun to walk about and check out. Sadly the area is a little sketchy, not very clean and lots of homeless people wandering about. Great to do once, but have your wits about you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/97happytraveler
40,Busy street!!,"Great to see the stars embossed into pavement, recon we chose the wrong time as the street was so busy it was near impossible to stop and take photos which was a bit disappointing.Looked around the shops and centre until dark. The main part of Hollywood Bvd was ok but the further down each end of the street you walked, the homeless appeared and things started to feel a little unsafe.Good experience but just be careful 👍",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyB5045
30,Really dirty and lots of homeless,I had no idea how dirty this section would be. It was really disappointing especially all the people begging and trying to pull a fast one. It was kinda scary.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baybug2012
30,Famous place to visit,"I was interested in going to the Hollywood Walk but was quite disappointed. We were accosted by persons selling things and wanting us to get our picture with them. When we said no, they were outspoken and rude.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurabP4074WL
30,Interesting but dirty,"Doing the tourist thing we had to check out the walk of fame but were fairly disappointed. Seeing the stars was fun, walking around the front of the Chinese and Dolby theaters was great, the stores in that area were cool too. That being said we found the area dirty and not very family friendly. Our kids are older teens so they were fine but just be aware L.A. has a major homeless problem. We never felt threatened but encountered a lot of panhandlers but more just high and mentally ill homeless. During the day the sidewalks are packed with tourists but we went early to try to see more stars and take pics and regretted it. People sleeping everywhere, store doorways, benches, sidewalks, on the stars, it was very sad. One other note, the celeb and costumed performers walking the strip we expected to be awesome and were totally ready to pay some for some fun pictures were a joke! Saw a couple good ones but overall looked like party city or home made crap. Disappointing.So it’s cool to see the iconic spots but definitely a one and done for us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeS787
30,"Iconic, but be warned","If you’ve never been to LA before then you should def visit the walk of fame. If like me you grew up in rainy UK dreaming of glitzy Hollywood then it is iconic attraction that would be sad to miss. But be warned it’s not classy and glamorous , it’s like stepping out of the tube into the chaos of Piccadilly Circus, but more tourists and people in fancy dress peddling photos. But seeing the stars is a must, it’s fun, and popping into the mall gives some great views of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikeyonhols
50,Amazing long walk to find the stars old and young!,Enjoyed a leisurely stroll spotting all the stars names and looking at the shops. Stopped for a great pizza and continued checking out the stars. Wear comfortable shoes!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gigle64
50,Loved it! Go early!,This was great! 2.5 miles of stars of some of your favorite celebrities. Go as early as you can to help avoid crowds. Find Muhammed Ali’s star and inquire as to why he’s not on the ground like others. Intriguing! Beautiful and a part of celebrity history!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelanieMcH
40,Won't hurt to visit,"It's one of the must visit sites in LA. Though there isn't really much to it than just the stars on the sidewalk, it's still worth the visit and won't hurt much to do. It's free anyway, unless you fall into the other tourist traps along Hollywood blvd like the museums that line it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eric821
50,Stars in Alignment,Always use google to locate the section your favorite star maybe located if you are just wanting to see that particular person or group. If you have the time and just want to site see you can spend a couple of enjoyable hours on the walk reviewing and taking pics of each star.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCDub6
30,Tourist trap,"We parked at the pay lot near Hollywood & Vine. We walked over 90% of the Walk of Fame. The kids were hunting for certian stars names but they got tired of it after awhile & started playing Pokemon Go. Lol. We stopped at Iguana Vintage Clothing, a couple of souvenir shops, Piehole, Dave & Busters & The Chinese Theater. Their interest peaked up when we were outside the theater. I noticed limited number of costumed people, which was a nice change over our prior visit. Unfortunately, the ridiculous number of sidewalk vendors made crowded walkways even more crowded. The number of homeless people seems to have tripled since our last visit 6 ish years ago & at times our teens felt unsafe. My husband & I never felt threatened though, but we wouldn't want to be there after dark.The only bummer was that Funko goes Hollywood isn't open yet. Our Baby Groot wanted to visit his Funko Family. 🤣The only le",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrymerry
10,Busy Chaos,Walking along the stars is chaos! Try to take a photo of your favorite movie stars star is a 2 second job because someone is likely to just walk in front of your camera or step on the name on the star. Some star are in bad condition. Many favorites not even there. The homeless lie along side the stars on the path. No l will not be recommending the walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boobs68
30,Still worth it even after all these years.,While we were there not only did we get to look for familiar names but the kids loved it because people dressed as super heroes were all over the place. I feel like it is a little bit tired looking though. A revitalization of that area could really be used.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seanaroundtheworld
40,A day exploring the stars!,"Looking for a vibrant place full of hustle and bustle? Then the Hollywood Walk of Fame is the place to be. Trying to get the perfect snap of a Star is hard work with the amount of people walking the streets during the day (in summer too) there is also lots of people dressed up in character suites to get photos with - don’t expect to walk around snapping pics of them though, they expect a few dollars in return (some demand a straight $5US). We saw bumblebee, superman, Spider-Man, iron man etc. There is also a number of street vendors selling everything from hot dogs and fruit to tees and caps! We also came across some fantastic singers busking in the street too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/270edenc
40,Touristy but why not!,"The Walk reminds me of NYCs Times Square but not as crowded. Can see the Hollywood Stars, Chinese theater, Jimmy Kimmel, El Capitan and a host of local artists/vendors and shops. Even if for a short while to take pics, go see it. It’s Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NMannersF
20,Crowded with Too Many Solicitors!,"We went to see the Chinese Theater and walk of fame stars, but got bombarded with people either wanted us to take fliers for their bus tour, superheros wanted to be in a photo (at a fee), vendors selling fresh fruit cups, etc. I compared this to NYC Times Square on steroids because of all this occurs within a short block in front of and near the Chinese Theater. I would not recommend this for families with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbird1015
20,Hollywood Walk of Fame....,"I visited the Hollywood Walk of Fame many years ago however, I believed this area was more visually appealing during that time. Unfortunately, the years have not been very kind to old Hollywood. I loved having an opportunity to see the stars of so many legends. However, the City of Los Angeles needs to do a better job with maintaining an area that is such a large tourist attraction. Again it was great to see the Hollywood Stars along the Walk of Fame and The Chinese Theatre however, for me this is not a must do activity unless you have extra time on hand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabrinak136
20,Simply put... meh.,"We found our way to the walk of fame via a parking garage - we were going to the museum of death down the street. Afterward we decided to walk around to find names for family that didn’t end up coming - and as you can probably tell, it wasn’t worth it. We even saw multiples of the same stars (Bing Crosby has at least three by my count). It’s dirty and crowded for much of it, and people are constantly screaming and trying to hand you stuff. Just don’t even try. There are more iconic (and fun) things to do in LA than this street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizamarsh
40,A visit to the Walk of Fame,I'm a native of Los Angeles and when I have visitors from out of town they all want to see the Chinese Theater and the Walk of Fame. I have lived in New York and it reminds me of Los Angeles rendition of Times Square. There is a little bit seedy . there are lots of improvements going on though. I would suggest that every tourist should see this at least once in their lifetime. But there are so many better places and sights to see in Los Angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5856OOdavidg
30,Was a crazy busy crowded mess,I was very disappointed with this it was so crowded you could barely see or read the stars and people were pushing and the crowd was just to much. The area is dirty and even saw a girl throwing up at the side of the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gayledubois
20,Dirty,The walk is dirty and there is a lot of people. It’s not a nice place to be. There are some cool places along the walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/407iselinh
40,"Out of memory, biased to being Swedish and from Europe.","Ingrid Bergman was nice to see. There was a man that guarded the Michael Jackson star which was decorated with red roses. In the very end of the street towards downtown you have the stars of Elvis Presley and The Beatles, next to each other. We were the only one there. The nicest stars were the four placed around a four way crossing presenting the men that landed on the moon 1969. Make sure to visit the Griffith observatory as well on the 50th year celebration of the moon landing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dansO6027DW
30,"We Came, We Saw, We're in No Rush to Go Back","Seeing the stars lining Hollywood Blvd just feels like the touristy thing you're supposed to do. Since we'd never been there, we decided to try it! Seeing the stars was pretty cool. Seeing the hand and feet prints at TCL Chinese Theater was even better. But the barrage of people trying to hand us ""free"" CDs (our tour bus driver warned us about that) and the people trying to get us to take their ""tours"" was really overwhelming. It's also dirty and smelly in some spots. Hollywood is not all that you see on tv, that's for sure. But we're glad we did this. We can say we got to be where the stars are!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacyL859
30,Grubby but ticked a box,"We went early in the morning which turned out to be a good plan. Parts of it were clean enough, but other parts were really dirty. There are a lot of homeless people lying on the streets. We managed to dodge a lot of the people selling tours, photos etc as we were early. Box ticked, no need for a return visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Julz862
10,So Disappointed,"I was so excited to visit the Hollywood walk of fame and I was prepared for it to be in a less than stellar area. However, I was not prepared the numerous tour guides trying to sell us a tour every few steps. I also was not prepared in advance with a map to be able to locate the stars I wanted to see. Unfortunately, the one star I was interested in is not there yet, Julia Roberts. That was disheartening but even if her star was there I would still have been disappointed just less disappointed.The souvenir shop was very useful and reasonably priced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mendez5plus1
50,Don’t Miss It!,So fun to walk along this iconic boulevard. Fun shopping and sights along the way. It really gives you the Hollywood vibe. Don’t miss it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baclifton
30,An over-rated tourist attraction,"Okay for a one-time visit just because of all the hooplah about it. However, this is a highly over-rated tourist attraction (in my humble opinion)! Just stars with famous names on a sidewalk -- and these are BOUGHT (for $40,000) by friends of talented people who nominate the person, who is then approved by an organization (I forget which). Of course, you need to have some basic talent in the field of Arts (e.g. Kim Kardashian was refused a star after someone nominated her). There are other historic Hollywood places in this area that are interesting to see like El Capitan movie theater, Dolby theater, Grauman’s Chinese theater etc., so a one-time visit is fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bbbass1

Not sure though the street selllers are improving accessibility now as congestion on sidewalk is crazy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/970darlenel
20,"overcrowded, overrated","We arrived to Hollywood Blvd before 8AM: a quiet but dirty street, where we could admire the stars but struggled to find a place for breakfast. Finally succeeded at the rise-n-grind. The stars were kind of interesting but not clean, and there were occasional hobos still sleeping on them. We then went on our 2 hour tour and came back to see the place hustling and bustling: touts selling yours, hawkers selling fruit, guys in superhero costumes hustling for pics and tips. Mass tourism at its worst.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimTerryIV
10,Over rated,"Once you seen a few stars the excitement is taken away by the filth of the place, dirty footpaths, vendors blocking the way with their food stalls and other dodgy stuff for sale. Grown adults dressed in pathetic super hero costumes trying to scam money out of unsuspecting tourists for a photo. The stench of cannabis all over the place puts you off walking anywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clayton_328
10,Horrible,Not worth a visit anymore. The street is sooooo crowded with cheap/fake souvenirs and sh**itty street show.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/icyicyicy
10,Sad juxtaposition,"We’d been told to not have high expectations of the Walk of Fame. However, I wasn’t ready for the very significant homeless and dirtiness of the area. The Hollywood Elite should be ashamed. The stars ought to be required to donate to a fund to support the homeless situation before they can be honored with a star. All that Fame & Fortune against the ugly backdrop of such human sadness was not what my family or I was expecting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyTime4usx4
40,A multicultural Mecca with a Hollywood flavour,"A unique experience for movie fans and immersion to LA culture. The walk give you a story of Stars in Hollywood, architectural relevance with the number of Art Deco buildings. Part of experience to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/921jpp
30,"Alright, chinese theatre was better","The walk of fame goes on for AGES. We enjoyed seeing it for a block or two, but it gets very overwhelming, as there are thousands of stars!

Worth a trip but don't go alone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprils213

50,Awesome!,"It was a 1 day walk at Hollywood that time with my friends. It is surrounded by souvenir shops and coffee shops. Don't forget to search for the star of your favourite famous actor, actress and singer. Don't forget to check the foot and hand mark famous people along the street. Don't forget to visit the Dolby building and the view to Hollywood logo at level three. Its a good place to visit and to shop as well. There were so many places to take photos, like a photo booth for keep sake. You can take photo also of some characters walking along the street. Its fun and good place to enjoy and feel the atmosphere of being famous😊",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheilaMalig

40,Stay away from costumed individuals,"This place brings you to most if not all the celebrity stars that ever existed.... be careful of the individuals wearing special costumes, don't take thwir photos unless you are ready to pay a few dollars for their pic...they will hound thru the streets if ever you refuse to pay. Just get it th3 Hollywood shops within the block and have your pix be taken qirh the predator, batman, King Kong or Elvis within the souvenir store... free of charge!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravenclawph2000

40,A walk amongst the stars,Before catching the open top city tour bus walk down the Hollywood walk of fame. Amongst the stars so so many of our favourite singers actors and more. Taking pictures with your fav stars is fun. You can even have your own star of fame on the walk. It's like a walk of discovery and so exciting with much fun. It was actually the best part of our tour of Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roam689776
20,Disappointing,"We walked from Hollywood and Vine to the Highland Center and back on the other side. It was sketchy, dirty, there was feces on the sidewalk at one point. I would think as prestigious as getting a star is, there would be a committee that keeps them clean. The old Hollywood theatres were cool to see, but surrounded by souvenir and tattoo shops, people in fake costumes posing for pictures for money, people trying to get you to take their CD, homeless, and a few people with questionable sanity. I'm glad we went during the day because it would have been scary at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnsGirl87

The street also have loads of shopping arenas so can buy some good stuff from their as souvenir.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/649ishas
10,Very sketchy,"Do not go here! It’s very tacky! Think a hood version of Las Vegas! Very scary, homeless people sleeping in the middle of the side walk, people scamming you into buying cds. Not what you think of when you think of “Hollywood Glamour”. It’s so sad. Someone needs to clean this place up. If you do decide to go, please keep children with you and don’t make eye contact with vendors. I was also almost pick pocketed by someone when my daughter was looking at necklaces. Such a shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsZ4189NT

40,Pretty Cool,"The Walk of Fame is a really awesome place to visit if you like doing the ""tourist-y"" thing. The are a lot of things to do and places to shop. It is really clean and fun. I took off one star for the crazy high prices for almost everything from food to souvenirs. Also, the really pushy tour guides are a bit annoying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vondiehmon
20,Taare zameen par,"Walk of fame is a normal street with an expectation, that famous Hollywood personalities name is written on stars shaped Tiles on the floor. This street is for Hollywood fans. But personally I feel names of such great personalities not be written on floors as you understand Taare Zameen Par . One can even find many attractions in this bustling street. There are also many museums present here.one can find many eating joints too. Just be cautious of pickpockets and people dressed as famous characters of Disney and marvel as they are their to earn extra bucks for their pics so just be cautious a handshake can cost you 5 dollars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/narendrermahajan
30,Meh,"Something you may have to do once if your in town, but overall, unimpressed. Sidewalk is ridiculously crowded, there’s a homeless problem, and it’s not as clean as you might expect. Is it cool to see stars names? Sure. It’d be cooler to see the stars, and not the ones dressed up asking for your money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660rickd
30,"Very touristy, crowded and generally overrated, but must see for many","Well, if you're set on visiting HWF, there is nothing to do about it - just go. Try not to do it on a weekend or during some holiday time. It's crowded regardless, but on weekends it gets unbearable. I'd also do it first thing am for the same reason. But if already made there, I'd suggest you get the ticks to go inside to the old theater, you go and see a long hall with the movie stars. Also, go upstairs, take some picks and of course find the bench with Hollywood sign view, take a pic and make a wish. This is not the place you'd visit twice, so make it worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lana_Calif
40,Good Visit,"I love the concept and trying to find the names of celebrities that I am familiar with. It is a little bit cumbersome because it is on a regular walking area, and the stars are split between both sides of the street. We had a great time trying to find the names though, and the experience in itself was wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arvian
30,Tourist trap,"It’s pretty good with some decent stores along the way however.....Far too many street ‘sellers’. CDs, food, general rubbish and constant hassle from them.It’s worth a visit but be prepared to be constantly approached by idiots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K8833GEdaveb
40,Hollywood have to do,As with the sign it is difficult to visit Hollywood without making your way to Hollywood Boulevard and viewing at least some of your favourite stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WiseTreeOwl
30,Hollywood walk of fame,"It's about a mile long walk. The stars are either facing you or turned the other way. They are on both sides of the street and up on Vine as well. It's very crowded so it can be a challenge to read them. There is a website that tells you where the stars are if you are looking for someone in particular. There was a movie premier going on when we were there so we didn't get to the end of the walk as it was closed off. It was rather neat to see especially when you spotted a ""star"" you may have forgotten about. (Christa)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidjensen399
20,Yuk,"Yuk - save the time and avoidIf you are interested in Amsterdam style coffee shops, aggressive tour tickets sellers, adults only shops and watching an overweight and underdressed audience ... you found an interesting streetNo cultureNo experienceNo beautyNo safetyNo visiting valueYou could actually make the idea of stars for stars an interesting Multimedia and multiethnic concept... but not like this seedy, awful and disturbing street ... never take kids there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LifelongExpat
40,Entertaining for an afternoon,This is a crazy place but it is part of the Hollywood experience. The street was clean with lots of good shopping and places to eat. We were even able to see a movie at the El Capital theater owned by Disney. It was amazing!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3sweetpeasmom
40,History Forgotten,"The Hollywood Stars was a big deal before Social Media, this was one of the ways fans could be close to Celebrities they admired. Today the Stars are just another Artifact that helps to cover the sidewalks. If you are able to see beyond the so visual homelessness that covers Hollywood, there are some historic buildings that will soon be gone, that represent the old Hollywood, that is worth seeing and visiting. Be sure to keep your purse on the lockdown and be aware of your surroundings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2019tobad
10,Not worth the hype,"While it was neat seeing our favorite stars on the walk at first, the walk itself is disgustingly dirty. There were numerous homeless people passed out everywhere (at 11 in the morning), most shops didn’t look tempting from the outside although I’m sure there had to be some nice ones. And to top it all off, a young man grabbed my young daughter’s face (who appeared to be special needs but obviously was not) and when I gently pulled her away from him, he grabbed my hands and gave me a hug, and swiped my wedding rings off my hand in the process! I know stupid, but I was trying to protect my child and give someone who appeared to need help. Lesson learned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heatherdQ5218HB
20,Under-impressed,"The street is rather unexceptional with average (at best or even below average) buildings/shops etc.Lots of shady characters, some homeless people. Just passed it in the car and didn't even want to stop having seen plenty from inside the car. If you are travelling by car you can just do what we did and see it on the way to better locations but I would not go there specifically just for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaximT5586
30,Hard to look at the stars in the evening.,I feel this is a location ppl don't make a big deal about anymore. They just walk on them and pass them as if it is just normal concrete. I felt like we where being rude to slow down and actually take the time to glance at them. If you want to browse try the AM time frame!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/145missyr
10,Not worth seeing,"Unless you just want to take a picture on the small “ Hollywood Star” strip, and to actually say you set foot on the strip, it’s actually worthless visit. This place used to be a great place to visit probably back in the 60s, but today, the place is very dirty and when I visited a few years back I was very disappointed. As many people look at the fact that HOLLYWOOD, where actors get to make their fortunes for us citizens buying and watching their movies, maybe they should put a few of their dollars making this liberal state of the art strip more appealing!!!VERY DISAPPOINTED and that’s why this time trip I did not waste my time driving there. It should also be noted that none of my family members advised me to visit this place as they also reside in California. So nothing improved since I visited years ago. VERRY DISAPPOINTED!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mo75jo
40,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"Honouring luminaries in Motion Pictures, Television, Recording, Radio and Live Performance since 1960, the Hollywood Walk of Fame includes both sides of Hollywood Boulevard from Gower to La Brea, also both sides of Vine Street from Yucca to Sunset, with approximately 2,400 stars.To identify the exact location of your favourite celebrities’ star, I recommend picking up a free brochure. These are available from most hotels in the area and will lead you to your dream photo opportunity much faster.Bustling with tourists and street performers, eateries, shops and surrounding museums, the iconic sidewalk is a must-see attraction if you’re visiting Hollywood for the first time - so don't forget your camera and a comfortable pair of shoes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_maka1620
40,Iconic Hollywood Blvd.,Such a fun iconic experience. Lots of fun street performers and delicious street vendors cooking along the way. The only retractions was that as we walked down the Blvd. we found many of the tour companies to be loud and invasive. Other than that definitely something that you should do at least once in your lifetime.Two additional things to know is that Graman’s Chinese Theater holds many famous footprints and The Dolby Theater is where they hold the Oscars and list all of the Best Pictures titles by year....so fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happy_Travels_CA
20,Disappointed!,I was disappointed to see how dirty the area is. There are a lot of street peddlers and transients. The stars are jot maintained. The streets are dirty. I expected a lot more from this attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3392RWdaniela

30,So crowded,It’s neat to see your favorites but it is crowded and overrun with costumed beggars and others peddling crap.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColbyHannah
30,Tourist Trap,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a popular destination when visiting Hollywood. Just walking up and down Hollywood Blvd is free. Along the walkway you'll see the stars' names along your journey. They aren't in any order, so finding someone you want to see can be tough. There are tons of street vendors and performers trying to get your attention, not to mention the beggars. The vendors and performers sometimes block your view of the stars' names on the sidewalk. I never felt unsafe, but we were careful to watch out for each other. I could see taking young kids here would be nerve-wracking. There are lots of souvenir shops along the walk. The Chinese Theater is where you'll see stars' hand prints in cement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/200brianq

My friends stayed at an air b and b that was amazing, never thought they could be so nice.( just incase it was at 1152 ogden in west hollywood) the best place ito park and walk is near the chinese theatre as the further east you go the less there is happening. June is gloomy in LA they call it june gloom but if you dont mind over cast then its fine. LA cools down at night so a sweater for after dark is always recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbarabuilder
30,"When they clean up Hollywood, it will be better.","Hollywood Blvd. once had some great places (C.C. Brown's is the most missed). Now a few places are worth a visit (Musso & Frank's, The Hollywood Roosevelt & Pantages). The Stars names may bring back memories but too many schlock shops and few of the old greats (Pickwick Books and theaters pre-shoe-box style).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeTom547
30,Star Struck,"The reality is you are looking at a star in the cement with a name on it. There are several (five) categories in which to qualify to earn a star: in radio, recording, motion pictures, television and/or live performance. Therefore, you will see some stars/names more than once, if the person so honored was active in more than one of those categories. They are in random order, some face one direction, where the next one might face the opposite direction. There are literally hundreds, so finding a specific one is a bit difficult without some type of map or guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimtZ7231HS
20,Waste of Time,The walk of fame is basically an excuse to get star struck tourists fleeced by low budget ‘homes of the stars’ tours and other assorted vendors crowding the sidewalks. There are much better ways to spend your valuable time during a trip to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcmooreiii

Parking is very hard to find and the cheapest one we found in the parking garage was $20. The whole area somehow feels dodgy and is very overcrowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Polishbenski
30,Underwhelming and Overcrowded,"I'm glad we saw it and even more glad I didn't have my young children with me.

I believe there are volunteers to look after them.If you are in Hollywood then you will probably walk over some of the stars on your travels. It was not quite what I expected. Many hawkers about trying to sell you things and tours you don’t want. Homeless laying on some stars. Very crowded during the middle of the day.Overall all it was ok, now I can say I have seen them.

Walk in front of Capitol Records and see all the Beatles immortalized on the sidewalk. Walk along the tourist memorabilia stores that are everywhere you look. You can also eat some mediocre tourist food on the boulevard.. checkout the old Graumanns theatre and try your hand and foot prints in the stars casting..you can sign up for a star tour bus ride to view famous homes... A one timer to be seen..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrk9789
30,Just like on TV - but expect to be hassled,Couldn’t come to LA and not do the walk of fame. I can’t believe how long it is - must be several miles in total! All your fave celebrities (and many more who I didn’t have a clue about).Only real negative is the street vendors trying to sell you tours constantly - cannot walk 10 steps without someone trying to sell you something.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joekerr23

10,Hollywood - Truly only the 1% live nice.,The stars wrap around for quite someways. Very disappointing to see many are filthy in areas of the town where you be hanging out as a tourist. The weed shops are not helping as there seems to be a lot of loitering now. Was walking down street and lady dropped her pants and started peeing all over the wall. The area has a lot of homeless people around begging for money. Disappointing and would be embarrassed to have my name on one in half the parts of town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M-P-E-06
30,Iconic Street,"Pros: The street is an iconic place full of famous stars on the ground, which is pretty nice to see. Cons: be prepared to be disturbed all the time by street people dressed in costumes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/777robsons
40,iconic,"You certainly can't miss this on a trip to LA. Start at the Chinese Theater and at least walk that block on both sides of the road. The further down you walk, the dirtier and trashier it gets. If you love crowds, going toward the evening would be best and if you hate crowds, go around 8am. Most stores don't open until 10am. By noon it's pretty crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorig689
10,We drove past it!,"Seriously, there was garbage everywhere. And some homeless people bumming around. My friend who lived there told me and my sister not to get out because we looked to touristy and would probably get pickpocketed. So yeah we just looked from afar. Completely unsafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/15kristaw
30,Not all that....,"It's neat, and on a happening street, but kinda dirty and congested....but is part of the Hollywood experience. If you're big into celebrities, then this could be fun. Much to see and do on the strip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JourneyIM
30,Could be so much more,"To be honest. I don’t think reading bad reviews about the the walk of fame would of deterred me from going to visit it for myself.Sadly, The magic of seeing some of my favourite stars along the walk Soon disappeared when I was overtaken by the filthy sidewalk and the overwhelming smell of urine and the great un-washed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatalieN750
30,Cool,"Cool to look at everyone's names etc, but you have to walk down boulevard, and it is gross. Jump out of car, run and take pic, get back in your car!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb887
20,Don’t waste your time.,"My husband and I visited Hollywood to see the Walk of Fame during our first trip to LA, because we figured it was an iconic part of the area. I wish we had read these reviews first! What a disappointment.The area feels surprisingly sleazy and dirty. About every 20 feet, we were stopped by pushy salespeople who would try to convince us to take sketchy looking bus or van tours around the city. I get that these people are doing their jobs, but it did not make for an enjoyable afternoon.You have endless entertainment options in Los Angeles. Unless you REALLY have your heart set on touring the theaters or seeing a particular celebrity’s star, I would recommend finding another activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margarettravels1
30,Kind of so-so,"It's an interesting idea but hard to really take in since you are walking while looking down. Also, sometimes it is so crowded you can't really take it in. I would recommend looking while you can-if you can do it safely. Not worth a trip just for the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1187HBlisag
20,Really,Many in poor repair and a sleazy place to walk around. Disappointing given the image of Hollywood. Plenty of souvenier shops cashing in on its reputation are also quite dubious. Not worth the effort.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barossa-Epicure
30,A star or two,Not what I was expecting at all the stars are very dirty and some times couldn't see who they were but there was lots and lots to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404christiner404
40,Snap Some Photos & Get Some Walking In,"Overall, it's a surface-level attraction. The stars line the sidewalks and there's plenty of hustle and bustle. I'm not a huge fan of street performers, so I keep my hands down and try not to make eye contact. You do see several landmarks as you wander like the Egyptian Theater, The Chinese Theater, and Hollywood & Highland. In between, there are tons of gift shops and restaurants. You can spend a lot of money while you're here, but we spent our time just looking around and taking some photos. Luckily, we were staying nearby and didn't have to drive and park. The traffic was manageable, but heavier than I'd want to deal with. This was my first visit to LA and I can't imagine not visiting, but it isn't a deeply moving experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/974lindsayb
20,Disappointing,"I had this image of the walk of fame as be somewhere special what a disappointment it’s dirty, homeless people everywhere, Takey souvenir shops. LA should really clean this area up !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisR265
20,Too many Scammers,"Disappointed the first time going here. There are too many people who tries to get friendly then tries to take the picture with you or sh*tty rappers who tries to sell you their cd then gets pushy and gets mad when you refuse to give them money.So anyone who goes here, just a tip. Ignore all those people on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReC1324
50,Got my steps in and more,"Very cool experience. Some names are repeated which was strange but over all if you got a couple hours its definitely a workout that's fun. if shopping , go down little farther prices get better",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0denisef
40,Still a must-see,"Finding the stars, you'll pass all kinds of other landmarks, such as the Chinese Theater, the El Capitan, and the Dolby. You'll also pass all kinds of things that AREN'T landmarks. To save time, spend a few minutes at the official website; they list the street addresses of each star, and you can go straight to your favorites. On the other hand, just wandering has its attractions; you can deal with the street performers who doubtless dream of their own star, and you can read names who won't ring a bell for anyone but the most devoted media fanatic and ponder the fleeting nature of fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CareyMartin
10,Sadly this is a PASS,"I spent a considerable amount of time and $ on an uber from Santa Monica just to see the famous walk of fame and get a photo of Maryiln's star. Turns out this is a very scuzzy area, homeless guy laying on her star infront of a McDonalds.There are so many neat things to do in the LA area don't waste a moment here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msmyka
10,ANARCHY!,"The element crawling here is alarming, Complete anarchy...drugs, prostitution, public urination. Doesn't seem safe here at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quest630575
40,Walk the stars of fame,It cover a huge area so you can't see it all but great fun seeing all the fifferent names. Be careful there are a lot of street ventures.Saw the Chinese theatre which is set back and not that big and with all the vendor carts you can walk straight pass it.Be care with the different vendors prices they change dramatically.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenwR1075QV
40,Too busy,Always wanted to walk on the Walk of fame but was too busy with a young child. Also was too hot and hectic but at least I seen it 😉,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10zsus
50,A fine place to walk on the stars,"This is a major attraction in Hollywood. You can walk along the blvd. and see the names of many of Hollywood's great. Unfortunately, this has also become a bit political with some people not appreciate the star of Trump.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/494samuelm
40,Time well spent,It is a good place to spend some time. You can look for the name of your favourite star. You can visit Dolby Theatre and Chinese Theatre while of this street. There are lot of shops for souvenirs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaithiliSave
40,Good way to spend a few hours,"Each time we went to Hollywood Blvd., we chose a different block to check out the stars. I don't think we would have dedicated a full day to this but it was fun to look at the stars while on our way to do other activities. I will have to say, I did not expect to see some of the stars in disrepair and others in need of a good cleaning. To see them in that state was a bit disappointing but overall it was a good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sugar04
50,In Hollywood? why would you not go here!,"Lucky that our son lives in Hollywood so have walked parts of this stretch of footpath a few times. It is a long walk if you want to see all the stars. The busiest area is around the Chinese theatre. Be prepared here to be amongst crowds with hardly a chance to get a photo beside a star. If you can get there in the early morn, when hopefully the crowds are less. You can walk into the mall area and see the Hollywood sign in the distance. We have found that an Uber is a cost effective door to door service (no worrying about parking and driving around this busy area).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharpeze
30,Walk of Fame a bit crowded,"The walk of fame is really crowded. There a numerous hot dog vendors, performers and some people asking for money. Maybe it was the time of day we were there 1:30pm-2:30pm but it was difficult seeing all the stars.I suggest going during a time that maybe less crowded.You can have your name on a blank star, but check the price. On one side of the street the guy charges $5 on the other side $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acostajesusb
40,Walk of fame,"Yes, I was the pure tourist and took pictures. Not too many regulars taking pictures but of course I was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fionaseamus
20,Tours,Can you tour the inside of the movie stars houses? I’ve never been on a tour of la . I was just curious.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rhondatravler1
30,"Neat, but difficult to see!","I’d say for all the hype of this “activity” it certainly is difficult to even see the stars. If you come during high tourist season, there are so many people that it is difficult to actually “see” the stars. The stars are on BOTH sides of the street & face different directions. So one has to be looking at the ground, while navigating tons of people & not watching where they are going .....all the things we are taught NOT to do as children! If you find someone’s “Star”, you might have to wait a few minute to have it clear so you can take your photo. Overall, it’s still worth viewing Hollywood Blvd., which captures the essence of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DisneyCruisingFamily
50,Very Interesting,It's fun to walk along and look at the different stars. It's enjoyable remembering the stars from past times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/220kenq
30,Interesting 2+ Mile Walk,"Not easy to Park and walk! We had directions for 2 hrs free in a shopping center mid-day, but couldn't get in easily due to Hollywood Blvd being closed for the ""World Premier"" that night. Paid $25 to park in the middle of the ""stars"" and walked them all, about 2+ miles! My g'daughter wanted to see Elvis & Beatles, both near Hollywood & Vine where the 4 statues of the award are.My 11 yr old g'daughter was excited to be in Hollywood and see all of the stars, plus characters from the movie premier that night. Worth 1- 2 hrs if you are in the area.But neither of us (I'm 70) knew most of the people on the stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bchgrl9
50,Where is Jennifer Lawrence Star?,"The actress is the biggest of nowaday, but she did not get her own yet. The Walk of Fame it self is cool, and actually, even living in L.A. I always get my attention fully draw by the stars on the floor. I do not know why, maybe because I am a person who likes to have full control over situations, so I want to know everything that is happening there, I mean, all names I am passing by. That area of Hollywood is amazing during Friday and/or Saturday late night due to the night clubs. The sidewalks turns into a place full of interesting and varied people, different from the tourist types during daytime. But there are still some unrespectful ones. Once a guy tried to beat me up with a nucklebrass because I crossed to the other side of the sidewalk passing in front of his ""girl"". So he made me apologize twice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcosladarense
40,Great to see!,"Lots of stars with famous names along 2 sides of the road. Great to see. Came across many of my favourites. Different to what I had imagined. Disappointed to see lots of Afro Americans trying to sell fake cd’s, this really spoils it. Something else ticked off my bucket list! Worth visiting if you’re in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamelaM1412
30,Just stars on a sidewalk,"This area is always packed with people, but if you have time and want to see your famous names in the walk of fame, it's something to get done, plus they have a mall nearby and other cheap shops. There's also hands and footprints of handpicked celebrities at the Chinese theater, next to walk of fame. It's something to say you did it but it's not very enjoyable being it's a high tourist area and alot of haglers will walk up to you trying to get your money for something they have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackiesN2826DN
30,Ho-Hum...,"It’s a sidewalk! In front of general stores one shops at. I get the history of it, and that part is pretty cool. But it’s just a sidewalk. And if you’re not careful, collisions are in your future!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinman59
50,Something to tick off your list!,"+ There's so many more stars than I imagined.+ Brings a lot of nostalgia seeing names that you've forgotten about over the years.+ It takes you past iconic buildings along the way, as well as glimpses of the Hollywood sign.+ It's free, and you can easily get your steps in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cartarino
10,unsafe street,"The street is unsafe to walk. It's not a safe environment for visitor groups with 4 or less.While we're walking to next attraction store during day time, many African Americans came surrounded us and forced us to buy their fake CDs and didn't let us go. We had to deal with this for about 10 minutes till found a way to escape. At the same time, there were another 3 groups visitors with 4 or less people each got attacked by them.Will never go there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/klwest111

40,Our review,"This was an experience we wanted to see having seen it on the tv so often. I think the old style hand prints and foot prints more interesting than the more modern designs .the area is really packed making it difficult sometimes to look at what you want . Parts of the area are old and tatty but just enjoy what you can see, after all parts of it are really old .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladybanker55
30,Hollywood boulevard,"This was my second visit,so I knew what to expect,but my brother in law and his partner hadn't,we took the metro red line from downtown to Hollywood (that's an experience in itself !!!!) You get hassled a little with people dressed as super heroes looking to get fotos taken with them,but they got to make a living so a few dollars is no big deal,don't stray too far from the central area as it gets a bit seedy but it's somewhere you got to see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F3862LKmichaeld

20,Not what we expected,"My wife and I were looking forward too walking the countless stars and taking a few pictures. However we were hassled every twenty metres to do some sort of tour, dodging rubbish and random drunk people. It was almost like visiting a third world country where beggars are everywhere. Parking was pretty good though, gentleman let us park for free and gave us some tourist advice.Unfortunately very disappointed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SA_Russell74
40,"Must See, just be vigilant","Of course the Hollywood Walk of Fame is a must see when on Hollywood Blvd, just watch out for all of the other characters that are around and happy to take your money for pictures, etc! It's nice to walk up and down to see them all. I found some of my favorites out of the overcrowded areas :) Don't forget to see the hand & foot prints in front of the Grumman Chinese Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamieM459
30,Interesting - in Good and Bad ways,"We loved walking the Walk of Fame and seeing all the names on the stars, but poverty and homelessness are making themselves known in this area. In two days, on two different occasions, we witnessed an arrest of a half naked man and a man pleasuring himself on the street. While mental illness and homelessness go hand in hand, it feels as if a bigger police prescience would keep this tourist area safer for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/348emilyl
30,Crowded,"My daughter loved the stars. Some of the street performers in Superman, etc costumes were very pushy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/omjourney
30,Not What Expected,"We walked a good distance of this, and were surprised at how dumpy this is. The stars are not in that great of shape, and there are lots of homeless in the area, one who approached our 15 year old daughter talking to her about having sex. We felt uncomfortable. The streets of Hollywood & Highland are where most of the street shows are. I HATE snakes, and there were people walking around with snakes on them. Being crowded makes it very uneasy wondering who you might bump in to. We even had to pull our children away from an area that a homeless man was dancing with his private parts shaking around. I don’t know, this is not what we expected. LA is very dirty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanbeckyj

40,Cool experience,"Need experience to see all those stars on the ground. There are over 2300 of them you can view several blocks. Its definitely a very touristy area so be aware of scammers. There are several people who claim to be musicians handing out cd for donations, but they are actually blanks. And don't ask for pictures with the people dressed up unless you expect to tip. Nothing is for fee so don't be a sucker. There are several cool stores, with cool stuff for $5.00 or less items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishb771
20,Not what I expected,"Don’t quite know if i had my expectations set to high however this place was a dump. Lots of mentally ill, high and homeless line the street. Some parts are nicer than others but it really isn’t a place for kids especially in the evening, seen one homeless man run up to a family with kids barking and trying to scare the kids. Unfortunately I was let down by the place. Needs a major overhaul to become something as good as it’s made out to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidjwgl1878
10,One of the Lousiest place in Los Angeles,"Dirty, a lot of street peddlers, super crowded. The stalls are on the wake of fame right along the stars...!!!! What nonsense. This street should be cleaned up and reorganised by the authority. It is already difficult enough for tourist to get to this stupid location and such a poor atmosphere doesn’t improve it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElvinW26
30,Not what I expected,"While it was cool to see all the stars, I was taken aback with all the street performers. People are out there trying to make money by selling food, asking for money for you to be able to take their pic with them like Spiderman or Batman. Some people have CD's and want you to support their music-which our tour guide told us not to take because it usually is a blank CD. Just not what I envisioned it to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liondalou

40,To be seen. That’s it.,"If you have a « grand idea » about Hollywood, the « grand idea » might shrink when you see the reality... Ok... IT IS THE HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD with its ca. 2600 stars on the walkway. Maybe we were having a too much high idea about this « Boulevard » which turns out to be a normal street of about 1-2 miles long, highlighted by a lot of neon lights, more or less crazy street artists, unnumberable souvenir shops... In our personal opinion it’s just worth 45 minutes of our time, strolling around to find the stars of our favorite movie stars - and you proceed without regrets...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stoffel1953

30,Interesting to say you did it...,"Felt like you had to stop and see the walk of fame if you were in the area, so we did. Parked on a side street right by Hollywood & Vine and started walking. We walked all the way down to the Dolby Theater, which was cool because they just had the award ceremonies the night before and all the tents and red carpet and everything was still set up. The walk itself is fun in that you are looking for names of stars you recognize, (and I was really touched by some like the one for the Apollo XI astronauts) but you are walking through some really seedy areas, and about every block you are accosted by people trying to sell you a tour package. That got old very quickly. But now we can say we did it, so check that off the list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worleybird98

30,You are going to do this if you are here,"If you visit Hollywood Blvd then you are going to see the Hollywood walk of fame. It’s nothing exciting but it is kind of fun.

While the street is lined with taco bars, souvenir shops, and smoke shops it is safe to walk despite the homeless issues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFloFlyer
50,"Lots of fun, goes for miles","We did the walk a couple of times, just seeing the stars on the walk of fame and taking photos for our memories. We also enjoyed the people watching, the sights in the area and the exercise we got from walking around. Heaps of fun! You hear about it, but its a must see experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarinnaCraig
50,The streets of many stars,What a fun day looking for some of our favourite stars of today and yesterday. Be prepared to do a fair few miles if you have specific stars you wish to find! Definitely worth a look as it’s a must do in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evo_321
30,Free activity,It’s worth a look if only to get your step count up. Just over 2.4 miles if you walk both sides so wear some comfy shoes!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beas006
30,An interesting tourist attraction,Once seeing it is enough Loads of tourist groups from all over the world and tourist trap entertainment on the street Go once. No need to return,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ohnosoho
10,Don't believe what you see on TV!,"I am a California native, born and raised. I have taken tons of family over the years to Hollywood and the Walk of Fame and let me just say that each time I visit, I grow more and more embarrassed. Hollywood is a MAJOR tourist trap. It's ugly, and it's dangerous and it smells. The homeless and panhandler issue is rampant. There are people who are on drugs dancing on the sidewalks, there are pushy tourist bus salesman, independent movie ""characters"" asking to take pics with you for a fee, the traffic is ridiculous, both foot traffic and street. I avoid this area at all costs, unless we have visitors who want to take photos by the stars belonging to their favorite actors. But even the stars are not maintained, the floor is dirty and it's hard to get a photo without 20 people in your background shot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/work2travel05
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"I loved the experience, just wished I had more time to see them all. It was especially nice to see the option of having personal temp stars made for a small fee. It made the experience more interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad655680
30,Go once,"You’re in LA, then you have to go see this... in the day, and not talking to strangers. It’s a pretty sketchy area, but is worth seeing once to say you’ve been there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeraKi25
40,Enjoyable Walk,"Nice to walk in the morning from 9:30am - 11:00am. Not too crowded yet. However, it is also entertaining to walk here at night when the whole areas are lighted up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Im_77MT
30,Go in the Morning!,"I mean, it’s a thing you gotta do at some point of an LA trip right? I’d been to LA many times but it was only recently I’d finally walked the “Walk of Fame.”We went on the walk both at 8 AM (killing time after breakfast) and around 2:30 PM (killing time before dinner). The experiences were night and day. Frankly I hated the 2:30 PM experience. The street is jam packed with tourists, performers, cops, crazies, etc. In the morning we had the place to ourselves. We got as many great pictures as we wanted and could view everything at our own leisurely pace.I don’t know that’d I’d drive and park to see this site. However, if you happen to be staying at a close hotel like we were definitely check it off your bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinestaszko

20,Seedy,"Many think a visit to Hollywood will provide an opportunity to run into movie stars. Hollywood is really not that nice a place. There are some highlights like Grummans Chinese Theater and shopping at Hollywood and Highland, but walking around the stars is not that great. Most of the stores are cheap T-shirt places and its crowded. If the teenagers have to go, realize parking is expensive. Take the metro for easy access to get there and out as quickly as possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MDSTJ
50,A place to be,You can't visit LA without doing this walk. Go there and keep looking for your fav stars! Also pay a visit to the famous Chinese Theater.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vf71

30,Do your research beforehand,"It’s less exciting and pristine in real life, but still a nice thing to check off the bucket list. Be sure to check the directory with your fave stars’ locations beforehand, as the Walk is loooooong - over 2000 names!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janelledazzlepants

40,Right Along Hollywood Blvd.,"This is really interesting as the stars are honored for accomplishments in various fields, such as TV, where the plaque is marked with rabbit ears. I am sure that younger people would not have an idea. Some stars are well known and some stars are blank to be used in future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiketoeatCincinnati
10,I Dread When Visitors from Out of Town Want to Go Here...,"Hollywood is not a jewel any longer, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame is dirty and crowded with ""characters"" who want money for a picture with them. Ugh!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearless730216
40,"Nothing like Photos, but Good to See",The walk of fame is absolutely nothing like what you see in celebrity photos or online. The stars in the busiest areas aredirty or cracked and some are outside really tacky shops. However when you learn the history about why some are placed were they are it is really quite interesting. It’s also something you have to say you’ve seen if you go to LA! However it goes on for miles! We probably didn’t even see the half of it! Overall I’d say lower your expectations about it if you go to see them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmsSher
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame!,"We really enjoyed this walk as part of our tour of Hollywood. Our guide dropped us here for 40 minutes, which was sufficient for us to find the stars of famous celebrities we like. We were told to ignore people who try to stop you and concentrate on looking at the stars. Such a fun thing to do! Glad we came!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Epicureandelite
10,What a disappointment .. Nothing like the TV,"It’s nothing like on tv. We walked down one side and all you could smell was marijuana. It maybe legal in California (I’m unsure) but walking around probably one of the busiest tourist attractions in LA with young children isn’t right.It was rife with people on spice. Some security guards from the mall next to the Chinese theatre came out and moved them on. There was no police around. Then you had the street vendors selling stuff on the side. Some of them had their carts over some stars. When you asked them to move the cart so you could take a photo, they would try and hustle you to buy something first to move. WTF?A lot of the stars are duplicated along the sidewalks also. Generally it was a massive let down. We walked down one side and then went into a bar. Had a drink, fed the kids and took an Uber back to the hotel.If I did go back to LA, I will be avoiding this completely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/huggybearversion1
40,Goes on forever,"I visited the Hollywood Walk of Fame in April 2018. I parked in a parking garage near Hollywood and Vine and walked along Hollywood Boulevard. It was really crowded with tourists and very active. There are many shops, attractions and restaurants. The stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame go on forever. Near Grauman's Chinese Theater is a special area with stars which is roped off. There is also the famous area with the handprints and autographs in cement of famous stars. All in all a very good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blairkk25
30,Worth seeing,"We debated visiting the Hollywood stars due to the bad reviews but we were glad we did. Sure we encountered homeless, peddlers and many people trying to sell stuff but just say no thanks and keep walking. Many reviews said the area is dirty and I can see how it does seem dirty in some areas but it’s no worse than Times Square in NYC. We parked in a parking structure and it was simple to walk around. We probably only spent an hour walking around but it was still a good stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellen055
40,You just have to,"This is really a must-see when visiting Hollywood - it’s the iconic symbolism of the stars of past and present. Obviously it’s a free attraction and you can spend as much or as little time as you want perusing the various stars. Keep in mind the stars go on for many blocks, on both sides of the road - and up side streets too.My tip would be if there is any star you are particularly looking for, make sure you find out exactly where it is before heading out. I looked for the star of Rosalind Russell. I knew the rough area and despite looking for a good 15 mins, I never found it!The only reason I have voted it 4/5 is that some of the stars on the side streets don’t seem to have been cleaned recently which seemed a little sad for those being remembered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rozb545
40,Must see,It was great being there and seeing all the Stars Names. But don‘t go there on the weekend! 25000 Stars so far on the Walk of Fame is crazy and needs a map to find the stars u want to take a picture of!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/298j_rnp
40,Famé personified,"If someone has to see what fame means must visit this place . There are stars as seen in the pictures in the name of all the famous Hollywood stars cost each one USD 40000. The red carpet during oscars is all seen here. Also the foot & hand prints of the stars is worth noticing . Slum dog millionaire , thé Indian film which won the oscars in 2008 has a mention here as seen in the photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sagareeka

30,Look up Key parts before you go,There are only about 3 blocks of the 10 that are worth a visit. Unless you want to go inside of each attraction you could enjoy it via tour or car and you wouldn’t miss a thing. If you’re traveling with small children I recommend this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traceychristian100
30,"Kind of have to, but...","...all the ”performers” working the street can be a bit much. For instance, saying no to a ”free” cd can earn you an offencive comment (its because im bl..k isnt it).Well your a tourist and everyone and thier dog wants your dollars, so put on your best smile and just endure.Its also a bit run down, the sidewalk is cracked and some stars are even broken. Seems noone cares, like with the rest of the city.. its chipped, broken and dirty.Been there, Done that.. never ever going back..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/969patrikh
20,An Overrated Sideshow with Shady Con Artists,"I arrived early in Hollywood to see Les Miserables at the Pantages so I decided to walk down the street from there to the Chinese Theater and back to pretty much pass the time. Honestly, I have no idea why people would consider this one of the ""signature"" attractions of the city when there's way better things to do in LA.While there is some cool Hollywood Golden Age architecture from the 20s and 30s to see while you're walking (one of the reasons I didn't rank this lower) and it is interesting to see some names I recognize every now and then, I wouldn't call this the main attraction that everyone needs to see whenever they visit LA. It just feels like a glorified sideshow to the real attractions, some of which line the road like the Chinese Theater, El Capitan and Pantages.Some of the stars are pretty beaten up and the businesses are a bizarre mix of tourist merch stores, dingy porn/tattoo shops, and glittering neon-drenched edifices reminiscent of Times Square (particularly on the intersection of Hollywood and Highland). Once you get closer to the Chinese Theater, it gets VERY crowded with tourists and shady characters in unconvincing costumes and ""upcoming rappers"" trying to sell you blank CDs.If you're a tourist visiting LA I would strongly recommend other attractions like the Getty, Griffith Observatory, Huntington Library, Universal Studios, Walt Disney Concert Hall, etc. but if you really want to spend time at the Walk of Fame, I can't stop you but I will recommend that you don't spend too long here and always be on your guard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014

30,Busy and crowded,"Lots of stars on the pavement. That's about it. The boulevard itself is very crowded and noisy, so if you want to get a good picture of the star of your favourite star, you'll have to be either very lucky, or liking one of the stars at the very end of the boulevard (where people don't go as much).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/999olympiab
30,Not like in the movies,"This is very busy, crowded and loud. It is the West Coast version of Times Square. There was street vendors, performers, wanna-be rappers and anything else you can think of. The stars are hard to see because of the crowds, but it’s iconic Hollywood, so if crowds and noise don’t bother you, stop by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yazdragonfly
20,Not great,"It's ok. I think you have to see it if in Hollywood. But not glam, lots of street food which is great but people giving you Cds then asking for money. If you want a picture with a character dressed up again it's costJust not as I thought this was going to be. Very busy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/375chloes

30,"Touristy, tacky but something of a must see","It's such an iconic place that no visit to LA would really be complete without spending a bit of time wandering around the Walk of Fame area. It is something of an assault on the senses what with the all street food vendors, the hawkers plying their goods and sadly a lot of homeless people. Spotting the stars in the pavement is interesting but with so many people milling around you have to be quick with your camera to get a clear shot. There are lots of shops and clothing outlets selling a whole host of souvenirs so there is no shortge of choice. When we there we saw a number of people dressed up in character such as Superman, Batman & Marilyn Monroe but they will expect you to pay to have your photo taken with them so be warned. Very much a must see sort of place but for me one visit will be more than enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colehillc
10,Avoid,"The worst part of our trip to the USA.I grew up thinking this was Hollywood... it’s not. The stars may come here out of obligation but they run far, far away once that’s done.This place is an absolute sleaze filled dive designed to scam and rip off u suspecting tourists.The amount of drugs, violence, prostitution and scamming we saw in 2 hours on a weekday was enough for us to give up. The street is neglected, a real disservice to the stars too.The Lyft drivers warned us not to go and told us we would be fools to go at night (we didn’t luckily).... it’s filthy, disgusting and embarrassing. Must avoid!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J3674BZchriscappola

20,I get excited when I see names of celebs,"I get excited about the names on the stars, but it’s also overwhelming because of how the residents and tourists treat the stars. Cracks, trash, and gum...oh my! LA must do something about the homeless population. It made me sad to walk around. I’m so privileged that I have the means to travel and do things, but I was humbled during my visit to LA, and it’s not a feeling I was expecting to have when I’m trying to visit the Bette Midler Star. :/ please take care of one another.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brichardsonville

40,Find your Stars!,"It's a long stretch and it is exciting to keep looking for your favorite stars along the walk. Best to come over during late afternoon as the sun can melt you if it's summer. A lot of attractions, souvenir shops along the way - careful of those personalities posing as your fave characters, you might be forced to pay for a photo with them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BBaylon
50,Go and see your favourite stars,"The walk of fame was a great experience to see. Over 2000 stars to view on one street with pavements either side.

10,Dirty and smelly!,"Hollywood would have to be one of the dirtiest and smelliest places we've ever been!I understand homelessness is a real issue in LA, you see it everywhere, but here there are so many people begging for money and sleeping (and toileting) in the streets, it's really uncomfortable to be in.Everywhere you walked smelt like urine, and you couldn't avoid walking through pee puddles, no matter how hard you tried!The stars on the Walk of Fame were interesting, but the footpaths were dirty, the stars were dirty, and the whole experience was very underwhelming.The best part is we can at least say 'been there, done that', but we would definitely not go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathymL9202IC
10,"avoid, just avoid, do not waste your time","After a long road trip in the USA where we saw 7 natural parks and 3 wonderful cities we thought what was the worst place we've seen in our entire trip.

If zero stars would be possible...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johngreen90211

Once is good enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamiesadventures86
40,Fun/ shopping/ eats,The Hollywood walk of fame is very close to the big hollywood sign everyone is familiar with. Take pictures with fun characters from the movies and enjoy shopping and lots of variety of eats!!! You can also book different tours from this location if not done in advance. Parking is easy to find depending also when you go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maanay10

30,Ok to visit,There is nothing great at this place. If you love art and stars then probably you can still enjoy. We got bored reading the names and trying to locate the known names. Apart from that this place offers plenty of tour to beverly hills and to me that was more scenic and majestic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveller_00727

50,Must see place!,"I have been there once before with my brother, but this time I was with my husband. It is quite an interesting place, rather reading the names of the Hollywood stars. Mostly, it is interested to me when reading and seen the stars that I know and like the most!It is a must see place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jayaseeli
30,Disappointing,"Have to say that I was really disappointed with this 'attraction', many stars could not be seen due to street sellers and 'performers' which appear to have set up ad hoc in very inconvenient places ! It's very very busy in some parts due to general footfall so would advise going earlier in the day to see as many stars as possible. The stars stretch for miles so please be mindful that some areas along the route are less celubrious with many people begging and struggling with homelessness.Word of warning, dont except CD's from people selling on the street, locals advised most were blank and be very careful about having your photo taken with 'superstars' on the street they can demand large amounts of money and can be very unpleasant if you protest !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A4421YArebeccaa
30,Great Nostalgia - Scuzzy Neighborhood,"I was born and raised here. I know Hollywood. I have had great times in Hollywood, seen great bands, danced the night away, seen amazing performances and laughed my head off seeing some fo the greatest comedians. I love Hollywood nostalgia. And Hollywood is ugly and dirty and filled with so many hawkers that it can drive you crazy.All that to say, if there is a star's name that you really want to see, and you find yourself in the general area, go see the star and dream about them and remember their great contribution to the industry. But, please, if you are from somewhere else and think that this is a destination spot, you will be greatly disappointed. You have been warned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alexander_Designs

40,Fun!,This trip was very fun but crowded of course. We were able to see many of the stars we love. We also saw many people selling different things and acting. This was a very exciting trip but you might have to park a little far away from the walk of fame because of how crowded it is.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sahaipanton
30,Mildly interesting.,"OK - it's a famous place with loads of hype so it's kind of neat to walk on those stars... but that said, for someone who does not recognize many names it was kind of lame. There weren't too many people so it was possible to simply walk along and note the names. We were able to track down John Wayne for my husband LOL. If there's a particular name you're interested in finding I would grab the location ahead of time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lad0206
30,Average at best,"Dirty, seemed like a bit of a dodge place in the day time with homeless people everywhere and drug users too, I know cannabis is legal here but it stank everywhere, there were people smoking joints on most corners.Not a place I'd visit again and definatley not a place to visit alone or at night unless you like being mugged",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rayuk81
30,"Famous place, but a bit dangerous","Is a MUST when you go to LA, but is too dangerous once night falls. There’s a lot of vagrants.

30,Not as hype as they make it out to be.,We were all excited about going but it was not all we expected. The strip with all the stars was not as clean as I expected. The homeless people were much better to be around. Than those who were smoking marijuana in public. The smell was horrible and I was ready to go shortly after arriving. You also see various tour guide people trying to convince you to go on their tours. I was told that it’s semi dangerous not to go in the evening. So I’m glad we went during the day. Overall it was a decent experience but not sure if I would want to go back. The few blocks I saw were enough to last a lifetime. You can get some view of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/930sylviag

40,Iconic Landmark.,"You can't visit L.A. without doing the walk. The stars go on for miles, there is 2600 of them apparently. A bit of trivia, it costs the recipient of a star $40, 000 to have it !! They have to be nominated too..!Area along the walk a bit tacky to be honest, and loads of people trying to get your money.Be careful if you pose for a picture with Superman/Elvis/Jacko...They all want a tip, and quite aggressive they can get too..also look out for guys giving out CD,s, they can be quite intimidating when asking for cash.Plenty of tacky gift shops along the way, but that's to be expected. Despite the negatives, it's worth a visit. Some good places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foster1965
40,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"Ok Um, its a must do one time tourist kinda thing......I was surprised at the lack of stars that were on this Blvd.-there has to be another street with stars names...? There are alot of street vendors and people in costumes-but, if you talk to them, they want a tip. They purposely get your attention and try to entertain you-then they want a tip-so if you dont want to tip someone in a ripped up old costume-LOOK THE OTHER WAY WHEN THEY WALK YOUR WAY =) There are a lot of homeless people(GOD BLESS THEM) on this street..... a lot of the same shops after awhile - gifts and gag gifts and um gag clothing stores....The Dolby and Chinese theaters are here-I suggest you tour those places and the 4 story shopping mall area. Also the TMZ tour bus is FUN or at least we had a great group on our two hour bus tour. Lots of laughs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1DesignDiva
30,HOLLYWOOD WALK OF DANGER!,"Folks.. it's not 1960 anymore. Hollywood has turned into a hellhole, loaded with thugs, homeless and very dangerous people who will attack you day or night in front of others, too. While the Walk of Fame and the Chinese Theater bring back the history of old Hollywood, walking around Hollywood is a different story. The safer place to walk is within a few blocks of the Hollywood/Highland area. Especially at night, you do NOT want to walk down Hollywood Blvd.. or south of there.Never walk alone. Never flash jewelry or hold your cellphone in your hand. Always keep your pocketbook and bag close to you. Do NOT use the train system. It's NOT NYC! Only the lowest of the low ride them.. and they are looking for tourists to attack. Aside from that, c'mon to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tvwarmup
50,Just a fun place for entertainment buffs.,"This is a fun place to just stroll along and see the stars. If you are an entertainment buff its' a must. Lots to eat and see here and of course wonderful people watching. The sad part is the abundance of beggars and homeless. Quite the mixture of the good the bad and the ugly. Pay parking is up and down the street, just keep looking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GenotheViking
50,Fun!,Fun to walk the stars. When we went on the tour they told us all the interesting facts about the stars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justbeachy777
40,Get Your Star On!,"IF you have ever had an idol and your dream has been to come to Hollywood to get closer to that idol, this is the activity for you. Don't be disappointed by how small the star s in the walk of fame are. Just to walk it na look up the names of the stars you have never heard of is a great activity. Hollywood blvd. always has interesting characters anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DBrackett
40,Makes taking long walks even more enjoyable,It's hard to walk along Hollywood Blvd and keep your head up considering each step shows a star's name. You can't help but walk by and realizing that so many celebrities stood at that same spot in the past. This is one of the must-sees while visiting Hollywood for sure. I couldn't imagine coming to Hollywood and not seeing this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesselodge

20,Dirty....,"Being from NY, we are usually not phased when we see a few homeless people on the street, but California or specifically Hollywood Blvd has a huge homeless problem. It was sad to see 2-3 homeless people on each block, and many appeared to be either mentally ill or high on some drug as some were very animated, talking to themselves or pacing. It felt unsafe walking back on Hollywood Blvd back to our Hotel at night. During the day they are out too but felt safer because of all the people walking around. This area is just very dirty and seedy. Nothing glamorous about the Hollywood Walk of Fame. We walked it at night and then tried again during the day to give it another chance and it felt just as dirty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmq2000
50,"Crazy, but fun!!","Very crowded with people selling food, music, and touristy items...lots of people in costumes who want money to take a picture!

30,"Like Times Square in NYC, but worse","Obviously on a first trip to LA you should check out the Walk of Fame. I knew going into it that it was going to be kind of seedy and gross, and I was not surprised in the slightest by what I saw. I think it's neat to go down Hollywood Boulevard and see all the names; my friend and I did about 70% of the whole walk. But at the same time, its crowded with tacky tourist shops and street performers, which is very a la Times Square. It's worth seeing, just know that it's hectic and gross.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmill42894
20,Very Disappointing,"Very disappointed. Was looking forward to the walk of fame during my visit to LA, but was very disappointed. The area is full of tacky souvenir shops and street sellers. You get bothered by people in cheap superhero costumes trying to extort money out of you. Also the recent legalization of marijuana had led to numerous ""smoke shops"" popping up. I got high walking through clouds of pot smoke. Not as bad as Venice beach, but close to it.Not pleasant",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkG748
30,Pretty hectic,"So twice we have done Hollywood and both times it was crazy but we had some kids who never have been so we figured we would take them.

40,What I expected but dirty,"Obviously the Hollywood Walk of Fame is on everyone’s list of things to see in LA, righteous so. Even after my second time there, as exciting as it was to be there once again the glitz and glamour of the celebrities getting their star, I forgot how dirty it is. There is quite a few homeless people, the streets are dirty and not well kept. But it still a fantastic place to go and a definite most stop on your trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhereIsAshley

50,Walk The Walk !!!,You have to walk the Walk Of Fame if you have a chance and are a fan of the Entertainment Industries. Old and new names appear one after another in cement with foot and hand prints. Some darned with the hand written autographs of the biggest stars of all time.

40,Can’t pass it up,"Really, it is just a dirty sidewalk with celebrity names engraved. But, it’s rather unique and famous, so why pass it up? We walked a very small portion of the sidewalk for about half an hour, looking at various names. It’s very long, and we walk toward the end away from the Chinese theater. The area around did not seem that appealing. But, it was an adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TB_Rays_fan_NJ
30,So I made it to Hollywood!,"When in LA you have to see Hollywood, that is the only reason we went to the Chinese Theater, see the Hollywood Start (If you can, since the place was mobbed with people and street/food vendors) and the Dolby Theater. Other than that or if you are not interested is okay to pass on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer827012
20,Quick visit,"Not a clean place, dirty sidewalks, if it's Hollywood walk of fame clean it up a bit more bit disappointed, lots of tacky tourist shops and people dressed up as different film characters wanting money of you just to have a photo taken, been once won't be going back....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Supernan49
40,Walk the stars!!,"Its really a happening place with lots of activities which are free. There's lot to do and see on the boulevard including stars on the walk of fame. There's also hand prints and footprints at the Chinese theatre.There are also people dressed as characters from movies like Batman, Spider man, wonder girl and you can get pictures clicked with them (for few dollars).Also, find your favorite star along the walk. You can also get your name in the star among the others and take a picture (comes for a price though but its fun).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thefastfurious
30,Walk of fame,"The Walk of Fame is an experience of its own. Aside from the wacky characters, tour sales folks and fake cd scammers, the Walk of Fame is 😎 cool. There are great Tours companies, like Open Bus Tours ( next to Pig and Whistle).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelingmaderas

30,"underwhelming, did not meet expectations","I don't know what I was expecting, but I was expecting more than what we saw. the sidewalk is overrun with street merchants pushing their stuff on you, there isn't much room to move sometimes, and besides the theaters (including the Chinese theatre with the celebrity marked pavement), there isn't much else to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smallworldbigoyster
30,Very busy,"This wasn’t quite as expected when my Partner and I visited it. It was fun to see but a lot of homeless people around, a constant smell of weed and beggars everywhere.Seeing the stars was great but working through the beggars etc was far from fun so it’s a must do to see them and the names you want to find but after that theres not much more to see or do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10carlh

20,Hollywood shame,"Not a great place to go with young kids there is the smell of cannabis everywhere, a lot of homeless people that hound you for money and will change their clothes in full view of young children our experience came during the TCM festival when they had red carpet events and said it was better than usual but we had trouble seeing the stars and if you stop for a minute you are inundated with people giving you CDs that you are expected to pay for or take a picture with someone dressed up again asking for payment. Not glamorous",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ljesson
10,Dirty place,Has los all the glamour. Streets are dirty and sticky. Sad to see so many homeless people living in the street. So much contrast in this country,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JankeesR
20,Won’t be going back,Like many of the other reviews say this place was a let down. Completely overcrowded street with loads of cheap tacky souvenir shops lining the road all selling unwanted trinkets and t shirts. So many more interesting places to visit in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanr645
30,Think of a long stretch of Times Square,"The title of my review says it all. Hustlers trying to peddle their crap every 30 seconds, drugs being dealt in broad daylight. The stars themselves are iconic though, and it really is exciting when you find your favourite celebrities’ names to grab a photo. Once you move beyond the most congested section between the TCL Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood Pantages it thins out and is considerably more manageable - the opposite side of the street where the stars continue seem to be easier to navigate also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommjs89
40,Walk with the Stars,"When you’re in Tinseltown, posing with a sidewalk star along the Hollywood Walk of Fame is practically a rite of passage. Honouring luminaries in motion pictures, television, radio, live theatre/live performance and recording since 1960 the famous sidewalk includes both sides of Hollywood Boulevard from Gower to La Brea, plus both sides of Vine Street from Yucca to Sunset.If you want to find a particular star pick up a brochure from most hotels giving you the exact location for your dream photo opp.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryM874

20,Great if you like being accosted...,"So we didn't choose to go here because I had read the reviews, however, this is where we had to change buses for our hop on hop off bus, in front of the Chinese theater. It would be pretty cool to walk along and check out all the stars but it's not because there is usually a fresh cloud of weed smoke and creepy people in gross dirty costumes trying to force you to take a picture in order to then charge you for it. When I say force, I mean they were going up to people and putting their arms around people, some not all of them. We just aggressively said no, get away, but it scared my daughter, she hated it there. It was like swatting flies trying to keep these people away. And not only the ones in costumes, but others trying to push their cds. There were also a couple of street performers who were quite good, but again, you really couldn't stand and enjoy anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857jillk
20,too long,this walk is not what i expected. i thought it was in front of the famous theater. it goes in either direction and across the street for about a mile on each side. try finding a star you like. there has to be thousands of people you never head of.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/John6330

CONFIDENT",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/candidocal
20,It reminded me of 1980's Times Square on steroids,Way too crowded. Not sure when a good time would be to go and look at stars on sidewalk. Would not recommend for young kids. I can see why this area was always the scene of noir films in the 1940s-50s.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rsquier
50,So much fun!,"We enjoyed our visit here immensely! I was excited to see Tom Selleck’s Star. I’ve adored him since the 80s and cleaned his star. I found Andrea Bocelli’s star as well. We had fun buying souvenir’s here. We parked near the Jimmy Kimmel theater. Even though you pay $20, it puts you in the center of the action and they don’t limit your time, so it’s worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valeriem543

40,Enjoyable walk,There’s no need to go on a tour to see this. Many big stars have at least 2 stars in the pavement. It was enjoyable waking along and spitting names.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/971louisep
10,Overrated,The Hollywood walk of fame is pretty average. The street it’s on isn’t the most pretty street ever & unless you’re looking for someone that’s famous specifically I don’t really see the point going there 🤷🏼‍♀️,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharpe90
30,"You came, you saw and you went","Historical landmark that ranges over a mile on both sides of the road. Find your favorite star amongst the busy Blvd of fruitful yet sorrowful dreams.

20,Not what we expected,Never expected Hollywood Walk of Fame to be so extremely filthy. What a huge disappointment. The large amount of homeless and druggies lined up and down Hollywood Boulevard made the experience disappointing.

10,Tourist trap - prepare to be hassled,"We arrived and within seconds were being hassled about going on a tour, this continued every few meters walking up the walk of fame. As you got towards the Chinese Theatre area it was packed, stalls everywhere trying to sell you tat, touts everywhere trying to sell tours and many people in costume hassling you to have a picture taken with you (and wanting money for this).

30,Marked it off the list,"This is somewhere we wanted to go, so we were able to check it off the list. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is fairly crowded, with a lot of street performers.

Not only are there tributes to actors like Audie Murphy,Grace Kelly,Liz Taylor but also tributes to rock stars like Slash,The Doors,Little Richard and more. The star walk also honors singer actors like Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra to name a couple.

I was looking for the star of Mickey Rooney who was inducted in the International Santa Claus Hall of Fame the same year I was. While I was there, I ran into The Incredible Hulk, Spider Man, Mickey and Minnie Mouse, who I later learned were street people dressed up to earn money by posing for photos with tourists! When folks asked if they could have there photo taken with Santa, I would say ""sure"" but then they would try to give me money!

Worth the trip anyway - and Hollywood sign within viewI couldn’t help but wonder what visitors from other countries must think to see such dilapidation in an area for which much of the world credits film development & growth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vicimamma

40,Better in person!,"During our stay in LA at the Lowes Hollywood Hotel, the 'walk of fame', became an interest over time. I really haven't been a big fan through the years, so I wasn't expecting much. The walk is rather extensive, and it being just outside our hotel, was encountered every day we ventured out. On crowded days/times, it's difficult to follow/noticed, but at other times our eyes looked downward as we recognized all the greats that have achieved this over time. And as said...it goes on and on for several blocks, both sides of the street! The one draw back is all the sightseeing services pushing their product, as well as numerous street vendors, (which tend to gather later in the afternoon/evening). There are also many character portrayers found in this area, (wonder woman, chewybacca, darth vader, the flash, cat woman, batman...), and will take a photo with you..for a price of course. I found and photoed my favs, be sure to check this lively area out when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russellt386

20,"Don't, Just Don't......","Not what it used to be. I was there 20 years ago and wow it has changed - and not for the better. Yes the stars are super cool but that's it. Beyond that its like a dumpy flea market. People are selling lots of stuff - but not good stuff just crap (oh and some drug paraphernalia). The smell of pot was overwhelming, the panhandlers were a bit over the top (like the one holding a sign say ""Need Money For Hookers and Pot"", that's a great conversation to have with a 9 year old), the people dressed in costumes looked awful (think cheap Halloween costumes and most didn't have the bodies to match the characters) and there were so many people pushing their tours it was ridiculous. I'm all about people needing to make a buck, but there has to be a way for LA to clean it up. I regret wasting a day of our vacation to go this place. The Hollywood Walk of Fame doesn't have the glamour or charm it used it, and its shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/686beckyl

Nope.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orcadas
30,LOS was good?,"Fascinating walk to think about wonderful films and fine genius. I speak another language and one thing I would reconsider is the name of the city?

She's vaccinated? Now she's in Brazil? Where s Angela? Has anyone seen Angela? The point is for people to recognize women's rights and women who work, that name didn't translate in English... I would change it, how about Just ""das port De Angeles""? LADIVA Angeles?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peneloped407
20,Walk of fame,"It’s famous, but it’s really long and there are so many people included that finding the really famous ones is tricky. A bit of a grotty road at the far ends. Walk it to say you have, but don’t build your hopes up too much. We walked it on our way elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexH0lmes
30,Nice to visit once.,Seeing the stars and the Chinese theatre where it all happens is interesting. Great to visit if your comfortable fighting off people trying to sell you something literally every 5-10 metres.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattgZ1306AK
40,Trump Star,"Trump Star was vandalized and they had to replace it with a new one. When in LA its a must see, because there are so many stars, young and old, which makes your memory kick in for all the movies and concerts you saw.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PietroSemplice
40,Worth A Look,"We were right outside the Dolby Theater when we saw the stars on the sidewalk. I suggest going earlier in the day when there aren’t so many weirdos out and about. Lots of costumed characters trying to get us to take pics with them, and a group of Bible thumpers marching up and down the street with megaphones shouting stuff. Pretty crazy, but not as bad as I expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mermaid51061
20,Pass By,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame has a feel to it like almost no other. Do I recommend going? Eh.We had a lark walking up and down the stars after we'd met up at an overpriced plasticine restaurant chain with a friend and their kids (who knew we'd want to check out the stars, and who are locals). We took a couple of goofy pictures with stars of people that were remarkable to us in some way, but didn't go round seeking out specific ones, and quickly tired of the monotony of the gritty strip in the hot sun.I had a nice talk with a homeless transgender woman who claimed to be Janis Joplin's cousin. It was definitely a fun conversation, and they were chill to chat to. Then we went up to the overpriced parking garage where we'd left the car and booked it out of that crowded strip.Honestly, do this if you have something else to see in the area. Think twice about how 'fun' it really will be for you to look at people's names on the street. Glad I went, will not be back anytime soon, although I do often wonder how Lilith is getting on...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j_mc431
30,Interesting,"Interesting to see, would think the city would keep all of the extra vendors(?) to allow all of the stars to be seen. Some of the shops are questionable too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dshow99
40,Lots of walking,Spent over half a day walking the stars. Arrived in the morning which was nice as by early afternoon it got really busy and hard to see all the stars. Be beware there were some unpleasant crazy people that make it uncomfortable for the safety of families with kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajcoco

10,Stay in your car,"This is Hollywood at it’s worst. Maybe at its most real? The glamour is all smoke and mirrors and you get both as you pass ragged smoke shops and tawdry clubs which I’m sure are full of mirrors.Grauman’s is an abomination of cliched stereotyping from a (thankfully) bygone era and it goes down from there.Keep the kids in the car, drive by at night, once, to see some pretty lights (though you might have to explain some awkward signage to younger kids) and keep on driving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunkyWanderer
10,Just Gross!!!!,"Like visiting a landfill!!! Don't waste your time or money!!!! Shame on LA and Hollywood!!!! Homeless Everywhere, Street Hustlers in the malls looking to rip you off, crackheads sleeping on the sidewalk..... It's all just gross!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hammer7576

30,Step Through Time,"The Walk of Fame is, essentially, a trail of plaques embedded in sidewalks around the Hollywood business district. What began as a clever promotion is now a record of entertainment industry movers and shakers, all literally etched in stone -- and brass. The neighborhood is far improved from decades past, but Hollywood remains one of the gritterier areas of Los Angeles. It's a fun walk through nostalgia and half of the surprise is seeing modern day megastars nestled next to now-obscure names that, thanks to the Walk of Fame, won't be forgotten.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeryValli
10,Overpriced Tourist Trap,"Listed as the worst tourist trap in the nation Hollywood is dirty, smelly and is becoming overrun by homeless. There really isn't anything glamorous about Hollywood proper. I had friends who came to town and begged me to show them the sights of Hollywood. after their visit they expressed disapointment and asked where all the pretty stuff was. I took em over to Hancock Park, The Grove, Beverly Hills then Venice Beach which made up for their time wasted in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhotographerJames
20,Unfortunately a Must-Do,"This is on most people's must-do list of attractions in LA. I found it boring, dirty, crowded, and disappointing. Several areas were in poor repair. There is not much to see along the blocks of stars but do look down because you don't want to miss seeing some of your favorites, or step in dog (hopefully but not necessarily) poop. Pull over, get out of the car, take a picture, and check this one of your list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DT355
20,Just Another Tourist Trap,"Apart from the fact the side walk has celebrities name, there is nothing spectacular about this place. I saw drug addicts (asking for spare weed) and homeless people on the side walks. There are people selling fresh fruit and that was good. I would recommend that. You will be approached by people selling you tickets to shows and tour buses. A word of advice, you can negotiate them if you are interested in getting a tour. We had this one guy following us who at the end wanted to give adult tickets priced at $50 and children tickets priced at $35 all for a flat rate of $15 each. We weren't interested so we passed down the offer. People dressed up in costumes will come pose with you for a picture and then demand $20! I would not visit there unless you are catching a show or partying in one of the venues there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haalio
30,Interesting but not fascinating,"There are countless names before you see someone you have heard of, and even then it is writing on a sidewalk. Not so thrilling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V153ILkenl
20,Only for the Truly Celeb Obsessed,"Los Angeles is many things, that is gets relegated to being the ""home of stars"" more often than anything else - saddens me, as a resident of this city. The Stars and the Walk of Fame are in one of the most rundown and commercial parts of our city. It's an attraction for the truly celeb-obsessed and nothing more. It's like LA's answer to Times Square with more pretend star power. You're not going to see any ""Stars"" near their stars on the Walk of Fame, you're not going to have any authentic run-ins with anyone famous. You're just going to see a lot of stone in a sidewalk, most of it chipped and aging. And you're going to get a contact buzz from the amount of weed smoked by lingerers in this part of town. Skip it! And pay your hard-earned money to go to a theater and see your favorite actor or actress in a film. Support the actual film industry!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstenAlana

30,Good for people watching,"Not much Hollywood fan but we were killing time. It a fun place to people watch especially the local street solicitors harassing tourists to take pictures with them for tips. They dress in marvel comic outfits like spiderman,superman, captain America and touch ,grab passerby to take pic with them. After experiencing it, we decided to watch them and it was fun how they work and get tips. It's like walking in Las Vegas bc place is busy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/890charlesn

40,Hollywood at night,My family member told me to go to Hollywood at night because the lights make it memorable. She was right.

When we arrived it wasn't too busy and the people trying to sell things didn't seem to be around.We didn't walk the full length of the walk but did a fair portion of it and saw many recognisable celebrity names. As the morning got more busy we noticed that many people trying to sell cd's and people dressed up were coming out. There are a lot of tourist companies along the strip promoting their various tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrs_B_Perth

20,Basically Robbed! Be Aware!,"Me and my sisters was in town for the weekend and we decide to tour on the walk of fame and as you know people dress up as movie character to take picture with tourist. This group of older guys (superman/chewbacca/obi-wan kenobi) came up to us as asked us where we were from (basically thinking if we aren't local it was a easier target) and they where like just getting to the point ""Let's take some picture"" us not knowing decide to take picture my younger sister was taking the picture at first and in the middle of taking picture one of them said ""We take tips for taking pictures."" and after taking a few picture the same guy who mention the tips said ""here let me take a picture with you all."" so my sister had given her phone to the guy to take picture of us and he took a few and then walked over and said ""Like I said earlier we take tips."" the three guys form a circle around us and look around before closing in, so we took out about $8-7 dollars and handed to him and he said it a very demanding voice ""No we don't take that! We take tips."" the other guys was saying ""That is not how we do it."" he flashed us a paperclip of a $20 bill and me and my sisters look at each other. And he was grabbing onto my sister $20 bill in her hand. The guy was super demanding for us to give him $20 he never gave my sister phone back to her, he held onto it until he got what he wanted. Not knowing what to do cause he had my sister's phone, we had to give him $20 and he gave my sister's phone back to her. From where we come from a tip is a tip, you don't demand and threaten to have what you want. If you want that much for a tip you might as well say it in the beginning that you charge $20 for taking picture. I felt like we got robbed. Now knowing how these thugs are it's ridiculous and disrespectful. Other than that the walk was great, got a lot of souvenirs from the stores there. **FYI-I would like to state that this is just our point of view and plan to come back but will be aware of this people from now on.**",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angieeangiee

20,Crowded chaos,"Okay, so admittedly this is a place to visit at least once to experience the hype, but we would never go back again. It is basically just a crowded mess of people with a feel much like Times Square. Lines are too long, restrooms are gross (for the most part), there are people in costumes trying to get money for photo ops, and people push their cds and social media cards at you. It is nearly impossible to see the stars in the crowded areas because people are standing on them. But hey, it’s a tourist spot, so just be sure your expectations match the reality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Froglovinlady

Which you can barely see due to the amount of ppl, but then again, they're just stars on the floor of a crowded, dirty street. Not at all what I imagined.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miryeh

40,Hollywood walk of Fame,crazy busy with crowds trying to get you to take picture with some movie characters. Homeless on the sidewalks smelling like urine. The stars o the walk are fun to spot your favorites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbuggs
50,Gotta go and check it out,I feel like this is one of those places you HAVE to go and check out. The vibe is very much like Las Vegas in that people are all along the street charging to take pictures with them or asking for money as they show off their talents. Parking is fairly limited so we parked at the Shopping Plaza right next to the Chinese Theater.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momof2boyz2015

30,overrated,"Hollywood is busy, busy, busy! It is expensive and parking is scarce. The hollywood walk of fame is a place to go and say you've done it but really not that exciting. You are basically walking and looking at the floor for miles trying to spot the few actors/singers that you like and take a picture by their name...not that exciting.

40,Always fascinating.,You never know quite what you will see or who but its a fascinating place. Especially in February when they are getting ready for the Oscars. We even got to walk on the red carpet - albeit on top of the bubble wrap. You need to book in advance to go in the Chinese theatre etc as it was very busy. This was not easy to do on line for some reason and even though we had a Air bnb in walking distance - trying to get on a tour was difficult.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janebG2415CQ

30,A must visit,"The Hollywood walk of fame is a must see when in town as it is a large monument to all the celebrities we know and love from all areas of the entertainment industry over the years, however it's not somewhere you can spend alot of time... just somewhere to pass by on your way to other attractions.As per other reviews, I agree that it is definitely best to visit here early morning as the superhero impersonators and performers do take up a large majority of the stars and street.It's also not what you would expect tbh, it's a rather dirty and run down place with a large number of homeless living in shop/museum doorways.It is a must see but don't expect it to look glamourous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimmyp87
40,It’s Okay,"Saw some cool stars. It was fun seeing names like Stan Lee, Chuck Jones and Snoopy. It’s not something you really need to see more than once but you shouldn’t miss it if you’re in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/706scottn
50,The most Hollywood thing to do,"Love movies but not as much as going to a studio tour? The Hollywood Walk of Fame is for you! This is basically a walk across a pavement with the hollywood stars on it, but its much more than that. Its a experience with a definite must-do in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salilm2019
40,Walk of fame..only in the early hours,"I would honestly say that the walk of fame is probably one of my favourite attractions there. I can't explain why but seeing my favourite stars' names on the pathway just rocks my way. However, I'd highly recommend serious walkers who are really seeking their idols' names to start off early. Like really early. The walk stretches across several blocks and on both sides of the road! And some even stretches perpendicularly! And early hours like start at 7am or something would be perfect to avoid all the superheroes impersonators and the stalls and street performers who will be definitely be blocking some of the stars. (Refer to the last pic). I'm giving it 4 stars because of all the stalls and people blocking the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AtticAsian
50,"Hollywood Walk of Fame as seen on T,V,","Everyone should have the opportunity to stroll down the Hollywood Walk of Fame! With every couple of steps I took, I seen a legendary star that was very recognizable to me.

Go to the Hollywood Walk of Fame and locate your favorite STAR!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregorydockery

It was really busy with people dressed like things to wanting you to take pictures, people handing out CDs and tickets. Then the people asking for handouts. It was crazy and most people are looking down so not watching out for others. Then the yelling guys there to sell STAR Tours.

Clouds of marijuana smoke everywhere, very congested area, and a lot of people with mental health issues are out there. I mean people that are literally tormented mentally are just hanging around. Not to mention the beggars (excuse how I describe them) but they will literally have a sign that say need money for drugs. And the crazy thing is, they get more money than the homeless people. I enjoyed myself out there. A lot to see. Nice gift shops and a few places to grab a bite. Stay away from the hotdog people.

10,Not what it looks like on TV,Came here assuming it was like what you see on TV. It is very dirty and smells awful. Yes there are the stars on the sidewalk but there are more people trying to get money or trying to get you on a tour bus. Even when we got off a tour bus someone tried to get us to go on another one. They make it look so nice on TV for the academy awards. Come to find out that they built a set around the Dolby theater that covers the actual sidewalks to make them look nice. There is a good spot that you can get a picture of the HOLLYWOOD sign. Dont come here expecting anything glorious or you will be highly disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sullivan76

30,Underwhelming,"I didn't expect much from this experience, because it's just a sidewalk full of stars. Be prepared to be heckled by various vendors, bump into numerous tourists because they make a dead stop to take a photo of a random star, and listen to annoying people on megaphones. I spotted a few IG famous people while I was there but no real Hollywood stars. It's an experience you have to have when you visit LA so you can complain to others about how horrible your experience was lol.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CheekyGold

The stars were beautiful but that street is littered with junkies and homeless people everywhere. Even my husband didn’t feel safe so we quickly returned to our hotel. Definitely a daytime visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judieb2019

It was a good one and done type of adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexiaripa
20,Hollywood Walk of Shame!,"One of the first attractions I wanted to see when I got to LA. Hollywood was this glitzy magical place I had to see for myself. I got off the bus to a grimy, filthy apocalyptic cesspool of cracked dirty sidewalks, buildings, homeless people of all ages, vendors, beggars, locals around the tourist areas of the Walk of Fame. They were so annoying even without the tourists. I don't suggest going at night alone like I did...It was scary and I did a brisk walk to my hotel to get away from the fervor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q2538ZHsharong
30,Definitely worth seeing,"Having not being able to sleep in (jet lag) I decided to get out early in the morning before the crowds and just had a walk down Hollywood Boulevard & Vine Street.It was to great to see so many iconic figures from film, TV and music being recognised.It’s definitely worth doing but be aware that it can get very crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulgilly1980
10,Super disappointed,"First time visiting Los Angeles, we just had to visit the Walk of Fame. My son, who lives in the area, said it wasn't worth visiting, but I had to insist.Like others have said, just full of vendors, homeless, tourists (me), and people trying to get your money.There was a group of 3 guys with a megaphone standing on the corner yelling really racist things, with the crowd agreeing with them. I'm surprised they didn't start a riot. We got out of that area fast.We were bombarded with people handing you cd's, pamphlets, and trying to get you to take their Hollywood tours. We literally had to step over people sleeping in the middle of the sidewalk.I didn't enjoy myself at all. We were there about 45 minutes total, and that was including time spent in Hard Rock Café, and souvenir shops.I can finally check that off my bucket list, but I wouldn't recommend going there. If you do, I'd leave the kids at home. I should've listened to my son!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stepper950
20,Cool but Dirty and Crowded,"The stars that I could see were cool, but the sidewalks were polluted with tourists, locals, homeless, vendors, and solicitors. The sidewalk was extremely dirty. Can’t LA afford a side walk cleaner?? It’s a one in a lifetime trip if you ever do decide to go, you probably won’t go again. Two stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellingirvine
20,Walking the the Stars,"Hollywood Walk of Fame - I would say, it's the name that made it sounded nice and famous only. Yes, it's good to see the names of your favourite stars in the street but it's just their names and it's so dirty and the smell of drugs is everywhere too so not really suitable for children. You've got to be willing to walk a long way to find a star - would be good to have some guidance to find what you're looking for though. Characters are persistent in having photos taken with them. Lots of homeless too, some areas are too scary to walk past - walk around but be quick. Heaps of souvenir shops and places/things to do just in Hollywood Blvd but the place is not really appealing as it sounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheilzy1972
50,5 Stars for Potential - I'd Visit Again!,"I came to LA early February when it rained for days! Dang!Landed from SFO on the Saturday morning and was staying near the Boulevard.The Hollywood Stars are super cool and I stopped to take several photos in the 4 days I was there. Without a map I'd have my work cut out seeing every single one!My rating is for the walk itself, not for what's around me, which was a lot of stores selling tacky tourist souvenirs, homeless people and a bunch of weed shops.Man the Boulevard stinks of weed!Some of the stars are cracked and damaged, which is a real shame, so the potential to maintain them would be cool.The Chinese Theatre and Dolby Theatre are awesome to look at, really iconic buildings.Crossing the street takes forever sometimes.When it's not raining, which it didn't for a few hours on one of the days, I saw Darth Vadar, Spider-man (wearing a fanny pack, dude, really?) and Captain Jack Sparrow.This is normal behaviour in Hollywood. Personally I thought it was bananas and found it hilarious at how eccentric everything was!I can honestly say I've never seen anything like it before in real life!There are loads of restaurants to eat at with plenty of choice.La La Land is a pretty cool store for buying souvenirs.Watch out for those aspiring musicians trying to 'give' you their CD!He'll give you some spiel about his music and record company and clothing brand etc whilst he hands you the disc.You promise to listen to it and spread the word. Then he'll ask you for $20, haha pfft good luck!CDs by established artists don't go for that price in the UK, here's $5 now leave me be!Then another will try it as you're trying to take a photo of one of the stars on the ground.""No thanks mate""""But it's freeeee!""""Ain't nothing free on the Boulevard!"" was my response! Was I a local for a second there?I'd love to come back to LA when it's guaranteed to be dry weather. Still so much to see and do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TashW35
10,Disgusting!!!,"It’s just about the name, the fame and the “stars” that you will find along the path, it’s nothing but a disgusting, filthy, unsafe place and nowadays, filled with a marijuana smell all over!!! It doesn’t matter the time of the day, it’s constant and unbearable when you’re traveling with babies!!!I respect the fact is legal now in CA, but there’s not a single drop of respect for anyone, it’s worst than cigarette or any other legal drug!!!Just safe your time and integrity and keep the TV image as the ideal of this highlight!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiberToka
20,Not the place it used to be...,"Had some out of town relatives that wanted to ""walk"" the walk of fame and yes, the sidewalk stars are still there! But you need to be willing to deal with the overly aggressive ""characters"" and the homeless, all trying to part you from your money. Not to mention the trash, crime and dirty streets. There are so many wonderful places to visit in Los Angeles, why go somewhere that doesn't feel safe. I would not bring children here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NY2StudioCity

30,Great movie history that needs a little work,"Well the walk of fame is so full of so many stars it’s truly amazing! However, for arguably the worlds most famous sidewalk it is really in a rundown condition which was both very surprising and disappointing! Cmon Hollywood, fix up the WoF so that it’s maintained in a condition worthy of the millions of visitors it receives every year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/-Guzzis-are-ace-
30,Iconic,It’s definitely an iconic place... but Hollywood Blvd has changed a lot. I’ve been living in America for 10 years and I’ve been noticing the change. It’s sad because there’s a lot of homeless and druggies around. And the smell of weed it’s constantly around. I usually just go there to show for the turista friends that come visit me and buy some soveniers because it’s cheap and take a selfie with of my favorites stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soraias370

50,Not just a walk,"The walk of fame is a pretty long walk if you go everywhere. Hollywood Blvd has a lot more to offer. Very crowded but tons of fun.

30,Kind of disappointed...,"If you focus in the history (Which I loooVe) you can still enjoy the magic of this iconic place, but to be honest everything looks very dirty and I was not feeling safe at all.My recomendation is to go just for an hour or two just to say you were there ;) take some pictures and that it.LA has many many many great places to go and enjoy your vacations!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NataliaSantillana

20,Not worth your time,"Took my 5 and 6 year olds few months ago to El Capitan theater and decided to walk around Hollywood walk of fame. It is so crowded that you spend 90% of your time bumping into people, stepping on their feet or get stepped on, and trying to keep an eye on the kids because it would be very easy to lose them ...Its pretty dirty too. There are things to see, Chinese theater, El Capitan theater, Madame Tussaud's museum...Not for family with small kids though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baldukhayeva

10,DIRTY & DISGUSTING,"It is truly sad, disgusting and dangerous. The stars are not maintained at all. Many are broken, cracked and dirty. People selling things cover the stars with their junk. It smells horrible from the stench of homeless urine and nasty hot dogs. Street characters harassing people and cording off sections of the walk of fame as if they own it. There have been fights, shootings and stabbings. Shame on Hollywood and Los Angeles for letting it get this bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/579kk
50,You can't to to LA without a visit.,"I decided to do a walking tour with Hollywood Behind The Scenes Tours& I can't say enough about their staff & tour guide.

The guide was excellent - Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carlton3

Nothing much to see there, but friendly reminder lots of costume people there will head up to you and take pictures with you and ask you money after. So becareful.

40,Fun hangout,"Although Hollywood Blvd has changed throughout the decades & became more crowded, it's still a fun place for a night out, despite the traffic/parking hassle. We usually park in the Kodak Theater underground parking structure and walk around. There's plenty of shopping, dining, and entertainment along the stars :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abbey0130
20,Not really worth a special trip,"I’ve lived in Los Angeles for 30 years, and previously, whenever guests came to visit...almost all of them wanted to see the Hollywood Walk Of Fame.I generally stay away from that area these days for the following reasons.The central hub is the Hollywood and Highland complex. This is a very DENSLY packer area, that can be challenging getting in our out of by car. There are a lot more panhandlers in the area, so you WILL be approached by a tour operator, someone asking for money, or some aspiring musical artist shoving a CD into your hand.Many folks dress as cartoon characters and will charge you $5-$10 to take a photo with them. ALSO...there are Scientologists everywhere and they frequently attempt to give you a “free” personality test.It’s jist not a pleasant place to take a leisurely stroll and enjoy all the stars. I’m reqlity it’s jist an overcrowded, over priced tourist trap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bpdarling

30,Disappointing !,"You see it on the tv and it looks different, somehow much more glamorous. The walk is spread over a massive distance and I would love to know how you qualify for a star because most of the stars you will have never heard of. It’s a must see to say you have done it I suppose.Loads of people in various costumes trying to get in your photos or they will try and get you to take their photos just beware they are doing it for money so they will ask and are quite pushy.Unfortunately another side of this area is quite a lot of begging and some of it a bit aggressive so just be warned and careful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve40_12

30,Cool but so spread out it loses charm quickly,"In front of the famous Grauman’s Chinese Theatre the Walk of Fame is cool but that is not the only place where stars are placed. If you stray to look at these, you end up in areas not really clean and not a place to take smallChildren for sure. Perhaps they should figure out another way to put new stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/g9rocks64
30,Walk of Fame,It was cool seeing all the stars' names on the Walk of Fame -- was surprised that the streets were pretty littered when I was there and some of the stars were dirty. I still enjoyed seeing the actual stars' names though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryanny2014
20,Totally underwhelmed and disappointed,"If your not being harassed by a man dressed up in a bad chewy costume, your being being harassed by someone selling you a tour in a van with its roof cut off.If you take a moment to look up from the stars on the floor (the only bit that’s not a terrible eye saw) you realised Hollywood boulevard is a pretty grim area.Most shops are full of over priced tat.Go there to tick it off, but spend maximum of 10 mins there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattrT398AF
50,Hollywood walk of fame,I visited the Hollywood Boulevard and did my walk on the ‘Walk of Fame’. It was a great view at night with amazing shops where you can buy beautiful souvenirs to take back to loved ones. I must do it again. It was great stepping on the paths of some of the most iconic stars in Hollywood!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sparkleyourworld
40,So pleased we did it,Some of the reviews can be abit off putting I would say just do it and make your own mind up. We weren't going to do it as we had read terrible things but at the last minute we thought what the hell let's go and see it and I'm pleased we did. Its a bucket list item it's a good thing to look back on and say I've been there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALCBS
50,A must do in LA!,"Was a bit worried about visiting based on previous reviews. Just be aware there are loads of people around.. its a tourist spot! Went midday and was absolutely in shockIt was a dream. Yes a bit busy, but loved walking down this road taking photos! Just realise that everyone wants to see this so you are walking through crowds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/affy1979
30,Meh,"I stayed on Hollywood Blvd and as a location for accommodation it was great. Lots of things nearby and easy to get to places. However the walk of fame is essentially a poorly maintained sidewalk. It's difficult to know where certain stars are without buying a map or doing a lot of research before hand. If you're visiting somewhere else on Hollywood (like the Chinese or Dolby theatres) then it's worth a wander as you make your way to them. Otherwise, I'd leave it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NinaH932
20,So dissapointing....,"The streets here should be revired as a national monument! Instead they are dirty and full of homeless people, scammers and tour companies, so dissapointing! Stars would be rolling in their graves!! No wonder the glitterati only come down from the hills and canyons once a year for the oscars!! The LAPD should be doing a much better job here, if they would like tourists to continue to come!! Perhaps speak with Rudy Giuliani! As it stands Hollywood has a scary, seedy feel....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lrhb2014
20,Completely underwelming,"I was really disappointed by the Walk of Fame. The area seemed really dirty, filled with homeless people, people trying to sell tours and budget shops.Whilst it was interesting to see some of the well know names, many of the stars were so dirty that I would have thought the ""stars"" would be embarrassed rather than proud to be there.We were there for Oscars' day so I expected to see things at their best - at least we got a glimpse of the Red Carpet.I wouldn't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenT665
30,All the stars!,"Great to finally see the Walk of Fame up close and see exactly who and how many people have been honoured with a star. As much as this is great and one of the top things to see and do in Hollywood, the neighbourhood leaves much to be desired and there are plenty of less fortunate folks who approach you as you walk along the street. It’s not as glamorous as is portrayed in the media, but still one-hundred percent something you have to see. Identifying celebrities and stars of past and present is fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gkw09
20,Don't expect too much!,"I had imagined a nice place such as a square where all stars would be on the ground. However, the stars are all on the footway along Hollywood boulevard. The entire street is full of homeless, weirdos and street vendors trying to sell random DVD's or simply begging for money. It's quite shabby and not appealing at all. If you want to take a photo of your favourite actor - do that and leave again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Toubi007

20,Not for an 11 year-old at dusk!,"My daughter was interested in seeing the Walk of Fame, but she was extremely frightened by the number of colorful 'characters' on the street who were under the influence. We had to leave after 15 minutes since she couldn't focus on the sidewalk.I liked recognizing the names of the stars from childhood until present, but definitely would go during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toomuchsnowhere

50,I love it here.,I’m a California native that likes to act like a tourist sometimes. The Hollywood walk of fame is not just filled with stars it also has shopping eateries entertainment and museums. I like to see the different characters as well as those that come to visit California. Go into the wax museum it’s really fun as well as the Guinness book of world records museum.There is a pizza stand that I really enjoy I wish I could remember the name of it and I often go to the Hooters there for football games if you are visiting California of course it’s a must see. Oh and if you’re looking for a tour of the stars home there are many vendors on Hollywood and Highland. If you’re driving be careful where you park you can get a ticket easily.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chayesocali

40,Fun thing to do in Hollywood,It may seem corny but it is fun to walk along Hollywood Boulevard and look at the stars in the sidewalk. This is flat the whole way so is doable for someone who has walking issues or has a walker or wheelchair. It is a lot of fun to read the names of both stars and those you've never heard of.Make sure you listen to The Kinks song of the same name prior to your walk. Makes it more fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MDXP
40,Must see sight on Hollywood Boulevard.....,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard features over 2,500 gold stars inset into the marble sidewalk, each featuring a star of movies, music, TV, or radio.

It is very touristy with street vendors selling all the tats as you would expect. What we didn’t expect, was filthy pavement full of dogs’ excrements lots of homeless people and crazy junkies smoking crack in the public. Honestly, what a disappointment.

10,Where people give up on life and lay down in the middle of the sidewalk,"I know you want to go and see the stars, but no one who actually lives in LA goes there, especially an actor or 'star.' The people you will meet on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are a man dressed up as Spider-man, 14 people asking for money, 47 other tourists, and you will step over no less than 3 people who have decided to give up on life and lay down in the middle of the sidewalk. Spend your time enjoying some other place in LA. There are plenty of amazing places, LACMA, The Broad, Venice canals, Griffith, etc. Spider-man won't be upset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashtanganurse

40,Stars!,You could literally spend hours looking at all the stars of the Walk of Fame. We did the stars along by Grauman's Theatre. It wasn't too busy but be wary of the people dressed up as film stars as they charge for photos and will not be haggled down. There are also a lot of homeless around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catp79

40,Interesting street to visit!!,"Located in the downtown of Los Angeles.This place is interesting with many city tours. Choose one you like, personally I tried the LA city tour. I took up the 2hrs tour, riding in the small tourist bus. The driver who is also the guide brought us round the Hollywood celebrities home in Beverly hills and Bel Air. But it tend to get a little boring as the tour goes by as we can really ""see"" those houses. So if you have time to spare, you can take it as an experience.The main attraction is definitely the stars on the road with all the famous celebrities name engraved on it. It has roughly about 2600++ names. It will sure take awhile to find your favourite one.Not to forget to visit the Chinese theater for a photo taking of this nice building with a big dragon curved on it.The Dolby Theatre where all the major award ceremony held, it worth to have quick photo session too.Be super aware of those ppl wearing and dressing up as a super hero uniform. They will approach tourist in a super friendly mode for photo taking (they look as if it for free but it not). After the photo they will then ask for a 10usd per pax.Just stay away from them.Along the road, many ppl will also try to hand you a copy of CD. These I suppose are freelance musician who wish to be famous and wanted to sell their own made music. So once you take their CD, they gonna ask you to pay. So... Beware.There are many souvenirs stores along the street too.so take your time to browse them. You may find something interesting to bring home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuztinP4
50,Legendary road,The most talked road in the whole world! You can take pictures with your favourite celebrities’ stars. There are tons of souvenier shops and restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlaraAygen
50,West Coast Adventure,If you go to LA you must visit the walk of fame. Much much longer than I thought with some of the weirdest people out and about. But well worth the experience and much more to see and visit along the way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/917andyp
40,Stars,"Everytime family comes to visit I always take them to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. You can walk for hours looking at various actors, actresses and musicians stars. You can also get good food and entertainment. Let's not forget you can take great photos. Always a tour when in Los Angeles. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/favoredby
20,Mini time square with palm trees,"We went to the walk of fame to see Pink get her star. That was amazing however after the ceremony was over we went to walk down the blvd to look a the theaters and other stars. We were constantly interrupted by people trying to sell us tours, push their music DVD’s on us and take pictures with horribly bizarre looking characters. Everyone wanted money and very pushy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krissyalx
30,Quick Visit Only,"What can I say, everyone needs to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame but from my visit two years ago and then again last week, I can say that this is not a very pleasant area to visit so just Uber it to the middle, walk along the star walk and Uber out again. This is not an area to stay in as it's very touristy, full of touts and a little dirtyl.In addition to seeing the Walk of Fame, we did have a look at the Dolby theatre which is where the Oscars are held. This was interesting to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddtrippas
30,One of those things you tick off your list when visiting LA,"Yes it can be busy, yes there are scammers trying to get you to buy their CD's or characters trying to get you to have a photo with them, yes it can be dirty in places but it's not as bad as other reviews suggest.We caught the Red Metro line to the Hollywood Highland station that is literally steps away from Grauman's Theatre, the Dolby theatre, TCL Chinese Theatre and the Walk of Fame. (And the Metro is only $1.75 per one way or $7 for a day pass) As we went on a weekday in December & on a rare rainy LA day, there were hardly any crowds so we were easily able to see the stars on the ground and all the hand & footprints and signatures without people walking all over them. We felt completely safe & spent a couple of hours wandering around.We have also been here in July and the crowds make it practically impossible to see anything at that time of year. Our best advice is go when it's not US holidays and during the week to avoid the crowds. We wouldn't say it's fantastic but it's worth a visit just the same",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C9666QRkareng
40,It’s a sidealk,"I don’t know what I was expecting - but it’s literally a sidewalk. This is one of those things that I feel was worth seeing once since it’s so iconic, but I don’t think I feel the need to visit again. It was cool to walk down the street and see the stars for my favorite celebrities and characters, and get all the classic photos. I think it’s just important to know what you’re going into and that it is A SIDEWALK. It’s not glamorous, it’s actually a pretty dirty area and felt kinda sketchy at times. If you go into it expecting something old Hollywood glamour - you’ll be disappointed. I’m happy we went to see it but probably wouldn’t revisit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaelaceleste
30,I expected a classy boardwalk.,"It is dirty and not worth the visit, but since we were already there, we walked it. It wasn't too crowded. Lots of people offering you tour bus rides which we did not accept. Lots of stores catered to strippers, which was surprising.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aysheh20182018
50,How fun to reminisce of favorite cinema and music artist,"Each time we visit there are a few more favorite artist added to the walk. Plus, you are on Hollywood Boulevard where the Dolby & Chinese Theater are located. You can make a day of sightseeing in one location. There are plenty of eateries and tours in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosyl409
10,Sheer disappointment,"This should be at the bottom of your “things to do” list in LA. Honestly, it’s not that great. And it’s not because of the scaffoldings as they prep for the Oscar’s. It is just a strip or a sidewalk, none of the glitz & glamour that you hear about Hollywood. Plus, the place is over crowded with tourists, scammers, homeless, creeps & weirdos. Still, we made the most out of it. Good thing I saw Michael Jackson’s star. Parking is so bad we had no choice but to avail of the Public Parking, cost us $20 unlimited stay, which was a total rip off. The biggest let down is that we didn’t feel safe at all. Not a single cop or security was in sight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mitzc2018
20,Not worth a stop,"What can I say. I would not recommend walking alone, and be wary of where you park your car. There were a lot of broken glass on the road. There are a lot of homeless people, it was dirty and reeked of urine, and some of the sidewalk was cracked. Let's just say, the pictures you see on social media - it's full of filters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c9017
30,Not that great,"Went for a business meeting with a co-worker and made time to site see. We both really wanted to go here. Afterwards, we were really disappointed with how dirty it was and the people crowding the streets to sell something.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meyersfamilyof8
10,Big Disappointment,"Don't the city fathers know that millions of people per year come from around the world to see these sidewalks. Hollywood Blvd. should look like Main Street at Disney World. Instead it looks like more like Skid Row in downtown LA, I can't imagine one person visiting the Walk of Fame coming away saying that it was positive experience. Amazing that they haven't figured it out. Lucky that most of the world is Hollywood crazy. I can't believe people still flock to a dirty street in disrepair to read names of the famous and not so famous on stars in the sidewalk. If the street was anywhere else, you wouldn't let your teenage daughter walk there alone, even in the middle of the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/595frankb
30,Walk of fame,"Was good to do the walk of fame, but was a little disappointed in how dirty it was, and most annoyed at the people just standing there trying to scam you into buying something from them and not moving so you can see the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccutting75
20,Tourist trap. Dirty and crowded.,"As part of our city tour our driver dropped us off for and hour at the walk of fame. In 15 minutes we were ready to leave. The sidewalks and streets are crowded and dirty with trash and filth. The area is teeming with vendors, some aggressive. The shops that line the streets are filled with over priced tourist junk. The small amount of fun possible in finding your favorite actor's star on the sidewalk is overcome by the crush of people and the bother of opportunists looking to sell you something. I never plan on visiting this place again. and I wish I hadn't gone. It was more romantic in my mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomaspV6928EA
40,A step back in time with Hollywood legends!,Fun to walk blocks seeing the stars and their names! Also movie characters are in costume and you can take pictures with them. A fun hour or two as part of city tour. Worth your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/318ilenes
20,Walk of fame,"This was a must see for my wife. You can get a map of where each star is. I didnt like the area and the other reviews made me nervous with homelss and beggers and the mentally ill. We went early in the morning and saw a few homeless and beggars. 2 costume characters were out trying to get pictures for monwy, but we declined after chewbacca took his mask off in front of my one year old. It might be safer than i am giving it credit for, but i was just overwhellmed with nerves",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chevyjlewis
40,Bit of planning or searching go a long way - or just Turn-Up,"Yes it get's crowded - very very busy. So timing exactly what you want is important. Or if you just have the time to meander for 2-3 hours take the time to enjoy the strip on both sides.We didn't have that must time, so we used Scooters to get up & back within 70 minutes.THen stopped at Starbucks for a well earned coffee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ceowarren
30,EXPECTED MORE,"A must do when in Hollywood and it was great to see names that have made entertainment what it is immortalised for future generations. The Hollywood strip however is dirty, littered with scammers, weirdos and makes you question whether this is the best place to honour our stars. It is worth seeing but you may question whether it's a strip to recognise the contributions of our stars or just a magnet used to draw tourists in to a pretty grotty street market. Anyway each to their own and we don't regret seeing it but were a little surprised at what we saw given stars usually mean glitz and glamour not trash and questionable treasure, cheers. :-0",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hgrundell

30,It smells like pee,"Hollywood is not what you think it is. Sure there are some parts that are nice but for the most part it's too packed, it smells like pee everywhere and there are people everywhere trying to scam you. If you do go check out the Ripley's museum and wax museums thise are cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2564K
50,So touristy but fun,My first time in LA. Didn’t have a lot of free time but just wanted to check out the stars. Just meandered for 2 hrs. Enjoyed it! Well worth the Uber fare for me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bevbemama
30,Over crowded and run down,It’s so hard to pause in an attempt to see who is on the various stars with the size of the crowds and the sidewalk hawking of everything to take your money especially in front of the Chinese Theater,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnpS4312GB
30,You have to see it but...,"If first time to Hollywood, you have to see it. I think a tour would be good to give some history and context. However, the area is a bit dirty and definitely has that..where Hollywood dreams go to die...vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schisti

30,Hollywood,"This was my second visit in Los Angeles and I thought it would be a shame not to see famous Hollywood and its Walk of Fame so I decided to visit it. I am glad I did so, we had fun and it has its own charm but I don't have to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvaF2Eva

10,Why is this even interesting?,"Friends who come to LA want to visit Hollywood. We usually tell them to manage expectations. Maybe movie buffs might want to see their favorite star’s sidewalk star but it really is just a pavement, hardly exciting except maybe for the day it was put in. Mann’s Chinese Theatre is more interesting and perhaps some of the old hotels and restaurants, but the Walk of Fame is boring. Suggest people try to see a show at the Pantages instead, if timing is right. Pantages Theatre has old school glamour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wonder80
30,So Glad I did,"I thought it would be check mark adventure, but I kept my head down and was surprised how I miss the real stars of Hollywood. I do wonder how they decide who goes where. The old and talented greats are all over. I did most of the walk but my priorities were Bette Davie, Greta Garbo, Katherine Hepburn, spencer Tracey, all the old greats. I had such a smile when I found one of their stars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolynP349
30,Felt a bit over rated.,"Seemed that the only bit that really got any attention was outside of the Chinese Theatre but this was packed with tourists and people trying to make a quick buck! The rest of the walk just didn't really seem like an attraction, I think I'd have had the same reaction if I saw a cool little graffiti piece as I did to made. Could do with some TLC and something to make it feel a bit more special, it's basically a pavement/sidewalk with some names on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattS921207
50,Acting Like a Tourist,"This is an exciting place to be. I honestly felt like a tourist. Walking around drinking a great cup of coffee, eating a cheese danish or just taking in the sights...being in Hollywood and viewing the immortalized takes my breath away every time. The only thing I would suggest is that you’re vigilant should you be visiting this place. There are a lot of people at any given time. However, the number of police (plain clothes and uniformed) are always a welcoming sight. Not once have I felt threatened, even when I’m visiting alone. The gift shops are the best. Their prices are affordable and with so many things to choose from; there’s sure to be something for everyone’s interest. Oh, there are a few upscale hotels that have “happy hour” and those are always fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TbSott
40,Great historical relic,"It’s Hollywood at it’s best and worst. Famous name stars from current years and days gone by. All the magic of Hollywood right below your feet. It’s cool but populated with hustlers, homeless and the mentally infirm. I’ve seen the CD hucksters take advantage of foreign tourists who don’t understand English or the currency. Legions of dirty stinking mentally unstable chattering aimlessly. Costume characters both good (hot Wonder Woman) and bad (fat Spiderman) posing for a dollar for your selfie. Sleazy bars, tattoo shops and cheap trinket shops mixed in with landmarks like Musso & Frank’s, The Roosevelt Hotel and the Chinese Theater. Wanna be musicians, food carts, tour vans with the roof cut off and starry eyed tourists of all nations hoping to see someone famous. There is a magic about it but be warned, it’s not paved with gold. It’s really the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinwK8892NE

50,All the Sights and Sounds,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a must see. There are so many things going on at one time its hard to pay attention. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes and prepare for all the street vendors or not (lol).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shimeie
30,"Not a reason to come to Hollywood, but if you are here...","Saw the WoF first as an out of state tourist many years ago and several times since, but usually incidental to other reasons to be in Hollywood. Now that I live close, I stroll the WoF frequently. Oddly enough, I still find it interesting. You will note many names that stand out that you have no trouble in understanding how they got their star. But, there are just as many names where you find yourself wondering, who? And, not just because they were stars of the past, but genuinely folks that the majority of us would never have heard of. And, you will see names that make you ask, ""Really, you couldn't pick someone more deserving?"". I don't see the WoF as a reason to come to Hollywood, but I do find that it still grabs my attention.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertwX2677ZI
30,Hmmmm,"Well totally not what I expected.Very run down, loads of homeless and dodgy acting people , guys shoving their CD in you face like its for free but if u take beware they want money for it !

50,Bring your walking shoes... dodge the superheros et al,"If you don’t have a lot of time, grab a map and look for your favourite stars. But if you have time, just go for a wander and look at all the stars. The bigger names stars are near the Chinese theatre. Just be careful as there are superheros et al wanting you to take your picture with them for a fee. I’ve nrver seen such out of shape superheroes in my life. Live with Jimmy Kimmel also located on the strip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CDNinHK
30,At least it’s checked off the list?,"The worlds “sickest rapper” handed me his cd for only $10, how neat that!?

I highly suggest getting the street car tacos, finding your favorite star, and leaving right after that 👌🏻",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhyA_13
40,The iconic Walk of Fame,Another iconic place to visit in LA. It is a good activity to try and find your favourite star and take a pic with it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/463pedrof
10,Very disappointing,"Had read bad reviews about the Walk of Fame, but thought it couldn't really be that bad. So decided to check it out first hand. As to be expected it is a very run down area, the star plaques are filthy, most of them you can't even see due to street performers. the street is full of Hobo's begging for money & ppl harassing you to buy CD's etc, it's madness! On the route into the Walk of Fame sadly there's homeless people in tents lining the streets. Really not how I thought it would be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kayleyboo
20,Not as expected,"After visiting Los Angeles for the first time ,I have to say the walk of fame could do with a good clean. The areas around the streets that they are in, are cluttered with rubbish and a lot beggars. It’s a sight most visitors want to see and I just felt abit more effort could be made.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzannet165
30,An embarrasment,"The level of care and upkeep to the stars is true embarrassment to the city and the stars they are meant to celebrate. Im actually surprised they continue to add new one because they have no interest in existing ones.Firstly it is filthy, really filthy. Considering amount of tourism this attraction specifically attracts, would it hurt to send a sweeper through once a week?Secondly many are damaged.i'm not talking being defaced like Trumps, i'm talking being cracked in half due to zero maintenance.Thirdly there are people in many locations who set up stalls on top of the stars to cook vile looking hotdogs. So many stars are unavailable and obscured.Lastly there are lots of cosplay type people harassing you for photos, who are very aggressive.I give it 3 stars because it was interesting to see it. But They deserve less for the upkeep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeighofLeigh
40,City of Angels,"Yes, the ultimate touristy spot here in the heart of Hollywood. There are lots of street residents walking around here. Probably the most interesting, yet overrated things to do. But overrated or not, it's still fun to take a walk up, down, and all around the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I had a lot of fun reading all the names and seeing how many I could recognize. The stars are on both sides of the street, meaning that you have to do quite a bit of walking to see them all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrWarrenM
40,Tourist Mecca,"Living in Los Angeles county for so long, the first thing you want to do is get away from the tourists Mecca . Hollywood Walk of Fame is one of those areas! With movie stars and musicians home so close by, you know you are in a special place. You will be paying special prices also!! It’s a weird place because it encompasses the gritty life of Hollywood while being so close to the mansions of Beverly Hills! People from all over the world comes to visit LA each year. I like quiet secluded places, so Hollywood Walk of Fame is usually not on my top lists. But for others who wants to take a selfie and check out LA lifestyle then it’s a must to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CambodiaTravelsGuide
30,"Must go, but do not have high expectations","The place is usually crowded and dirty. Also there are a lot of people that will try to sell you things you don't need or take a picture with you for some money. Be aware. There are just too many signs, it is hard to find your favorite artists. It is good to do some research beforehand to get the exact location of the star your looking for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gussch1987

50,An amazing walk,"This is one of the must visits in LA. We enjoyed walking up and down taking pictures with the names of our favourite stars, especially with The Beatles star. Try and avoid going during the afternoon as the sun shines directly over your head and is difficult to cover the entire walk - instead go in the evening between 4:00 and 6:00. There are people who create a personalised star so that you can take a picture with your name of the famous sidewalk. We went to chill in a Dive bar called Frolic Room in the evening and spent the rest of the night in Hollywood and Highland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sudhirkirangn
30,Must so but a bit underwhelming,All the stars written...in the stars so perfect for photo opps. Problem is that too many names are from bygone artists so I'd recommend looking online for your faves or have Google handy to look up those you don't know.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colincitos
50,Starstruck! 🤩,"It is a MUST while in Hollywood to visit your favourite star's star! I enjoyed walking up and down and exploring the area whilst keeping an eye out for my favourite celebrities star.Don't be fooled though I was under the impression that all of Hollywood is rich and famous. Tourist have common sense keep valuables close to you and be aware of your surroundings. Just like any high tourist attraction there could likely be pickpockets and with it being a crowded area at some parts it can be easy to be taken advantage of.Not all the walk of fame is as well kept as others so I'd advise taking a few wet wipes, give your favourite celeb's star a wipe and get a picture with it.If you can't find the star you're looking for go onto the walk of fame website and you'll find the directions there.There is (again like any city in the world) a lot of homeless people. Be kind to one another and don't just turn your nose up at them, they're people to! Just be sensible yet sensitive x",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/253lornam

We went to hollywood blvd on our first day with the idea it would be great.We walked past people smoking actual crack in the streets!Ive never felt so unsafe in my life.I would recommend six flags, venice beach (in the day) and the farmers market/grove street in the evening.

30,Interesting but Overrated,"While it was interesting to look at all it amounts to is a stars on the sidewalk. Many are unknown to the common fan. We walked along the street for a few blocks and noticed a number of people we knew. I recommend a look because it has been drummed into our experience for years and years.

Overall the area is not as run down and seedy as it was a few years ago and the metro is near-by Saw quit a few homeless people around but they were no bother just felt bad for them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larryw263

20,Haggled by street workers,"Cool to see all the stars with celebrities names on it....the whole walk of fame was over ran by lame street workers dressed up as Chewbacca, Darth Vador, Spider-Man, Superman, and It.

It was brilliant walking along and finding a name that brought back so much nostalgia..ie Alan Hale, Lucille Ball etc.So much to see and experience. I wouldn't like to be here on my own after dark though as the numbers of 'crazys' increases. Great for seeing all sides of humanity though. If you get a photo with anyone in costume though be prepared with lots of dollar notes as they will want payment. Lots of brilliant shops such as Iguana Vintage Clothing and Pie Hole.

30,Crowded and dirty,"The Walk of Fame is a must see for any first time visitor to Hollywood. It isn’t the most wholesome place for children so if you have kids visit during the day. Be aware that it is not unusual to see homeless people camping out on the sidewalks, nudity, and people smoking weed. The smells can be acrid from urine to pot. That said, the lights, the street vendors and the night clubs can be very fun. Parking is always difficult and usually expensive. I recommend public transportation from your hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kl417g

50,Fun day trip to Hollywood,"If you have a favorite celebrity - movies, music, tv, radio - they likely have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Some people even have two. If you don't have time constraints, there are tons of stars to see down Hollywood Blvd and surrounding side streets in the heart of Hollywood. Download the walking app (both iPhone and Android) to find the location of specific stars if you want to take pics of & with your favorite celebrity name.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coreham
10,What a Disappointment,100% a tourist trap! Most of the blocks have sidewalks with many homeless and vagrant people. Not much to enjoy. There are 2-3 blocks that are cleaned up for tourists who were there in droves. Cannot imagine any reason to return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/burtw
40,So Many Stars!,"It's pretty easy to just start anywhere along the street and keep looking down to find your favorite stars. I did expect something a bit more upscale and clean, as the area is mostly t-shirt and souvenir shops. A few old buildings still have nice architectural details. An interesting and fun way to spend an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catiba110
50,Something to check out!,"Haven't been to Hollywood since 1975 this is great to see, sad thing though some of the vintage buildings are so run down falling apart, small souviner businesses, and Hollywood tour companies run out of them, but it always fun to walk around to see all the Stars ⭐ and run into impersonators!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tigerpawsdf
50,Quick Trip to LA,"The Hollywood walk of fame was an unexpected viewing. Not far from the hotel we walked to it, enjoyed strolling both sides of the street and then viewed the walk at the Chinese theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheilar846
30,You have to see it for yourself,"Best viewed before 10am. The foot traffic after that makes it challenging. Some parts are not so clean. Disappointing that Elvis' star is missing. Definitely not at 6777 as advertised. Do NOT go there after 5pm. Packed with people. SO many people trying to 'give' you CD's etc. Was abused for my clothing when I said no thank you. Many of the 'sellers' are significantly taller - over 1.8 metres (6 foot), and as a female tourist I was quite concerned for my safety. Was then pleased for the footpath to be so packed at that moment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joy_M56
40,A Day in Hollywood,"7 October 2018, Los Angeles: This post has been long overdue. First stop was Los Angeles on the California Coast. Beautiful weather on a perfect autumn day. Walking, exploring glamourous Hollywood. Busy street lining Dolby Theatre, Walk of Fame, TCL Theatre, Hard Rock, etc. Many dining options. Street and cosplay entertainers hoping to make few bucks, all sort of creative street arts. There's a Sweet Candy Shop selling varieties of sweets, also a create your own lollipop. Distant view of the iconic Hollywood Signboard. Well, a must do list when in LA. #hollywoodwalkoffame #hollywood #LosAngeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linweisingapore

30,You must t take a walk - Who's your favorite??,So off the metro - West Hollywood - Straight to the walk of fame!!!Seen ot for years as Stars get unveiled and finally made it!Great to see all these famous people - And many that are not so :-)Took a walk both sides of the street ...Shame some are cracked where the sidewalk has moved...The high light for me - Elvis... Amazing to see...If you are here - You gotta take a look ;-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petermL3976PO
30,Tourist mecca over rated,"For the locals a haven for peddling from tourists - as almost every LA tour stops here, once again with buskers, beggars and anybody trying to hustle some money out of you. Big souvenir stores with hollywood paraphanelia of every description. Place is wall to wall full of tourists , all wanting shots along pavement of their favourite stars. A bit over rated in my books. If you have to visit do so, but be prepared to be hassled . Another LA dissapointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mccdzyne
50,heads down ...its the best way to see all the stars.research who you want to see,"great day out .it is quite a long walk to see them all, so research who you want to see before going.

20,Disappointing,"While the stars on the walk of fame are nice to see it is overrun with street vendors/performers, people dressed up in the cosplay outfits solicitating for money, and people trying to move you towards shops. The place was very dirty and crowded. The mall is the best parking area if you feel you need to go. My suggestion is keep your hands in your pockets to avoid people grabbing you or handing you flyers. Saw this several time while walking the strip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mnako
40,Stepping in the footsteps of Movie Star history,"The area around Grauman's Chinese Theater is almost a mine field filled with people bending over placing their hands and feet into the impressions of movie stars of yesterday and today. Trying to navigate that mine field is an adventure in and of its self. Standing just a few feet from the location are a cast of characters dressed as super heroes and movie stars trying to gain your attention and money as they pose for a photograph. Of course that photograph is going to cost you. As with most areas surrounding the Grauman's Chinese Theater, it has that seedy feeling that you don't particularly safe. Just relax and enjoy the scene, but do not drop your guard. It is a location to be visited because it is a part of California film history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sagres96
30,Kinda underwhelming,"It was pretty underwhelming. Don’t expect it to be glamorous, literally just stars on pavements. But I do get the hype over it, but it’s pretty far from what you see on TV. It goes pretty far! If you’re with a group, it’ll lead you into some places you won’t normally just pass by. I say group, because I won’t recommend walking on your own around LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shirannie
10,Worth 10-15 mins of your time,"Unless you must pose for the selfie next to your favorite celebrity's star, the walk of fame is not worth whatever hype it gets. It's a side-walk with stars with names on it. That's it. And lots of street vendors and hustlers trying to sell you something. Put your hands in your pockets to avoid having CD sleeves thrust in your hands. At night, this area is very crowded and there can be lots of homeless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rlj714
50,Tour,I really like the tour. Getting to see the stars at my own pace was nice. The place was cleaner than I thought it would be which was a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed the ability to take pictures and just enjoy and learn at the same time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rbelle50
10,Nothing glamorous,"The Walk of Fame is nothing to write home about. I found Hollywood Blvd disappointing. At no point can you drop your guard - constantly thinking someone might try to hustle you into a dodgy tourist attraction, or try to rip you off. It is vaguely interesting to read the hall of game, but the environment doesn’t really allow you to enjoy it. Very ordinary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NP3003
30,Free fun,"You already know what it is. The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but you have to go there and at least look around. Multiple t-shirt shops, poor people, protesters, and stars with names in them. I recognized about 25% of them and it was fun memories. Not worth a special trip. It basically takes no time because you should add this on to doing something else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoccasinMike
20,underwhelming,"We had a 11 hour layover at LAX, and this one of the items we decided to do (Walk of Fame always seemed interesting). We've now done it, and won't need to see it again. Besides the stars of the sidewalk, not much else in the area (and the immediate area is sketchy).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveller-BL
40,Show from nothing,"In my opinion - nothing special. Long street with name of a lot of people. Even if you is a not famous actor, you can wright your name on this street for $35000). Dolby theater where are the Oscars - nothing special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andriy32
10,Disgusting,"I’ll give it one star for novelty value, because the stars on the street are pretty cool and there are some reasonable establishments that you can visit and hand over your hard earned tourist dollars at.BUT (and this is a big but), for the most part Hollywood Blvd is dirty, dingy, full of homeless people and hawkers and in many places quite simply reeks of urine.Hollywood and L.A. need to sort out their housing issues, because Hollywood Blvd was, with the possible exception of the few hundred meters either side of the Chinese Theatre, quite frankly a huge, disgusting disappointment that really didn’t feel like a safe place to be in 😢",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MendozzaMagic
30,One visit will be enough,"This is one of those ‘tick the box’ tourist attractions that I’m now pleased to say I won’t have to go to again! (Yes, I know I didn’t *have* to go there, but you know what I mean).The whole street was very busy, the footpaths too narrow to accommodate all the sightseers, and then you add street vendors set up on the footpath, and people (understandably) stopping to take photos of the stars, it was very difficult and frustrating to move anywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/973sharynw
20,Disappointing - don't stay too long,"The experience of visiting the Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard isn't half as good as it's famous status implies. For a 'must-do' attraction there is little to see so while worth a quick look if you're in the area, but don't allocate too much time to doing the full walk, just stick to the area by the theatre (the handprints at the TCL Chinese are way more interesting). Celebrity fans may want to do more to find their favourite celeb but will end up wandering out to some run down areas for no great thrill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomgoggin

20,Famous location with crap for sale,"The Walk of Fame is currently a real disappointment. ""Cement"" is a very 1950's technology to employ as a landmark, and you're walking around looking at names in cement. And trying NOT to look at all the crap for sale in the crappy stores, and dodging t-shirt and tour and CD peddlers. Overall, a very un-cinematic experience for the presumptive cinema capital of the world. And garbage everywhere on the side streets. Not a pleasant experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisheavy

30,Nice,"Nice, nothing special compared to the other beautiful attractions. Hollywood looks like Wonderland. Beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D2531KPfedericad
20,A famous landmark in need of a facelift.,"Who wouldn’t want to visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame having journeyed to Los Angeles. And certainly the vast array of film stars heralded in the pavement brought its own interest. But I was shocked with how tired and rundown this iconic area looked. This should be an area which surely should reflect the glamour and razzmatazz of the stars it celebrates. It should sparkle, enthral, captivate, but it instead its surroundings and environment are dowdy, uninspiring and in desperate need of the major face lift its stars and reputation deserve.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaddoDB
20,Nothing special,"There are so many stars on the Hollywood blv that it doesn't seem very important if you have one. The street looks realy dirty, there are many homeless people, many souvenir shops and nothing glamourous at all.You can find many people dressed as famous movie characters who come to take a picture with you and then they ask you for some money. And it is not cheap at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorad689
30,Awesome!,"Whether you're star struck or not, the walk of fame is worth seeing. I loved seeing the stars of my favorite actors and singers. There are real life models dressed up as superheros which is so festive and interactive. It's a very busy place so don't wonder off without your party. There is even a facility to have your own star done (temporarily).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BevS586
30,As close as ordinary mortals can get to the stars!,"No visit to Los Angeles can be complete unless you’ve done Hollywood – and what is Hollywood if you don’t do the Hollywood Walk of Fame?The Hollywood Walk of Fame was a brainchild of E M Stuart, Volunteer President of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce – he came up with the idea in 1953 and it finally became reality seven years later in 1960 – and as they say, the rest of course is history.The Hollywood Walk of Fame honours personalities who have made their mark in five different achievement categories – motion pictures, television, radio, audio recording/music and theatre/live performance. The last category of theatre/live performance was added only in 1984.As of now, there are 2600 five-pointed terrazzo and brass stars set in the sidewalks along fifteen blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and another three blocks of Vine Street.The walk of fame committee that comprises of a chairman and one representative each from the five categories of achievement, receives an average of three hundred nominations annually, of which some ten percent are given the honour every year.Once a person is selected for the honour, those who nominated the achiever have to pay $40,000 towards the ceremony, promotional charges and future maintenance cost of the star.Practically half of the stars on the Walk of Fame are in the motion pictures category followed by about a quarter of them from television – music and radio between them account for the last quarter – obviously that makes for hardly any representation from the live performance category.It is interesting that boxing was deemed to be a form of live performance which is how Muhammad Ali got his star in 2002. His star is also the only one that cannot be stepped on – in line with the legend’s request, it was embedded in the Dolby Theatre’s wall since he did not want his name being walked upon!The very first star on the Walk of Fame went to filmmaker Stanley Kramer – it was installed in March 1960.There are a few illustrious luminaries who have earned stars in more than one category of achievement – Bob Hope, Mickey Rooney, Roy Rogers and Tony Martin have stars in four categories.Those with stars in three categories include big names like Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Jack Benny.However, the distinction of being the only celebrity to have a star in all five categories of the Walk of Fame belongs exclusively to Gene Autry!As far as actor families go, the Barrymores top the list with a whopping six – Lionel with two plus one each for John, Ethel, John Drew and Drew.Apart from the human performers, the Walk of Fame also acknowledges as many as 17 non-human characters – Mickey Mouse was the first to get his star in 1978. Other cartoon characters such as Woody Woodpecker, Bugs Bunny, Donald Duck, Minnie Mouse, Snoopy have all made the grade. As have The Simpsons, Winnie the Pooh, The Muppets, Shrek and Tinker Bell.Some big names like Julia Roberts, Clint Eastwood and George Clooney have turned down a star on the Walk of Fame.While there are many who will carp that the Hollywood Walk of Fame is no big deal, judging by the number of people like me milling around, it still is a big thrill to be here – maybe because this is as close as ordinary mortals can get to the stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
30,It’s Hollywood,You can’t not go see it if you’re in Hollywood actually it would be difficult not to see it since Hollywood is so small. It’s not exactly what they depict in the movies. You will be shocked. But at least you can say you walked the streets famous acting legends walked on. I’d recommend parking at the undergarage parking lot of the mall. I believe it’s called Hollywood Galaxy. You will come out right in the middle of everything you would want to see in Hollywood. All within walking distance and it will save you from parking in unsavory locations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krist_nn
20,Meh! Been there done that,Ok now I can check this off my list. Kinda the thing you need to do if you are in LA but really nothing to write home about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBGoode441
10,Smells,"It is SO not what one expects.... but then Hollywood is all about make believeFar too many homeless people setting up bedding at the intersections of Hollywood Boulevard and coming on the main road to beg.Far too many ""stars"" dressed in fanciful costumes posing for pictures with tourists for a fee.Far too many persons setting up ""stalls"" on the blank stars so tourists can have their name on the start.It is the worst tourist trap I have been to ... Far too crowded even if you know where your preferred star is located it can be missed .... Maybe at night it might be better as the crowd should be less...BUT THE SMELLS ARE DISGUSTING",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CamiddleJm
40,Iconic Hollywood,I had read about this but finally saw it in person. Neat to see. It is distracting while you walk. You might step on a homeless person sleeping on a star!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davanrn

50,Easy and fun,"If walking through Times Square is the essence of visiting NYC, an hour walk up and down the Hollywood Walk of Fame is the heart of a visit to Hollywood. Don't be like me and get a $66 parking ticket on a side street: Pay the $20 to park, and then walk around for an hour or so (plus time to eat, shows, etc.) at no cost. Best place for Hollywood souvenirs. Who knew that Billy Graham and Thomas Edison had stars? Also, check out a new-release movie in a classic, extra nice theatre (of which there are several) for $15-$20/ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessepisors
20,Disappointing,"Hollywood, capital of glamour, movie stars and beautiful people. If it were only so... Hollywood Blvd continues to be a disappointment and an embarrassment to a city that was built on movie glamour. The street is run down with kitschy stores selling tacky gifts. The area can be a bit dangerous at night, as it attracts a rough crowd. I have lived in Los Angeles for many years now, and it's a place I never take my out of town guests whenever they visit frankly, I find it embarrassing. Worth skipping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlC8530VB

Or worse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oladob1
30,"A must see, but it's not what you may think","I thought LA was this fancy place, especially the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

We still had a great time checking out the stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelswithdanielle
20,Dont bother...,"Wasted half an hour walking along the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ridiculously busy with tourists stopping to have their photos taken next to their favourite ""star"" on the pavement.

Kudos to stars like Clint Eastwood, Julia Roberts and George Clooney who turned down nominations to be placed on the WoF.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josh_p01
10,Over hyped,Nothing special about this walk of fame except that it’s famous. The walk is full of over commercialised knock off stores. It’s neither hip nor glitzy. You’re better off at a beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redhooloovoo

30,Cleanup?,"A target of my trip was Hollywood Blvd and the Chinese theater as seen in the movies. The famous walk of fame was very interesting though a little difficult to study due to the crowds mingling around. However a negative impression was all the homeless people sleeping around or begging everywhere around this walk. Experienced this in Times Square in New York in the mid seventies, which later was totally cleaned up. For the sake of LA´s image this should be done by the mayor of LA on Hollywood Blvd as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kim1307
20,As expected,"Very much a tourist spot, busy area, lots of stars in the pavement, lots of people everywhere. Worth a brief visit, but we did not stay long",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AAAAA22
50,Tourist Attraction,"When you travel you always want to see what you will never be able to see in your home town. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is iconic. If you are a fan of movies and Hollywood history then walking along Hollywood Bl is a stroll down memory lane. The sites along that route includes; Mann's Chinese theater (foot prints in stone), wax museum, Ripley's Believe it or not, Capitol Records, Kodak Center (where they hold the Oscar's) and many more. The down side is the area which is a bit seedy and dirty and I would tend to stay away during darkness but it is still a site to see if you are in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/as4beatles
20,Marijuana everywhere,"Hollywood is a dirty city and I wouldn't ever spend much time there. We walked a couple blocks looking at the Walk of Fame and smelled marijuana everywhere. There were people smoking it on the sidewalks and blowing smoke into the crowds with no concern for small kids or people that just don't want any part of that. The stars on the street are fun to see but boring after the first few. You'll see characters walking around the streets to take pictures with but it's not free. There are also people trying to give away ""free"" CDs for their own created albums but if you take one they hassle you for money. Go at your own risk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryan8underwood
20,"Nothing to see, please move along",Its names written on stars on the ground. Thats it. Extremely crowded and hard to move around. I would not recommend going here with a stroller. There are loads of people dressed up as different action figures but the costumes are mostly very bad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefanf590
30,Interesting but scary at times.,"A must for all first time visitors to LA, but there was way too many pan-handlers and pushy ‘vendors’ trying to get you to pose and buy their products. Some of them actually get quite rude when you refuse their approaches, which can get rather scary for the younger kids. ( we had our 9 & 10 year Grandsons with us ).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scojansan
40,Busy and crowded at night,We went in the evening and it was packed with people and street vendors. Go during the week when I would assume it’s a bit quieter and less overwhelming and you don’t have to deal with people rushing you every time you stop to look at a star. Worth it to check out whether you’re just curious or looking for someone in particular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrHanny
30,"Nice walk, a bit busy","It's a nice walk to discover a famous part of Hollywood. You can find your favorite celebrity name.

30,Fun but we were ready,"Thanks to other reviews we found parking at Dolby theater. Which was a mall and located at Highland area. Lots good stars nearby we walked only 2 blocks each way and stopped at McDonald’s for lunch. Don’t eat there, bad service and cold food, never again. But best time was at the TCL Chinese theater as long as your patient people kindly moved every time I spotted one I wanted a photo. I had older teens they both had fun acting like roving body guards preventing rude from walking into the photo. It was a lot of fun! Great weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelJ323
10,Dirty and disappointing,You would think that a place on Los Angeles’ top things to do would be better maintained. The strip is teeming with those cheap characters posing for photos in very bad costumes. You can’t go more than a couple of feet without being accosted by one. There were no less than 6 Spider-Mans on our short visit. The walk of fame was okay but the whole place needs a power wash. Dirty and seedy with no where to use a restroom.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwat70

There must be a map showing the location of the various stars, but I wasn't able to get one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlyAtNight
20,Crowded and Dirty...better Years Ago,"If you want to have a zoo/circus like atmosphere do walk down the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It is like a carnival with every inch of walk someone trying to sell you something or give you something. Once inside the original Chinese Theater front, it is slightly calmer so that you can find a particular hand or foot print. However, back on the sidewalk of fame, good luck. At least the west side of the street is a bit calmer and you can actually see some of the stars. However the whole atmosphere is rather ridiculous , but maybe it was just the December crowd. Anyway that was the last time I would walk down that street.One question concerned Service Animals: I have a Service Dog and wouldn't take it to this location: too crowded and actually too dangerous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bearkat62

30,Crowded & Tacky,"Yes, all the favorites here, including many names unknown...lots of tourists crowding the streets, hawkers wanting to take you on a tour, street food vendors, memorabilia/mementos, street performers and relatively seedy kind of neighborhood. Glad to have done it, but the allure exceeds the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
20,Most police presence I’ve ever seen,We stayed next to the walk of fame during Halloween weekend. I have honestly never seen so much police presence in my life. Made me feel a bit uneasy. Street was full of people trying to push things on us. Like home made CD’s etc. Not sure if I wasn’t looking hard enough but I couldn’t find many bars etc. Was all a bit of a let down tbh. Definitely somewhere I’m in no rush to re visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakej4k3
50,Great Experience!!!,It may seem like a simple thing to do but don't skip this. The Walk of Fame has provided many people with the inspiration they need to jumpstart their own dreams.Everytime I go I feel like I can do so much more in life. Not to mention it's a great journey down memory lane when you were a kid growing up watching these stars become BIG.Good exercise and one of the best touristy things to do in Hollywood that cost nothing. ;),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mighty_Travelers
20,WOW - was not,"Just few blocks of ”life”..cheap crap was sold, clowns with superhero costumes for taking pictures. Salesman asking you to take a Hollywood ride..wow..Anyway saw my teenagetime fav bands star..KISS! ..wow :D..also homeless and junkies a lot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taika_jimi
20,Beware,"Most of the action is centered around the Chinese Theater. Several people in costume you can take pictures with however they want at least a dollar. Would have wanted to walk further down the street to check out the rest of the Stars however the further away you get from the Chinese Theater the scarier it gets. Tons of druggies, homeless, and mental cases walking around. Saw drug deals going on. No police or security patrolling so do not feel safe at all. Recommend staying close to the theater and visiting during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seo95758
40,Great location to travel too,I loved seeing the walk of fame first hand it was really interesting to see all the street meat and people out there making a living in a way I’m not used to seeing. Never really been to America and almost watched a pro trump riot break out yes that was a nice little bonus.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onlybosseats
50,Iconic,We came here especially after we had heard Donald trumps star had been hacked at by a crazy dude. Very funny. Got some great pictures. Very fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgesalmond
10,It's Nasty and Dirty,It's very Dirty and unsanitary! Trash is flying all up and down the walk of fame and homeless people,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/somethingn
40,Nice to stroll around,The famous Walk of fame is great to have a walk around. There are plenty of things to see to spend between an hour or a full day. Take as much time as you prefer. You will walk across the stars of very famous people and characters. I had a nice experience! :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mijo39
30,Just an average attraction,"After previously reading many poor reviews on the area being dirty, the stars being run down and people feeling unsafe while viewing the attraction I came into checking out the walk of fame with cautious yet low expectations. Overall I found the area to be cleaner than what I had expected from what I had read. That being said, at the end of the day these stars are on a sidewalk and most sidewalks no matter where you are from aren’t always clean being exposed to natural elements along with some garbage which can always be expected unfortunately. I visited various sections of the walk of fame at different times of the day and during night and didn’t have any encounters where I felt unsafe. Sure there are homeless people in various areas but I found they kept to themselves without bothering me. Around the area of the Chinese Theatre is where it definitely got crowded at times between people walking and checking out the attractions to people trying to sell items or tours. I can only imagine how busy it is there during the summer months. There are lots of guys that try to hand out cd’s for money in this area but as long as you don’t take it or act like you are too busy for them they don’t really bother you either. All in all I am happy that I got to experience seeing the Hollywood Walk of Fame once in my life but at the end of the day they are just stars in the sidewalk and after you see a few you are interested in the appeal kind of wears off on them. I would say check out as many as you are willing to see since they are free to view but there are much better sights to see while in Hollywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodyt4130
30,Was good... but...,"The Walk of Fame was good that o see. Another thing ticked off the bucket list. But, the place is filthy! Rubbish everywhere, homeless people, drugged up people and the scammers!!! Don’t take anything off anyone here. I read previous reviews and was forewarned about the guys trying to hand out CD’s. And straight away, they tried several times. Just becomes damn annoying.It was great to see the actual Walk of Fame but it should be looked after a lot better than it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shall171
40,Good but not amazing,Something that was on our must do list and was great to wander around but it probably suffers from not being able to live up to the extreme hype for a first time visitor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenGenn
30,Dirty,Whilst visiting LA it is one of the areas you want to visit. It was a real let down. It was so dirty and had lots of people sleeping rough. It was quite scary and once you'd seen one star you'd seem them all. Only constellation was that we did see Michael Buble receive his star. Wouldn't go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevnelaine2016
40,Go to say you've been,The walk is 3.5 miles long so there are many stops along public transportation. We went at night and felt very safe. We only walked a little bit but I am so glad we did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatCincinnati
30,Underwhelming and disappointing!,"We were all really excited to do the Hollywood Walk of Fame and found it a very disappointing experience. Hollywood Boulevard is dirty and a lot of the stars are cracked/damaged. Whilst you are walking along the street you are constantly hassled by people selling trips, stuffing C.D's in to your hands etc. They can actually be quite rude and abrupt. I thought that this would be as see on the TV but nothing like it unfortunately!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m4slcsam
10,So overrated,We did the walk of fame because it is what you do in LA. Definitely would not recommend it. It is not a nice area and it was just a big waste of time. We did not hang around long at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BCSUT
40,. The Hollywood walk of fame and Chinese Theatre,"This is a not to be missed experience. To walk along the pavement and see where the Stars have left their prints. However be prepared to be accosted by young people selling CD's or dressed up in Costumes wanting to have their photos taken with you then asking for money. However if you take it in good humour it can be great fun and we got some great photo's at a price, on our own phones. Just be prepared and don't get ripped off.We thoroughly enjoyed the tour through the Chinese Theatre and at $10 US dollars it was not a bad deal. The ceiling in the Theatre was just amazing.An hour or so will be long enough to spend here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/815robyng
30,deception,"For someone travelling to LA, the walk of fame is the biggest deception. I was expecting a wow factor, as we see on TV with the stars! But nothing of that! Dirty place in LA, Action on only a corner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jim611
30,As expected,"The walk of fame is OK. It was pretty cool to see all the names and the hand and foot prints etc. It was totally as expected - lots of hawkers trying to guilt you into parting with cash and tacky souvenirs. Understandably a ‘must do’ when in LA, but once is enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melinda4061
10,Gross,After going to a museum that was on this strip. I realized where I was at and was not impressed. It smelled of vomit and urine and was very unpleasant. There were so many people that were not paying attention to where they were going and doing. To many people trying to sell tickets and being obnoxious about it. I personally don't care about someone that has a star with their names on them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josecC8527CV
30,See it Once Attraction,"Hollywood in general is disappointing after seeing it hyped up so much, however it is cool to at least visit once in your life. Once you see it Once, you don't really need to see it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexaB944
30,Nice to say you've seen them but grubby area by day.,"It's quite fun to see how many names you recognise but in truth, the area is pretty grubby during the day and the incessant hard sell by tour operators every few yards is stressful and irritating (to me). Area looks nicer at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vinden_G
20,Not so impressive,Early in the morning with all shops closed and shutters full of graffiti does not look too good. Many homeless people within the area. Unobstructed view of stars in the pavement thou.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RudySzymon
30,Interesting place,"One cannot walk or drive through the Hollywood walk of fame without encountering interesting look-a-likes or custumed characters dying to take s photo with you. Guess I am too old to have heard of chew backer, but there he was parading the boulevard. Searching for the star of your favorite TV star is of course the highlight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandrina55
40,Bigger than I thought,"I always wanted to visit this attraction and it was much bigger than I thought. Hollywood Blvd and Vine are much longer than I thought but very interesting identifying the names. We actually saw Sarah Silverman receiving her star on the day we visited. There are plenty of places to stop and have a drink or just people watch. It was a bit less glamorous than I imagined as this is a prime spot for homeless and beggars. The contrast between ""haves and have nots"" is obvious here. Although I felt safe there were some odd characters around. You would think the City would clean the streets and take a little more pride in this area. Even in November there were a lot of people out and about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/444martinu

40,Bought the map & walked the walk!,"We really didn't get to see all of the stars because we were trying to see as much as we could, but we were able to see the Chinese Theatre in the process - across the street from where Jimmy Kimmel is filmed & we also enjoyed visiting Amoeba Music nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacation570351
20,Disappointed,"I had high expectations of tinsel town. Expected it to be fancy. But the streets are dirty, filled with so many homeless people. The open smoking of cannabis is a bit much. You can hardly see the stars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justnats10
10,NOT A SAFE PLACE,"I would rate this as the worst and unsafe US attractions that I have visited, so many homeless and drug addicts walking on the street. People with mask posing with you in photos and later demanding 30 dollars as tip and a big tall African American trying to sell CD that you don't want. Never seen any of these non-sense in other attractions. I would strongly recommend visiting Beverly Hills and rodeo drive and skip this. Hollywood Walk of Fame is NOT A FAME anymore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdhavanJ
40,Hollywood Stars,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is one of the major attractions of Los Angeles city. There are hundreds of stars with the celebrity name written inside it. I personally enjoyed my time here. Best time to visit is the night time when all the lights highlight the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodblogmumbai
20,Disappointing,"The walk has had its past glory days, but those are long gone. It’s sadly dirty, filled with adult shops, street vendors and homeless. There isn't much to see and enjoy. I wouldn’t recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephwc668
30,One and done!,"From St.Louis and the perception in the Midwest is Hollywood is oh so glamorous.. The Hollywood walk of fame unfortunately not so much.. Granite sidewalks with stars cracked and in disrepair.. Tacky souvenir shops everywhere.. bums, druggies, and the smell of urine.. Only decent spot is the Chinese theatre.. Strongly suggest visiting there only to see the theatre’s beautiful architecture and the hand/footprints of your favorite stars.. St Louis isn’t as famous but our “walk of fame” featuring the likes of John Goodman, Chuck berry, and Greta Garbo in the Delmar loop is so much nicer.. Next time in LA I’ll skip Hollywood and cruise the coastal highway or hang at the beach..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shedrivesahotrod
40,Great place to walk around,"Definitely a great place to walk around and take pictures with your favorite stars. It can be quite crowded depending on the time of day.

30,Cool to see,While on the city tour we stopped in downtown Hollywood and I had a chance to see all of the stars. It was pretty cool but most needed some upkeep. I still enjoyed seeing the stars in person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigDob
50,A must See,"Okay if you are near the LA subway Red Line Take it, its inexpensive, safe and fast. Its just a joy to walk both sides of the Street and watch how the neighbor changes, don't be alarm when the store fronts start looking a little shabby, all is good and SAFE. Many,Many Stars to look at and depending how old you are it just a walk down Memory Lane just a must see if in Los Angeles.By the way,Window Shopping is every place but you do have enough Restaurants to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbq12018

The scams are like the previous travellers said. The blacks said that the CD is free, shake hands and ask for your name, then write your name on the CD, force you to accept the CD and pay $5; You have to accept it, you will have to pay for it; It's a bad place!

30,A LOS ANGELES MUST,"A great visit to Hollywood isn't complete without going to the Walk of Fame; however, know that it isn't just 1 block, but several and to see the star names that you desire you will need the map.

This place is interesting in a strange way but it’s rundown appearance and sheer grubbiness is a huge surprise. The performers represented by the stars in the walk are legend.

Not to make fun of or to demean but to draw attention to the fact that we can’t house our own, how on earth do we take in thousands more? They lie on the sidewalks and you just walk by. I did not see any trouble or problems. But why in America I have to ask? And then we will build houses for refuges?

30,Busy,This wasn’t as well kept as I thought it would be. Bit dusty and untidy in places. However still something you should go to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianecN9589CI
30,Not impressive,"We saw this on our tour of LA. While it was cool to see I was not impressed at all. I thought it would have been cleaner but all it is is a bunch of stars with names on them.Years ago it might have been something but right now it's a sidewalk with stars in it and names. Area is not kept up. Would I say visit it, yes, it's been around for ages but just don't expect the wow!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/campgram
40,Must Experience in Person,"As I looked down to see the next star; each person seemed more iconic than the last. The only downside to walking the streets to see the stars, is that you will end up apologizing more than you ever have before, due to walking with your eyes glued to the sidewalk. This was an experience that you need a fully charged phone, camera and time on your side because you will be Amazed at the names that you stumble across!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnySpnt
30,Gotta do it.,Ratty stores. Tons of tourists. Between the rap battles and the fake Spidermen... Are these stars. Heads are down a d phones are focused on getting the right shot. From the obscure to the obvious... There is someone for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rubten
20,Homeless Walk of Fame,"Hollywood Boulevard is the poor man’s Disney. The streets are grimy and you can’t see many plaques because usually they’re buried in trash, gum and dirt. Parking is outrageously expensive. The surrounding area is dirty. And filled with the homeless There are also overpriced tours in very dangerous converted trucks. They take you to places where stars used to exist years ago but don’t anymore. It’s a ripoff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K3188VZmichaelg
50,Star Gazing,"An iconic spot for sure. You’ll be amazed at how many stars there are and how many different sidewalks actually make up the walk of stars. The main spot is in front of the El Capitan and Grauman Chinese theater. Hollywood and Highland has transformed into a huge spectacle in the last decade. As you look for your favorite star’s star, you’ll come across various characters offering photos, tricks, Performances, etcLots of souvenirs and restaurants and bars. Very safe and accessible by metro, ride share, however you wish.Tonight is The holiday parade.Lots of families but also cool if you’re alone and just want to wander around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terrylQ3610HY
40,Everyone and anyone,"Great to see the names of yesteryear, and to be able to visualise them. Amazing the brains ability to recall faces. Great tribute to a century of entertainment!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enjoymentguy
30,Not worth a ton of time,"Was here on business and walked over to see it from the Loews hotel. It was a jumbled mess during the day with people trying to scam you with cd's, drawing and pictures. Glad to have walked a few blocks and see it along with the Dolby and the Mann Theater. Once was enough and we would likely not return.On my first day got up early and walked a few blocks on Hollywood Blvd. to get some exercise. it was a mistake and I did not feel safe. Headed back to hotel after a couple blocks walk. Lots of homeless and scammers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parcapecod
40,Place of the stars,"An interesting landmark in a nce location. However the street was very dirty and you need to wtach out for tuorist traps - pictures, CD's etc. But still has its cool feeling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bence23
20,See The Chinese Theatre Then Leave,"Visited LA for four days with a young family. Booked a hotel in Hollywood just off Hollywood Boulevard thinking it would be convenient and interesting to be based close to the walk-of-stars (what LA is known for). This turned out to be a mistake.The walk-of-stars (and surrounding area) is disturbingly dirty, including pervasive and powerful urine and marijuana odours.The constant harassment by street hawkers is the worst I have experienced anywhere in the world.The chronic homelessness is very sad and was especially confronting for our children. There was many instances of people obviously under the influence of drugs.My advice is do a tour of LA, jump-off at the Chinese Theater, grab a couple of snaps and move on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelpE8192CW
30,Star struck,The walk of fame is nothing we imagined a lot of the stars set in the ground require cleaning or some maintenanceThere seems little respect from some locals to the area which is a shameNice to see and acknowledge the stars you know or who you have heard of,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leewD2072CN
40,Nice straight Street,"Nice walk and easy to reach. Just out of metro station. Plenty of foods, shops and entrainment outlets. Show and attractions areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albert_Teo77
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame was worth the visit to me. Not only did i get to see stars in every creative field but the visit also offered other points of interest. I saw the outside of the Jimmy Kimmel Studio and the Dolby Theater. Also, the Chinese Theater and Hard Rock Cafe. It was fun and interesting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mroath46
40,It's the Hollywood Walk of Fame Dahhlings..,"Self explanatory, but I must say don't get your hopes up, it doesn't look like the movies at all! You need to google the name and location of the star you're looking for ahead of time or you will be walking around Hollywood looking all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ButterflyHoney
30,Hollywood walk of Homeless and Trash,"This place is nice on itself, hunting down your favorite stars star. But when you get there you can’t see anything because of the homeless and trash littering the area. It needs a cleanup unless you want to be bothered by homeless every 30 seconds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolasftv
30,Pros and cons.,"The walk of fame is iconic so it’s a must do on your trip.But there’s so many people trying to get your to take their Hollywood tour every few steps, it was beyond irritating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danniranger
10,Disappointed,"We have just arrived home from a holiday to LA. I had a vision in my head of what the 'Walk of Fame' would be like. I thought it would be sign posted, lots of lights , all glitz and glam. I didn't even realise I was walking down it....until I looked down and just about saw a star on the floor. The stars had stalls set up all over them. People cooking/ selling food, jewellery, tourist souvenirs etc. I was sooo disappointed. The whole area looks rundown and in need of some T L C. Sorry Hollywood but you didn't meet my expectations at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackie_dodds
30,Seedy Area,Most of the stars are dirty and cracked. Hard to get pictures of individual stars since the sidewalks are so overcrowded. Too many homeless and questionable characters around to feel safe especially at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DouglasH779
30,Hollywood walk of fame stars,The side walks are not kept clean and littered with able bodied young homeless. It's a shame when you can't take a picture without someone laying on the sidewalk expecting the working class to support them. There's no excuse for these people to be so lazy and entitled. Time to clean up the area. Those who really need and want help.....get it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gingergeor
30,Crowded place,The entire street was very crowded with tourists and street side vendors. There are no proper signages around. We have a lot hawkers surrounding you to sell stuffs.It would be helpful if there are some boards indicating about the prominence of the place and the must see stuffs. There is none as such.The walkways are too narrow for a tourist place like this,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pradeepkumar008
20,"Interesting, but so dirty","Walked quite a bit of the WOF during a recent trip to LA. My hubby had been before and wanted me to see the stars and experience the walk. Must say I was disappointed and really wouldn't bother with this experience again. It is nice to see some of the names etc. but the area is dirty and crowded and there is a lot of homeless and people trying to sell things and also religious demonstrators were out the front of the Chinese Theatre getting a bit in your face. I am not critical of the homeless, far from it, I feel very sorry for them, but overall I was really disappointed when it looks nothing like the promotional materials due to the state of the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyLyn
10,Scum & Villainy,"You won't find a more retched hive of scum &villainy anywhere. But this is not a movie and youare not sitting safe in a movie theatre.You, the tourist are the target and soon to bevictim. If you insist on going there, do not underany cirumstances accept anything from anyone!My nephew made the big mistake of accepting a CDhanded to him. He tried to return it, but theperpetrator demanded money.Things got ugly.When I tried to intervene on his behalf, theperpetrator said f**c you cracker over and over.To say I didn't feel safe is a understatement.Never did see any law enforcement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adventure669151
30,Could be a lot cleaner!!!,"Spent a month in LA so seen basically all the tourists attractions in the city. The walk of fame looks so much better on post cards as once you are there you will be disappointed just how the street and area looks dirty. Yes there are thousands of tourists like us. There are many excellent performers on the street looking like famous celebrities, but the street is so dirty that makes you sad and we couldn’t understand after all the money being generated by tourists, yet that part of LA is dirty & neglected. They really need to take better care of their famous city...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodies588
40,Touristy walkway with history,We walked the walk of fame several times while visiting Hollywood. The walk extends 15 city blocks and can reach some seedy spots but all in all it was good fun to look for some of our fav stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaddleWarrior
30,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"I loved seeing the stars but unfortunately, the area surrounding it seems a bit dirty. Also, there were lots of people trying to sell tours and other stuff and it felt a bit like a carnival. I wasn’t comfortable being down there after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5035FNjohns
30,nice to to visit,As my wife and I had been before we decide to take the kids as it was there 1st time there seems to be a lot of costume dressers and scammers out to make a dollar just be careful as they don't like there photo taken unless you give them money watch out for the cd guys as they can be intimidating the best thing is to walk straight pass just don't stop. the street is dirty and very noisy it does get quieter when you get pass a few blocks away from the Chinese Theatre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigedd
20,Average,"On our trip to LA we did Hollywood Walk of game. The street is dirty and too many costume dressers, they approach u too many time.Recommend not to spend too much time as u have so many other places to see in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poojak979
50,Fun!,We are a family of 5 with ages ranging from 12 to 61 and we all had a great time! The Hollywood Walk of Fame is about 15 blocks long. We would definitely recommend!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TDDRN
20,Wouldn't bother,"Street is dirty, place is packed, lots of weirdos, and local parking companies are a rip off. Although nice to spot the names of your fav celebs it does get boring quickly. The Chinese theatre was also disappointing. If you want to go make sure you park in the shopping centre car park as much more reasonable as the local companies try to take your eye balls out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neilm920
30,short break before returning home,Was a good experience however the beggars and ticket touts and people trying to sell you there cd's was a put off if I ever return to L.A I would definiatley ignore them,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/885laurencec
30,Hollywood walk of fame.,It is a lot of walking. It was cool to see the stars. There are homeless people laying on some of the stars. It’s a shame. The shops were nice and can buy nice things. The Chinese theatre was cool. You can see the Hollywood sign from on of the streets which was cool. There are nice restaurants to eat as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayval68
40,Interesting,"Had looked forward to seeing this iconic site, was a little disappointed in how some if the stars had been maintained. Saw a few that were seriously cracked and/or chipped. Wondered who does the upkeep on the walkway. Besides that, the rest of the walk was amazing. Saw many names from my childhood, and was amazed by the number if stars who had multiple stars due to the different mediums they performed. I don't think I would visit again, but it was a cool experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bashfulliz
30,Tourist trip,"So disappointed when we got there, it was dirty some of the stars were damaged & filthy & so many beggars+ ticket touts who won’t leave you aloneOnly thing good was when you found a star that you wanted to take pic of you had to be quick so cant understand how people have time to kneel so they can fit there hands in stars tried once nearly got trampled as people don’t stop would not go back so I’ve crossed this as 1 & only visit not to return",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/659is
40,Great to see,Had an amazing morning walking the walk of fame with my partner was a little disappointed that some were covered by stands on the street and the red carpet for events going on even when the events were finished,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kingston1212
30,A to do for sightseeing,Fun but be wary of the costumed street performers. They want a tip per costume. They dont split tips. My daughter pulled money out to find a dollar and they took a ten dollar bill out her hand and hurried off.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2bizzygirls
40,Hunting known names,"Nice to have a leisure walk on this street with all tourist, hunting known starts in this street. Fun and excitement if you have children or a small group for hunting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheshagirishenoy
30,It’s just a street,"If you’re visiting LA and are looking for things to do then by all means walk around the area and find your favorite star, but that’s all it is. It’s a nice walk to explore it all but the area is filled with tourists and it’s not the cleanest neighborhood in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CostasDaGreek
20,Surprisingly disappointing!,"We found the overall visit to be quite disappointing, a neighborhood that you don't want to be wandering around in when it gets late. Not as glitzy and exciting as was imagined. Very touristy. Nearby farmer's market is where we had the most fun.Dorothy, Camarillo",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorothyf555
50,Wow!!!,You just have to be here to experience this place - go in the evening and roam through the road - check the stars on the walk of fame and recall the history of a century of movie making the big stars who made it all!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7099rishid
10,"Sadly, a dirty and decay experience; reminiscence rivaling a failed third-world country","Think of any failed third-world country and the superimpose the problems associated (contemptuous ambivalence and apathy, dirt, decay, poverty, homelessness, extreme economic and social dichotomy, crime, etc) over the stars and you have a good representation of what to expect.Expect to be unpleasantly assailed and accosted on all levels if you tour the area, especially at night on the weekend.A sad living monument to oh so much....but that is just my opinion. Your experience may vary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephmelow
50,The Famous Walk of Fame,I have traveled to Hollywood/ Los Angeles a few times before but this is the first time that I made it to the Walk of Fame. It was a cool experience. Hollywood Boulevard is very dirty and it doesn’t seem like they clean it too much but it is cool to see all of your favorite entertainers stars. Plenty of people will try and sell you something or a tour but you can tell them no and they move on quick. A must visit to Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/546jimmya
50,Fun but crazy,"Crazy, crazy, crazy, that will be your first impression of the Hollywood walk of fame, but actually if you look past the craziness you will find a lot of cool stuff, the parking can be an issue and expensive,so I would suggest downloading an app call parking buddy,it gives you locations of car parks and how much they cost there all around 10 dollars but you can get lucky and maybe find one a bit cheaper, there are some colourful characters all wanting your attention so be cautious, there are a lot of people dressed up in character costumes who will have a picture taken but you are expected to tip them at least 10 dollars, it takes a full day to see everything even though it's not that a big an area it's just the volume of people...get there early morning get parked up and take your time, eating can be a problem also with the amount of people and queues are likely, would I go back again....yes but I would get there early...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanhK4442UP
30,If you love movies..especially the old ones,"I have heard so much about the Hollywood Walm of Fame over the years. I really enjoyed looking at them all. But this is only interesting , imho, if you love film. The neighborhood is seedy and awful with cheap shops , very rundown and dirty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Macrosantafe
20,Wouldn't go there again,"Place is neglected and dirty, homeless people running around, sleeping on the stars and in front of Chinese theatre. Stars are cool but that is it. We saw 15 police officers arresting some crazy guy who was yelling on the street so all together not a nice experience. Place doesn't seem safe to walk at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TikicaOs
30,Typical tourist attraction,"There are alot of ""characters "" here, in costume and out. Beware of the ""actors/super heros"", nothing is free! Its very similar to tunes square in NY , Just smaller.Pretty dirty considering the area. But, def worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melissa_Bmore
20,Dirty and rough,"Visited here from the UK whilst on our honeymoon. We knew before going that it isn’t all you see in the movies but we went just to tick it off the bucket list. We stayed for around 45mins before heading on to Griffith Park. I wouldn’t come back to the boulevard it’s dirty and just souvenir, weed and sex shops not really anything to see or do. The stars themselves are not well maintained and you can’t stop to look anyway as it’s too crowded or full of homeless people who will talk to you if you stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrincessPanoullie
50,Star hunting,picture taking with the stars in the famous walk of fame.... a lot will offer you to take a photo with them but just be reminded that you will have to pay them for it afterwards :D,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nejn2015
40,Interesting place.,Place has a lot to see and do. We really enjoyed seeing all the different stars. Lots of action all around. Some of it seemed a “little sketchy” but overall it was a fun time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/serafina6
50,Walk baby walk,"OK. Get yourself a good pair of sneakers for this. This was definitely a longer walk than I thought it would be. Be prepared and stretch really good. The stars are on both sides of the street and are sometimes placed side by side or opposite facing, i.e... one up, one down. Now I didn't go with a map or down loaded the walk of fame app. I suggest if you're looking for a specific star to do so. I walked both sides in order to get the full effect. There were plenty galore to see. Even names that I didn't recognize. It gave me incentive to look them up or remember those of a by gone entertainment era. Keep in mind you are walking on a side walk so it's not so clean. I didn't get to see the stars with their foot prints and hand prints because it was veterans day and they were having an event. So check before you go to make sure it's open to the public that day.Now with that said there are plenty of tour guides along the street that you can take. Do your research before you go. Some tours maybe and hour with commentaries and a few stops others you can get for a whole day. They range from $50 to $100. If you want a persona tour call ahead and arrange for a group of friends and family. They are way more personally and catered to your needs. You get more from those tours too. Those range from $400 to $1000. You can split the cost with family and friends and it will be cost effective if it's enough of you together. Over all I enjoyed my time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolep629
30,Interesting people watching but there are minuses,"Hollywood Blvd, as well as Sunset, are the two most touristy areas in L.A. While LAPD does a great job in maintaining a presence via bicycle, foot, helicopter, horse, motorcycle, and vehicle patrol, the biggest issue is rampant marijuana usage and the nightly huge crowds making driving or parking ""problematic."" It's rather fun, but be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peoplehavetherights
10,Tacky and too busy,Biggest let down ever! Very tacky crowded area!I really can’t think of anything positive to say about the area.Decided to leave for dinner ASAP.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulW319
40,Do not miss,"You can't come to Los Angeles and not do the Hollywood walk of fame. Yes, it's weird and tacky, and the people are very questionable, but it is a must. You see so much of Hollywood in TV and films so to actually go to the walk of fame is very surreal and worth the visit.We spent an hour walking from one end to the other and stopped outside the Chinese Theatre and in a couple of gift shops. We enjoyed it, and of course completely free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcglassa
30,Eh...it's a bunch of stars,"I'm not really seeing what the big fuss is all about. It's a bunch of stars on the ground. Maybe you can take a picture with your favorite actor's star or see how many of the Stars you recognize, but there wasn't a lot to do here. There are better free attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curious446526
30,Getting Run Down,"This is an exciting strips to see the stars, see the tourist traps and have dozens of vendors trying to sell you tours and other miscellaneous items. It’s a busy and exciting strip but some blocks are run down. You’ll see homeless people asking for money and struggling artists trying to get tips, which can be a harsh reality that everyone doesn’t “make it.” It’s something to see once, but there’s plenty of nicer things you can do and see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdl07c
40,Where even you are a star,"It's a lovely walk on the street where you can read the name of so many masters of acting cinematography musicians and who's who of the long legion of Hollywood those lovely academy award holders who really have changed the scenario of the industry worldwide. We know some and not others who have been behind the making of those great names..all the way to award theater..the glitzy walk makes you pass Capitan theater, Chinese tcl theatre, not to mention Kodak theater which has been the pioneer. Now shrouded around the lively and vibrant eateries, big stores, momento stores, wax museum, not to miss out on Ripley's believe it or not...this time it had on display the most expensive dress of Marilyn Monroe...who was the trend setter of glamour read out the name of Lucile ball, Elizabeth Taylor, Michael Jackson, Julie Andrew and so many and then have a Hollywood tour to see the mansions of those rich and famous.. surely a good place to spend a day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Himanshu1959
30,Historic but falling apart,"While it holds exactly what a walk of fame provides, but what you don't read about is the poor condition it is in. There are various unruly characters roaming around in costumes and when you take pic, they ask for money. Various homeless people sleeping on and around, which is ironic display from stardom to pauper. Around the walk of fame also there is lot of garbage and most of the plaques are graffitied. Overall, yes def a place to visit, but don't hold high expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525atulc
50,CRAZYNESS BUT FUN TO SEE,Along the strip you will see crazyness.Watch your bags just in caseThere' is cheap souvenir shops as well as people dressed up wanting a tip for a photo. Some are pushy you will soon learn to say no thank you.Chinese Threatre there'. As well as Dolby theatre where they have the awards.Hint if your looking for a certain celebrity star down load find a star app to locate it.Hooters is a cheap place for food and drinks it is family friend and girls can go in girls are nice and dressed well.Visit tje roosevelt hotel for history walk through to foyer and the pool as marilyn munroe fans will know she lived there' for a while.You can do celebrity tours from the strip. Also adjoins the highland shopping centre lots of good shops.Enjoy the crazyness,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deesimone

30,Overrated,Hollywood walk of fame was quite average to be honest. The amount of hype it gets from the public media makes it sound like it’s a pristine classy attraction... it was most definitely not that allWas very dirty and a lot of homeless people around and scammers.Must see if you’re travelling to LA but wouldn’t visit again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calebwtn
40,Walk of fame,Had fun looking for all of the great stars. Walked down one side of Hollywood Blvd then the other. Lots of cool shops to go in and eat or shop along the way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jerryshauling5412
20,Dirty and a bit disappointing....go super early if you must,"Having been to LA before and knowing the stars are a bit of a let down, our friends really wanted to see them so off we went.My advice, go around 7am if you must, then the sun is up (just) and the parking is easy and they do actually clean some of the pavements (sidewalks).It’s still grubby and lots of homeless people but you should get an uninterrupted photo of your favourite star.Definitely look up one of the websites first to find the exact location of your favourite people, they will give you the address of what building they are outside so you don’t spend hours wandering aimlessly looking at people you have no idea who they are/were.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshBush

50,Find your favorite star,The sidewalks with stars is a few blocks. This is an interesting area with stores and restaurants. Parking is available in nearby lots. Public transit goes here. People in costumes walk around here. Some of the studios are nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalgaryWoman
40,Worth seeing,"Great experience although you may be surprised by the amount of homeless people, everyone wants your money.Some of the street performers are really good and worth tipping.You probably won’t feel the need to visit more than once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/01Emrah

40,Slightly disappointing,"I would assume this would be a pride & joy to most but some of the stars were cracked or damaged in some way. It's a but sad to see cigarette butts being stomped out on the stars etc, I thought it would have been treated a lot better.You really can't take it all in either without feeling like you are in the way because technically you are and will be if you stop at each star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slothsrule
40,crowded,must see attraction but very crowded. still enjoyed walking around. helps if you have done some research before hand of the stars you want to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahkG227ZL
30,Hollywood walk of Fame,"Our teens wanted to see Hollywood walk of Fame & Chinese Theater. I have to say, it's always crowded, the sidewalks not so clean, many homeless & people on drugs as well. Some of the starts are cracked or missing. Worth going to at least once. I have been a few times but this text seemed not so fun, trying to walk with so many people. Chinese Theater was more worth our time. this trip we parked further away and walked a lot. Park near Chinese Theater, rather than walking so much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/143erinnv

20,dirt,unbelievableHollywood is the most dirt place ever visited .the walk of fame is more clean but is a tourist fraud many taxi driver and try to sell you tour and other stuff .very disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gca009
40,Busy,"Is a must visited area, crowded, mostly tourist. Less restaurants. Moreover shopping area. Need to be careful of of the time. Homeless is just around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherrylynlarona
10,Not worth the hype and unpleasant,"The concept of the walk of fame is great however the reality is quite different. It seems to be a poorly disguised way of trying to get money from visitors in any way possible! The stars themselves were quite fun to look at as you follow the trail, but hard to enjoy when you are being solicited from all directions every few yards. The atmosphere ends up being a little aggressive and this mixed in with the open street drug-use makes for an unpleasant experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessstompy
10,Will never go back.,Please listen to the reviewers who are giving this a realistic rating. We went about 12 years ago and enjoyed it. I wish I could say the same this time. It is VERY dirty. No openly accessible public bathrooms and a large homeless population in that area adds up to pungent odors and trying to find a walking free of urine. There is no nostalgia left in that area. It’s pretty awful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChillyCanuck_1
20,Dirty and a total Let down,"Now that I have see it, I’ll never go back! It’s trashy, it’s dirty and so many homeless or people drugged up lying on the streets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angitas
30,A Bit of a Let-Down,"A place to have a look at but not quite sure what the fuss is about. As it’s on the main street it’s very busy so it’s difficult to take time to look at individual stars and in any case the pavement slabs are a bit underwhelming. We were there when Jennifer Garner was being endorsed and it was absolutely chaotic as the walkway was blocked off and people were diverted onto the street behind barriers, combined with passersby who were stopping to take photos meant that the area ground to a halt. If you want to see something worthwhile, have a look at the area in front of the Chinese Theatre, it’s full of hand (and footprints) of all the greatest Hollywood stars past and present.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ste653
30,Long,"The walk of fame is a must see, which means you will be seeing it with many, many others. In this very upscale area the whole experience is a bit downscale, with the sidewalk lined with scruffy souvenir shops, and the pavement populated by Superhero impersonators, religious zealots proclaiming the end of the world and quite a few people for whom it appeared to have already arrived. The handprints in front of the Chinese theatre were pretty cool, but be prepared to walk a lot if you want to see all of the stars. Kicking off point for good tours of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SB01
30,A Must Do,"It’s like visiting the HOLLYWOOD sign or Universal studios. You have to do it. But, you probably wouldn’t do it twice in a lifetime. A tad underwhelming. But I’ve done it and it’s out of the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoydY517
30,Disappointed,"Great to see, but my expectations were different to reality. When it's busy people are walking all over the stars, there's trash, weeds and other debris in the pavement that don't give the sparkly appearance that you see in films. There is hundreds to see and recommend you pick up a map.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melaniehN6420AP
20,Dirty and cheap,"Disappointing , full of street vendors and pushy sales people , the McDonald’s in the Main Street was the dirtiest I have ever seen with homeless people seemingly allowed to go through the bins inside while you eat.Wife refused to eat anything and described the toilets as disgusting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skiralph
10,Terrible,"If you enjoy the smell of urine and marijuana and like seeing homeless people everywhere- then this is the place for you. Unfortunately this place is trying to hold onto the fame and fortune of yesteryear and a must see location. I was so excited to visit this area on a recent trip and was disgusted on how terrible it was. It was dirty and the stars were damaged, no maintenance seems to occur. Something needs to be done! Disgraceful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Browning139
10,Depressing,"Was in LA for our honeymoon and we were really looking forward to this trip. Like everywhere in California, the homeless crisis is visible for all. I did not expect the hollywood walk of fame to be laden with drug addicts, prostitutes and people without shoes or clothes. It is a sorry place and i would not rush back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Colin_303
40,Bring your cameras,The Hollywood Walk of fame is a fun stop for all tourists. We went seeking to view several but especially Michael Jackson's star on the walk. It was easy to find as it was the most crowded with flowers left by others.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0221Serendipity
30,Skip it - - Graumann's is so much better,"While it is nice I suppose to see the stars, you are just essentially looking at someone's name. Also, my understanding is that one has to also pay for part or all of their star, so I guess I just find the whole thing a little silly. Parts of the Walk are overcrowded with people looking at other things too. To me, going to Graumann's Chinese Theater is so much better because you can actually see stars' handprints and footprints as well as their ""writing"" in the cement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyj466
50,Great Tourist Spot,"We went here at night it was okay. Definately not a clean place like it appears in the movies. But, it was good to experience it and see the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramonaa531

Felt quite grotty and lots of people dressed up trying to take photos with your children and then demanding money, be earned and totally ignore them!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/669katys
30,One visit is enough,"Pretty standard attraction heavily touristic with loads of souvenir shops. It gets very repetitive quite quickly. You are likely to be stopped plenty of times from people selling tours, cds etc. Visit was worthy but one was enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/672michalisa
30,Overhyped,Nothing special but the marketing done on the walk of fame is incredible. Anyhow the arts are fading away and are not kept properly and so many homeless people and the place definitely needs cleaning up. The only star worth seeing is Muhammed Ali.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MahmoudAGD

20,LA Walk of Fame,"I live in LA and each time a family member visits me from out of state, this is the first place they want to visit. I get it, it's HOLLYWOOD. However, the walk of fame isn't what the movies make it out to be. It smells like urine, its over crowded, there is trash and homeless people everywhere hassling you for money and the restaurants-shopping are way over priced.It is a smelly and draining experience. I recommend you drive down Hollywood Blvd if you want to see the Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/exploring1111
20,Gross,"This area really needs to be cleaned up! It smells like urine and marijuana. It was cool to see the stars but I wanted to get out of that area asap. Didn't feel the safest and just a rough part of town, and I've been a lot of places. Really sad that the area is so bad!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderlustingWalker

10,Give this a miss!,"Hollyweird is a filthy place, the walk of fame is filthy, the footpath/sidewalk is littered with vagrancy and rubbish.We couldn’t wait to get out of the area, what a run down place.... definitely not a place to take the family...it’s in need of a giant broom to sweep the place clean or maybe an enema.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lincolnh44

40,Nice walk and tons of souvenirs,"Very nice walk once you park at the flat fee Loya nearby. You get to see all the stars of your favorite artists and bands. Can even eat or have a drink at the many bars on the Hollywood Blvd.Be careful with the people that are high and publicly smoking weed - some tried to touch other people and that was not nice.But overall, nice walk when the weather is nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1968mayrap

40,Popular but a little run down,"When walking on Hollywood Boulevard, you see all the stars, street performers, even where they film tv shows. But it’s also kind of sketchy in certain parts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ffraioli
20,"Dirty, sleazy disappointment","For all but the adolescent awestruck, these several kilometers of sidewalk are apt to be a big disappointment. The embedded pink stars of Hollywood's most popular cinema, television and discography famous are literally under foot and filthy. The boulevard itself is lined with hustlers, smelly fast food and crumby souvenir shops. Nevertheless, like Mont Saint Michel, the allure is probably too strong to avoid it completely, so I suggest you start at Hollywood and Vine and walk up to the Grauman theater. There, at least, there is enough reverence for the famous foot and hand prints in cement to be cleaned regularly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CGK101
30,Not the place I thought,"The boulevard is full of people and souvenirs stores. Looks like a local market as there are a lot of street food shops, street artists. Some of the stars are dirty and some adiacent streets seem dangerous. I think it's a one time place to see in LA, a bit overrated",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaduS90
30,Found my name on the walk of fame!!!!!,Must say I wasnt sure what to expect. However it's not easy looking down and trying to read the star names without bumping into people. It's a very hectic area however I managed to find who I was named after! But over all fun to walk and see!!!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/971annettea
20,Harassed over a star,This was very average. It was very difficult finding certain people's stars. I visited one in particular where I was harassed by bystanders for taking a picture of. It was incredibly uncomfortable and unnecessary. There is no sense of security here either- LAPD is scarce.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellbelllll

The theatre where distinguished awards are given the foot path has been marked with Stars, on famous artist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VinodB460
50,Iconic if a bit cheesy...,"The Hollywood walk of fame is a must, if a bit cheesy. The class of days gone by are long dead and the walk is now filled with pizza stands, tacky souvenir srores and corporate owned shops. It’s not all doom and gloom as a few remaining old book stores and vintage costume shops remain and be sure to veer just off the boulevard to grab a drink at the many brew pubs and cocktail bars nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/murmurpictures
20,An underwhelming experience,"The rather filthy state of Hollywood makes this a rather disappointing experience. Beware the multitude of unconvincingly dressed up characters who photo bomb your pictures and then demand payment. I am sure that once upon a time this would have been quite an attraction to visit, but sadly no longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisCDC
20,"Disappointing, filthy and let down.","Spent time in LA and Vegas before we ended up in Hollywood. I was shock by the amount of homeless sleeping on the seats within the Hollywood Blvd. This did not reflect the glamorous persona of 'Hollywood'.Ppl smoking Cannabis on the streets, can't remember the last time I was walking on a side walk at 8am in the morning and had to walk through a cloud of cannabis smoke from someone puffing on a joint!? (it's ridiculous I think)The actual stars (and there are over 2000 of them) we're filthy, dirty and very unkempt again not meeting the glamorous ideal I had of this areas industry. I'd be ashamed of I had A Star on that street in that condition, it wouldn't feel reflective of the apparent recognition (to the person) of their achievements. The local government need to realise and appreciate how much tourists/tourism keep this town going. In doing this they need to cater to the expectations (or at least appear to be) for the clientele they want to attract. Between the smog (and it's thick), the severely congested traffic, the homelessness, the cannabis smokers all over the streets, along with the harassing beggers outside all the popular tourist locations it was hard to remain enthusiastic about heading out each day. I wouldn't waist your time and I wouldn't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mljjones1
40,Famous street....,"We spent five days at Hollywood and managed to visit the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame.The street were busy with full of tourists and local. There were plenty of souvenir shops along the street where you can buy souvenir at affordable prices.You can take plenty of pictures here and be amazed by people from all walks of live in one place.Along the street there were some restaurant such as Hard Rock Cafe, Doner King just to mention a few.Just be mindful of those giving you a free CDs as they want some money for it.We’re glad to be able to visit this famous street and would love to make a comeback one day, hopefully.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stomping

30,Over-hyped tourist attraction.,"If you love celebrities, or want to take a ""walk down memory lane"" and see all of the old TV and movie stars names in the pavement, this attraction might be worth seeing for you.But with the exception of the Hollywood & Highland shopping center (outdoor mall) and Disney's El Capitan Theatre, there isn't much to see on Hollywood Boulevard. The further east of Highland you go, the more grungy it gets, with souvenir shops everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
30,Something to see...I guess,"If you’ve never seen the stars along the walk of fame, it is something to see...But really its just there unless you’re looking for a particular person’s star. The streets are crowded and everyone is looking down and yelling out names. Pedestrian traffic all comes to a halt when someone stops to take a pic.On an average day, that part of Hollywood is anything but glamorous as it’s dirty, packed and everyone trying to separate you from your money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HomeBaseAK

30,Very disappointing and rough,"This has been our dream to go and see the walk of fame. Omg what a total let down.It's situated on a dirty and grotty long road, nothing like you see in the films. I was so surprised to see that a lot of the stars names were constantly repeated as you go along. I thought they were unique one offs? Obviously not.The main stars are by the theatre where premiers take place. Here you will see the major film stars and big name stars. The actual theatre itself was great. This is where you can see hundreds of hand and finger prints. This was amazing and staff were on hand to tell you about them. There was a Marilyn Monroe lookalike who was great, she told us about the earing in the ground and that Marilyn wanted to out a diamond into the ground but it wasn't allowed. This was a great experience.The main walk of fame was dirty and felt very unsafe. As expected, loads of merchandise stands and people offering you tours, that's no problem. This issue we had were aggressive men walking up to you and shoving a CD into your face saying, HERE TAKE MY BRAND NEW CD, ITA FREE. No it wasn't, and when you refused, they became abusive and saying SHOW AOME F*****G LOVE. It felt very intimidating. So much so, we saw what we wanted and left very quickly.It was great to see it but very much a let down and extremely busy. Just be careful when you go and have your wits about you at all times, you can see the homeless (hundreds of them) all watching every move you make. Just be careful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simontR2320TT
50,Always nice!,A walk to find and see your favourite performers is exciting! A treasure hunt for all age groups! Don't forget the handprints at the theatre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASRSKSSS

10,Care about performers,"You should care about performers especially CD sellers. I paid 120 dollars for only 2 persons as tip, even though I said ""I don't need it"". They said ""tip! tip! tip!"" loudly. I couldn't move because of them. Anyway it was worst experience in my life. I never go to this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sh08us2
30,Hmmmm,So not sure exactly what i expected.. however after walking up one side of street it would seem if you have ever been in the Hollywood area it would seem you get a star.. I’ve been in a bar for 4hr now so should get mine soon 🙃,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/logiemrcraigl
40,Interesting,"The reality of the walk of fame was explained to us by a tour guide who showed us photographs of Oscar night and how they transform the existing shopping centre frontage into the Dolmen theatreThere are 2 stars awarded every month and they are spread out over a greater distance than expected (miles of walking)Also dont miss the Capital Records area where many of the pop stars stars are, Beatles etc.We were fortunate to see Richard Branson receive his star on our visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulawales_11

30,California’s dirty little secret,"While visiting Hollywood with my husband and daughters (age 18 and 8), I was slightly disappointed in Hollywood. It was much sketchier than I expected. It reminded me of a mix of Vegas and Bourbon Street. The Main Street within a block or two of the Chinese Theater is nice, unfortunately we walked from our hotel (about 15 minutes away) on a Sunday morning and came across all types of interesting people, sights and smells. I am glad we visited but I wouldn’t go back and wouldn’t recommend anyone spend a lot of time here with small children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VTTracy

30,You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Blvd,"If you are interested in movies you will enjoy seeing your favourites 'star'.

30,Mixed Review,"Pros:1. Good to put this place on your to-do list as it gives you a feeling and sense of “Hollywood”2. Tremendous amount of souvenirs/gift shops with all contending with one another in terms of price.3. Many eateries with reasonable price.4. Every shop you enter give you a sense of Hollywood.5. There is a Metro, easily accessible.Cons:1. Too many homeless or beggars along the street.2. Some parts smell badly.3. Some of the walk of fame is damaged/vandalised and show no effort by the authorities to fix it.Heads up:1. When anyone approaches you for a picture (Wonder Woman, Batman, etc) you have to give them a tip. If you don’t, they will ask you for it.2. A lot of street food but be careful as they do not cover it up for hygiene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BalpreetHarvi
40,Celebrities Stars on the Sidewalks,"I was really shocked when I stepped at this street. I always believed that dedicating a star to an artist on the walk of fame is for honoring him. But unfortunately when I saw that those stars are engraved on the ground of the sidewalks where all people walk and step on I didn't get where the honor is !!! Only one man refused to engrave his name on the ground so instead they hung his star on the wall right in front of Dolby theater entrance: Mohammed Ali. Still it was fun looking for our favorite celebrities stars and taking photos/selfies. The sidewalks are always crowded with tourists, street performers, vendors and beggars. Lots of cafes, restaurants and gift shops. We got the chance to put our family name on a star and took photos of that for only 5$.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OsmanB511
40,Very crowded,"This is a must-see in Los Angeles, but it is very crowded and if you want to take photos with a star be careful not to get run over!

Homeless population sadly takes away from the experience as some have set up camp, are laid out, and the strong smell of urine throughout the town can be unbearable. The walking traffic is more treacherous as the cars if you not used city life this takes some practice. Lots to see though in the area amongst the crowds between each star. Wear comfortable shoes and walk it a few times in case you missed something!! Lots of culture, arts, foods, beautiful people, diversity etc. to experience! Each time I walked I saw a name I misses!

30,"Dirty, not what I expected","I was looking forward to visiting this place for the longest. Upon my arrival I came across the Chinese theater and was mesmerized. But soon after, everything went downhill. Constant street performers and costume people requesting pictures in exchange for money. They randomly touch you, and demand money. At least 30 tours were offered to me at random within a block radius. The magic of this place is taken away by these people. Not to mention it was like a circus of clowns. On the other end of the street there were religious protestors speaking about the return of Christ and how you should repent as well as stop being hypocritical. I felt so out of place. Too chaotic for me. The air smelled like pure marijuana as well, the stores were dirty and the quality of the items seemed cheap. I thankfully found a couple of awesome stars along the floor, took pictures and left. I hope this area is cleaned up for a better experience. Also, there was a young guy who randomly went up to my husband and hugged him (which he doesn’t like to be touched) and he was like “man look at this trick, look, look LOOOK!) and my husband ignored him. When he saw that I was filming he said “catch this on film” and he threw a rubber dildo on the wall. It’s definitely not a place for families, so gross.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fearlessnaya
10,A waste of time,"It was really disappointed, It is one street with too many people (even hard to see the stars) with tons of gift and souvenirs stores. It is tacky, ugly and dirty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492manuelam
40,Fun Times With Family,We were in California for a weekend trip to an amusement park and decided to go visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was very cool. Myself and the kids had a good time seeing all the different stars on the walk. I would recommend going during the day time if you are bringing children. I went in the early evening and from the time we arrived to the time we left there was a drastic change in the type of people you would see. When we started out it was not a bad group of people but as it got later the crowd got more unruly and I did not see much of a police or security presence. People were sitting on the street smoking weed and even offering it to people walking by including children. Something I would not mind coming back to but will not be on a weekend and will not be at night. The parking is also a major issue as there is very limited parking or it is very expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maegenr2015
20,Not so glamerous after all...,"Firstly, don't bother staying in west Hollywood. Its a dive. Secondly, when you watch on tv.. you picture the walk of fame to be glamourous. To me it was dirty. I also noticed a lot of homeless, drunk/drugged people and a lot of people selling items etc which makes you fell abit on edge. Its not so bad when its busy in the afternoon / night but early morning its a little uncomfortable. I personally wouldn't recommend anyone to bother going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaymiexox
30,"Walking Area, No More","It is just a place to walk around with no activities and many gift shop, not too much worthy to visit but for the first time you must, streets not clean enough as you expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saifalmallak
10,Not worth going to.,"My husband and I spent 45 minutes here today and that was too much time. The place is heaving, parking expensive and the street full of people trying to get you to hand money over. If you do go do not except 'free'CDs, they aren't free. We stayed to get a couple of photos and a souvenir then couldn't get out of there quicker. Didn't feel safe there either, felt vulnerable to pick pockets. Opted to go to the Citywalk after instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alices699
40,A must see!,"My daughter and I recently visited L.A./Hollywood area while on a vacation. One of the first spots we stopped at was the Hollywood Walk of Fame, on Hollywood Blvd. It was interesting reading all the names on the stars as we went down the sidewalk. Most of the stars were in good shape, but we did find several that were in need of repairs. One that we did want to see that's been in the news lately was Donald Trump's star. His star is located near the TLC Chinese Theater. Upon finding his star, we witnessed that it was covered with swastikas that somebody had graffitied with a black marker. When walking Hollywood Boulevard in this area, we witnessed many homeless people. For the most part, they keep to themselves and didn't bother us. Another thing we noticed around the L.A. area, whether it was Hollywood Blvd or Venice Beach, was the odor of marijuana. People watching along the Hollywood Walk of Fame can be quite entertaining. There are many costumed characters looking to earn a buck with a photo opportunity. We also found many people trying to hand out their music CDs in exchange for a couple bucks (caution I've heard some of the CDs are blank). There are also many interesting shops, souvenir stores, and restaurants in this area. Along Hollywood Blvd. you will also find many popular attractions like Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, the Capitol Records building, TLC Chinese Theater, and many spots where you'll be able to view the Hollywood sign. We visited this area during the daylight hours, I could see it getting a little seedy after dark. Parking can be a little tough in the area also, I was able to find parking meters at a rate of $6 for 2-3 hours. Despite all the homeless people in this area, I felt comfortable visiting the area, and would do so again if I was back in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanW_12
30,A little bit disappointed in a night visit,The street is dark. Only small section near the Madame Tussaud was busy. More than 2000 stars and you have to do some homework if you want to find your favorite star. We only spent 10 mins walking along the street. Won't come back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackier_rui
50,A MUST SEE IF You’re From Out of Town,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a lot of fun to explore HOWEVER the area is quite seedy during the day and worse at night. It’s completely safe- just lots of homeless people. There are people dressed as famous people and characters that you can take pictures with but many are not licensed to work with tourists. You can take a picture with Captain Jack Sparrow, Spider-Man or Pikachu but some of the characters have been known to be aggressive with other characters. The Walk of Fame is FUN just focus on the stars on the sidewalk!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valleym
40,A real legendary hot spot in LA.,Hollywood Blvd.Is nuts thousands of touristsSellers every type of person you can see.We wanted to see the stars on the walk but it was not easy with so many people worth the time and effort!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickcardo
50,Fun!,We had so much fun walking to the Chinese Theatre Ann's looking at all the stars along the way... great way to spend an afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theatrix9
30,Once you have seen one...,"An experience to be seen but the whole of this stretch of Hollywood is dirty, busy and once you have seen the first few stars you really give up caring about seeing the ones you really want to see! Maybe check which stars are where before heading up as there are a huge amount of stars and some read correctly to the way you walk up the street, some are upside down so it also hurts your eyes after a while! Not my favourite LA sight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boxonsea
30,To busy and a very dirty area of town,We thought this was something we needed to experience. We would have been off the train and walking along the stars for 10 minutes total including the walk back to the station. We have ticked it off the tourist list but it was just a thing to do. To be fair we only saw along from the station to the kitchen and back. Perhaps other areas along the road would be cleaner and less busy. So much poverty showing in this area in particular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FionaW677
50,Weekend Fun,"Being from out of state, The Hollywood walk of Fame is only something you see on TV or social media. So fun to actually to be there and see how accessible the stars actually are!!! Yea!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolkL4450GU
30,A must see only if it's your first time,"If it's your first time in LA, then the Walk of Fame is worth your while. Once you've seen it I'm not sure it's worth re-visiting. There are some shady areas on Hollywood Blvd, especially away from the tourist areas, and there are a multitude of homeless, most of which sleeping on the stars themselves. And the smell of urine is ever present. If you like souvenir spots then this is your spot. There are many great souvenir places, and I rate LA LA Land the best of them all. Situated next door to the Chinese Theater.Tip: STAY AWAY from the costumed characters! They are only there to ask for money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/594stevev
50,Fun day,"Walk of fame is, of course, very crowded. I would look up and write down the stars you would like to see before you go so it’s a more manageable tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brooke5504
40,Take your time and look,I had a great time- but I was not able to cover the whole area. Take your time and look for the stars you really want. You might be surprised at who all has stars there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimml2015
10,Clean it up!!,"It is such a shame to visit Hollywood Blvd and leave with the impression we had. It is filthy, homeless everywhere as one guy urinated in street right in front of us. You couldn't go five feet without smelling marijuana or being hit up for money. It felt only borderline safe with zero police presence. We stayed only 15 minutes max. Congrats California you have successfully ruined a great asset. I guess you clean it up once or twice a year for the awards or have extremely tight shots. So sad... Have some damn pride and clean it up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q4216TTerich
30,Stars in the sidewalk,"The stars themselves are interesting. It was fun to walk along and try to find different names. The fun is gone after about 5 minutes, because Hollywood Blvd (IMO) is not a place to be on vacation. It was quite trashy with blaring music, people screaming about assorted beliefs, trying to be sold CD's every block, people that looks homeless smoking (?) while laying around. I was a little shocked at what the actual Hollywood Blvd looks like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaGallivanter
40,Enjoyable,My family enjoyed the Hollywood Walk of Fame! My 6 & 9 year old boys had fun finding stars of people & animated characters they knew. Some of the stars were faded and hard to see in some of the pics we took. The highlight was when our youngest son lost his first tooth right before we saw the Walt Disney Star...his favorite!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliebeasley2018
30,Could be better,"Looked at some of the stars here. There are so many that you can’t see them all!!!!An interesting piece of history. Drawback? So many people trying to shove a cd in your hand, or dressed as someone and trying to get you to have their picture taken. That kind of put me off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanG1967
50,Very nice place but full of tourist traps,"This is a very nice place where you can see tributes to the stars who made our dreams on big screen, radio, theatre, and music. Just beware of people who tru to give you “free” CDs and brochures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamD485
20,Average and dirty,City dirt that is. If you are used to downtown type North American middle of the road Commercail retail streets then the only thing to see here is the actual stars on the sidewalk. We had a rental car and drove down the parking lane. The passangers walked and looked for a few blocks while I tailed. Got er done and have the check box. Not an area for fine dining or specialty shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SvenA663
40,Quick visit during work trip!,Loved the energy of of the area. We were on a business trip for my husband so the crowd was not to bad in the middle of the day on a Thursday. Look for public parking signs and prepare to pay for parking with cash.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/413brandig

30,A must visit once experience.,"I had been to the walk of fame as a child, but visited for the first real rememberable time during my Honeymoon we have just returned from.The walk of fame and Hollywood Bld are definitely a tourist must do, but once you've seen it, you've seen it. Now any time we're in LA in future, wlthe only real way wed end up there is if a restaurant or show just happened to be in the area.It's very dirty, the wall of fame itself is filthy. Very much reminded me of a slightly more upmarket Blackpool.Some great cheap souvenir shops if you're on a budget looking for a few trinkets for people and home and The Hard Rock Cafe is a good one. Mel's Diner is conveniently located just of the Blvd and is well priced, alongside bringing a bit of movie history with it.Use the Hollywood and Highland red line metro stop to get you right into the action. The Metro service in general is very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LKS85
30,A solid cleaning would help a lot,"Unfortunately, many of the plaques need a good cleaning. Seems that for the $$ people have paid for the recognition, the area could be kept in better shape.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomascR4785YC

30,Tick the box,"This is a sort of must do when visiting Los Angeles. Looking at the stars on the boardwalk is fun, however for someone who enjoys kitsch, this is even too much for me. This is a seedy area that does not have a lot of appeal, often dirty and unwelcoming.

30,"If you’re in Hollywood, you may as well take a look!","Honestly my over all trip to Los Angeles wasn’t exactly wonderful. I had reason to be here so I figured it was necessary to at least see the ‘walk of fame’Of course you can find your favourite people and take some pictures with their stars - this is definitely enjoyable!Over all I wouldn’t travel to LA just to do this as LA in general is just not that beautiful or pleasant to stay in. I would say if you’re passing by or you’re there for a brief time, then of course go check out the stars!I walked around hollywood boulevard many times and it’s actually quite badly kept and a little uncomfortable to say the least.So over all.. of course go look... but don’t go here without many reasons... and take an Uber everywhere... LA is large and not walking tourist friendly at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurynG1989
40,Tourist,"Arrived here Sunday lunch time, very busy with thousands of people everywhere, as a first time visitor it was exciting seeing the main tourist things walk of fame/Dolby Theater etc, watch out for the local con artists shoving CDs into your hands saying there samples but then demanding money if walk off,other that there’s plenty of tour operators around to book tours, and plenty of cheaper shops to buy souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heizzy
30,Classic Hollywood,"Very cool to see the Stars.....lots of crazy people running around dressed like superheros. It was kind of dirty and missing the Hollywood sparkle I expected.

30,very crowded and dirty,"Yes, the walk of fame is, well, famous, and if you're a tourist visiting LA, you probably will want to see it. Be prepared, however, that the area, in general, is very crowded, not only with locals and tourists, but also street performers and homeless people. And for the most part, the sidewalks are dirty (they are, after all, sidewalks). If you have to cut something from your ""gotta do"" list, you won't be missing much by cutting this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseR3184
50,Times Square of Los Angeles,"Go there in night time to enjoy it to the fullest . The lights , glamour and smartly dressed people , interesting shops make this walk a beautiful experience .

30,The Stars are Cool but it's Really Dirty :(,"I was excited to visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame but once I got there I realized that it's too busy to enjoy. I did get some photos of the stars I admire. I am sure that a cleaning crew power washes the sidewalk because so many people are walking through the area. I also went on a Saturday so that was probably a mistake, haha! There are indoor areas and shops to visit if you're not into walking through dense crowds and vendors who want to put your name on a blank Hollywood Star (when you can just use Photoshop, lol!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joid474
20,"Well, If You Really Want To","When you go, go exhaust-ready. Bring your wet wipes because the place is dirty. They are sidewalks that host hustlers and shopkeepers, vagrants and vagabonds, hoteliers and mega-merchants...none of whom have broom and hose. It seems a movie buff's dream but unlike going to the movies, you won't finish clean. If you really want to look at pavement, go in the morning (if you don't mind the smell of urine) when traffic is less fierce and before the hustlers wake. For the adventurous, trek out just before four o'clock in the evening. You'll find the buzzing hive you've seen on Jimmy Kimmel and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492nathanieln
30,Didn't meet our expectations,"We were looking forward to our walk along hollywood boulevard spotting our favourite 'star's. However there was no hollywood glamour... We found the whole street to be run down and dirty, and could hardly heat ourselves think on s lot of our walk due to road works. We expected such a significant tourist attraction in on the supposedly most glamourous cities in the USA to be kept in pristine condition but it was not. Now we've seen this once we would never make an effort to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyec91

Overall we spent good 2-3 hours walking down this street and enjoyed the place..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AjitT924
50,Golden stars of the stars,"No trip to Hollywood would be complete without strolling down the Hollywood Walk of Fame. There are stars from movie, television and the music industry represented.

20,Could be so much better,"This covered a much greater area than we expected, whilst mainly along one street there were a few odd stars scattered on side streets or buildings. The vast majority of names I had no idea who they were, certainly not what I would call a “star”.The buildings along the street could be made so much nicer some nice architecture was hidden by all the dirt – generally the area does not seem that well maintained.When walking along the street you are constantly hassled by people trying to sell trips to see the stars homes or even worse simply trying to con you.If you are movie mad I could see the appeal of the area for anyone else a quick one hour walk along the street to say you have seen it is all that’s needed and then move onto somewhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garywN3559DL

A wretched melange of hucksters, urine, weed, lousy stores, souvenirs made in China from spent fuel-rods, filthy sidewalks and the list goes on and on.If you want to see stars go plant yourself outside the Ivy. At least you won’t feel the need to shower for a few hours after spending time there.If you go I’ll give you 5 minutes before you Uber your tail out of there STAT. Yes I am from NYC but this is worse than Times Square circa 1978 with less to see and do. Went to the Getty Museum the next day to purge myself of the toxins.

It's probably worth it to get the hollyweird vibes that can be entertaining but given the growing number of dangerous weirdos that abound i personally would stay away from this area although one time experience might be ok. For dining i would recommend Jinya Ramen and Pokinometry both at the Dolby theater building. Enjoy the view of Jimmy Kimmel's building and HW traffic why dining on the second floor open patio. Right below is the Chinese Theater def a tourist attraction. Beware of scamming guys ""giving"" away cds. The jap store Muji is close by that i recommend.

It is intriguing to see which stars are immortalised there, but we found it so grotty. The street is dirty, there are quite a few homeless people hanging about and some of the window displays advertising Halloween are way out there.

It just smells really bad and homeless sleep in the middle of the sidewalk.It's a nice place to visit and shop. But if you are especially Asian, then be ready to be abused by the street sellers. Especially the ones who sell CD and DVD. They do a lot of racial abuse and try to make you feel posed off. Except for them all others were friendly and informative on our queries. Especially, if you want to find three location of a particular celebrity, then ask shop keepers or fruit sellers. They will help you find out more easily. If you want to take snap with any of the people dressing as a character, then be ready to pay cash for it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meierjaco
10,Most underwhelming tourist attraction in LA,My partner and I went to the walk of fame around 10am on a weekday and walked about ~1-2km up Hollywood Blvd. It was incredibly dirty with lots of homeless people. The street smelled of urine and weed. Very underwhelming. Would advise avoiding when in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katiefisher2908
40,Walk of Fame,Interesting looking for and finding favorite stars. Learned much more through our personal tour guide than we did as we walked independently. Could be a little overwhelming/underwhelming depending on the amount of time walking the walk of fame. The whoa factor did wane over time.Would I recommend avoiding this? NO! It is one of the cheesy things you need to do when visiting LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/audreyet2017
10,Disappointingly Dirty and Unpleasant,"Took a stroll for about 2 blocks. It is disgustingly dirty, shabby looking and not a comfortable feeling walking the streets as a tourist. Took the train back to our hotel and won’t ever go there again or recommend it. I was here 3 years ago, and it is worse now than back then, and, I thought it was bad 3 years ago.

Those people who are dressed up in cheap costumes trying to convince you to take pictures and the tour people who are trying to convince you to take their tours by giving you “discounts “ are extremely annoying!

10,Makes Times Square look like it's made of gold!,"We were in town for the Beck concert at the Hollywood Bowl and were able to walk from our hotel to the venue. Our path took us through part of the Walk of Fame. It's quite ironic how celebrities are so desperate to get their ""stars"" in such a horrible place. If I was a celebrity, yeah, that's exactly what I'd want - I want my name on one of the filthiest sidewalks in the world with all kinds of questionable characters hanging around. Sign me up! Now that I've been here, that concept is even more ridiculous to me now than it was before. I'm from the NYC area and always thought Times Square was awful, but I can honestly say that the Walk of Fame makes Times Square look like it's a gorgeous Caribbean island in comparison. Don't waste your time visiting what may be one of the worst places on the planet!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mdgrl79
40,Fun and Fantastic but always anti climatic because people envision there is more to Hollywood.,"Fun and Fantastic but always anti-climatic because people envision there is more to Hollywood. I know how exciting it is for tourists because I once was. I live here in Los Angeles it's mandatory to take friends and family to the Walk of Fame. You know they will get a kick out of it. Living here for 15 years, I've seen changes to the block so there is a lot more to do with the Hard Rock, El Capitan. Wax Museum and shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crystaljayMCCN
20,Walk of Shame,"I was very disappointed in the walk of fame. The stars were dirty and the sidewalks were very crowded. For the cost of a star, I thought they would have been kept in better shape. This was a waste of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbodorizzi
10,Ufffff what happend here,Very dirty place and full of homeless people.I was So disappointmen i just could believe it. And sunset strip nothing to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoffySig73
20,Poor,Sorry the walk of “fame” is scruffy and full of scammers and homeless. The Chinese theatre is great and good photos of the Hollywood Sign from the back of the Dolby theatre mall. 🐝,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GezandJune1
10,Overrated,"I think that this ""attraction"" is both ridiculous and overrated. It's just a sidewalk, people, one that is often dirty and populated by sketchy people. Worse, it's being copied. Palm Springs has one too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
10,Dirty Place Full of People,As a lifelong resident of California I always feel sorry for tourists going to the Hollywood walk of fame. This place is super crowded and busy. Everyone’s trying to make a buck and you’re constantly accosted by someone trying to and you either have free CD or a flyer for a tour. Sure there are stars and the Chinese theater but overall not a good representation of California. A few blocks long and the traffic is crazy. I would recommend a quick stop and then moving onto nicer areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iamiamgoing
50,Very interesting!!,"The place is right in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre. The area is smaller than I thought. But, it holds a lot of older stars & A-list current stars. The oldest I found was 1934. Some of them weren't marked!! So fun to walk down memory lane!! Right outside is a portion of the ""Star""Walk of Fame. To the right of Grauman's is a fantastic mall with viewing of the HOLLYWOOD sign. You can nice t-shirts & hoodies for cheap there as well!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebiMemphis
40,Iconic land mark to visit,Couldn't believe I was in Hollywood. Walked up & down the the Hollywood of fame seeing all the famous people's hands & names. Souvenirs shops galore. Can get a very crowded & street vendors trying to hassle you. Great attraction 😍,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hitch1971

30,Iconic,"This road is of course iconic with all the stars and you probably need an hour to walk both sides to see most of them.Once you've seen if not worth returning. Alot of people trying to sell you things, some parts are a bit run down and overall its not as great as you think it would be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ultimatesi

10,Overrated,"I read some reviews before going there but I still wasn’t prepared for it. At first we thought it was ok but as you walk down the street you can see that the place is actually packed with homeless people and smells like pee. I wouldn’t mind if there was 2-3 every once in a while but it’s actually 2-3 every few steps. Also, some talk alone and others are screaming while they are walking. We saw one guy screaming and cursing while we were crossing the street and his face was bloody.You would think that since it’s a touristic place it would be well kept but no. You can go, take a picture and leave just so you say you were there. We definitely didn’t have a good time and wouldn’t go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cinaalb
40,Simply entertaining,Good for those who love Hollywood movies as they can see their favourite movie stars putting their marks (stars) there. One can also see the famed moonwalk moves by real-life imposters of Michael Jackson.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caseyw487

30,Pros and cons,"Located on Hollywood Blvd, this walk is quite long, with stars on both sides on the road, so it can be difficult to locate your particular favorite. Most interesting part of the walk is in front of the Chinese Theatre, where you can see real footprints of some stars. There are also many souvenir shops, Madame Tusseaud museum, Dolby Theatre and some liquor stores. It is nice to walk down the street and take a picture of some stars. Also good to check after dark, when all those neon signs and colors give the place a different vibe. Be warned that parking is a challenge, street is quite dirty, full of homeless people, you can smell weed everywhere. Many people will force you to take their CD or ask you to take a picture with them. I did not feel unsafe even at 10pm, but I was verbally attacked by some racist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lukask45
40,Click a Picture with Your Favorite Celebrity Named Star,Walk of Fame is the small stretch on Bollywood Blvd. It has many pink colour stars studded on the street with celebrities names on them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VIPIN_GOEL_TP_Impex
10,AVOID at all costs,"A local brought us there and thank god since navigating the area was beyond nuts. He knew where to park and took us up to the walk of fame which dumps you into a melee of craziness. There are nuts dressed (mostly badly and not at all convincingly) as various characters that all but accost you to have your picture taken with them for $. There are masses upon masses of people who cannot walk in a functional way to save their life. You cannot possibly stop to read the stars because there are so many people and if you want a picture with one, good luck, you will likely be run over trying. There are shills everywhere trying to give you crap you don’t want and chasing you to engage. There are people smoking weed everywhere. So touristy and overrun, this was pure nightmare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALLSLC
20,Run down and stank of weed.,"I stayed in a hostel around the corner from the Walk of Fame. I was excited because I’m a huge film fan, and the pictures from the walk look amazing. The reality is totally different.Every two seconds someone is pestering you by shoving a CD in your hand (don’t take it, they’ll want money for it) or a tour. Lost count of the amount of times I said no thanks to people. There were a lot of homeless people raking through the bins which was sad to see, or people sat on the ground smoking weeed.That’s another thing, the walk stank of weed and urine. Lots of shops closed down or look like they could do with a facelift. You can imagine maybe 10 years ago it was fun to be there, but it was a massive let down.Also, don’t go out at night. There were a few people randomly shouting at things that aren’t there during the day, so can’t imagine what it’s like after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chellenney
20,Homeless and dirty,"We drove down Hollywood Blvd with intent to get out of car and see the stars. Once diving down just a few minutes we all decided (two teen girls and husband) that just taking some pics from within the car would be satisfying enough. We did hit one red light and myself and daughter got out momentarily to take a pic by a random star, just to officially say we got our pic there. We quickly returned to the car bc the streets were covered with homeless and intrusive individuals. The streets and store fronts were run down and unkept. Not a place I would feel comfortable exploring with my family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lillyann-Biscuit
30,Very Crowded,Very crowded and just a long sidewalk where you see see names of celebrities who have chosen to buy a star.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haveatums
20,very dissapointed,"walked most of the Hollywood walk of fame, very disappointed how run down it islots of the stars are broken, and a lot of the older names are well worn, the whole place is very dirty, not at all like you see in books or on tv, no wonder muhammed ali did not want his star put on the ground his star is on a wall just inside the dolby theatreI would sum the whole of LA up in four words, DIRTY, NOISY, RUNDOWN, AND UNSAFE there is loads of homeless living on the streets where the walk of fame is the whole of LA was a real let down",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFH143

40,A must see,"This is a must see when in LA. There's lots of energy on the streets , places to buy souvenirs, and grab a bite to eat. You'll need at least an hour to cover both sides and to visit China town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SNJ1
40,A memorable stroll down the walk of fame on Hollywood Blvd,"The Blvd. buzzes with excitement and sights, from the stars on the pavement, too numerous to mention them all, to the sounds and smells of this iconic location. The Chinese theatre with its imprints of feet and hands in the concrete is impressive and you can imagine the stars decamping from their limos' and walking up the red carpet to the Oscars …. brilliant.I don't know if there is an official guide to whose star is where on the Blvd., but this would be handy if you were looking for someone specific.It was hot the day we were there so take water, sunscreen. Food is available at Hollywood and Highland mall.(we parked here and you can get the first 2 hrs free if you get your ticket validated in the mall) Good walking shoes are useful as you don't realise how far you walk if you want to see it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddlerpants
30,Not what you expect,"The area is extremely run down and dirty with people on the street constantly pestering you which makes it difficult to stop and look at the names on the floor. If like me you are a fan of the films I would make your way to he Chinese theatre where the handprints are in the concrete, much quieter and less intimidating. We only spent 15mins in the area as there are better places to see in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3748ATdanielj

50,Iconic Location!,This is one of the major tourist attractions in LA. The entire stretch is filled with a lot of activities that can keep one occupied throughout the day. Stars of your favorite celebrities can bee seen on either side of the streets. Footprints of the celebrities can be seen at TCL Chinese Theatre. It's best to take your time and explore this place than have someone show you around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eudaimonictraveler
50,Hooray for Hollywood,"This is the one place in Los Angeles that I completely lost myself in the moment- it was amazing!!It wasn't too busy so I could concentrate on reading each and every star, instead of looking where I was going.Admittedly some of the stars were dirty and I'm surprised that the pavements aren't hosed down every day, but it didn't interfere with my enjoyment.Some stars have flowers, i.e. Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe and of course Aretha Franklin as we were there at the time of her death, and some stars are cracked and should really be replaced especially as they are a little dangerous if you're not looking where you're going.We didn't get bothered by any characters in costume, but be warned there are a lot of people trying to sell you tours of the stars homes. They try to hand you a flyer as you pass but I found it funny to say I'd already done the tour with them and didn't they remember?Well worth a visit but it's probably only going to take you a morning to see everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/246merylw
10,Dirty and seedy,"The Walk of Fame was meant to be one of the highlights of our trip to Los Angeles. We were hugely disappointed. Vine Street and Hollywood Boulevard turned out to be busy, dirty, rather seedy streets. Most of the people there were just going about their normal daily life, which made taking any photos really difficult. The names were interesting, but there is no particular order, so it is difficult to find names that you might be interested in. We were staying in Santa Monica and Hollywood was a long way to go. It was not worth the time or money spent on the fare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JosephineF999
40,Good visit,"Went earlier in the day and so it was quieter, walked up and down, it is quite long and do you do get a sense of Hollywood, lots of shops nearby, you can see the Hollywood sign from her, definitely worth a visit, did get busy during the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManjitS454

30,Must See Tourist Trap,"The 5* reviews for this amaze me... yes it’s something you “have to see” if you’re in LA, but it was the dirtiest, tackiest place I’ve ever been to! There are street artists (and I use that term veeeery loosely) everywhere, people trying to flog their “free CDs” that aren’t actually free once they’re in your hands... it just goes on and on.Seeing some of the Stars was fun, it’s nice to know the person was actually in that spot at some point, but why people sit on the dirty pavement for photos is beyond me!We went to Jack Black’s Star unveiling while we visited Hollywood and that was truly amazing, without that I would have given the Walk of Fame 1*. If there are any Star Ceremonies while you’re there, go, it was a once in a lifetime opportunity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abbyw371
50,Good free experience and self paced!,We had fun and it’s always cool looking for your favorite stars! A hint to help find them faster is to google where they are since it’s a long stretch. Just be careful because certain areas are schetchy and you have to watch your surroundings. Once you get to the TCL theater and Dolby theater then you’ll get to a lot of tourist attractions. Make sure to have your walking shoes on!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/363davinab
30,City of stars...,Came here with my wife whilst road tripping around California and this is just one of those things you ‘have to do!’ It was interesting to walk along Hollywood Boulevard and see the walk of fame stars and see what celebs names you recognise! Surprising how many people’s names we’d never heard of before!It’s not the nicest in the world to walk down but generally felt safe! It’s one of those things we’re glad we’ve done it to see what it’s actually like but we’d not need to see it again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattrolfe16

50,A mix of a little of everything,I went with my daughter and we had a very nice time. We went when the sun went down so everything wasn’t beautiful and lit up. There were so many restaurants and little stores to go into and just overall things to do. There were celebrity impersonators walking around and just an interesting mix of a little bit of everything. I could see someone spending a good portion of their day here just looking at the stars finding different names or exploring. Definitely glad we made it there before we left LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingLibra901
40,Crazy!,"This place was great during the week, but weekend was mental! Something really needs to be done about those CD men where I come from half the things they do would be classed as assault!

Don’t even look at them just keep walking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melissabalogh

Although there are a large number of tourists, there are a number of establishments that are adult in nature. Perhaps a drive would be better suited than an actual walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alicsyed

50,Wow,What an amazing road to stroll around.Very much crowded & very lively area with characters moving around,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alokmili77
20,Quite disappointed,"Let’s start that I’ve visited it during a week, around 1pm. I didn’t expect that big crowds, however it’s a touristy place, so wasn’t that surprise.What surprise me though, was how unsafe this place is!We were walking there in a day light when 2 man started to spray a pepper gas and shout. They both were wearing a brass knuckles. I didn’t see even one patrol of police during my whole walk (5/6 km).I’m really happy we didn’t came there with a kids.It’s as well an extremely dirty place.I’m rating it as poor and not terrible, just because of the opportunity to make your own “star”, with your name and small Oscar. It costs you 10$, but is worth spending money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shealwayswanders

30,A walk through entertainment history,"We had a very pleasant walk down Hollywood Blvd, checking out the ""Stars"" for various individuals and musical groups. We didn’t know all the individuals honored and took the time later to look some of them up, an opportunity for all of us to learn a little entertainment history.Parking is an issue, we found a lot about a mile and a half from the main attractions on Hollywood Blvd. and it cost $20 a day (flat rate).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericw824
30,Not great,Another must see while in LA. The walk itself is fairly interesting. The streets are drab and the shops around are a bit tacky. As others have said you just expect it to have a bit more razzle dazzle. Constant hassle from dressed up super heroes wanting money in exchange for photos. Just very disappointing in real life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GWSenior

10,Disappointed,"Sure there are stars in the sidewalk. Sure there are hand prints in the Graumans Chinese Theatre which is quite moving... however, the walk of fame should be remarked the ‘Walk of Shame’. It is dirty, unkempt and littered with rubbish. If I were a celebrity I would not pay $40k to have a ‘star’ on this walk. A complete and utter disappointment.

30,Okay,We parked several blocks East of the Dolby Theatre so enjoyed the walk along Hollywood Blvd - star gazing - without a lot of crowds. As we got closer to the theatre the crowds were pretty bad. There were also significant numbers of homeless people along here.

40,FAMOUS PATH SHOWING STAR NAMES,"We were in Los Angeles in July 2018 and every day we had a walk on this walk of fame. This is actually the wide footpath of Hollywood Boulevard, starting near Chinese Theatre and gong towards south for about a kilometre. There are stars on famous person@s name (may not be the movie star) at every 3 ft distance or so. It was started in 1960. I heard that the Chamber and City opened with 1500 stars initially.Today, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce continues to add stars to the Walk of Fame and on an average of two stars are added on monthly basis. The Walk is a tribute to all of those who worked so hard to develop the concept and to maintain this world-class tourist attraction.Walking on the stars at peak hours was very difficult. There were lot of crowds and most of the areas foot paths were taken over by street performers, homeless peoples, agents of various tours and touts. We had to take care of our belonging, particularly when we took photos of the starts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DPMALLIC

If someone looks like a movie star they probably are not. lots of impersonators and if you take a picture with them it's going to cost you money. They thrive on the tourist in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulhC1926TM
30,A must see in Hollywood,Just walking around on Hollywood boulevard and seeing at those stars on the sidewalk is an experience by itself. It’s not the glitter and glam that one would expect but still it has to be seen at least one in your life. I suggest taking some picture and then move to visit the Chinese Theatre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gincar2016
30,HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME,"Surprisingly the paths are very filthy in some areas where the stars are located so i hope the star you want a picture of is clean enough to see the stars name. Also a lot of homeless and weirdo's hang out on HOLLYWOOD BLVD and it smells like a toilet all along the paths. Quite filthy and a very sketchy area, particularly at night as i was staying close to this area and didnt feel safe as a female.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darleines
10,Dirty and scary,"I grew up in Los Angeles, this was a fun place to roam around.I wouldn't go there after 2pm any day of the week.It's dirty , smelly and down right dangerous.It's inundated with a community of mentally ill homeless people.You just never know what they're going to do.The LAPD are nowhere to be found.NO THANKS!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lourdesr394
50,A must when visiting LA,Note there are a lot of people around during the middle of the day. Which is to be expected. Definitely worth the visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miz_emma11
40,Good but needs a bit more promotion/info,"Good to see this but I wish there was a bit more information available on the street as to where the stars are - you can walk blocks and blocks and see properly big name stars, but well off Hollywood Boulevard in side streets most people won’t bother with - I’m still mystified as to how they choose who gets a star and where they put it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kendoherty70
10,Family trip,"Do it once, if you must. But we will never return to California, let alone Walk of Fame. Got abused by a 'Homeless guy' asking for one dollar in McDonald's. Rudeness overload.

40,Walk Among the stars and have fun,"Much improved since I was a child, you should plan a whole day since there are plenty of things to do along the Walk of Fame, forget about driving there. Park somewhere else and take the Metrorail. Lots of walking and many cool places to stop and eat. In fact, it would be cheaper for Uber or Lift and avoid the HEAVY TRAFFIC. Put on your walking shoes, grab a bottle of water and make sure your phone is charged for plenty of photos. The threat is low, due to heavy police presence, but keep your guard up and have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomgsells
20,Don’t go at night,"This was the dirtiest and saddest place we have been in a very long time. Foolishly we walked in the area on a Saturday night looking for a restaurant- extremely crowded with tourists, homeless people, and people trying to make a quick buck. The area smells of urine and marijuana- it was shocking how many people had their young children out there at 11pm. We only lasted a few minutes and quickly got out of the area. We drove by the next morning and it was deserted except for all the homeless people. If you really have to see a star - go in the early morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/llaugh8424

30,Dirty & Smelly,"Wow !When we pulled up to the road and my husband told me this was it , I was instantly disappointed and didn’t believe him to begin .It is dirty and smells of wee !Some of the stars are that dirty you can’t really read them and they are not picture worthy .We didn’t walk very far to see much as it was just dirty and smelly.The shops are ALL the same !

20,Hollywood Not So Good,"Hollywood is a pretty grimey area with tons of tourists mixed with some runaways, some actors in superhero costumes, some street performers/vendors and blocks of souvenir/tacky strip club clothing stores. Don't expect Bell Air or Beverly Hills. The energy/vibe here is funky and not in a good way. But if you want to see your favorite celebrity's star on the sidewalk, it's here. You can do it in 20mins and move on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/encouragement8
30,Has to be done but...,This area of Hollywood is very touristy and actually quite tacky - it’s also very busy and visitors are hustled on the street. We didn’t stay long but were glad to have seen it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karencA6283NY
10,Disappointing,The iconic Walk of Fame is definitely lacking. This is supposed to be a place where the great stars of Hollywood are celebrated. Unfortunately Hollywood has allowed Hollywood Blvd to lose its star power to the smell of an outdoor bathroom. Truly unfortunate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854billk
30,Visit at night,"It's cool to see and walk by but there really isn't that much. Go between 7-930 and there's lots going on yet not too busy.

40,Good Fun,we had around 20 mins or so to wander up and down as part of our LA 6 hour city tour which started on Hollywood Boulevard. Personally I was thrilled to find Daniel Radcliffe ! Really enjoyed seeing all those famous names. We actually came back the next day to spend a bit more time in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraceyNottag
50,Bucket list must see!,Had a great time looking at the stars. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed! I would go during the week if possible. Watch out for hustlers though. They try to take your picture with them while dressed as your favorite character then want $20. Some are relentless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z6626EEkimn
50,You can't go to LA and not do it!!,"Unless you absolutely hate tv and movies you can't go to LA and not walk down Hollywood Boulevard and see the Walk of Fame. My favourite? Walt Disney for sure but there's a star here for everyone and just walking around, seeing the lights and entertainers (there's always some type of entertainment on the Blvd.) is worth it. You don't need to stay long. I recommend eating at the Hard Rock Cafe while you're there. You'll want a break from the chaos and the food is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/surfwave01
30,Bof!,"Ok, been there done that! Always too crowded, shops are tourist traps. Dirty sidewalks. Big tourist attraction but seems like the city doesnt care about tourist... not at all tourist friendly. Walk, look down and thats it...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelAlbert
30,A little tired but still worth a look,Visit early in the day when the sidewalks are vacant and you can stop and move around easily. The streets and venues are all starting to look tired and not the glitter and glam you might expect. Allocate 45 minutes and take a few snap shots and move onto the other LA sites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chuck0210
10,"Disgusting,dirty !!","What a big let down for us all, street hawkers in your face,quite forcefull and aggressive .The sidewalk we found covered in litter and grime and some of the stars difficult to see,I guess it's a little piece of times square..or it trys to be. After 30 minutes we left,we won't return, once you seen it ..you will understand these comments. Maybe someone should get this sorted,especially the hawkers, I don't go on holiday for this,I can imagine some people would find this quite intimidating..highlight for me as a 58 yr old..A young guy,say 19, black in a large group of his friends telling me I wasn't "" f@#$%g cool"" as I pushed back the CD he demanded 20 cents for !! Stick it mate!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewp516

40,One of those things you have to do in your lifetime,"It is great to see all your favorite stars as you walk down the street. There are areas where it isn't very clean and there are homeless people, but you are in a big city after all. Also fun to go see the cement hand and footprints in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gidgetcindy
30,My kids didn’t enjoy it.,"My kids (boys 9 & 11) were excited to see the Dolby theatre where they film America’s got talent and Hollywood walk of fame. Until we got there. It’s super crowded and noisy and yucky. Be careful of the people dressed up as characters, after asking my kids if they wanted to pose for a picture he told me they work on donations and most people pay $10. I laughed and gave him $2 and walked away. They didn’t want to stay. We left soon after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T955SRjenniferr

50,Good fun for family !,"Took my little girl to see hollywoods stars on the streets, she loved it 150% ,The stores Take you back in time .The place should be the capital of Los Angeles, the food is great in Hollywood , the little shops sale old movie star pictures of stars long time ago in silent movies to. You will enjoy the history of this great movie city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/521trip
50,Fun Experience,"Lots of fun looking for certain Stars and seeing talented people dressee in Costumes, etc. Shopping & food all around.

30,Names in the ground,"Coming from the east coast, seeing Hollywood was certainly an experience. I definitely snapped a few photos of stars with names I knew and liked, and my timing was lucky enough that I was able to see Weird Al get his star, but all in all its just a bunch of names in the ground. It's always crowded, you're stopped every 10 steps but some guying trying to sell you his rap CD, and everything is too expensive to buy. But, it's something you've gotta do at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahcg93
10,Awful,"My Husband and I were in LA for a few days ! Thought we should take a walk along the stars and find our favorites. All around the Chinese theatre we were hassled to take free CDs along the way . We politely declined . Just as we approached Donald Trumps star , which had been destroyed and closed off, just as we were walking by we were approached by a man who physically shoved a cd into my hand and told me it was free ! When I politely said “Thanks but not thanks “ he called me a racist who hated black people and I should go and stand on Trumps star as that is how I was going to end up !I have never ever been accused of being racist in my life , because I am not , he yelled it all down the street and followed me telling me I was in trouble !Awful experience! Avoid !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathyMcGiv55
30,Cool to see but dirrty,This was a must see for me but it was very dirty when I got there. Lots of homeless people sleeping all over and most of the store fronts were closed.

20,Disappointing,"This was the most disappointing sight of our vacation! Pictures and media make the walk of fame to look beautiful and luxurious, but that is far from the case.The stars are actually on the side wall that hundreds of people are walking all with their heads down trying to read the names which aren’t even facing all the same wAy.It’s a mess to walk in, the entire street was filthy, covered in garbage, bums and people begging for money.All the stores in the area were less than attractive as well only selling. The same old classic souvenirs and trinkets.I wouldn’t spend more than a 20 min walk through just to say you’ve seen it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W5852EJjesss
10,““I‘LL BE BACK““ 👉🏻 not!!!,"A visit to the world-famous Hollywood Walk of Fame was on our bucket list, so up we went!Gosh, what a disappointment.Well -still recovering from the shock- let me put it like this: if I were to be famous I would definitely not want to have my name in that street (Hollywood Blv), covered in thick layers of dirt, urine stains, drugs leftovers and hurdles of creeps, beggars and addicts sauntering over the stars while filling-up the put-holes with gob.My recommendation: go there if you really feel you need to, park your car shortly (lock it!!!) on the side of the road near the W-hotel on Hollywood Blv. (instead of being ripped-off for 20USD for a hopeless car-park), see the stars in front of that hotel, and get out of there asap!LA, to put it in a Hollywood term: horrorShame on those responsible but not giving a 💩",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRT78
50,Must do,A must do in Hollywood. The walk actually stretches quite far but it’s a lot of fun looking for celebs that you know.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marts0424
10,waste of time,The stars are really spread out and go into some less appealing areas. The Blvd. is filled with seedy characters who are hustling for your money. It's too hard to look at the stars without someone trying to bother you for money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/882alycias
10,Not the Hollywood of the past,"Boy has the walk of fame changed over the years. We did a day trip out there just to walk around and see the Museum of Illusions that I read about in a magazine. The smell of urine is overwhelming, it is so dirty, the crowds are unreal, and everyone is out to make a buck. There are folks selling junk along the road, including fresh fruit (there is no way they were legal). I would only take someone visiting who REALLY had it on their bucket list...too many other nice things to see. Drive past and say ""been there, done that""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Gl0balTraveler
20,Have to do it,Just an activity that you have to do and get out quickly to your next plan. It just s este of time. The mariguana weed smell is overwhelming! Is like walking back in the heavy smoker times. Horrible,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsosa196
10,Meh...,"If you like crowds, beggars, and addicts then this might be your ticket to look at the sidewalk to read the names of people in entertainment who paid to have their name on the sidewalk. Unless you are a super fan of someone specific, it is not as interesting as you might think after reading this review.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Macksir
20,Very busy not worth the hype,It’s located in an incredibly busy part of Los Angeles which was not a particularly pleasant area. Don’t accept anything “free” that people on the streets will offer you as everything is most likely a scam. The Chinese Theater is a huge disappointment and the walk of fame is not much better. The only redeeming feature is the hands and feet paving stones outside the Theater which are actually pretty cool however this is an extremely small congested area where you can’t spend very long due to the large number of people trying to get in behind you to take photos. Make sure that you park close enough to the Theater as we mistakenly parked really far away and ended up walking for ages in the heat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CLADavies
20,Nothing special and quite overrated,"It was a long street with cars in the middle. low-rise houses that were not particularly beautiful. I expected so much more from one of the world's most famous streets. The good thing is to have been there, and now I can make it off the bucket list ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnicaE32
30,"Walk of Fame - been there, done that","It has been quite a number of years since stopping at the Walk of the Fame. I must say that this visit was a colorful one. Imagine the lights of Time’s Square...the glitz of Las Vegas Facades...and the tourist trap feeling of San Francisco’s Fisherman Wharf...and you have the Walk of Fame. It was a colorful combination of all of those things. People watchers paradise! Yes, I did enjoy seeing several stars in the sidewalk...including President Trump’s vandalized star.Well worth a one time stroll through the area. Highlights to me were was the TCL Chinese Theater (foot and hand prints in the concrete), and the tri level area just to the right of the Dolby Theater. This area offered a great bird’s eye view of the area, plus the rear area faces the iconic HOLLYWOOD sign that is on the hill.It is very unlikely I’ll return to this area however. There were many street performers/musicians trying to make a buck on the street. Nothing that impressive...however this one gal playing a violin to Hip Hop and rap music earned a tip from me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dagoose9500
30,Interesting but not an essential visit,"The stars are without much fanfare or glitz, and are along an area that’s a huge hustle from one end of the tourist trap to the other. It’s worth a look if you’ve never seen them before and you’re going to an attraction nearby, but they’re not something to go out of your way to see if you’re looking for high-impact attractions. Perhaps that’s the Southern Californian in me saying so; if you love taking photos with anything celebrity, this is probably a great place to visit for a bit.I will say that there was an international tourist who took one look at the Walt Disney star and lost his mind, he was so excited. So it’s not without its uniqueness. Just, expect to be approached by every tour operator and vendor along the whole pathway, and to be running in to people the whole way up and down the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliaGooliaAbroad

30,Could use some sprucing up,"As this is usually the first stop to those who are new to LA, you would think a little more care would be taken into the area and to ensuring tourists aren’t being hassled, it doesn’t make you want to stick around the area at all...Also a little directory would be nice to try and find your “Favorite” star",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldtravellercndian

50,Say...I think I saw .....!,"OK, folks. First off your NOT going to see any movie stars looking at their own Star. A walking tour would drain your mind and possibly your wallet if your not careful. I suggest (weather and your health) to take an open air guided bus tour. There are literally hundreds of them! Some deal with homes, others do haunted tours. It is can be macabre or not. Try and avoid the ones people see waving “Maps” to Stars homes only finding out half of them are dead and the other half have walls a castle would envy.

30,It could be really special. But.,"I spent a week in Los Angeles in August 2018 and I was warned by friends that the Walk of Fame is perhaps not as enjoyable as you would imagine. However, I wanted to visit at least once to see it for myself.I have never seen a busier street in all my life! The place is packed with tourists, and I suppose that was exacerbated somewhat because it was in the summer holidays, but I know other people have made the same comments as me.It is actually very difficult to look at all the stars, and certainly to photograph any of them that you wanted to, apart from the fact that they all look pretty much the same and would make for very boring photographs, due to not only the footfall but also there were some parts cordoned off where they were working on putting up banners, improving the sidewalk or improving the buildings.It's more sprawling than you think and to walk the whole thing takes a good couple of hours. Most of the stars are on Hollywood Boulevard but some spread up into Vine Street in both directions, and they are on both sides of the road. I didn't manage to find the star that belongs to my favourite band and I was tired and hot and gave up in the end, especially as part of it was cordoned off and I figured it would be typical for that particular star to be there!There are lots of people there offering tours of Hollywood, ""the stars' homes"", so if that was something you wanted to do, you would easily be able to find one that suited you here.There are plenty of cafes, restaurants, bars and shops along the boulevard too if you wanted to get in the shade, get refreshed or sit down for a while.If you really want to see a particular person or group's star, I would research ahead of time / find out if you can buy some sort of floor plan or map. If you generally just want to see the stars of a lot of cool people, you may enjoy it more than I did. If you're not overly bothered about Hollywood culture and you're trying to decide between going there or a different attraction in Los Angeles, I would choose the alternative. (In fact I myself was actually going to go to the Getty Centre but it was closed that day and this was my second choice idea.)One of the worst things is that it didn't feel like the safest part of Los Angeles. There was a local guy who walked alongside me for a bit who was chatting me up in a pretty vulgar way. It took several firm ""nos"" and a very stern ""I really would rather walk on my own, thank you"" to get rid of him. The saving grace to that is that it's so busy you could easily call for help though I didn't particularly see any police around.I wouldn't bother to go again unless I was going to Hollywood Boulevard for some other reason.I would honestly prefer it if there was an entrance booth and you could only go on the street if you were doing the actual Walk of Fame walk, and you paid to get in and were given a plan of the stars on the way in. That's impossible now because so many other hotels, businesses etc have grown around it, but it would be good if the powers that be would try and think of another way forward because as it is it's a pretty disappointing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladyvalkyrie22
10,Not worth it,"Bringing my family to LA for the first time I figured the Walk of Fame was a must do. Never again. While it is cool to see the iconic names of Hollywood lore, the aggressiveness of pan handlers and unlicensed street vendors make for an uncomfortable feeling as you walk the boulevard. You can't walk more than ten feet without someone asking for money. You would think such an attraction would merit at least a modest police presence to curb the rampant harassment of visitors but you'll quickly find you're on your own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/966jona
30,Meh!,"It was neat taking pictures in front of some of our favourite stars. The walk is crowded and sometimes there is a wait to take pictures. The worst part of the walk is the people trying to make a buck. They can be pushy and rude at times. I had a guy follow us down the walk, insulting us for not purchasing tickets for his company’s tour. The guy made my kids very uncomfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregm75460

40,Amazing,"Considering we walked up and down a road for 3 hours, it was so much fun! There are lots of souvenir shops at decent prices as well as a variety of food places to stop at. The only downside was the street 'entertainment'. Spiderman thought it was funny to create shadows on the star I wanted to take a picture of. I'm sure Kevin Costner would not approve of Spidey's actions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86jess86
30,A must whilst in LA,"Whilst in LA you have to do the walk of fame on Hollywood blvd. if your not doing it as part of a structured tour then parking can be a chore and expensive ($15 upwards). We visited both day and night and it is crazy busy at both times. Beware hawkers, beggars, hobos and “street performers” - nothing is free in LA.I must admit I was rather underwhelmed by it as I was expecting something more glamorous but it is quite “seedy”. Look out for the stars on the boulevard itself and the Chinese theatre. Loads of shops selling everything you’d expect in tourist area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sardev2014
30,Nice Walking Quiz for whoever remember the names,"Yes it is a dirty area. Yes the shops/bar are dodgy.

30,Respect required,It's such a famous entity in its own right it seems a shame to.

50,Bigger than you think....,"The stars cover pavement (sidewalk) after pavement and are all over the place, not just on one street as I expected. That said, definitely worth a visit.

Walk past bars with patrons bumping and grinding on the sidewalk. Smell the urine from ' homeless' street people, druggies and severly mentally disturbed walking dead. Past pot shops and porn stores, Scientology store fronts and monuments to their strange space alien comic book cult. It is a striking reminder that this street side filth that is Hollywood Blvd influences the world. Although many walk with families with young children, one has to question their own immorality is exposing little eyes to such a disgusting display. We walked from the W to the Bowl for a concert. Fine for adults without addictions but awful for the innocent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimBenTravelin
40,How do u visit Hollywood Hall of Fame,"After 10+ years live in LA area, here is my best suggestions to visit Hall of Fame:1. If you are NOT going for specific star, just some stars, I suggest drive !! Park you car in the Highland mall. It is only 2 dollars for 2 hours after validation from the mall. For simple validation. Just go to the ""sweet"" shop in the second floor inside the Dolby Theater by the escalator, you can take good photo with a Oscar red carpet setting for free and buy all sorts of cheap stuff there. My favorite is 3 for 10 dollars LA special candy. . Workers there are very friendly so you will have no problem to validate. it is a huge mall so it is easy to find your own way to validate. (Visit Hard rock Hollywood, Victoria secret, etc).2. After you park your car, go up to the escalator toward Hollywood Blvd. You are in Dolby Theater !! Check all the Best picture from Oscar on the way out and snap few pics. Image you are walking on the red carpet during Oscar ceremony !!3. Chinese Theater is just 2 min walk away. Just turn right from Dolby Theater.You will find all kinds of ""hand print"" in front of Chinese Theater, include Harry Potter, Star Wars, Michael Jason, etc.4. Go back to second or third floor of the Highland Mall and you can see the world famous Hollywood sign from there. Tiny but might save you a trip to bring your visitor there.You can finish all above in 2 hours so 2 dollars parking.Be ware of those actors in costume, from Darth Vader to Mickey Mouse, if you took pictures with them, need to tip. By the way, if you are lucky, you will see a lady who has all the gadget to make your own star. It is so real and hard to tell those are fake...you can put your name, choose a category (radio, motion picture, music, etc) and have a picture. 10 dollars with First and last name. 5 dollars with First name only. Very good business for her but personally, I think it worth every penny.Notice, there is a LINE store across the street with super cute plush animals and decoration. If you are a LINE fan, don't miss it.After Hall of fame, you can drive to Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive. Hard to find parking but will be fun even drive by.Have a wonderful day to tour LA !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snowinsfo
30,Overrated,This attraction was not what I expected. Lots of salesmen trying to get you to buy tours. The area is not very clean and you can walk for mile before you see Stars that you are familiar with.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OesStar
30,Times Square of LA,"The stars are fun to walk over and read and find people, other than that, not much else to do in this area unless you're paying for tours of theaters, wax museum or shopping. Stores are mostly mall brands, restaurants are mostly fast food, and it is super busy. Many street artists, people trying to get you to buy their CDs, lots of weed smell in the air. You definitely should check it out and then go do your other plans. Always less busy in the mornings before all the businesses open if you really want to see the stars. But like Jennifer Garner said when she got her star last week, kids ""don't spend a lot of time on Hollywood Blvd."".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mindyt131

30,Good to see but very dirty!,"We are on a 4 day stop off before heading to NY and wanted to tick LA off our list. Well we’ve done it now and don’t think we will be heading back.It’s great to see the stars, but really disappointed at how grubby they are. Considering this is a top tourist spot, it wouldn’t take much for someone to come through each morning with a buffer across the stars. Some of them are so dirty it’s embarrassing, you wonder what the point of it is if hey can’t look after them.There are a lot of homeless people as well but they don’t bother you at all however it can be quite daunting when there is a few of them together or they are standing over a Star you want to take a picture of. The street entertainers are a mixed bunch, some are great, others are just out for your money with little give back.We did do the Hollywood Museum which was great to do as it lets you see how much history there is in these parts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GailM94

A half hour is enough, as the street is typical Main St in Big City, USA, unless you really want to spot a star's name. Food options are really so-so and shopping is crowded and mostly chains. The souvenir shops are good and pretty cheap - surprisingly. Teens were happy to buy T shirts and key chains for $5 bucks and under!TCL Chinese theater is in the midst of the strip and worth a gawk, but not more.

30,More crowded than we anticipated,Try to visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame in off hours if possible. There were mobs of people. The LEAST pleasant part of this area was the many people dressed in various costumes and others passing out CDs aggressively trying to get you to pose with them/take a CD and asking for tips. We stayed only 45 minutes (30 of those in the wax museum) and wanted out ASAP.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcyBliss

It was a very odd and hassled experience but I guess when in LA you’ve got to see it all!Outside Graumans looking for the hand and foot prints of the famous from recent times ( Hugh Jackman, Meryl Streep) and times gone past ( Marilyn and Clark Gable) was fun - we spent ages for my daughter looking for the Twighlight cast only to find we were virtually stood on top of them!Don’t spend any longer than you must here - it’s a shame as it’s not really that enjoyable and was a little disappointing to be honest but we can tick it off the bucket list now!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markhJ1878CC

30,Be prepared to be a little disappointed,"We'd been warned that we may feel a little underwhelmed by the Walk of Fame, and unfortunately we were. The street is incredibly busy, so it's difficult to see/get a photo of your favourite stars.

30,"Topic, crowded, but imperative visit","The place was less than I expected. Crowded, many souvenir shops with almost always the same kind of products. Less costumes that I imagine in other videos and webs about the place. Honestly, we were disappointed, because we do not see any particular glamour, extravagant fashion or at least something really cool.At the end, hundreds of stars to try to find your favourite actress/actor and the final place to see their hands, shoes and writing and finally to take a dozen of shelphies. If you can, park the car close to this point, because the extension of Hollywood blvd is big and takes time walk among the crowd. Do not expend too much time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josegV3393SU

We follow the stars on the blocks. We didn't have a chance to get the map that was why we had a hard time locating our favorite celebrity stars.

Nothing but crowds of tourists, fake supermans, fake everything pretty much. Homeless run the walk of fame and the price of admission is the smell. It baffles me why anyone would visit Hollywood. If you want a taste of Hollywood I suggest going visiting the many studio's out here. I wish I had a time machine to go back to the 50's when Hollywood was a classy place.

Although there are some oddball characters around we didn’t feel unsafe with our kids there, despite what some reviews here say. It just isn’t very nice. We saw the Aretha Franklin star with memorial flowers a few days after she had died which was very moving, but the pavement stars aren’t that interesting really and it’s all a bit grimy. Given that the highly recommended Hollywood bus tours go from here you can easily kill two birds with one stone by spending a short time here ahead of going on a tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomGSt_Albans

50,Really need to see,Interesting how you walk upon the stars of famous people on both sides of the street something you truly have to experience to see for yourself you see it on TV but it's not quite the same,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love2Travel100
30,Walk of Fame Review,"I came upon the Walk of Fame because I went to a theater show. I saw the ""stars"" but I wish that the restaurants and vendors in the area offered maps with locations to the stars and where to find them (at least those in the area). I would have stayed in the area long enough to view other stars and maybe even make purchases.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PLO528
50,Alex,"Must see. Try not to go at tourist season, I mean May to September if you have a chance. Check online who is going to get a star, you can meet a celebrity",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V6117VFalexb
40,"A must do thing when in Los Angeles, California","It’s an icon in the world, we hear and hear good things about Hollywood and this is something worth stepping at, see it, enjoy and discover all the things this place has offer. It’s a true contact with Hollywood way of thinking!!!!!! Come up and enjoy yourself at it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamsosa
30,"Kinda of fun, kind of gross","I went early on a Sunday morning so it was quiet. But it's still kind of gross. I wasn't expecting much, but not so many adult store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmKay823
40,Iconic place to visit,"We were very glad we visited this iconic place, and looked at the different stars, ranging from cartoon characters to singers, actors, directors, ... You cal also stop at the Hollywood and Highland centre (along the boulevard) and see the Hollywood sign from the viewing platform on the first or second floor. And stop by the Chinese theatre as well to see some of the actors hand and footprints!The walk of fame was not exactly what we had expected though, it is a bit of a dirty road in places as some other people said, so would suggest to stay within the beginning (Elvis Presley and Beatles) and the middle (junction with Highland Avenue). But still worth seeing once in your life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisandsteph2017
40,Worth the walk,"So everyone on here is bashing how dirty and how weedy it is in the area... Number one is the down town area, as in every big city is gonna be dirty. However, it is far cleaner than say New York or Philly. And marijuana is legal here so there is going to be people smoking it. And there are homeless people all over. My little girl (10yo) even asked me if people live on the street.The walk off fame is cool, there are a lot of stars, even for things you wouldn't think of. They even had one for GODZILLA and Bruce Lee! (Favorite actors of all time)I would recommend going during sunlight hours even though the Chinese theater looks cooler all lit up at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SnakPak3
50,What a feeling,When you are there and specially during the Oscar preparation everything is different... so many stars pass by there and so many left their star name!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bichi81
30,Disappointed,Great to see all the stars but was not what I imagined. In reality they are in a dirty sidewalk. We took a stroll on our first morning around 7.30am which was perfect as we had jet lag and this meant the sidewalks were empty. We took heaps of photos. I doubt we would be able to later in the day due to it being so busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nelzgirl
30,Very Busy and Crowded Sight,We visited this sight as part of a G Adventures tour. I found while it was nice to see the different stars the area is very busy and crowded with lots of different people such as tourists and the down and out. Have seen it and I'm done here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2torontotraveller
50,Awesome time....,"Loved this, A must if your in LA..watch out for pushy pushy pushy sales people...hey they are doing their jobs for sure...Love the tours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarawerner
40,Dreaming of the Walk of Fame!!,"Visited here whilst holidaying in LA. It’s amazing how you have an idea in your head on what to expect. It’s really glamorised on TV. We still enjoyed ourselves and got to see the star tributes we wanted to see. I checked on Tripadvisor before we visited and most of them advised to be careful of people selling pirate cd and dvds, people dressed up as characters and if you take photos of them they expect payment. You can also be a target for pickpockets as whilst your engrossed with taking photos of the stars, they can be busy taking your personal items. So be extra vigilant. My husband was like the bodyguard for the few hours we were there, as he didn’t want us being hassled when we came for a fun time.Two bits of advice I can give is check online what stars you are interested in rather then wondering aimlessly as it will tell you where the stars are located on Hollywood Boulevard and bring a bottle of water as it can be thirsty work walking around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieJ0
30,"Famous tiles, nothing more","The walk of fame you have to see it al least ones, well after seeing many tiles. It was nothing too spectacular, it was funny when you saw a tile of the person you like and make a photo with it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/octimuskevin
40,loved looking for the stars,"It's been a while since I've been here, however, it was certainly memorable. First, go in the morning, most of the business along the route actually hose down the sidewalk and it's cleaner then. It is super fun to buy one of the ""stars maps"" and then mark off all your favorite ""stars on the Walk of Fame"" (also used the map later to find some of the stars homes) fun thing to do before it gets congested with other tourists and the locals that hang out there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldtravelsavy
20,"Dirty, smelly, boring and full of weirdos","Title sums it up, it’s a must do to say you have done it, but it’s just a disappointment.Not what the Hollywood image on tv is like at all.Also gets seedy in the evening. I wouldn’t go out of my way for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/legodude1983
40,I must see in LA,This was part of a tour and it was amazing and euphoric to see all of the stars in one place. We were also able to visit the Dolby Theatre as well as a Chinese Theater. However I would avoid the summer as it is packed with tourists and certainly on location that you wouldn't want to stay for very long. A true Taste of Hollywood stardom.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisandlesley03
20,Grotty and random without a guide,"Walked around on my first day with no guide except for the multiple homeless offering assistance, don't attempt without a walking tour first, massive help. Very dingy compared to the movie Hollywood image",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richyintipp
30,A must do,When planning a trip to Hollywood this is a must do of course. The Elvis and Beatles stars kick the whole walk off; you probably won’t finish the whole experience either as it is a lengthy walk by which time other attractions or nostalgic points will have grabbed your attention.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BurlsGurth
30,Ok,"Had a walk on Hollywood walk of fameIn some places it was very dirty and smelly and looked unkeptAnd got very busy late in the eveningGood fun trying to find your favourite starI,d advise going during the day time when it is less busy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nmkenny
50,Star strucked ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"Well if one is big Hollywood fan, a visit to take a snap of your idol stars at the walk of fame is a big must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariehJ616WV
30,Just to tick it off the list,"Was surprised at how underwhelming this place is. It's dirty, it's busy, the stars are just part of a sidewalk. You have to see it but manage your expectations well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samadison1974
30,Lots to see,"So we took an Uber rather than having the hassle of the parking and got dropped off down the side of the Chinese theatre, we headed away from the theatre and walked as far as the silver gazebo (Elvis & The Beatles) then crossed the road and headed back. My husband and I enjoyed the walk talking to our 11yr old daughter about who the film stars were and which films they had appeared in. We had a McDonald’s on route which was convenient. We were there between 6:15pm and 9:30pm, I took photos along the way using a camera phone, the streets were dirty and there were many homeless along the route although the thing that mainly upset me was stalls / singers set up over stars I wanted to photograph. Lots of the shops are cheap and tacky although some are worth visiting. We stoped in at Hard Rock Cafe shop. The Chinese Theatre was the best part, getting to put your hands in the handprints of the stars was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cosstick123
10,Even less then l was expecting!,I don’t know why this is on a bucket list of places to visit in Los Angeles. You only want to visit this place to understand the low score or when you want to find to your Hollywood hero!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/252robertu
30,"It's ok, but you have to dodge a lot of of people, very weird people, scary if you aren't use to that kind of thing.","Be prepared for a lot of mental illness/homeless people surrounding the walk of fame. On top of that, its pretty crowded, but if you stay close to the area you can get a good look at everything without the crowds in the morning! I suggest doing that and taking a nice hike at Runyon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imrico
50,YES,The Walk of Fame was probably one of my favorite places in LA. I expected it to be like a long avenue with the stars all along but it's so much more.It's actually a very busy street right in the heart of Hollywood. There are fun museums and great restaurants everywhere as well as cinemas and let's not forget the chance to meet celebrities any time (the cosplays AND the real ones too). There are constant street performers with a lot of talent and every now and then a new movie premiers right in front of you.We spent the entire day there as a family with teenagers and it was a lot of fun. There's just so much you can do!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_salmaeliela
20,Average and dirty,"This is that hollywood and that famous walk of fame????Oh my god..dirty,horrible and If I were there during the night I wouldnt feel so safety...Hollywoood hills is other thing.But walk of fame = average at all",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vlk777alfa
40,You’ve got to see the stars,You can’t go to LA without seeing the stars but be prepared it’s busy! The pavements were packed with tourists wanting to take photos with their favourite. Here’s ours!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/277charlotte
30,SHORT TIME WALK,"When you are in LA you have to visit the famous WALK OF FAME, but it’s not a place to enjoy walking, specially at summer time. The heat is too much and the side walk is a bit dirty or smelly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abdulaziza470
30,Stop to see but moved on quick,Wanted to see this place but crowds and room was to little it was dirty and over rated when you see it on the TV there is plenty of room but when you are there no room shops all seeing same items worth a look but glad to move on,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bjf62
30,Too many people and lots of arguing,Myself and my husband liked the walk of fame. However we found the area unsafe for children.Street vendors were arguing with each other and numerous tourists didn’t give a damn about waiting in line for a picture and just pushed in.Would we go again? Unlikely but we are glad we have been the once,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Babesb79
30,Had to see,"Wasn’t impressed after seeing on TV it looked inviting ,actually when there not very clean ,people wanting money lots of Disney movie characters in streets chasing cash for photos ,I really didn’t like walking that part of town ,disappointed !! I won’t be rushing back 👎",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterdV3835FN
30,Unkept,"It's unfortunate that despite the stars or their fan clubs/production companies paying fir the privilege of a star, many are cracked and grubby. Not great when beggars take up the sidewalk so they can't be seen. The whole area does not have the Hollywood blind it professes to have!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenh376
30,Just a touristy thing to do,"Very crowded at the Chinese Theater area. My 10 year old was super bored and could not understand what in the heck was so special about the stars on the ground even when I pointed out a few familiar ones to him. He kept complaining about the smell. One thing I have a major issue with are the people dressed in costume grabbing my kid to get him over to take a picture...aggressive photo hustlers. They acted like the very stranger danger creeps you talk to your kids about. Anyway, all that said, if you’re like me and would enjoy a trip down history lane...take your time and do it. If you have anyone in tow that wouldn’t be into that sort of thing...you won’t get what you want out of it. No glamour to this street at all. Just a place to mark off your things of nostalgia touristy stuff to do. Sort of like going to a Roswell Alien tourist attraction just because dang it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodyd337
30,Not Great!,"So our kids wanted to go here first and they to were disappointed, not a great part of LA and lots of guys pushing bus trips around the area who won’t take no for an answer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/608beverleyb
30,From George Vreeland Hill,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame goes for many blocks along Hollywood Boulevard and even on Vine Street.You will see the stars of legends and where many of the legends stood when their stars were unveiled.Marilyn Monroe, Jean Harlow, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland and on and on.While seeing the names, you will also see many souvenir shops, tour buses, street performers, famous places like the TCL Theatre that was once Grauman's Chinese Theatre and other historical places that made Hollywood great.Unfortunately, you will also come across homeless people, beggars, and suspect characters.Parts of the Walk of Fame (mostly away from the crowed areas) stinks of urine.I mean, in some spots, it's really bad.Despite the problems, the Walk of Fame is a must-see.After all, the Hollywood Walk of Fame is on most people's bucket lists.George Vreeland Hill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeVreelandHill
30,Tacky and touristy but worth a visit,"It’s probably what you’d expect it to be with lots of street vendors trying to sell tours and CDS just to get your money. Around the Chinese Theatre area, it was very busy but turn left from there and walk a short way and the crowds do thin out. You can buy a map of the locations of all the stars - all 2600 of them- and find your favourite.Look up to the Hollywood hills and you will see the famous sign in the hills.We felt quite safe here although it would be best to keep your hands on wallets and purses.We got off the Metro at Hollywood Highland by the theatre and walked to Hollywood Vine Street and saw most of the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieM452
50,Great fun!,"Tacky, grubby and wonderful! Full of people, crammed with souvenir shops, seedier and seedier as you move away from the Chinese Theater. But a splendid treasure hunt looking for your favourite stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pippadina2
40,Look for the TCL Chinese Theatre,"We visited the walk of fame first thing in the morning. It was already getting busy with tourists and scam artists. Be careful of the characters dressed up (e.g., spiderman), offering to take your photo. These characters will be requesting money from you! We found the stars themselves along the walk of fame not to be very interesting. However, since the TCL Chinese Theatre is located along the walk of fame we upped our rating to very good. We found the hand and foot prints of the stars located in front of the TCL Chinese Theatre to be quite a bit of fun to look at. I don't think that they are formally part of the walk of fame, but located along side it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ottawatraveller547
30,Good for a Quick Visit,"The Walk of Fame unfortunately did not live up to our expectations. Coming from the NYC area, we are familiar with a city enviornment but found some of the characters wanting to take pictures with you (for $), hawkers selling tours of celebrity homes and other questionable characters to be more agressive than those found in Times Square. It was fun to walk around for a while but we did not spend more than about an hour there. Also, the stars are spread out over a fairly large area and some of the ones we wanted to see were located in a borderline seedy neighborhood. Have fun but just be aware of your surroundings. It is a good place to buy souvenirs and easy to visit the Chinese Theater at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jfp420
10,Sketchy area,"I visited with my husband and two teenagers. I did enjoy taking a look at the stars on the Walk of Fame because I liked seeing who had stars and talking with my family about who the people were/are. The nostalgic aspect of the WOF appealed to me and my family.The area is so sketchy though! It was sketchy during the daytime when we visited, so I can only imagine how much sketchier it is at night. Overall, I did not feel particularly safe when walking on either side of the WOF. I saw a fair amount of police activity during my short visit, yet I don't know the nature of what occurred. In addition, we were accosted by many different people, and we were accosted in unsafe ways on multiple occasions.Other reviewers have written about the dressed up characters soliciting for pictures with them, and we experienced that too. We're glad that we knew about their tactics in advance so that we could avoid them as much as possible. In general, these characters try to take pictures with you in such a way that it's not initially clear that they are going to charge you money. We witnessed several families arguing with these characters about not knowing they had to pay. We also experienced several people literally slapping CDs into our hands/bodies and immediately saying we owed them money even when responding with ""No, thank you"" to their CD. They were really unsafe, aggressive, and rude. The area is also filthy. There is so much garbage strewn about; it's really disgusting.In all, I'm glad I saw the WOF firsthand, yet, now I can say firsthand what a sketchy, gross place it is. I would not go back for another visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathleen100100
20,Run down and dirty,"People will still visit but this place is dirty and run down. It has goneDownhill over the years.Be very careful if you get your picture taken with the Spider-Man characters or others that are dressed up, they are there to make money and will charge you for pictures, ask before you get your picture taken with them.If you really want to see this place be prepared for a pot smelling dirty location with a lot of street vendors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeB0167
50,A must go to,The Hollywood Walk Of Fame is a great tourist attraction. There are so many stars to see and even take photos with. If your a people watcher then you can definitely find a bench to sit on and watch people all day long. People from all over the world visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73_Jewels_73
20,Watch your pockets,It’s a sad statement but very true. It’s a sidewalk in the middle of the city. Street performers hustling for a buck everywhere. Pickpockets looking for any opportunity to grab what they can.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fappug55
30,Okay but not spectacular,"I was a bit disappointed if I’m honest about the walk of fame. I suppose I just expected it to have more of a wow factor. The stars were dirty, some broken and very overcrowded. We walked quite a way up and down where the stars were and the further away from the centre you went the smell of weed was unbelievable!!! At least we could tick it off our list of places to visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1972nessie
10,"Traveller from Germany: There were NO Stars in Person, Donald Trump´s Star was ""pickaxed""","Oh my god, I am so dissapointed: I did not meet a single star there, I thought there would be at least a bunch of them running around. AND: the star of Donald Trump had been pickaxed away early in the morning when we got there, how disappointing.At least we could see the stars in the Wax Figure Cabinet.Wax figueres: a very original Idea: they should have those in other Big Cities like London and Berlin.Positive: more tourists than homeless people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdkmdk2018
40,Busy but worth seeing,"When in LA, you must go check out Hollywood Blvd and walk around to check out the stars. Go ahead and take a picture with the stars. Usually others will move around you when you stop to take a picture. It was fun to walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judzv2016
20,Jan,I visited in the morning. Dirty and dreary nothing as I imagined. Very disappointing. I guess you may feel you need to see it as I did but don’t expect too much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jan-4225
40,Area bustling with activity mostly in TCL theatre area,Great to feel the hustle and bustle of this area...the 1km of Hollywood boulevard near to Hardrock and the imax TCL theatres. Further up and down is quiet and with not touristic. Very near to Sunset boulevard where you can eat better at a lower price.Hollywood sign is visible from the TCL plaza.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pikku007
30,"Busy as expected but dirty, unexpected","Ok place to stroll and see the stars once you are away from the Chinese theatre. Saw many rough sleepers, street hustlers can be a bit aggressive. Food places were expensive with ok quality best stick to well know chains for predictability.Only need to visit once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/328allenp
40,Walk Of Fame????,"Hollywood Blvd is crowded: ALLDAY LONG!Loved, loved, loved the experience.We didn’t have time to see everything because it’s a long street and it was crowded so we think about going back today to finish it.Great activity; alot of things to see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bossladyy08
30,It’s okay,"Obviously if you’re holidaying in LA then it’s a must see. It’s very busy and although it’s easy enough to spot the names on the stars it’s not so easy to take photos due to the crowds. We saw the hands/footprints by the Chinese theatre but half of it was sectioned off. There are souvenir shops galore, the $10 store was having a half price sale so we picked up a cheap Hollywood sign. The Oscar statue was really cheap looking so paid a few extra dollars and got one from Madame Tussards instead. If you go to Madame Tussards then look for the people that are giving out 1/2 price tickets or get them on line. There are also people trying to thrust CDs into your hands so be careful as they will want paying. So will the people dressed up in costumes if you have your photo taken with them. Buffalo wings is a great place to eat.All in all it’s alright and obviously you have to visit but lower your expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kezza004
30,It’s ok but be careful with hours if you take kids,"As we all know it is an iconic place to visit if you are in LA. I travelled with a 6 year older and a 12 year older and we stayed walking distance Loews, which by the way this hotel experience was horrible, check my review. Now... when we went before it was dark it was ok to walk, a bit crowded but ok, now... at night don’t take your kids. It heavily smells like weed, people are stoned and some women are dressed (barely) almost naked and are drunk. Don’t get me wrong I myself like to party and hace a good time, but I don’t recommend children to go through this. So it’s cool to go before 6:00 PM, have an ice cream at the Ghirardeli soda fountain and walk, but later at night you would rather skip it if you are going with children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manuelpJ8111BS
40,Worth seeing but don't be fooled,"I've been to Walk of fame many a time , i visited again because I had some friends who were first time visitors to Cali and LA so took them here. It's definitely an eye opener and I always warn my friends its not how you see it on TV, very dirty and stinky but still worth visiting and checking it out. Some weird characters hang out there but they normally leave you alone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annapp69
40,Busy But worth it!,"A must do, you just walk up and down the street and look at the Hollywood stars on the pavement, and outside the TCL Chinese theatre you can see the footprints and handprints of some more starts such the Harry Potter lead characters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rohankapila
50,Interesting,"It's strange to see so many pedestrians with their heads down reading the names of the stars. We did exactly the same, and spoke excitedly and nostalgically about those stars from our yesterdays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LyeCon
40,Nice walk,"Nice to walk and see all the stars, you can park your vehicle in the street and also parking garages for a price between $20-$25, I looked for about 10 minutes and found a spot on Franklin ave with no meter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angel_Benz
30,Happening place in Hollywood with lot of attractions,"While there is nothing great about this place in itself, the whole area has good vibes plus it is Home to many attractions like Madam Tussauds, Hollywood Museum plus a mall where you can see the Hollywood sign for free. Also there are good eating places around to have great pizzas. You can also take a 2 hour tour of Hollywood from there but be ready to negotiate on rates to get a good deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kshitij2003
20,"Overcrowded, stinky, and after 5 stars- you’ve had enough","This was on my list of things to see- the walk of fame, Chinese theater, the handprints but this is not a day’s worth. What a let down. I think you are better off driving through it- to check it off your list. Parking was a challenge- everything was expensive and it was horribly crowded. In addition, we were there right before a movie premier so we couldn’t even get close to the handprints or take a decent picture in front of the theater. We walked down to capitol records and the neighborhood was a bit sketchy. The shops were all the same then turned into sex shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stinkykitty
20,Visiting this place once in 10 years and it is more than enough!,"This place is very crowded and on a hot and humid day you only think of getting out of there, nothing else. We wanted to see the Trump star and it is closed due to a recent vandalism. Nothing to add... Very smelly place, where weed smokers are sharing their cigarettes out in the open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IlyaDer

40,Entertaining road,"Hollywood boulevard is busy at night.It's pavement is studded with celebrity stars.What we liked most was the entertainment you get when you walk. Lots of love figures of famous movie characters and also celebrities are found.We saw Michael Jackson, Batman, the Joker and many more for photo opportunities",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingBoneDoctor
40,Over the top star walk,"The visit to the Hollywood sign is worth it..there is some special spots to make good photo’s. Make sure you park your car well as there is much control on wrong parking.After we visit the Walk of Fame. Dissappointed. Too crowded, too many people. Not worth visiting during the day. Better to do early in the morning. Parking is paid possible for 15 euro dayprice.Nearby you find Mama Shelter for the best experience in this area.￼",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruudschaapsmeerders

40,Walk of Crowds!!!!,Busy busy spot. Started inside the Shopping centre at the Dolby Theatre. Walked the Academy steps. Then outside to the madness that prevails around the Chinese Theatre. Check out in advance the location of the stars you want to find on the Walk of Fame. Some are a walk away. You will need to be fast to get your desired snap. Certain nationalities seem to take over!!!!It is a must do if your first time to LA. GO ENJOY.!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsrob26

10,Overrated,"I walked few blocks in Hollywood walk of fame. I found this place to be sad place rather than enjoyble. There is lots of poverty there, many homeless, the place did not feel pleasent, fun or safe. I would not recommend going there. I hope the people that their name is mentioned are doing something to help the community there because this is what actually makes them real stars...in my point of view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doritc877
30,We've seen it but probably wouldn't rush back to do it again,We walked a couple of sections of the Walk. Caught the train out and dropped you right off on the walk. Took some photos of the Australians who have made it in Hollywood. The area itself was dirty and seedy. Lots of people trying to push tours onto you. If you have the time you can just walk it yourself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvonneh203
40,A must do one time when visiting LA area,We enjoyed walking along the boulevard looking for stars. It was super touristy and busy. It is dirty and food just thrown on street but everyone should see one time on a visit here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cw0108
40,It was awesome but CROWDED,"The picture where you can see all the stars is just not realistic! It is wall to wall people! Think Times Square times 2. Lots to do, tons of great food. We even got to watch a segment of Jimmy Kimmel live being filmed. One of the places that was on our list of ""must see"" while in Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988bobbyb
30,So many people,"This is pretty much just a tourist trap. There are tons of people outside at every hour in the day. If you want to go to see the Chinese theater, then I guess it's cool to see the stars on the walk, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krystiep2017
40,Fun afternoon,"While it was very hot and crowded, we had a lot of fun looking at all of Hollywood stars on both sides of the street. I was sorry to see that President Trump’s Star was covered with cardboard and had a barricade around it, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/521ruthc
30,"Tired, extremely busy, unclean","As per the title - we only walked a select section of the walk but in the short section we saw it was dirty, tired and extremely busy. Overall - I cannot see what the draw is to this place - it is horrible and I’m very glad we spent only 1 day in LA. It’s just so so busy, and feels unclassy, tired and dirty. Maybe it’s just not my cup of tea - research before spending lots of time there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairea55
20,Dirty and stressful,"Walk of fame looks so glamorous on TV, but it is nothing glamorous about it!The stars are located in a busy part of Los Angeles, on narrow sidewalks on either side of the street. So you have to calculate good time to cross the busy street and to see the stars among street vendors, beggars and other visitors.But, if you're like me and think this is a ""must see"" I'll give you some advice on the way. Find your stars on internet first, (search for 'walk of fame star locations map') and save yourself for a lot of time Exploration about 3000 stars.....If you arrive with a car, look into the corner where Highland Ave crosses Hollywood Blv. Or enter 'El Captain Theater' on the GPS. Then you will find both a huge parking place and stars like Michael Jackson, Marilyn Monroe, Sylvester Stallone, Britney Spears, Antonio Banderas, Jack Nicholson, Bruce Lee, and I could go on, and on...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrineLiseK
50,Donald Trump’s Missing Star,"You must see if in the area. This is a very controversial hot spot for conversation. LA does not like the Donald and are trying to decide whether or not to fix his star. We enjoyed this area and the Chinese theatre. There are some old movie stars that grandchildren had never heard of, but this made for some interesting topics for later mealtime conversations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shereetravel
30,Go early!,We were in town for an event that our daughter was attending at a nearby hotel and had lots of downtime while she was working. We walked all over the walk of fame several time. Honestly if you’re wanting to see the stars. It gets very crowded throughout the day with lots of people peddling various wares.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/49laurelg
30,Walk of fame,"really dirty, lots of homeless, intimidating looking people , and run down. Theres nothing glamorous about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohammedmA9487OA
10,Dirty and nasty,This looks so much more glamorous on TV. The street is loaded with peddlers and homeless people along with people disguising giving away CDs but are really selling drugs. I would suggest keeping your wallet and pockets tight because there are a ton of pickpockets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kansascitynative
30,You have to when in Hollywood.,"I’d read the reviews so knew it wasn’t the imagined yesteryear of golden paved sidewalks of stars but we enjoyed searching out some stars and seeing the Chinese Theatre. Overload of tour sellers and people wanting to sell you tings and ‘give you free things’ don’t engage with these people a simple shake of the head and no eye contact means they don’t ask you twice. It’s Hollywood, you got to look at the stars as a first timer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmapU6872WY
40,Fascinating walk,"Puts you in the center of what people see in film and TV with great glimpses into the history of the stars, the flit and glamour",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naneliz
30,Looks so much more glamourous on TV,We stayed right on Hollywood Blvd so my teenage kids were excited to find their favorite celebrity stars. We walked to see most of them and along the way you see the stars are not kept clean and some smell of urine. It’s great to get a pix of the stars you want but that’s about it. Google who you want to see and it will bring up the closest address. We also did our souvenir shopping that same day since there are some good shops along the way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moek700
30,Spent the day in Hollywood!,"It was a pretty ok experience, but I was disappointed. I had expected more, but it was such a tourist trap. Still happy I went though.The boardwalk is cool, with all the stars engraved in the pavement. TCL Chinese Theathre tour is a cool niche experience if you are a fan of movie history. Good guides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baris910
30,Typical tourist trap,"It’s nice to walk around and see how many names you recognize. Besides this there isn’t a heck of a lot to do that is interesting.Rude tourists who push and shove. We saw a man smoking weed on the sidewalk using a bong. Drunks everywhere. And the fouls language was enough to make a sailor blush.Plus don’t forget the overpriced shops and questionable street vendors.I will, however, go back again one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/watermelonPredator
30,Great place for photo taking.,Come early if you want to take photos without crowd. Be careful with people dressing up as movie characters. They will pose with you to take photo and asked for a minimum fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jasminetck
20,Dirty LA,Had a very short visit to LA and was surprised at how dirty the city is. Up in the hills where the rich an famous live is not too bad but the downtown area is quite dirty and shocked to see so many homeless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D255CQcharlesg
10,"Do you have $40,000 for a star!","If you are a little bit famous and have $40,000 to hand over, you can have your own star on the walk of fame. I wasn't excited in going to see the walk of fame, but it was more disappointing than I could have imaged. Don't waste your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/839duanew
20,Rough around the edges.,Me and my wife visited in June. Its quite nice to see the stars in the pavement but the locals are mainly drug users and alcoholics so it doesn't feel very safe at night. I personally witnessed someone walking down the street with a machete which didn't look good. It is nice to walk down during the day and see the stars and look in the tourist shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewkZ1076RW
30,Walk of days gone by,The walk of fame cover a few kilometers of street footpath so if your after someone special find out first where their star isOutside the grand theatre the street pathway is bedlam and not what the tourists would expectVery disappointed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/669bryanm
30,Must do but not more.,"When in Hollywood have to see the stars and the famous Chinese theatre...crowded, not very much to see. So I would say have to visit, yet not a highlight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NabilBKK
40,Must see,It was our first time in LA so we obviously went to the Walk of Fame. We went first thing and found parking at the Dolby Theatre fantastic. Easy to find and plenty of spaces.The Walk of Fame was as expected - a road with stars on which wasn’t very clean and had a few interesting people along the way. The area by the Chinese theatre felt safe and catered for tourists. Wouldn’t do again but definitely somewhere to visit once,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandasJ5994CW
30,A sight to behold,"Visited the WOF twice in the same day. First was during the day, was a really great experience and the second time was in the evening. On balance I would recommend an evening visit. It is that bit quieter and the way in the the Boulevard illuminates makes it that bit more special. Be on your guard, some of the street actors try to entice you into pics and even photobomb your pictures, to only try and charge for the privilege. A must visit place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markandsusie2015
30,Fun to see once,It is fun to look at the stars but most of the souvenir stores sell the same stuff. There is a mall with great food places and some clothing stores. The streets are dirty with lots of homeless people and sketchy looking people. We did not feel safe at night. We could smell and see people smoking pot too. We went a second time and were bored.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bctabby
30,Normal Street Walk with Star tiles,"Exciting to walk on the start tiles but ok for few clicks not really a tourist attraction for me, good for couple of clicks whether day or night but strictly ok. Souvenir shops around were more intresting actually",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KKS81
30,Disappointed,Maybe are expectations were too high but we were disappointed with the location a not particularly glamorous street teeming with Tourists and street Vendors making it impossible to look at or photograph the stars maybe a visit during a quieter Month would be better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X6056ASgeorgeh
50,Great!,It’s very fun to walk and looking for some artist! It’s very crowded so if you want picture it’s good idea go there early,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaniSepu
40,An Icon but not exactly ..,"I was so excited for my trip to LA and first on the list is the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I was advised by my sister to see it during the night time to better appreciate.I was really expecting it to be flashy, imagined it like how popular actresses and actors walk on that popular street with stilettos, long gowns, black ties and coats for men and how exactly it appears on the magazines and some TV shows! Soon enough we were there, walking and walking and I asked my sister, so how far are we going to walk and reach the ""Hollywood Walk of Fame""? My sister said, ""YOU ARE WALKING ON IT! ""😂😂😂. And I looked down and saw the star symbols with names printed on it. Some are faded, some are dirty, some with cigarette butts on it and a lot of foot traffic 😂😂. It was hard to take a photo but I managed to take some photos. Hollywood Walk of Fame is a long stretch of sidewalk, an ordinary sidewalk with all the names of popular stars written on it. But it was fun because it was my first time. Maybe my ignorance got the better of me. 😂😂. There are people who would dress up like Michael Jackson, Marilyn Monroe, Shreck, Spiderman and a lot more if you are lucky. So excited that I think I gave ""Michael Jackson"" a $10 tip for a photo-op 😊😊. In HWF, that's it. You walk on the star symbols, you may want to see Ripley's Museum, Madam Tussaud's wax museum, the Kodak Theater and a lot more. Cafe's, souvenir shops abound. I had fun because I was a foreigner and it is worth visiting, it is famous and it is an icon. I went back on the day time, it was plain and ordinary street, no frills, no fuzz. But over all, it was fun seeing it for the first time and not no a magazine. Worth it, it is for free.. Free to walk endlessly. 😊😊 See photos for my own version of ""walk of shame"" 😂😂😂",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzzetteb2014
10,Go to Hollywood to see these stars??? Forget it!,"OK, having lived my entire life in the greater Los Angeles area, perhaps I am jaded. But going to Hollywood--which is ANYTHING BUT glamorous these days, just to see some stars on the sidewalk is, in my opinion, quite ridiculous. The Hollywood area is not a good part of town, with many panhandlers, druggies and other crazies looking to do you harm. It's just plain not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobSacamento
20,"Not as I remembered it, sketchier","It had been about 25 years since I last visited the LA area and Hollywood is way more built up, flashier, dirtier, and less interesting than I remembered it being. I saw it again and don't need to go back. The was my teenager's opinion also. Been there, done that, no need to repeat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D904ITpamelab
40,Walk it like I talk it!,This was my first time in LA and we had to check out the walk of fame. It was pretty cool. A lot of people and a lot of entertainment. The weather was great which was a plus. We didn’t spend a whole lot of time there but it was enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/380raquelb
40,I was there on the day that Cedric the Entertainer received his star on te Walk Of Fame.,Great time. The weather was super hot but I got to see a lot of things. I went on the 6hr. Hollywood tour which I don't recommend. The 2hr. tour was much better. And we stayed downtown at the Sheraton on 7th and Hope and took the train to Hollywood. We then took a Lyft to Beverly Hills to walk around and shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srmathis
20,Dirty,I was looking forward to seeing the “stars” but I was disappointed in how dirty they were. Los Angeles can definitely do more to keep it clean. Only a small section of the street is really there for the tourists with most of it being dodge and we felt unsafe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Red947
10,Don't take children,"Wouldn't take children, area is dodgy and doesn't feel safe. Sex shops and drug dealers. Not worth it to see a few stars on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmasU3137ZV
40,Must do but read about it first,"It’s a must do when visiting LA especially the first time and you enjoy seeing some of the most favourite movie actors with their star on the walk. However, when we went (Sunday lunchtime) the place is mobbed and if it’s like that al the time then quite overwhelming. Also the place is not full of rich people. This is where your find a lot of tramps and various other degenerates. Be warned of this! But seeing the Chinese theatre and Dolby theatre and El Captain theatre plus the stars is a brilliant experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnselmColom
30,Nothing special,This is not a really attractive or inviting area not being very clean with expensive shops or common chains store outlets. There are plenty of undesirable looking people and scammers about so be careful with your security and don't be pressured into buying something you don't want.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Betula103
30,"Must see, but that is it","Loved it, for the 30 min we walked there.Just a street don't expect too much.Saw several drug addicts shooting up on the sidewalk, several homeless people sleeping around and saw what I thing was a drug deal.So watch your belongings.I would avoid this place after dark, but I always play things safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dansk2016
10,OH MY GOD DIRTY!,A awesome place now nothing like its historic and beautiful past. What in the world happened to this place? It smells like urine and is filthy dirty. Vagrants begging for money and shady looking characters everywhere. Don’t believe me go check it out for yourself. Poor Walt Disney would be so sad if he was still alive!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lewesbeachshop
20,Save your...,"...time. Walking along, looking for a star in the sidewalk? What's the point? The area is generally dirty, either over-priced shops or the standard chains that offer nothing much interesting. Shady looking characters around the area. If I didn't have to walk through here on my business trip, I wouldn't waste a minute.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanNic44
20,A must see but be careful,"Of course if you’re near the area, you have to go but be careful because there are lotsOf people (men) trying to give you “free” cds and then asking for money. Lots of characters trying to take photos for money and bothering you. Otherwise, lots to see and take photos of but very very busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Millerdes
40,Get There Early,"This us one heck if a busy place during tbe day, you'll be jostling through the crowds Get there,early or go off season. The hand and footprints outside the Chinese,theatre are far more interesting than the relatively mundane standardised plaques that line the pavement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S1152MIbillm
30,California Road Trip,"A very busy and hot July day but we enjoyed the walk of fame, we had to keep our wits about us as we didn’t want to get too involved with the various characters vying for photos to be taken (for a fee).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annmL8096GM
40,Bucket List stop,"We only spent 2 days in LA and this was a must do stop for us. I didn’t have high expectations for this, but had a great time. We parked in a garage by the Chinese theatre and enjoyed every moment of following the path of the stars. We did this during the day as I was concerned that it would be a bit dangerous at night. It was crowded, but not as bad as I thought it would be. We all had fun taking pictures of the stars and the handprints outside of the Chinese theatre. Very glad we did this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Compass426977
30,A good clean up,This was alright. However street's seem dull and dirty the same as the stars on the walk of fame. Plenty of souvenir shops and various eateries and cafes. Very busy near madam tussards. Lots of homeless and beggar's too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisadJ3401GV
10,Pathetic!,Absolutely filthy and a waste of time going! Homeless drug addicts everywhere! Nothing like what you see on tv!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cobb1971
40,Star spotting!,Have fun spotting famous names as you wander along. There are significantly more stars than I remember from my previous visit over 30 years ago and some I would not know! However we had fun looking for those we did and taking a photograph outside the Madam Tousaud entrance. However do be aware that some of the costumes characters and music artists do expect some sort of cash reward for photographs or their ‘free cd’ etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paddiperkins
20,Overrated,"It’s packed, it’s dirty, it’s busy, it’s full of tourist being tourist. It’s got the hustlers trying to sell you stuff and take you on tours. Don’t judge LA by this place. There’s so much better to see and do in LA. It’s worth the visit just for curiosity’s sake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/architecte007
10,Overrated,"Very overrated. It was stupid to see people lying on dirty floor to click a picture. There are better street entertainers in almost any other tourist city, most just seemed thugs...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/varunmaskara
40,Must visit in Hollywood,We really enjoyed walking the Hollywood Walk of Fame and spotting our favourite celebs. I’d recommend finding it where your favourite celebs are in advance to avoid having to walk the whole thing. But the kids loved it. It’s a bit crazy busy but worth doing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrightonBelle1975
40,Good fun but be careful,I enjoy seeing old Hollywood and seeing all the Stars along Hollywood Boulevard is great fun. Then the foot prints in the Chinese Theater are fun to compare with your own feet. Having an ice cream is a great way to cool off on a hot day. But be wary I almost had my bag stolen. The street can be very crowded so make sure to be alert. I was amazed at all the shopping available. All the attractions are also cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415elfriedem
50,EMINEM,"I came only to look for the eminem tile, and I found it, great satisfaction. in the meantime I saw a lot of other stars, I did not expect it, very rich, beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DDebbyy_Bo
40,Good fun,"It’s a good way to visit the city if you don’t mind a good long walk around town.It can be great fun looking for your favourite star, if you don’t fancy a long walk you can always google the location and jump on the metro.But where’s the fun in that?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaniFarrar
30,A reunion with the Boulevard .,"40 years ago whenI was young and handsome, the Boulevard(as it was called then) seemed wider and less crowded, fewer stars, of which I mostly knew. It was (to me) more magical.Today, too crowded, too noisier, less magical..Am I getting old????",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Er2210496
30,Interesting,Many of the Stars were dirty and needed repairs. The Trump Star was a funny site to see. Very crowded by mid day. I wish they had a map you could see where all fo the stars are.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annapN7702ZW
30,On the tourist path,To be done whilst in LA. Plenty of restaurants near by or juice bars. From there head to Westwood on Thursday for the weekly market.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathakali_12
20,Grubby and slightly scary!,With many of the stars needing a good clean and a lot of questionable characters around (some were seriously high on something...) it's definitely a case of 'check off the bucket list - move on'.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tomby1
20,Not as great as it seems,"It's overall pretty dirty and crowded. The shops aren't very interesting, just your typical souvenir shops. I did enjoy seeing the Dolby and Chinese theaters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/131denissea
50,Great walk!,"It´s so cool to walk in this street and look for your favorite actors and actresses.....and even cartoon fictional caracters! Very crowded,but still a must see place in Los Angeles! You can spend up to 2 hours in this area and you won´t see everything, because of course there must be some time for pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GladisCosta
50,Lifetime experience,This was a lifetime experience for me as I was walking through the walk of fame reading about each and every star whose names are engraved.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shenaliranga
20,Run down walk of fame,"I will say I was very disappointed with the walk of fame, nothing like I was expecting. The streets are very run down and worn, also filled with homeless people begging for money. Definitely worth the one time experience but never again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562cayleyl
30,Good To See,"This was my second time visiting the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I visited, this time, as a part of our Highlights Tour with a tourist company. It was cleaner than when I visited back in December 2010, but it was definitely A LOT more crowded. It was hard moving around because there were so many people and it was very hot!! I would definitely suggest visiting at a cooler non-peak time of the year. My husband had never been, so it’s was a good experience to share with him. It’s a must-see, at least once, when visiting CA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/617crystalb
10,Filthy,"Not pleasant at all, at least not in the evening/night. It was packed at expected, hard to walk or see any stars but that wasn't the worst part. The stinch of marijuana as you are walking amongst 100s of people is nauseating and disgusting. The second worst thing and the saddest is the amount of homeless/indigent people sleeping outside the businesses on the famous Walk. We went back in the daytime to look for a couple of stars but then it was easy to see how dirty it all is and how the City neglects this infamous LA spot even after all the money tourists spend there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandrae288
40,CROWDED,"It was SO CROWDED that we couldn’t see most of the stars. Maybe it was the time of year, but definitely pack your patience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/171tarat
30,"Messy, touristy, crowded and boring street","While first-time visitors may find it necessary to pay a visit to the famous walk of fame. I would not recommend spending over twenty minutes on this street. Based on my three visits made in summer 2016, winter 2017 and late-fall 2017 (I did the later two with my first-time-visiting friends and almost cried when asked to go here), this place does not provide a great picture of the city of Los Angeles. You don’t get to find your favorite star’s name easily unless you walk incredibly slow, and TILT your head to see all the reversed names (they do this since people obviously walk along this street in two directions, but inevitably you miss half of the names if you want to walk and read comfortably). You don’t get a glimpse of the busy Hollywood moods unless you smartly realize that everyone approaching you may charge you a fee without notice in advance, and that everything given to you costs as well. Also, the shops by the street sell universal souvenirs seen anywhere else in the world’s other big cities (I’m pretty sure there is always somewhere you can go to find a “LA” or “HOLLYWOOD” mug).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qinghuix
30,Visit to Hollywood,We both visited Hollywood in the day paid $25 to park car for 3 hrs. Walk of fame street not clean drug uses laying on the pavement out of it. Not a nice place to go to never againCheap goods not well made sold in 9 out 10 storesWould not recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W5591ZEalana
30,Grumpy part of town,The walk of fame itself is great. Walking along trying to spot the stars you know from past & present however it is such a grumpy part of LA. There are people demonstrating all along the walk way over various things. There are the con men trying to get you to take a free music CD and there are a lot of homeless. It’s full of tacky souvenir shops. Reminds me of the bad end of Tottenham Court Road.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siobhansmithis
20,Just busy busy busy!,My suggestion- arrive very early and it’s great - arrive late and you will be amongst many thousands of people jostling for a view if the stars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidCardiff101
50,Must see,You can find almost every Hollywood star's name in this blvd. I loved it. Good restaurants and gift shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matthaus_n
30,Just ok,I’d been looking forward to seeing the stars. However the crowds are so big all the time you can barely see them. I tried to stop and take pictures but ended up either getting in people’s way or someone stepping on the star in the photo! Still a good iconic thing to visit and was fun trying to find certain stars. Be careful of people pestering you for money along there too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJanes1511
30,It should be better,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame, just outside the Chinese Theater, is quite interesting but also, could be a lot better. First the interesting part, walking along looking at stars that you know is nice. Finding them is half the fun. Outside the Chinese Theater, were the stars left hand imprints and shoes is also very interesting. Going up to the patio area, you can see the famous, ""Hollywood"" sign on the foothills.Now, how it can be a whole bunch better. The sidewalk opposite the Chinese Theater, reeks with urine- especially in the summer!!! There were plenty of people so it took time to be able to take a picture or two without holding up pedestrian traffic. There were ""picture hounds (Those dressed as characters wanting you to fork over cash to be in your own picture). Hardly any security as in LAPD. You would think that this IS a tourist attraction, either the City of Los Angeles, the Motion Picture Industry would clean, polish and repair the stars. The answer is NO. That is a shame and why it could be a lot better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tarrytownvic

20,Not what you’re thinking of.,"When you think of the Hollywood Stars, I guarantee that unless you’ve been here before you aren’t thinking of this place accurately. Honestly my whole family and I were just very disappointed as the stars are nothing more than a boring, dirty, and rundown way of getting people to visit the tourist traps situated on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cahnola
10,Skip it...,"Much like the strip in Vegas... debris every where...dirty, smelly, just skip it. Unless you know exactly what star and where it is located then make a 2 minute stop.

40,Walk of fame,It is fun to walk along and look at the stars . There is a lot of people on the path. Lots of people wanting your money. Don't give in and just keep walking . It is something to see snd free,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5637MFlisaa
20,Pretty run down and very touristy.,Wasn't impressed unless you like Time Square. It felt like a tourist trap with cheap trinket stores on every block with people dressed as charachters trying to charge you to take a photo with them. Lots of homeless folks walking and laying around this area however there was a significant police and security presence too. We only lasted a half hour due to what my family called the ick factor. Did think the Chinese theater was cool to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/883leep
30,Stars and tourists,It is interesting to see and walk ‘walk of fame’. Its a busy street with lots of tourists stopping walkers to take a pic of their favourite stars. So it slows down sidewalk traffic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyDayton_Ohio

40,Good couple of hours,Had to be done when in LA. Kids enjoyed spotting stars and even couple of celebs there too. Trumps star smashed again which was amusing as lots of TV crews there!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashnjo
30,Overrated,"We were really looking forward to this as one of the famous LA tourist attractions. It’s pretty tacky. Although fun to go round and spot names you know, would really recommend checking on their website first to make sure the people you are looking for are there as lots you’d expect are not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanneo554
20,Look carefully ... no to our expectation,The family in the evening if our first day in LA ventured here... accidentally via Farmer Jos.... you can easily miss this as the pedestrian traffic is very high! Also for the san reason you cannot read the star names for the number of people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanem590
50,California 2018,"We parked in Hollywood and Highland (shopping mall). Basically your right by the walk of fame. Get your ticket stamped in the mall (buy a drink) and you will get cheaper parking.The Walk of Fame area is very busy, but people do mind out of the way for you. Watch out for people trying to sell you DVDs etc....they’re a pain!!Still worth a visit!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/906petes
40,One of famous places of LA,Walked along the different stars looking for the ones we really like and know. Quite crowded so not always easy to take picture and you have always different dressed up characters roaming around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DidierNivelles
40,"Walk of Fame... Teens/Family, No plan",Visiting LA for the first time and decided to see the Walk of Fame. We had no real plan and my husband and 2 teen girls left fairly early according to teen time. Arrived around 1030am and parked at Madama Tussaud for $18. We walked up the main drag for maybe 25min and then came back. Wished we would have planned a little better to find out where certain stars were but we got the idea. It was packed with people and this was a Thursday. Lots of people trying to “give” you stuff but it’s not Free! We zoomed past the Dolby Theatre and TLC Chinese theatre which they had no interest in seeing. It was actually cleaner than what I had read about and didn’t really see much homeless but maybe because we stuck to the main drag. We visited Madame Tussaud was museum and then left the area. An easy enough visit and would go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heathersW4154PT
40,2nd time around!,We had a great time walking around the strip. If your looking for a certain star just google it! It saves time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisav974
20,Disappointing,"It's worth checking out only if you're in the area. But unless you have a strong desire to experience this Hollywood moment, it's not really worth it in my opinion. The walking traffic on the sidewalk is just as bad as the car traffic on this street. Maybe we just went at a bad time, but there were so many people. Didn't really look for stars since we were just trying to navigate walking down the street. The area is not very clean. The sidewalk and the stars are dirty. Passed by a few people in random spots actually doing drugs right there out in the open in front of everyone, not even trying to hide it. Parking is difficult. We found a parking garage off one of the side streets. I'm sure there were other parking garages in the area so make sure to use your GPS to find one nearby. Overall..... been there, done that, don't care to do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvonnefrasca
40,Must see,Hollywood Walk of Fame is one of the must sees if you are visiting Hollywood. Be prepared for many street vendors trying for your attention and dollars. Not to mention a large homeless population. It's all safe and fun. There is also a strong police presence.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royalpalmshade
20,Overated Attraction,"Visited the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame with family. Place was very crowded and plus the day we picked was hot and humid. The place is okay and there was nothing special about it. Kids enjoyed finding stars of their favorite actors. The route is not well kept and was crowded with vendors and peddlers. Lots of weirdos dressed in Disney characters bugging you to take pictures - off course for money. On a positive note, there are few nice restaurants along the route which are worth trying. It was sad to see some visitors stomping and spitting on Donald Trump’s star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bcm2019
20,Disappointing,"We were really looking forward to this, but were sorely disappointed. The street was grotty, the stars dirty with lots of litter and spillages. It looks like whoever looks after this attraction doesn’t care since it doesn’t have to be clean to attract thousands of tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/839iaina
20,Not what you would expect!,So disappointed with the Walk of Fame. It stretches over a large part of Hollywood Boulevard but in most parts it’s really not a nice area. Lots of poverty and you don’t feel particularly safe. Often difficult to stop and get pictures as really busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamie344
40,Must Do Fun!,Walk of Fame is a must if you haven't done it before. It's free and fun! Be careful and aware as there is a bit of a homeless and shady population hanging out but it isn't dangerous. Just don't engage. There are a lot of great souvenir shops in the area too and lots of character actors for pictures and fun if you want to give them a little tip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaHall04
20,A bit of a disappointment,"This is something that I’ve always wanted to do, but it was over crowded and the stars are all dirty and there’s a lot of people just trying to make money - the souvenirs are also disappointing, the same in every shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaP4130
30,Shopping and food,"A couple shops, Dave and Buster's, talent along the strip... I liked it. We didn't know where we were going, we just ended up there. Just have to pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melohnee
20,I expected way more,"When you think about Los Angeles you immediately have the walk of fame in mind. I was disappointed. Nothing special about the street, at some places very shabby. I guess you kind of have to see it but well...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalwf
50,Fun!!,"I really loved getting to find my favourite ""stars"" on this walk! Lots to see and do, non-stop entertainment, all you need to bring with you is a few bucks for a cool drink and a happy attitude.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joslynrose
10,Gross,"This was not at all what I expected. I was expecting well-kept and attractive. There were bums all over the place and weird characters trying to get you to take pictures with them and then of course ""begging"" for money. Do the stars have to pay for upkeep of their star? Because lots of them were cracked. Just not the best place to bring family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganlucas09
20,"Long walk, busy and always hard to get a decent picture!","bucket list tick off, kids complained a lot as they were not able to get many of the stars photos as they would have liked becasse the amount of people down there is ridiculous. Parking costs is also ridiculous. we got a parking ticket due to a sign that we could not read down it to being graffitied all over. not sure if I would rush back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smeeezeme
40,Plenty to see,The area isn’t the cleanest and it’s a busy spot but I enjoyed walking down the street looking at all the stars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elleahyouorah
20,Most disgusting street,"We traveled to California to knock some things off the bucket list, one being the walk of fame. This street is the most disgusting street I have ever seen. And we have been to alot of places. It’s sad that a street meant to honor the stars, has also been allowed to serve as a home for the homeless. People just sitting on sidewalk no shoes, nasty clothes..one man was picking a scab. We saw men digging in trash cans. It was just nasty. Not only that but its home to half of LA’s top con artist. They pretty much stop you and don’t really give you a choice on paying them. Some can get pretty aggresive. We traveled with a 5 yr old and 17 yr old. She was fine, but the little one had no idea why we wanted to walk on stars names. Especially when some were even covered in human and dog crap. Like I said, it was so disgusting. I’m glad I got it marked off my bucket list, but we all went to our hotel and scrubbed down with dial soap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brandim481
50,Must do,This is a must do if you are in the areaIt is so Iconique that it is a must seeAlso you can see the Hollywood Sign if you go up the big and large stairs I can’t remember the name of it but it is pretty obvious once you see them. It is right to the hop in hop off red buses and across the street from the chocolat placeThere is a Harley Store if you are into itWe did not eat in the area Just walked around and did the hop on hop off tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnikF
30,Ok to do once,We walked down the hall of fame as typical tourist. Can get pretty crowded and approached by lots of characters to take photos for money. Ok to do to check off the box. The big well known starts have their stars just outside the Dolby theatre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WarrenPF
40,Crowded,Lots of things to see on the stars street - find your popular star and make a picture or let’s create your own star,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennys34
30,"Nothing special, dirty and very busy","It’s one of those must see things in Hollywood/LA but don’t expect much. It’s dirty, busy and you’re unlikely to see many stars or be able to get a good photo due to the large amounts of people around standing in the centre of the stars themselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlotteKirsch
40,Do the Walk!,"Yes, it is just another street, but what a street! As you check out all the stars you can't help but find at least one (and probably many more) famous name that you admire, appreciate, respect, swoon over, wish you could meet or just jogs your memory because of a favorite musical, song, movie, TV show, comedy.......................... There are plenty of shops and other things to observe as you go too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RecreationV
30,Hollywood Glamour!,"Nice, must-go to collect all your favorite stars! Just be careful with all those characters dressed up in the street closing in automatically for photos with you and then asked for photo tips from you (they even demanded for a ‘minimum’ amount)!! This is the least friendly part that I didn’t expect. They could have put up proper stalls and price the photo opportunities openly. I think tourists will welcome that more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alyf38
20,Disappointing,Went here to see the stars on the walk of fame. People had told me that it was a little rough here and that it wasn't much to see. It's one of those things you want to see but it's a real disappointment when you get there. It's just a normal street with a bunch of stars on the floor. The area seems very run down and to be honest it's not worth a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fordy2014
30,Shady but Hot,"It's an experience I think everyone should have. This is an eclectic area with many personalities. Keep your eyes open, purse tight and enjoys the spectacle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajlively76
40,Just have a look,Funny to find the stars of artists you love. The downside is too many so-called musician selling cd and so-called actor try to have you taking pictures with them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodjin
40,Must-see,"Everyone knows about the stars that line the sidewalk along Hollywood Blvd. As far as the best way to see them, you decide what you want from them, as they go on for blocks. One can just meander, exclaiming familiarity with names, recalling their movies or shows, or you can have a specific goal of whose you'd like to see. In that case, do your research, google it, so you know where to go. Legend has it there is a homeless man who shines the brass in them, asking for donations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Partera60
40,Walk all over the stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️,"There are tons of stars all along Hollywood Boulevard - from Michael Jackson to Frank Sinatra and James Cagney to James Cameron. They are on both sides of the street and seem to go down the entire Boulevard. It’s very busy around the Chinese theatre area and we particularly noticed how popular Michael Jackson remains with loads of people stopping to have a picture. One ‘star’ which particularly stood out to me was the 4 (all the same)on the corners of Hollywood and Vine for the Apollo 11 astronauts. Some stars looked a bit tatty - dirty or cracked, but they all seemed to draw huge crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenm442
30,A mile of stars,"We walked trying to read all the stars looking for a couple dozen we wanted to take a photo, but it is dangerous to walk looking down along very crowded sidewalks. We got a few photos, but people do not mind stepping on the star you taking a picture with someone. we spent two hours walking looking for the stars we wanted, only finding about half when we gave up. Summer, the sidewalks are shoulder to shoulder people, so this was not fun. Also, many of the stars had things spilled or covered with dirt. On one we took a wet one trying to clean it but people ran into us many times, even knocking us over a couple. I wouldn't spend a lot of time, but definitely walk the area at Hollywood and Highland so you can say you saw they stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomaspZ9286SG
10,Filthy!,If you like the smell of urine then head down to check out the broken dilapidated walk of fame. We were more concerned with watching where we walked than taking in the sites. Dodging so-called musicians hawking their CDs and homeless than really enjoying the moment. Entire area needs to be redone. So much more to see and this ended up being a disappointment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aclary
10,It smelled like urine....,"What a sad site this area is.... dirty, filthy. It looked like some areas of the walk were better than others but it could be so much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OldNavy1961
50,ALWAYS A MUST SEE !,"Great visit, had a lot of fun with my family and friends.. too bad it was raining that day but we still did most of the walking of fame and a little bit of shopping. Boardwalk was busy due to the premiere of the Pacific Rim movie. The best place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hambch
40,Bizarre!,"Ok so we all know what we think the Walk of Fame is, right?Wrong!It’s the following:1) pretend rappers trying to rip you off to buy their CD’s once they hand you the CD they are forcing €5.00 from you!2) people dressed as film stars wanting their picture taken - that’s another $5.00!3) sleazy characters and religious folk with loudhailers - people playing guitar (badly) and constant pressure to buy water “for a dollar” - with a catchy tune!Aside from that, it’s a bit of history. You’ll see all the names and it’s an experience to behold!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlasgowCurryClub
40,Walk of fame,"Lots of things to see there, very busy place, lots of people. I would like to mention , this area has some homeless people , I did not see any illegal activity .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorrainespayde
50,SILLY BUT SO MUCH FUN,"Would YOU want people to step on your name by the thousands? The whole idea is so silly, but manages to be nevertheless irresistible. ""Oh look! There's so-and-so!"" Many names are lost to time, but so what? It's still fun to see the stars....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miriyamg
40,Just playing tourist for the day,"My kids love walking around the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Just be careful of people trying to give you CD’s then they ask for donations. To purchase souvenirs, go to the 5 dollar store and just look around the store La La Land ( way over priced )The fresh fruit stands are also very yummy.P. S. Bring cash to donate to Spider-Man , etc if you want to take pictures with them as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minecraftfnaff
20,Dirty Hollywood,Not what you see on tv.. Hollywood is really dirty and people are out there trying to really make it.. that’s about it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoslynF
10,Very bad expirence,"Well, it looks fine on the photos, but the photo doesn’t have a smell. Feels like you walk in a big mobile bathroom, even worse than that. ( Pee stains or fresh all along the road, better at the TCL Chinese theater area) It’s sad to see your favorite name star is so dirty and smelly. It’s very crowd too. But as a land landmark, you feel like don’t want to miss it. So park your car a few blocks away. (We paid $20 at the one which is on of the begging of the walk.it’s even prize for before leaving 6pm, we only stay less than 1 hour there, so find a further cheaper parking) Got a Uber to TCL Chinese theater, then walk around. There is a shopping center can spend some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LijiaoS
20,Poor Maintenance,"We visited the Walk in the morning. Crowded, dirty, and constantly harassed by guys selling tours, junk, dope. Really annoying. Parking cost $20 even for a very short stay. Very disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hotziek60s
30,Not what we expected,"Well, with how it looks on TV, we kinda thought it would be cleaner. There is lots to do and see, lots of shopping, lots of places to eat. Once it starts turning evening, there are lots of people to watch. Gets pretty crowded, and it starts to smell ""skunky"" if you know what I mean. I would come down here again, but not with small children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheNextNewt
30,Just a stroll,"We just wanted to see some stars. Searched for them, took pictures and kept on going. It only gets glamorous when the star is given. After that, is nobodys land. Some are broken, some are very dirty. Some we couldn't find. But over all was nice to walk.The reason I give 3 stars, is because you have so many people offering you things in exchange for money, even for a penny. Even ignoring them, they still walking behind you, trying to get your attention.But, take your walking shoes with you and let the inner searching fan inside you find your ""star""!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/549abbyr
50,Really Cool!!!,It’s not exactly what you would think. But cool to see and finally get an up close look at the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame. Very crowded and people every where some trying to sell things and some in costumes wanting donations to take pictures with them. You’ll get a kick out of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandMasterOfTravel
30,Tourist Destination...,"This is totally a Tourist Destination... We took our family here to tick the box and found that it is totally a tourist destination... While cool and if you have a favorite star on the Blvd. it is fun, you could miss this site, google it and watch someone else enjoy it on youtube and get more from the experience while enjoying more time elsewhere. Parts were kinda seedy and there were some areas where we were concerned about the people waking around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TampaTravelers1234
30,Just looking at stars,One just walks the streets up and down and looks at different celebrities names. It’s a tourist trap of magnitude. Lots of anime’s that trap you and tricks you to take photos and ask for money. Some look really good others are really bad. The kids thought it was fun to find stars with their favorite actors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/577jimmys
50,Pretty Cool,We walked up and down the Hollywood walk of fame. It was very crowded but pretty cool to see all the stars. Parking was expensive at $20 at the garage we parked in. Other than that fee it was a cool experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Porterhub
40,not as good as one would imagine,"It is a must-see, but it is a little underwhelming. It is a working street, meaning it is constantly being walked on, so you don't really get the chance to hunt out the stars you want and marvel at them, as it is very busy. Go, but don't expect too much",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkS-Chelmsford
30,Seriously needs a good clean.,"All very interesting and that, but surely they could run a cleaning machine over it occasionally? Far too many of the 'stars' were filthy dirty, and covered with what I wouldn't dare guess, and some were even cracked and broken up, especially at the intersections. We went looking specifically for Steve Irwin's, but the street and shops became pretty seedy and we had our young granddaughter with us, so we turned back before we got to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenC527
40,A must do,"It is great to find your favourite star in this wide area that stretches several blocks. Muhammad Ali is the only star not to be in the ground, his is in the wall on the way into the Dolby Theatre. However, as mentioned by other reviewers, the area is really quite rundown and many stars are dirty and neglected. However, you wouldn't want to be in Hollywood and not come here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lottie03
30,Waste of time,Given the fact the stars are invited but someone still has to pay $30k a year upkeep it looses its impact. Dirty streets and big crowds too much to enjoy it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottlopa
50,Must see!,"You simply MUST find your favorite stars on the HWOF. If you’re in Hollywood it’s kind of hard not to notice the pink stars all along the sidewalk. A trip to LA would not be complete without exploring this area. Some of the stars were dirty which was a bit disappointing, almost sad. There’s just so much to see in this area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Southerngypsydreams
30,A lot of walking for a lot of stars,"This is a long walk if you want to see all the stars, go online and download the map for the stars you want to seeIs is a bit disappointing in places with drunks and homeless people and the strong smell of urine in some places is overwhelming, but it is still a must do",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricki475
50,Walk of Fame,It was fun but sooo many stars and hard to figure where to start. I would suggest mapping which you want to see or you will be walking all day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CheriBecker
20,Super Crowded,"The Walk of Fame was extremely crowded and there were many panhandlers and people peddling their things for sale that I felt unsafe at times. It was hard to take pictures of any of the stars because of the large crowds. We went in the afternoon so perhaps there are times with less crowds. The area was a bit dirty and again, I did not feel safe when we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelleg436
20,Crowdy and Tacky,Ok so it’s glitzy and glamorous from a distance. But up close this is lowest common denominator territory. Lots of hawkers and tat. Go early and get out. So many better things to see in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gsutherl
40,Not bad,"Good thing to checkout while in the area—if you have the patience to get into LA with the traffic. Lots of neat shops, tours and attractions in the area. “The Walk” spans several city blocks however, some of the stars have been neglected and look in rough shape. Picking up a 3 pack admission to the Wax Museum, Riley’s Believe It Or Not, and Guinness World Record Museum is a good way to spend a few hours in downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NFMTravel
40,Must do,Pretty cool. Hollywood must see. Find your favourite and try get a selfie. Real buzz about it. Go between LaBrea and Highland.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claytoro
50,Exciting,"Nice to see your favorite movie stars name engraved. Nice place. Nearby there are museums, Hard Rock Cafe, souvenir shop. Only thing didn’t like that people walk on the star’s names. That area shud be clean and nobody shud be able to walk on it. It hurts if someone walks on your favorite star’s name. Pretty happening place, must visit. You can also see Hollywood sign from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/534maitp
20,Final visit. Sad.,"It had been many years since I went Walk of Fame. Others in group had never been, so we decided to go. Visited on a Thur AM. So sad what has happened. We took a handful of quick pics and kept moving along. Smell of urine was atrocious. The place is so dirty and rundown. Guy became irate and confrontational when we didn't take up his offer of a tour. Made an awful experience worse. Other folks trying to hand out cds, brochures, ??, etc... If you've never been, go for it with caution. If you've been before, it has changed for the worse = take a hard pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillC_ATX
50,Just 1 day in LA,I got a metro day ticket for 7$ and was able to see all I wanted using metro train or bus. Totally easy to reach even though our hotel was in downtown LA. Was a fantastic experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/696desr
40,Stars everywhere,"I went here 7/13/18, in search of Michael Jackson’s star. It was one of the first ones I noticed. It was a breathtaking sight all around! The area around TCL Chinese Theatre and Walk of Fame was too claustrophobic for me. Too many impersonators and wannabe rappers pushing their albums for tips...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelaz428
30,"Worth the visit, but not what you expect","As a native Californian and a local, it is embarrassing to know how many people come from all over the world to see this historical Hollywood landmark, only to be bombarded by tourists and street peddlers. The world's most famous sidewalk is filthy, filled with street vendors and there are homeless people sleeping in the doorways. It is also super crowded in the summer and holiday breaks. That said, the Hollywood Walk of Fame is worth the visit. Early in the morning, before the stores open and the tourists arrive, is the best time to see the more than 2000 stars at your feet. You won't see any stars in person, but it is free to walk around and quite nostalgic. There are some other great attractions nearby so you can easily make a day of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maxxw2013
20,Must see but very sad,"When you visit there, manage your expectations and you will enjoy it.True that it is very long road but actually, you should be focused on the area from Koda/TCL theaters to few blocks from there.Try to come by evening, lights and crowd make this area more fun.It is a must see place when you are around, 1-2 hours visit at most, enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaananTZ
30,Walk of fame,"This visit is exhausting. From every corner there are people offeri g to you tour guide, lot of stars are on the street and lot of people everywhere. It is interesting to see but once only. As the stars are on more streets and this is not anymore unique.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/makafelix
50,Very nostalgic!,Great place to bring family.So much history here.Try to come at 8 am to enjoy it before the large crowds.Every star has a time in our lives.I’m not sure which one is more important to see then another.But you will definitely find one that causes you to reflect back in time.Great place to people watch .Everything you need is right in front of you. This is a day trip for sure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daveleclaire
20,What's the big deal,"Well you find names of your favorite celebrities engraved on the pavement, but they are not the real persons right?And the place is so crowded, I got in an out of the place in less than 15 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/satlakhapu
30,The glitz of the strip,"Visited with party of 7, street was super busy with lota if spectators viewing a premier of a movie at chinamans theatre so some of the street and pavement was blocked off. All the normal fanfair of such a ikonic area of LA with lots of shops, street characters/performers and of course general public. The street could do with a general tisy up as it's a bit unloved and unclean to be honest. No real rubbish/trash in the street, but the pavement, buildings gutters etc are all very grotty and looked like it's not been cleaned in ages and is in loved. A bloody good preaure clean of the street and pavement would be a great start as this place is busy and a major tourist attraction.Ita a must see when visiting LA. Half a day max is all you would need.move theatre here is expensive at$28 per person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robcX898NR
20,Star studded pavements,Interesting to see how many “stars” that I had never heard of. It is good to visit but I’m not really impressed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdywest
40,Must-see for tourists,"Just admit it. You've heard about it and probably seen some TV footage and this is wortha stop. It's hard not to keep searching for famous names, even if it means bumping into some other tourists doing the same. The scene is chaos every day, with thousands of visitors and hundreds of wannabe actors dressed in movie theme outfits offering to take photos with you. Understand that if you take a photo you are required to pay the performer five bucks. No freebies. Be sure you ask before you agree to a shot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mesatraveler
20,Meh.,"Mobs of people, street vendors clogging the sidewalk selling all kinds of crap, stars in the sidewalk with celebrity names under them. It was fun for a while, and it’s something you have to do while you are in Hollywood but a little bit goes a long way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RouteSixRoadie
50,Great,You can spend hours walking up & down Hollywood Blvd & the best thing about it is its free. interesting to see where some of the stars have there stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/57chevycustom
40,Some parts are nicer than the others.,"As most have already said, this is really just a long street with stars on the ground. I didn't understand why people were arranged that way so if you don't have time to look for someone in particular, you'd be better off using a map or a tour.The street itself offers different things from costume shops to theaters to museums so it is not a bad walk.I did notice that a lot of the heavyweight names are placed near major places like across Dolby Theatre or the Metro or something.Good luck and have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loremel
40,"Cool walk, people watching","Just a bunch of stars on the ground! Not really! The feeling you get walking around is very surreal. All these famous people have been there and now you can too. It has many street people characters but be careful, if you stop to take a pic with them, they will.ask foe money. Lots of good priced trinkets and clothing in the multitude of shops. Great open bars with outdoor seating for people watching. Pay attention to Happy Hour prices. Can save some cash. If you want to take a Hollywood Tour I would reccomend Hollywood sightseeing and celebrity tours. 2 hours and you see enough and only $35 though TripAdvisor. Spend 5-6 hours down there with a tour for a great day. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jacksun1002
40,Great for tourists,"It's fun to stroll down the sidewalks and try to figure out who all these stars were. It's like a trip down memory lane😃😃😃. Watch out, though, for the many holes and missing concrete along the way. It could really use a bit of repair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainep868
10,Just a street,We walked here both because we lived near by and were hungry and because we felt that we had to see it because of all the attention. It was just a street with stars. Pricey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etenga
30,Way Too Crowded,"If you want to be able to see any of the stars on the walk of fame, stroll it before 8:00 a.m. This place was packed for blocks and I mean shoulder to shoulder people slowly moving along. It is worth going out there early to see the historic walk and find the stars for your favorite star(s).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJRogers61
30,"A pavement with stars in, spoilt by market stalls selling tat","I bet in its hey day this was a great place, however, it is full of street vendors selling tat and rappers trying to thrust CD's in your hand. Avoid eye contact with them, see a few stars and then do a swift exit stage left luvvy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cathyandpeterw
40,Great fun,"While getting there can be a problem (lots of confusing small one way streets), once you're there it's pretty fun to look around at all the stars on the sidewalks. I haven't seen them all but each time I'm there I come at it from another angle and always find something new. The only annoying part I'd say is all the cosplayers that want money for photos, and street salesmen selling demos and knockoff sunglasses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minimacaz

10,Disorganized dumpster fire,Terrible tour. Front office unprepared for checking in customers. Then we waited for 30 minutes to be led to our tour only to be left behind by our trolley driver.Tour was uninteresting and most of time was spent in traffic.Don’t spend your money!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kacey973
50,A Friday night hang out walking was fun..,"This is ONE of the famous tourist attraction in LA and Hollywood area part of LA. This footpath with lot of famous celebrity stars from all leading actors, directors etc in range of hundreds will found defn., one if ur favourite star and can snap a picture.. Hint: All world famous stars will be in front of Dolby Theatre where Oscar Night Happens and I front of TCL Chinese theater..A must visit any day in LA ..🙂🙂",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArunM04
40,Awesome the first time,"We have been there already several times. My first visit was 20 years ago and back then I was thrilled.It's a must see if in Hollywood and you will look for the names of your favorite actors. It's a crowded place no matter when you're there. Men's Chinese Theater is also a must see.This time there was a world premiere of a movie again and the street was partly closed. But from Hollywood Highland Center we saw a few celebs. This time it was ""Antman and the Wasp"". It's quite exciting.Be careful, many people approach you with music cds or other things they want to make known and they want money. Costumed people running around, if you make pics they also want money. Just pass and ignore! You'll see a lot of crazy guys, that's Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misscalifornia1
30,Overhyped,"I guess this is one of those things that you either like or don’t like. I found it to be overhyped and overcrowded. It was also a bit grubby and dirty. There were lots of interesting street artists around here so you could get a picture with them if you want. Overall, unless you want to see or take a picture with a particular star, you could give this a skip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holidaywhisperers
50,"Hollywood fun for family, friends, guests, and singles.","A great way to visit the Hollywood stars. This is a wonderful way to pay tribute to Hollywood stars who made a successful career acting, singing, and performing in show business. Join visitors as you walk down memory lane. Remember when you stand by a famous star, that is where the actor received their star award. Enjoy your journey through Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M9719AKpaulam
30,Dirty,I had a layover and couldn’t wait to show some loved ones the famous walk of fame. I was so disappointed by the smell of pot everywhere and lack of police patrol. It was dirty which I understand since so many people are walking and seeing this however I felt safer on the streets of Cabo at night than I did in the good ole USA walking down this street. It is fun and loved seeing the stars and unique people but there needed to be more police presence and less pot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvsfiremen
40,Go early morning to avoid busy and crowds,The walk of fame is great. it spans for many miles and I got told by a tour guide there is more than 3000 stars. I would suggest going early because by 3pm it's packed with family's and children etc. some parts are dirty but still good to look at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katiehiscock

50,Fun to see the names of the old stars mixed with the new,"We had fun walking around the streets of Hollywood finding our favorites here and there. Didn't realize stars could receive multiple stars for the five different performance categories. (film, recording, radio, television, live)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HarperVoyages
20,A walk along Hollywood Boulevard to the Chinese theatre,"Dirty streets. Stars run for a long way, possibly 1 mile. Fun name spotting.Chinese theatre is the focus. Lacked the glitz and glamour that Hollywood suggests.Seems an good location for a cheap pizza and a new mobile phone screen. Plenty of people asking for you change as you stroll along",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apb180868
40,Part of an LA Tour,"We stopped at Hollywood for almost an hour and took in the sights, including the Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood walk of Fame. Wasn’t as crowded as I had been led to believe, also saw Elvis’s car at LA LA Land",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laurel_265

30,A must-visit if you like that kind of thing,"Couldn't come to LA and not do this - it's so famous. But extremely busy and very tacky. You will get ripped off for parking anywhere near it, so be prepared to park a few blocks away and walk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giffnockman
30,Hoped for better,"One of the main purposes for some tourists visit Hollywood is the walk of fame, unfortunately some will be underwhelmed jus due to the cleanliness of it or the lack there of. I understand these are side walks but even a City like New York comes up with ways to keep a certain square blockage of street lookin presentable for tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coolblue05
50,MDRT conference,Good location to visit time passes quickly here worth the visitWe travelled to Hard Rock Cafe had breakfast here plus travelled here again in the evening to see the night life seriously busy placeGreat hard Rick food services and experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Primewealthsolutions
30,Should see it one time,"This is an iconic walk that everyone visiting L.A. with teens should check out. You can be done with it in 15 minutes, tops. But it’s cool to see and your kids will feel the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kelly32963
10,Won’t be back,"Second visit in 8 years. Our first visit was brief, our second visit was awful. We chose to return as we thought an LA visit wouldn’t be complete without a Hollywood Walk of Fame experience however in truth it has completely tainted our view on LA. An almost aggressive atmosphere with people trying to sell there wares in a pushy manner. On three occasions we felt very unsafe & uncomfortable. We parked a few blocks away and even witnessed a young man with a fire arm. The walk of fame was grubby with many stars being covered by street sellers.In my experience the only attraction worth visiting in LA is Universal Studios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dominicfarr
20,Far from glamorous,It’s not what it’s made out to be. But I guess if you find yourself in the area stop to see it just so you can check it out for yourself. I’ve added things you’ll see along the way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashre28
20,Very different to what you’d expect,"It’s busy, dirty and really not what we imagined it would be. Worth a look but I doubt you’ll stay long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pattriick
40,Interesting but overrated!,"We had gone to a walk of the walk of fame, I was impressed with the celebrities names which were on it however, during the walk, there were certain points where we could smell marijuana very strongly. We didn’t appreciate it, as it was a public walking place, and the smell was disturbing.It’s just a one time walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nkeswani
40,Walk the Walk,"This is exactly what it is, the Hollywood Walk of Fame where is about two and half miles of stars on both sides of the street. My only advice is to get there early because as the day goes by the street gets busier. You will find the usual opportunists who are dressed up as movie characters - be aware if you take a pic of them, they will want payment. Don't miss the only star that is not on the footpath (Muhammad Ali), it is on the wall near the Dolby Theatre (where the Oscars are held). He was quoted that nobody will walk over him, so his star is on the wall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColScott
50,Top ten tourist spot,We had visiting family from Wisconsin. They had to see the stars. Pretty cool if you know where to find the Star you are looking for. Always tons of people here from everywhere. Of course we got sucked into the Ripley’s Believe it or Not. Pretty cool too. I’ve been a dozen or more times and it’s always fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MapGuy414
30,Hollywood vacation,Very cool to see the stars. My son even got into it!Only problem was trying to see some of them when many vendors set up over them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/batangel40
20,A one time thing,Walk of fame . sure why not . see lots of kool stars take couple photos . get out of there . i felt like i was walking down the red district .not a nice experience its probably the worst hollywood has to offer . good thing the old chinese theatre with all the stars signs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danny10002
40,Maybe more fun for adults...,"My boyfriend and I loved this, but his daughter was tired and probably did not recognize the names she was walking over that her dad and I were ooing and aahhing over. The poor child wanted to find Lily Pons' Hollywood star, but she did not realize that she is a dead opera singer, not the young star Lele Pons. Nonetheless, her dad and I had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jelyla
40,Multi city break,The stars range for 15 blocks. This would take a considerable amount of time to go through them all.Tip would be if you want to see anyone in particular is to find out where they located.If you on a bus tour they usually stop at some point along the way of this strip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mel0neyb
30,Good to see,"Arrived in LA and headed up Hollywood Bvd to see the great walk of fame. I was a little disappointed. Not too sure what I expected from the walk of fame - maybe that the stars would be in their own special strip - not just in a regular old pavement - all a bit dirty. Found my some of favourites though. It was incredibly crowded, and very very hot ! Ok. But not my favourite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/560vickyw
30,L.A MUST SEE,"This place is iconic. However, it is very dirty on the streets. People hustling you for celebrity tours. Came by train from downtown. Easy to get there. But, not worth staying. Walk the route, then move onto sunset blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_tone_ay
50,Enjoyed it,I wouldn't go out of my way to go here but if your close I'd recommend seeing the walk of fame it's a cool kinda strip reminds me of vegas a little bit but not as goo. Spent bout an hour and a half here wouldn't need any longer parking was 20 dollars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/598glenr
40,Can’t go to LA and not visit..,"Alot of people have mixed feelings about the Walk of Fame but I enjoy the restaurants/bars, the street artists (find the guy that paints with spray paint on a canvas) and finding our favourite celebrities stars. The afternoon is a better time to go as the crowds are less. There are some great attractions to see like Ripleys Believe it or not and Madame Tussauds which are great for couples and families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DemiB110

30,Disappointing,I was left underwhelmed...mostly because of the condition of the stars which were very dirty and unkempt. Also a less pleasant part of LA. I recommend visiting but not with high expectations!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRV711
50,Fun adventure,Was told to expect it to be dirty. Was pleasantly surprised that it was pretty clean. Enjoyed looking for our favorite stars and shopping in all the places along the way. Well worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/220chuckp
30,Touristy Fun,"Enjoyed overall, but had some minor issues. Didn't care for the group of two forcing their CD onto everyone that past even they were told no.Other then that, only issue I had was trying to look at all the stars/finding the stars I liked. Lots of people in the area and sometimes the street venders will have the stars covered up. Did enjoy myself overall and neat to see the strip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBMatt1147
30,Crowded tourist trap,We decided to check this out when we were in the area. Very tough to find reasonable parking as everyone is trying to make money off the flocks of tourists visiting. Luckily we found free parking on a side street. Walking the walk reminds me of walking the Las Vegas strip. Due to the heat we avoided most of the characters trying to get pictures taken with them but still lots of people hustling for money. Something to see but not something we would ever need to go back to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Canuckonthego11
40,Walk the Fame,"It's everything you can imagine it to be... overcrowded, full of celebrity stars, and dirty. It's great that you can see all the stars of your favorite celebrity, but because it's so busy and dirty I can't say it's a 5-star experience. It is something you do have to experience at least once in your lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ryanpicha
30,Very grubby,"It had been 15 years since visiting this area and I was shocked at how grubby the Main Street was, the shopping centre was nice with its open eating, but expensive for even a bottle of water. We went on a taxi trip to see the Hollywood sign and famous houses not a bad trip but not cheap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spice2uk
30,"Became a tourism trap, disappointed","Low class souvenir shops, fast food places with no characters, ridiculously dressed movie characters whose sole purpose is money-for-photo, overly advertised wax museums (or sorts of)....The whole area feels like a tourist trap without any elegance (the culture and art scene is far better in Time SQ and Broadway in NYC).The only highlight for me is the Dolby Theater....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FengXueSG
20,"Boring, dirty, messy","Had this image in my head that this is sth cool with all your Hollywood stars in it. Well, it turns out to be just many streets (Vine, etc) of dirty pavement with stars on it - some one way, some the other making it complicated to read. Plus most of the names say absolutely nothing. Won't miss a thing if you skipped it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joonas2014
30,Good to bring young adults.,"We brought our 21 yr old star struck grandaughter.She really enjoyed it and us telling her about stars before her time. Grandfather is a Michael Jackson/Elvis fan to pictures with their stars are a must. I don’t think we would have gone on our own, area was so kitschy touristy. Great to bring visitors from the East Coast. Parking on side streets was easy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaynacharter
20,Highly overrated walk,"I stayed near walk of fame, but did not find neighbourhood that much promising. Neither the walk was too exciting as most of places are smoke shops or small restaurants. One cant find his known star on walk easily as its too long. Highly overrated walk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarun2k5
30,Fun novelty thing to do while you're in town,"It was really interesting to walk along the street and see all of the stars. There is also a lot to do off the street, and a lot to see. The downside is that the area really isn't clean, but that was to be expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisiyag2017
30,Take a walk with the stars,"The Walk of Fame is a landmark to go and see. Find the stars you know and love, walk around a bit, but don't worry about spending too much time here. There are so many peddlers and people walking around. I'd recommend the morning, as foot traffic is a little less.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bx2L

20,Visit for the sake of visiting,"The last time I visited the walk of fame, I was a kid. I was 10, and I enjoyed it. Thanks to the glamour of movies and TV shows, and my rose tinted memories of the place - I expected more, and was disappointed.When you think about it, it's just rows and rows of stars on dirty sidewalks. I really didn't enjoy myself. I guess I did enjoy the idea of being in Hollywood and the walk of fame, but it truly wasn't that worth of my time. Most spots smelled like urine and the people around that area will either try to sell you things or ask you for money. I wouldn't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethKayN
10,Nothing like expected,"We didn’t last 5 minutes until we went back to our car and left. I forfeited tickets to the wax museum and starline tours and don’t even care. It’s filthy, stinks and full of homeless and aggressive people. A huge guy stuck a cd in my hand even after saying no thank you. And then took it back when I kept trying to walk away. Then there was the guy on the sidewalk with the huge snack. That about did my 11 yr old in. The stars aren’t even that cool. You couldn’t see then hardly anyways with the people selling water and souvenirs. It was terrible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoxanneS346
10,Tacky Venture,"A wonderful Hollywood Walk of Fame beware the Walk of Fame is the Walk of homeless people scattered all over the sidewalks in the street. Also expect tacky taste list stores for you to spend money on souvenirs millions of people come here every year so this is what you need to expect.I decided to rate this attraction since it stretches for blocks on Hollywood Boulevard. Not impressed with Hollywood Walk of Fame Grauman's Chinese Theater we're past celebrities have their feet in cement.Expect everything to be expensive, over-priced with people dressed in costume in front of the Grauman's Chinese Theater asking for money if you want to take their picture that's just the beginning I rate this one star I wish I could give it minus 10 Stars.If you're visiting in Hollywood I recommend that you visit other wonderful attractions in Hollywood in Los Angeles.1 ☆ Star Rating",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sogonblick
20,Disappointment,"The sidewalks were crowded, and the strip was dirty. No public restrooms. Wouldn't plan a vacation here. If in area you could go to say you saw the stats",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rtjjeda7
20,"Heaven sake, let’s just all be honest......","IT WAS TERRIBLE!!! I’d so much expectations for this city and it was such a let down. Everyone is chasing fame, everyone wants to be something, everyone wants to be noticed. Going out of their way to be loud, and seen. You’ll get people trying to sell you cds, don’t buy them. They’ll get annoyed if you even hesitate.Hollywood is very dirty, lots of homeless which was sad to see. Yet a stone throw away you’ve the riches of the rich! The amount of cracks on the pavements was unreal, the stars embedded in to the ground I new about 12 stars in total I reckon 😂 Most of them where filthy and the names you did know, people where spread all over the star trying to get a picturesque photo with the dirty platform star. Most stalls where taken up most names as well. It was disappointing. Yes it’s “great” to say you seen it. But it’s not all that. Lots of competitive shops, restaurants, fast food places all around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ceallachain
20,Busy place...,"This street is overrated.. been there, will never be back. Ok the stars of all these famous people were there and it's possible to walk a little down memory lane when you see these names, but it would be much better if it was possible to do this without criss crossing between irritating vendors and street people trying to sell you (stolen) CD's . There were overcrowded with people offering peep rides to Hollywood, and every two guys I met had to hand me a broscure.. time to get yourselfs an app and save some vocal cords? The scenes reminded me of the extreme active vendors you can meet in Arabic countries in the basaars. The peak of the madness was when we reached to this Chinese temple like thing, and a bunch of strong believers with personalized batterypowered amplifiers were yelling out their faith and the need for the rest of the world to repent. It was quite obvious that they thought absolutely nobody else had heard about our Saviour JC. Not going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/386gustavl

30,Don’t expect much,You have to go if just to take it off the list. The day we went is was so crowded that the walk of fame gets lost in all the stuff going on.Every 5 feet someone is handing you a CD or tour guys trying to get you on their bus.However if you like to people watch this is a pretty good spot to do that.If you do go I wouldn’t waste a lot of time there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMc33
50,A must see,"My family and u really enjoyed the Hollywood stars walk of Fame. By the time we made it was pretty late and chilly, so we had to buy sweaters at some of the vendors. Luckily they had plenty. There was tons of ""free"" entertainment and food options along the walk. We even did some late night shopping due to there being many stores opened late. The night life seems like it was plentiful, too bad I was with the family. LOL",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katinarabb

20,Hollywood Glam - Not!,"Maybe we were naive but we had this romantic notion of Hollywood Boulevard and the Walk of Fame being a glamorous place full of flash cars and beautiful people. Well that's not what it's like here!As you walk along trying to spot the names of stars you're interested in, you can't help but notice the filth. You're constantly (and I mean constantly) pestered by people trying to sell tours, people trying to sell music and people dressed up as various characters.When they're not bothering you, you find yourself looking out for homeless people/drunks/mentally unstable people laying across, or staggering down, the sidewalk.Unfortunately, for us, this really wasn't a pleasant experience - not what we'd expected at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorMart
40,Down the Walk of Fame ?,"The Walk of Fame nice to see your favorite star their name whether it be an actor a singer or comedian Or what have you. Free to take your picture next to your favorite star. So why is it so dirty why hasn’t the Mayor of LA clean up this area. And keep it cleaned, This is a tourist landmark many people come from all over. The Walk of Fame. Leaves a bit of a bad impression of LA (Hollywood) somewhat. You have weird looking people sometimes with mental conditions walking around begging for money,food or marijuana homeless people laying in the sidewalk.I f the mayor could clean up this area a bit would be a better picture. You would remember more, The Walk of Fame than homeless people laying in the sidewalk. And how dirty it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pwrquestusa
10,Worse than expected,"Went there early in the day. Not because we wanted to, just had some free time. What a flea-pit, the whole place smells of piss. The stars and sidewalk are filthy. Annoying people trying to sell you something every 10 steps.Many other places in the world would value this as an asset and an attraction. It feels like the local authorities have given up on this place.I didn't feel unsafe but I am a 6'2 guy. I saw no security or police at all so I could only imagine how uncomfortable some people would feel.Avoid it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L1207LKstevec

50,It does go a long way,Yes whilst this is a MUST for many visitors the distance one would have to walk in order to see all the stars is quite considerable on both sides of the road so most people only get to see part of them. There are other sights nearby including sight of the HOLLYWOOD signage on the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/confused999

Hollywood walk of fame was an amazing Experience the first time I came here, so busy full of life Street performers everywhere you turn, tour guides and buses. The Thrill of just walking in the steps of the Stars seeing there names is a buzz make you feel part of there Journey.

I loved walking the many streets snapping photos of the stars on the sidewalks. I only wished we had researched more as to the how the stars are designated and where they are placed. We ended up googling while we We there. It was a bucket list item for me so I’m glad we went. We parked at the garage on the corner of Highland and Hollywood and had our ticket validated, only paid $4 and we were there almost 3 hours.

10,Very dirty,"Masses of people, whole road dirty of rubbish, smelling like a toilet - can't believe that this was the street Hollywood advertises to everyone to visit, to see the stars on the sidewalk - doesn't seem that Hollywood is proud of this street at all. A quick trip out for max half a day and get out of the area before nightfall if you value your safety.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liezelp1997
30,Meh,"It’s a must see in LA, but a bit disappointing. The walk of fame is super large, but the most famous stars are located in front of the Dolby Theater.There are too many character impresionators (superman, hulk, etc) and they can be really annoying.Caution when parking! Try to find a 10$ parking. Most of them charges 20$ but it’s a scam because you would not spend more than an hour there, 2h at the most. The parkimeter is the best option!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oliveira_de_figueira
50,Fantastic,The best time to see the Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is early in the morning when there is not too many people around as it get pretty crowded and the day goes on.

20,A tiny item on a buck list,"As another reviewer summarized; At least you can say you've seen it. Having lived in LA for over 40 years I've never understood the attraction of the Walk of Fame. Dirty sidewalks with names of ""star"" you've barely heard of. Wow! Factor in the hoards of tourists, the AWFUL , ANNOYING AND AGGRESSIVE ""super hero's"" trolling for money and you've got a recipe for one on the most over-rated tourists spots I've ever been a part of. Out of towners sure do want to see it though and most are almost always in some way disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StudioCityMark
30,At Least You Can Say You’ve Seen It,"You’ve come to L.A. and have your list of things to see and do. The Walk of Fame will most likely be on it.This is essentially a decorated footpath with a lot of pedestrian (tourist) traffic and lots of stars / names to be seen.Be prepared to find it needs a good clean up with a pressure washer and some repairs. You’ll also see a lot of names you probably don’t know but then all of a sudden you come across one of you favourites.If you plan to do the full walk be aware it’s quite a walk, then you cross over Hollywood Blvd and continue your walk all the way back - yes it’s both sides.Plenty of glitzy touristy shops and landmark buildings along the way make for some welcome distractions plus many dodgy looking ones too.For most it probably wont be the highlight of your trip but at least you can say you’ve seen it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnbG164FE
20,Dirty and run down,"I have to say I was disappointed. I expected the area to be kept up a bit better. The sidewalks and streets were dirty, the buildings run down and it stank.I guess I should have expected this but it still took me my surprise.I expected a bit more glamour and less street performers and hustlers.The one place that I thought was worth seeing was the Chinese Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RalphR28411
30,Average,The Walk of Fame was a bit of a disappointment if I’m honest. We had limited time in LA & unfortunately the only time we could see it was in the evening. We felt unsafe & didn’t venture too far. It would have probably been more enjoyable during the day with a tour but time wasn’t on our side!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMYTHTRIBE
10,What? Why would you go there?,"So, we went to this and it was a dirty and nasty area of town. We walked around and kind of grossed out about it all actually. Not really anything to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaneA424
20,Free but waste of time.,Only positive is that this is free to do. This part of town is dirty and crawling with people dressed up like “celebrities” or “superheroes” so you can pay them to take pictures with you. The walk itself it pretty boring. The starts you see on the ground go on for miles. The most popular are in front of Chinese Theatre. That is also the most crowded area. Don’t spend more than 30-45 mins of your day if you must see this. The sidewalks are dirty and the area around the “stars” on the ground is not kept up. We only had 2 days in LA. I wish we wouldn’t have bothered. I honestly could have just drove by it and looked out the window and been ok. The shops around the walk of fame are cheap tourist gift shops that just sell crap. They are hoping you walk your young kids down to buy crap they will never use again. Go do something actually fun if you are just adults or have kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krchampion

30,Fun but gritty,"We live near a major city so we aren’t usually surprised at places like this. We’d never been but read reviews ahead of time to get a feel of what we were in for.Pros- it’s the walk of fame, people. You gotta go if you’ve never been.Cons- it’s dirty, smelly in spots, and kind of gritty.Tips- don’t take cds from anyone, don’t pose for pictures with any type of superhero or character. Don’t take selfies with you tube celebrities or musicians. Why? You’ll be charged money for it. I’m all for helping struggling artists ( I am one ) but these people are con artists. So make your way and ignore them and they will leave you alone. They don’t hassle you, so don’t be afraid to venture around to see the walk of fame stars.The walk of fame stars go on for blocks and blocks so if there is someone you want to see, do research ahead of time.Go early in the morning (like around 9) to see the Chinese Theater up close. It gets really crowded by 10 and you will have to wait in lines to see the hand and footprints.It’s a cool experience overall, so have fun and go with the flow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KariWH

40,Cheesy fun,"This is a must do for your first time in Hollywood. It’s cheesy but a lot of fun. Trying to find your favourites and looking around the Chinese and Dolby theatre is also cool. The hand prints outside the theatres are pretty awesome, especially Mel Brooks. Look out for the extra finger! Lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suseowen
20,The Perfect Tour?,"Was so excited to go on this tour especially after reading recent reviews just a couple days before we were taking the trip, but we were very disappointed by the whole experience! First, the tour started late, the bus wasn’t there on time; then the bus was not as described in the description on the website or in the reviews, there were obstructions by window posts even though there was no window glass, and people who were stuck sitting in middle seats were unleashed to see or take pictures. Next we were taken straight to the designated spot to take pictures of the Hollywood sign, our time was cut short because we were already behind; also you are so far away from the sign it’s just a white blur in your pictures! The view of the city from this spot is beautiful but there was not time to enjoy it with such an extremely short amount of time and having to stand in line to take a picture with the sign, there were 3 other tour buses at this spot at the same time. After piling back in the bus, we made our way up Mullholland Dr, our driver pointed out some famous peoples houses, slowed down at a couple of them, even stopped momentarily at a few but was in such a rush by the time you had your picture set up to take over peoples heads next to you and around the window posts he would speed off. We made our way to Beverly Hills and Rodeo Dr which was probably the best part of the tour, and then made the drive back to the starting point. The tour description said you could choose to stay and explore the walk of fame, that wasn’t even an option, so we had to walk back over to Hollywood Blvd from the tour office, which we were being rushed off the bus so they could get the next tour on. I’m glad this wasn’t one of the more expensive tours, but it just goes to show you get what you pay for!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FLTinaS30
40,Fun place and must have,"It’s absolutely a must have! To be fair, it’s not really that what we expected to see but worth. It’s just a shopping street where you find the stars on the pavement wherever you walk. It’s also quite expensive but the feeling you get is fantastic. Walking down the Walk of Fame! Amazing! The street life actually hit us. You boys were playing music, convinced us to sing and to dance with them, fantastic! They made our day! We also did not expect sooo much fun on this busy strip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sroehrdanz
30,Must see - not what I expected,"This was high on my must see list for our Los Angeles visit. We ended up walking the entire walk of fame. Come wearing comfortable shoes and have some water.This is not the gleaming polished walk you see on TV at new star reveals. This is a high traffic sidewalk and looks like it, at least did by midday when we visited. You also have to contend with a thousand others jostling to see their favorite stars star. And 90% of them are oblivious to you and the fact you are trying to snap a picture of Snoopy’s star.There are maps ($10) to show you where the various stars are located for those on a schedule. There are public parking lots nearby .Be prepared to be approached by hawkers trying to get you on a tour of the stars (every 100 feet). There is also some very interesting people and shops lining the walk of fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/469MarkQ
30,Just ok.,"My daughter thought it would be fun to see the Walk of Fame. It's basically streets lined w/ souvenir shops, bar restaurants, street performers, vendor tables a few homeless people. Watch your valuables here! I saw a few people eyeball tourist backpacks. I would visit definitely morning to mid afternoon esp with kids/ teens as early evening it starts to get more crowded & a little rowdy.We left at 6 PM as street performers & followers we're covering the Walk of Fame stars and you couldn't read the names nor would dare ask somebody to move . The tables and booths were set up along the streets which made it incapable of reading the stars.I'm not sure how it gets later on in the night, can only imagine. If you grew up in a big city this probably would be OK for you but if you were from a smaller town, it would probably be a little uncomfortable. The Dolby Theater & its shopping area is nice to see. I was expecting the sidewalks to be pristine but in my opinion, a little shabby. We took a taxi back to our hotel as I didn't feel comfortable walking with my teens alone just before dusk back to hotel. While in traffic in the taxi, we saw a police officer holler at somebody to stop and they kept running as 4 police officers were chasing him and two police cars in persuit -think we left a good time:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/983julien
40,"Its Hollywood Icon, come and snap a photo already","Come early in the morning before the crowds make it impossible to see all the stars on the sidewalk and by early I mean 7am.

Because a trip to Hollywood just isn't complete without seeing the Walk of fame, ya know?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
30,"Cool, but lost a little lustre!","I could have given it 4 stars but there are a few factors why it probably shouldn't get more and that being the history. There are some individuals that have been handed stars that certainly don't warrant their place considering some of the calibre of people over the last 50 years to have graced our lives. Be it musicians,actors etc. I found parking really easily which was great. While there were quite a few people around which is to be expected it was still very easy to get around and take some cool shots. There are some nice chilled restaurants and bars to hang out in if you are so inclined. Many parents with kids so it did feel quite family orientated which even though I was on my own gave it a nice diverse touch. The performers etc didn't seem to be overly forceful and if you aren't interested in their gimmicks. Other than that still fun to take a walk. It was a lot longer than I could ever have imagined. It goes on for quite a few blocks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grants976

I like people watching so I could have stayed there for hours watching the freaks. Maybe not for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharkdiverusa

30,Sightseeing,"Went down to Hollywood blvd to see Walk of Fame. Felt a little disappointed, way too crowded and way to busy. It's one of those thing's to do just to say you did it. The traffic to get there was terrible, spent more time in traffic than actually seeing. Parking in the garage was best thing to do, also if you want to pay for parking with cash you have to go to I think 2nd floor in parking garage, if paying with credit you can pay on the level you parked on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunburn2016
30,Pick Your Timing Carefully,"It is hard to see the stars on the Walk of Fame depending on your timing. Unfortunately, my timing was about the worst possible -- a very busy Saturday afternoon with 3,000 people attending an event in the Dolby Theatre AND a Los Angeles Cultural Carnival going on that terminated at Hollywood and Highland. Hollywood Blvd was closed to Highland and the streets and sidewalks were packed with tourists and carnival goers. On top of that, street vendors were set up on the sidewalk. Nonetheless, it was cool to see the stars, but it would have been near impossible to get a good photo of one on this particular day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CacheOn

I was hoping to see Donald Trump's star and it was one of the first one we walked up on. The entire thing was fun, even though a bit campy and some could consider even cheesy, it's a fans' shrine.I enjoyed seeing all of them. And the people experience was fascinating as well. People from all over the world coming to see our entertainment industry's shrine. There were some homeless and really dirty people but we never felt unsafe or even uneasy.

20,Meh...,"Unless you are looking to take a picture with your favorite star's star, then don't even bother walking the walk of fame. Hollywood is one of the most underwhelming parts of Los Angeles. The movies, television shows, and online montages you see are enough of a lie because nothing is nearly as close as it seems. Los Angeles county is over 100 miles in circumference, and the walk of fame is no different. From Gower St. to La Brea, there are a ton of stars on the walk, and most of them are dirty, cracked and/or covered in mystery sludge. Although the city tries, they just can't seem to keep the streets clean enough for all to enjoy this attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nlucin

A good way to find out the location of your favorite stars is to go to Wikipedia and look up "" List of Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame"".

40,Enjoyable...Don't fall for the trader tricks...,"The Walk of Fame was great fun, we got dropped off right outside the Chinese Theatre which was the perfect spot. The stars run on either side of the road, but if you have specific people you want to find then download the app.It does get busy around midday, we went at around 9am and had plenty of space to take lots of photos.Hint...don't take photos with the characters walking around unless you want to tip them, there are a lot of them around.Hint...you will get a lot of people asking you to do tours, most of them are connected just keep and eye on their leaflets and play them off against each other for the best price. The most common price was £50 per adult but we paid £25 for 2 of us for a tour of the Hollywood Hills for 2 hours. We did get scammed a little as they promised a drive along Rodeo Drive but they then refused as they didn't have a permit.Just check with the company and make them confirm as we did see your buses on Rodeo Drive when we later visited.Hint...some of the tour sellers have cheap tickets to Madam Tussauds so you can blag some tickets from them or at least a discount.Visit the front of the Chinese Theatre as the floor is covered in signatures and hand prints for some famous movies.Overall a great day, can easily get the stars done in an hour or two, you then have a nice shopping mall to browse and Madam Tussauds are all right there to do it one day.Hope you this helps and you enjoy your trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeshikaR2
50,The Hollywood Sign,You walk amongst the stars when doing the Hollywood Walk of fame. When you reach the Chinese Theatre you are able to see the Hollywood Sign in the hills behind. Lots of places to visit and see and food to eat also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackieheighway
30,Disgusting,"Hollywood Walk of fame is disgusting. We loved visiting and looking at the stars but its so unkept, dirty and to be jonest a bit disrespectful to people being honoured with a star. It certainly needs money spent in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDME15
10,Disappointed to the max,"People talk of this hall of fame as if its absolutely amazing, well its not! Its long and really there are no easy ways to do it. The most off putting thing is that it is so dirty! Do a guided tour, its not fun on your own!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregTitaliano
50,Loved it but be careful,"At any given time the Walk of Fame is loaded with people. There are those who will try to distract you but don't be fooled ... be on the look out at all times. Other than that ... ENJOY. It's a must see for any fan of the movies, tv and music. It lots of fun to pose with the stars along the walk of fame and the street vendors who do the face sculpting are FANTASTIC!!! I wish I had taken the time to have it done. There are tons of things to do along the Walk of Fame",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mburbank2016
40,A must see for music/movie fans,"Paid parking was nearby...wish it were free but quickly learned in LA area-not much is free.Was neat to see all the names. I found names of stars I had forgotten. Was alot of fun.Yes, there is a crowd. Yes, there are vendors around. This is a high traffic area. But luckily there are websites to give you the exact location of any star you want to find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoneReally
50,Miles of Stars!,It is nice to stroll and see whose star you will find while sightseeing and walking around Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/742jaclynd
30,Nostalgic Fun...For a Few Moments.,"Love My Hollywood!!! Cemented Footprints. Signatures and handprints of our beloved then and now. Then, get out of there!!! Unfortunately, there are too many suspicious looking individuals standing way too close for comfort. Crowds from everywhere, as expected, do not really allow you the freedom to browse UNLESS you arrive quite early. Walk the walk, once. Cross off the experience from your life's travelled list. Then get the hullabaloo out of there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattiwalls
30,Not like it use to be,This is about my 10th time going to Hollywood Walk of Fame and I was disappointed.To many sidewalk vendors covering up the stars with there booths and acts.Add to that the mass of people even late at night and you can’t see what the whole purpose of the walk is for.To little restrooms and little parking make this a possible disappointment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckOregon
40,"Fun time, lots to do!","We has a very fun time walking around Hollywood walk of Fame. I was worried about vendors and general safety after reading some reviews, but we honestly felt safe and did not experience pushy vendors or pushy homeless. We definitely talked to our children about not talking to people who approach them, but no one did. The kids loved taking pictures by the stars and we had a great time at the wax museum, Ripley's. The 5.00 store was awesome! It is worth taking a stroll down the Hollywood walk! There are a lot of tourists, people taking pictures, so you'll blend right in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianedN2525IL
40,A must see in Hollywood!,"A must see in Hollywood! Great place to find the star of your favorite celebrity and take picture with it. Will certainly earn you a lot of ""likes"" on facebook, instagram and twitter",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarwarmazid
30,Interesting,"Definetly want to go early if you dont want to fight crowds of people. Some sections are so crowded that its just frustrating. I understand everyone is wanting to take their picture with a particular star but there isnt much room to walk with street vendors and random people trying to solicit photos and give you a copy of their CD. We ended up having to cross the street, just to get from Point A to B without walking through all that mess again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justin2406
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"Hollywood Walk of Fame is about 15 blocks of walking I would recommend comfortable shoes, if you are looking for a cretin star I would recommend get a map, or the app for your phone. Big tourist trap with lots of people trying to sell you something.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjones4421
40,Lively Street- Hollywood Walk of Fame,"It was the first point of our day tour at Los Angeles. We have been to different places, It was fun walking on the star street. We came to know the criteria of having name and star on the walk of fame street. It was simply fun being there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neelu257
20,Watch out: “The Flash” hustler!,"First of all, I liked the stars!For the handful of decent shops located on the boulevard, there are more adult shops. The people dressed in costumes as famous characters, where mostly ok to deal with but specifically the person dressed as **“the flash” and Darth Vader** duo made a big deal about taking a video of them and tried to charge us for it??? And began to insult us. Most of them work for tips, which I completely understand. These two showed us how much they made on an app, suggesting tip amounts. Who does that?! That made me not want to take a photo with any other character. Rude.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabstravelblog
10,Don’t bother,"The walk of fame I feel has no organization at all. They are spread out over miles and many of the older ones are in disarray with chips and lots of dirt. The upkeep is non existent unless you do yourself. My friend is a huge Barbra fan and when she comes to LA, she cleans her Star! And it seems lately anyone can get one. There used to be some kind of agenda but now it’s like do two to four movies and you now get a star!Very touristy so if you like that kind of stuff then you will probably like but we walked on other side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judyl240
30,"Been there, done that.","Fun for approximately one hour, but of course on the to do list. To much people and all of them stops to take photos of the ground!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492vegards
40,A MUST activity when you visit Hollywood Los Angeles USA,"Walking along this walk of frame looking for the name of your idoles is a quite exciting experience! Take your picture with them and bring them home will last the memory for a life time. In our case, we have also the ocasion to take pictures with Brad Pitt (my wife's idole) and my self with Marilyn Monroe (I think that they came from Mme Tussaud Wax Museum), it was very funny! Also don't forget to take pictures of the Fames in nearby Chinese Theater. Very cool.We did enjoy very much this experience.Duy N.Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DNCanadaVN
30,For tourists,"Cheesy, but one has to be there and see it for at least once. Hop into the Roosevelt Hotel to have a drink around the pool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Le0nis
50,Vacation in Los Angeles,"My 2 teenagers and I walked on Hollywood Blvd on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I stopped to take a picture with the star of one of my all time favorite musicians, Bob Marley. Also on Hollywood Blvd, we found a souvenir store and purchased 4 t-shirts for $10.99. The t-shirts were of good quality. I love it when I find a bargain!😊",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelynu2015
40,Bigger than I thought,"The Walk of Fame covers several blocks. It's fun to spot the different names and work out from the gold symbol why they are honoured. Take care not to bump into other people when you have your head down! And when it rains, the surface is very slippery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeredithAussie
50,Great place,You can walk among stars engraved on the floor of your favourite Hollywood celebrities. It’s a busy place so earlier you go better chance to take pictures and explore the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faiz-ras00l
50,Fame on the Walk of Fame!,We took my mother in law and had a wonderful time looking at all the signatures and hand prints. WE would love to back soon!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drcharlesanthony
30,Not what we thought,"So we had to visit here as part of our holiday but it really was not what we expected . Streets filthy and homeless people everywhere. Characters persuading tourists to have photos took with them and then demanding a fee. The “stars” are nice to see , if you can decipher what the name is under the spilt drinks and food .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoew992
50,GREAT PLACE TO VISIT AND REMEMBER SO MANY MOVIE STARS,Took this in before we took a tour. Brought back memories as you see names of stars you may have forgotten about. A great experience just to make the walk. It is a rather long walk too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/revrick33
20,Terrible,"Too many vendors trying to hustle, some of them extremely rude. Very dirty street, expensive parking price. Didn’t have any fun at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheesc2016
20,A long walk of nothing,I recently went to the Hollywood Walk of Fame while in Los Angeles.It is very dirty and in a seedy area. There is nothing special about the stars they are all alike. No rhyme to reason as to what order are they installed. You have tour people constantly coming up to you trying to get you to sign up for a tour. I found myself walking faster and more or less watching around me more than the stars. If you have seen the Chinese theater at Disney it looks the same.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duaneh304
40,Interesting but less than expected,The road is nice and very interesting to see the names of stars on the street never meet them in person. A lot of names. At nigh us more interesting a lot of people around tou can see crazy America,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hossamm894
40,A must see!,This is a great place to connect with your favourite stars and remember their contribution to the art form. It's a long walk on side walks on both sides of the road. There are stores on the sidewalk if you want to do some shopping after viewing the stars. Be careful with your wallets and personal belongings as it can get crowded. Look out for people trying to sell you tour tickets they can get a bit annoying. I will recommend visiting this attraction if in LA California. Check out my pics :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChicaEmery
10,Disappointed,Too dirty. Too stinky. Too many hustlers. Too crowded. No cops in sight. No visitor ambassadors in sight. We shuffled with the crowd for a few blocks and left. There's more interesting and pleasant places to visit than this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MollyMariero
40,Hot spot,"Man! It was so crowded when we went but still fun to look for my favorite stars! Really touristy section of town, but that’s to be expected!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lunchlandqueen
30,"Alright, but pretty boring","There were tons of people I didn't really care about or know who they were, and there isn't much else to do around here. I wouldn't go out of your way to come here unless you really wanted to find a certain star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeremylesley
30,Hollywood walk of fame,"It was cool to see the stars names on the sidewalk;some of whom I had forgotten about. However, someone needs to clean the sidewalks with a powerwasher! Ugh! Filthy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sugamama6
30,Overrated!,"We thought it would be more hype than it was. Some were very dirty and not well kept. It was ok, but not a must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/863shannonr
30,"An average tourist attraction, better to take a bus tour.","Whilst this is a good thing to have done, spending a bit of money on a bus tour will give you a lot more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomNIwona
30,Not as classy as expected,"I had looked very forward to going here to see Hollywood and the Walk of Fame and expected it to be classy and well taken care of... it isn't. The stars are all very dirty, there are people everywhere which makes it hard to take pictures with or of the stars, and the area can be very sketchy and unsafe once evening hits. Street performers are EVERYWHERE which makes it impossible to see many stars because they have stuff all over them. Also there are people trying to advertise their music and other things down the street who are shoving things in your face trying to get you to purchase it and if you do not want their product, many of them get very angry.It is nice to be able to go and say you have seen it, but I wouldn't tell anyone to expect much. The pictures from the star ceremonies they have are nothing like how it actually looks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paigemcfarland21
40,Very crowded,This is a fun thing to do. Try and find your favourite celebrity. The area outside the Chinese Theatre is very crowded. Lots of souvenir stalls all around,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255060Charlie10
50,Full of life,Full of life. Things I saw 30 years ago still here but then a lot more as well: buskers were around. Very entertaining. And of course had to see the stars lining the broadwalk. Also place to eat etc,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/youke_worldwide
30,"Walk on a bustling, crowded street remembering the Stars","We visited the famous Hollywood walk fame ( basically name of many Hollywood stars engraved on a bronze star on the footpath) .. clever marketing I would say, you have lots of shopping avenues, souvenir shops, Madame taussads wax museum.The street is quite crowded with locals and tourists alike.. artist dressed as the famous super heroes and if you or your kids like to click. Pic, just shell out 5 dollars..I was with my 4 year old and she slept throughout..still jet lagged from our long flight to US..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DevShetty
40,The classic thing to see,"Of course you have to see this. Don’t expect to park quick and jump out and find a certain star- stars are not arranged alphabetically or chronological. If you are after a name, do some research.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattiBethA
30,Better on TV,Hollywood is not the center of the entertainment world in LA though clever marketing would have you think it is. Thus Hollywood boulevard varies from old commercial to somewhat sketchy areas. The sidewalk on both sides near the Chinese theater is filled with stars ... the businesses behind these stars are not the high end shops you would expect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brenda-blmhouston
40,Good experience,Early this week when we were at Los Angeles after putting our luggage in room we took an uber cab and landed at this famous place. We spend good time to walk down the street and enjoyed the window shopping and other activities,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Satish1949
40,Worth it for the chinese theatre and celebrity tour,"The chinese theatre with the palm / footprints was for me what made the area memorable. I also took the ""celebrity homes"" tour with skyline which was quite interesting and includes a free ticket to madame tussauds, also worth visiting.i would however have a chosen a vehicle which was covered as i got badly sunburned and 30 minutes left of the tour i wasn't even listening to the driver anymore.Just wanted to get out of the heat.Apart from that, there's nothing really special about the road itself and like others, i too was misled by the cd hustlers.I thought they were really promoting their cd at first.They asked me where i'm from which is a small island few people are aware of in America. Their reaction of ""WOW"" is when it clicked.Really really pushy and talking to one of them brings a swarm upon you forcing the cd in your hand and wanting me to 'break a 100'. I gave 5 dollars and told them i don't like the way you operate.Do not engage with them at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reprovoa
50,Great Experience,"Enjoyed our walk on the Hollywood Walk of Fame!There are so many options on what to do from dining, shopping, and locating the celebrities stars. Ww even went back about 10pm, and to see the area light up with lights, and entertainment! Safe. Fun and Friendly!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/227kishan
30,Grubby,Well we saw it . Not as exciting as we thought. Grubby and some dodgy shops and characters to match.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glpl
30,Disappointing,Hollywood walk of fame needs to be better maintained. The side walks were nasty. One would think such a high profile tourist area attractions would be better care than it is; very disappointing.Thank you Rosa Brown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DayTrip780605
30,Plenty of Stars.,There are a lot of stars to look at and some I have never heard of?It’s a good walk on both sides of the street.The only downside is that some are dirty as they are on the foot path.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shayne3067
50,Amazing feeling,"A place to remember all your dreams, wishes and memories.Every time that I go to Hollywood, I would read the names and think how short the life is. In summer they have live music and some fun activities at the Hollywood and highland mall. Lots of nice small and big hotels, restaurants, bars, clubs and fast food are around .it is easier to take uber or metro to go to the nightclubs . No free parking at all and be aware about parking tickets or cars getting towed alot.it is a great place for long walks on the flames and read the names. Only Mohammed Ali's flame is not on the floor . You will find it on the wall .In front of the cpk, you will be able to see Hollywood sign and take pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryamr127
50,Its Hollywood Hurry for Hollywood,"Hollywood its great for tourists to see the Hollywood Its walk Of Fame. Its full of diverse people. It could be over packed and a bit dirty its for sure not glamorous. Great fun spots to hit on Hollywood. You have the Pantages Theatre a must to take in some theatre at 6233 Hollywood Blvd. and Vine. Full of action day or night. You have the Kodak Theatre , Grauman's Chinese Theatre , Ripley's Believe It Or Not and sexy Lingerie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorona653
10,Overrated,Unfortunately not a place I would recommend to visit. Many pushy people on the street and generally unappealing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahky12
50,Holiday,Wow amazing seem all the footprints and handprints was very busy and some people rude knocked passed me with my walking stick the atmosphere was amazing done a lot off shopping food was to much but fresh def go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joansheen
40,LA,Loved seeing all of the stars on the walk of fame. Have it four stars based on being approached by street vendors every five seconds or strongly costumed individuals,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kendrap972
50,Must do!,Too much to see which is great! Clean streets and heaps of street entertainment (careful though and stand back a little or they will try screw a dollar off you haha. Mind you everyones after a dollar in USA). There are guys that sell water for a dollar and play music...omg I'm sure that song will be forever in my brain. Felt sorry for this beautiful snake a guy had wrapped around himself (offering to tourists to put around themselves for money...despise that sort of thing). Otherwise did tour around strip/LA as well. Well worth it. Went during the day and night to see the lights/excitement and a MUST DO. Make sure you take plenty of $1 notes as you will need them for tipping. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/200julesw
30,Only need to go one time,"The Walk of Fame is just one of those bucket list things you need to do and check off your list. Our family enjoyed it, but between the strong smell of pot and the lack of cleanliness, I was a little disappointed. This could really be a great area if they would try to clean it up, similar to what New York did for Times Square. Overall, I'm glad I did it, but I can now check it off my list and don't have to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffK_12
40,Fun walking and looking at the stars,"No trip to Hollywood wouldn't be complete without seeing some of the stars. Be sure tp look ahead on Google to see where your favorite star is located! Also, be sure to go in front of Grauman's to see their hand and footprints! I forgot to do that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancyhN4304BC
10,Shady,Haven’t been here for a long time and now i remember why. It’s shady! A lot of tourists with a lot of people trying to hustle. It’s a shame that people are excited to come to this area and probably are let down. I did like seeing the Jimmy Kimmel lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ascenethp
20,Disappointment,"While it was exciting to see the iconic TCL Theater and the Walk of Fame, my experienced was tarnished by the filth in Hollywood. The sidewalks and streets smelled strongly of urine and appeared as if they are seldom cleaned by the City of Los Angeles. I’d say it is unlikely I would return to Hollywood in the near future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryoliviaj
40,Walking with the stars along Hollywood Blvd.,"It may seem silly to a lot of people but I was born and raised close to Hollywood, CA. My grandfather was a leader starting with silent studios and moving on to MGM. I grew up hearing his stories about the great stars of the silver screen. As a young adult I often went to movies at Hollywood theaters. Now we go to the Pantages Theater for live theater and do the Walk of Fame. It always gives me a thrill to walk and see the names of the greats. Some I have almost forgotten but most of the names make me remember movies or even scenes that are firmly in my memory banks as thrilling moments.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendy4413
20,Walk of Shame,"Nothing wrong with the idea - just the execution. And there probably have been some. Executions, that is. The whole area is dirty, run down and full of homeless, crazed and druggie people. Not an area to walk alone - especially at night. Shame the local authorities can't get to grips with the squalor of one of the world's most famous areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryanedwin
50,Must see once in your lifetime,The walk goes on for what seems like miles. Fun to see all the names. There are a lot of vendors along the street. It’s very loud and kind of dirty. Not what you expect when you think of Hollywood! Neat to see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OhioLove2travel007
20,Not what I expected!,You see the walk of fame on TV and it looks great.The walk of fame is a glorified sidewalk that stretches throughout Hollywood Blvd. Some parts are clean others are just gross. There are so many people walking around Hollywood it’s hard to find stars you maybe looking for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenhD4733WL
20,DISAPPOINTING,"Stars on the gangway with the name of a star in it, if it is a camera it's an actor, with an lp it is a singer. You see a lot of well known names, but also a lot of unknown. There are lots of people walking over this stars and a lot of them are dammaged. Also the numbers of stars on the street is so high, more than 2700, that it becomes boring after a while.We are glad that we saw it, but surely will not return for this walk of fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/370michelv
10,Disappointing,"Nothing as we were expecting. I always imagined Hollywood very different, nice and glamorous. To our surprise it was filthy and smelled like pee, also a lot of homeless and could smell weed everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ydegaston
30,Walk...,"They were setting up for the Incredibles, great to see. Walk along the blvd. to see the stars and theaters. Tourists in all directions, many things to see. Grab a tour out, you’ll be fine through LA Tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasTravelertx
30,Nothing spectacular!,I was truly disappointed! I thought it was going to be bigger and more glamorous than the stars were and the neighbourhood looked a little iffy! It was fun though to find my favourite actors and actresses!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Petuniatokkie
10,"Seedy, overcrowded, and run down","As with many of the areas in LA, we found the Hollywood walk of fame to be a disappointment. The walk is filled with people trying to sell you unappealing tours of Hollywood. The stars have not been maintained, and the area doesn't feel particularly safe or inviting. Don't recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lalls92
50,Must See,Even after five visits it's always interesting who's star you find on the pavements of Hollywood. But the area is always crowded and populated by the worst kind of hucksters beggars and people on the make.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avatar888
30,Something you just have to do..,"The walk of fame is certainly not the glitz and glamour you think it will be, in fact quite underwhelming.. just look down where you walk and there are what feels like a million and one names many that are unrecognisable.. it is fun if you find someone you really like but its really not amazing... just something you have to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellerm68
30,Nicer on tv than in reality,"Its not bad because it is recognizable and there are a lot of famous people's names to be seen but it is also not the highlight of the year. Crowded, people trying to sell you stuff all the time and in the end it's just a star with a name on it...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/svisker
40,Fun thing to do in LA,Walking down the Walk of Fame is one of those things you need to do while you’re visiting LA. It’s not as glorious as it seems when the stars are being dedicated but it’s interesting to see all the names from various industries. There are tons of souvenir shops along the way with any kind of LA gift you could imagine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthernBelles98
40,Fun to look down!,Like a walk through time as you see names of stars from present and past at your feet. Lots of things going on around you so take your time and enjoy the whole experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JALToronto
30,Underwhelming experience,Although it was exciting to see the stars for my favourite celebrities- the chaos around the area just made the experience so underwhelming. Worth a one time visit when in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ziaahmed21
30,So many Hobos,"Lots of homeless everywhere, further out towards Whitley st at the start of the walk of fame, the streets smell of urine, gross. Not sure if human or dog feces everywhere. Gross for Hollywood. Dolby theatre area was much better & presentable. ""The incredible"" event was going on with the whole red carpet thing on Tuesday. That was interesting to watch. So much tourist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarayang27
30,"Famous, fame, walking","It's interesting reading those things on the ground, walking, exploring. It was very nice, not like, a life time experience, but worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnaArifan03
40,Worth a visit,"I’ve been here a few times now, walking all the way to see the stars on footpath and just get the vibe, It can be quite busy but you can’t really go to LA and not visit here. Lots of eateries, my favourite is The Hard Rock café right there in the thick of things. Also there are lots of sometimes dirty film hero’s trying to get your attention to take photos, and others trying to sell you CDs. Be aware that if you pose for a photo you’ll be expected to pay. The people selling CDs will approach you friendly and will push a CD towards you, if you accept it you are expected to pay for it, they won’t leave until you do, so I always advise to not make direct eye contact if you are really interested. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goretti_13
20,The place is a little dodgy,"The walk of fame is not half as glamourous as the one we saw on TV.There are people dressing up as the DC/ Marvels superheroes or cartoon characters throughout the street. Unsuspecting kids like my own were stop to snap a shot with them, only to realise that you would have to pay a fee.... within the stretch of 300ft, we had people approaching us to buy pirated DVD. It was hard to get though the pavement within having someone trying to sell you something very 2 seconds. It was not a pleasant experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RacCay
30,"Touristy, but fun!","It is what it is! Fun to see the names, but be ready for people trying to get you to take pictures and trying to give you pamphlets! Also, it is crowded!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/518ATLCouple
40,Something to tick off the list,"I think we expected a big more glitz and glam from the ""Walk of Fame"" rather than thousands of stars spread completely along Hollywood Boulevard and adjoining side streets, however we still enjoyed seeing the stars. We used Google to search up who we were after and then walk to their location for photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P2554HSsamh
50,Love the stars,I love stars name. Clean. Attractions are near to each other. Lots of souvenirs. Plenty of restaurant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliceinTime
30,Loved seeing my Favourites,"I did love seeing my Favourite artists on those big stars, i think it something we all dream of. However you can do it in half an hour, including the entire boulevard. Hollywood really needs to clean up the entire street, its pretty disgusting. I would only recommend to stay in Hollywood for a maximum two nights",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anastasiakollis
40,Read this for Hollywood sign picture...,"Besides all the stars on the sidewalk, there are lots of superhero and cartoon characters looking to make a buck posing for pictures. Chinese theater is there as well, Madame Tussauds wax museum, Ripleys believe or not...etc..etc..There is also an open mall where you can climb the stairs and take the photo of the Hollywood sign far away on the hill, in case you are out of time to make it closer to the sign.There are many parking lots around for around $20 or street meters as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gatocanada
30,Too many characters...Annoying!!!,We loved the stars with all of the celebrity name. This was one of the highlights of our weekend however there are too many people dressed as characters of movies mulling about. This really takes away from the Hollywood Walk of Fame and can be kind of annoying.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P5313ZAjamiep
50,Busy Busy,"There are so many stars and so many people. It's a busy avenue but so much to see !!our heads were on a swivel like wow look here , look there. The souvenirs are priced reasonably because there are so many vendors. The Kodak theatre , tmz tour, a mall and so much to see. It's a must to see. The people are all dressed in character, there's Micheal Jackson , super heroes and the gold man.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferp421
30,This is Hollywood?,"You will be surprised at how small everything is and the lack of....cool factor. Some areas of the street are run-down and not well kept. Walk a bit farther and around the Capitol building things get nicer. Go see The Beatles' stars near there. Otherwise, a disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lostj252
30,Eh.,It was nice to see the names of the celebrities on the stars but that’s about it. Be aware about the people trying to sell you stuff on the street because there is a lot of them on the Walk of Fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mostdope412
10,So Disappointing,"I was very excited to find we were going to the Walk of Fame but was not expecting to visit a rundown street filled with garbage and sketchy folk every other block. It was so dirty and very tourist-trappy with merchandise shops everywhere. We lasted 30 miserable minutes and then decided to go to Universal Studios, best decision we ever made!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClassyOkanagan
10,Don’t wast your time,"We did the walk of fame. It was not what we expected. Every few feet Someone wanted a “donation” for something. A cd of their new work, magic show, picture with Someone dressed up. People were rude, streets and people were dirty. If I never go back it will be to soon. An experience I could have missed and been better off",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dann2277
40,Not what I expected!,"It's a must see location if in visiting Hollywood, I was a bit surprised it was not that clean, loads of shops bars and other attractions, if your thinking of doing a tour would recommend A1 we did the 6 hour one and you get to see everything there is innghe area , Venice beach, Rodeo Drive, Santa Monica, Beverly hills sign and Hollywood sign and loads more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O7311TIsharonh
50,What you would expect,"Yes there are lots of tourist traps, but the souvenir shops are not absurdly expensive and they are what you make of them. It's iconic and pretty cool. My teen daughters enjoyed it and the tour vendors ate not aggressive like other places (like Vegas!). Reasonably good food and I recommend parking at Highland. $3 per hour $15 max.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/624larryg
30,"Busy, interesting once","The stars are on the sidewalks on both sides of the road. Even on a Thursday afternoon in late May, the sidewalks were busy. The stretch of stars spans several blocks for lots of walking. I have been before and while it was cool the first time to take a few pictures of certain stars, it's really just a star on the sidewalk. If you go, be sure to watch where you park and keep your valuables safe. The area with the stars isn't bad, but you are just a few blocks from a very sketchy area.Recommendation: Tennis shoes (or good walking shoes), hat, sunscreen --- oh and just a brief look to the hills and you can see HOLLYWOOD on the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savsgirl66
50,Compulsory,"Its the most obvious place you must visit when in LA. Well, parking is hard to find. Don't take chances otherwise your car will be towed away. It`s a nice overall experience that's got to be done. Take a lot of pictures and buy fridge magnets. Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BalintRichter
30,It's a pavement with stars imbedded into it. Enjoy it for what it is!,"It is what it is, a walkway paved with stars embedded into some of the slabs. But yeah, the names of the stars are themselves very famous. Lots of tourist shops, lots of people trying to sell you a tour in a bus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stateofplay69
40,Got to be done,Started with breakfast in Mel's diner. Strolled up to Babylon Court to take pics of the Hollywood sign. Then did the walk of fame up to the Chinese theatre. Another photo opportunity with famous prints in the pavement. Lots of souvenir shops and tack to buy. People dressed as superheroes and the like offering to be in your photographs.Was surprisingly pleasant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sm1708
50,It's WALK OF FAME,"LocationIn the city of LA, California.ExperienceWonderful experience the place if full or people all the time. Full do stars on the floor engraved name of the best celebrities of all time, good luck for finding your favourite one. Really a great place to be anytime u are in LA, even for a while just be there click picture with the celebs as they are always roaming around like the one in my pictures.ServicePlace is surrounded by lots of fast food outlets and restaurants, sovinier shops.Hope this will be helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldsourhome
50,Near to see the stars,It was pretty neat to see the stars! I had purchased a book in my kindle that has a map and a list of all of the stars and which block they are in. It made it very easy to find the ones I wanted to see and get pictures of. Sometimes it was a bit hard to get a good picture due to the sun and glare but it was still a neat experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilypD425ZY
50,Walk of fame,"was Very crowded, but was very entertaining. Not very safe after 5:00 PM. They also have a lot of cute shops. Just wish it wasn’t so crowded and you could eat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnsI8339MD
40,So great,"Hollywood Boulevard is very colorful. A lot of shops and shopping centers. At every step, there are twins of movie heroes. Very innocent they behave if they get in the frame. Do not spare two dollars to withdraw from them. The only thing that is not convenient, there is no list of stars, whose star is located. But, know the brightest stars at the Chinese theater. Well, to tourists, please do not litter for there is not clean where clean, but where they do not litter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cod615
10,Dirty and smelly,"Well what a dump!! We didn't go in with majorly high expectations given the reviews however we were still surprised. The area definitely didn't feel safe and this was reiterated by the various people fighting on the street. The streets mostly smelt like pee too!! It was one of those things that you have to do but it's one of those things you do and then think ""what a waste of time.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oostell
30,Nostalgia and then get out of there.,"Great thing to see, and walk up and down, but all in all too touristy and built up, you wouldn’t spend the day there. Go, see the stars and then head to somewhere more low key for shopping and eating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kateradartist
30,Too crowded!,Interesting seeing all the sidewalk stars. But the crowds were unbearable! We got forced off the sidewalk several times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DjDan48
20,Day trip,Not much too say it was fun looking at the stars and guessing who some of them. Looking down some of the side streets I thought I was in some third world country.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G1853XZjimw
30,Dated :-(,Back in the day it may have been a thing to get your name on the Hollywood hall of fame however there are now large areas on the outskirts that are dated and grubby.We also noticed the same person on two if not three stars as we walked down in daylight. The place comes to life more at night with the neon lights and in-ability to see the grim in the dark...There were a number of street performers which were interesting to start with however you soon realise how difficult it is to walk anywhere when there are crowds of people every few minutes..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulbrown1019

30,Fun for the family but proceed with caution.,"It’s fun for the family but with my 7yr old daughter I didn’t feel totally safe. I’m a local and have lived in LA for over 12 years. Bringing your kids to the Hollywood Walk of Fame is like walking them around busy streets in Vegas or Niagara Falls Canada. There’s a lot to look at, people to see, lights, action and super fun museums but so many kinds of people are attracted to this destination that it’s a bit unsettling. I held onto her hand very tight as we walked the streets on a Sunday afternoon.Pros:Awesome thing to see at least once in your life! It’s wonderful to see your favorite movie stars on the walk of fame, and experience a slice of Hollywood, the Kodak Theatre, the Egyptian Theatre, the fun Museums and all the weird people dressed in super hero costumes, busy streets filled with cars and people. I would go during the week so that people and traffic are kept at a minimum.There are fruit vendors on the sidewalks and people selling trinkets and small toys and bubble blowers so kids have a lot to see and enjoy! Super fun souvenir shops for the kids that are filled with Hollywood reminders! The Hollywood and Highland shopping center is awesome with an outdoor water fountain that’s kids run through in the summer heat:Cons:There are a lot of people. All kinds, and it can be overwhelming to say the least. I was constantly stressed because I had my child with me among all of the people. Parking is expensive and sometimes hard to find when it’s really busy so go during the week especially if you have kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TANYAMEMME
40,Crowded and overrated,"Visited on the memorial weekend, when there were heaps of tourists and also heaps of buskers/entertainers and street sellers.Also people doing really weird things to photograph themselves with particular stars!Wouldn’t suggest a special visit, but if you are in the area....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CactusRose
30,Be aware this ain't Disneyland,"The stars are beyond cool. The memories they inspire even better. What needs to be remembered is that these are in real city with a real city's problems and not some idealistic movie set. Hollywood has never been ""Hollywood"" and honestly I would not want it to be. These stars are public tributes to great people in entertainment in a public place. Enjoy walking around and see who you can find",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DisneylandFamily
40,Go early!,"The Walk of Fame is a must see but best seen in the morning, by afternoon it can get so crowded that you won't get a good view of all the stars.It is also very pretty at night but keep your guard up - Hollywood is a great deal safer than it was in the 80s & 90s but you should still walk with caution and not alone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NanceeLeeAllen
50,Good times!!!,Okay so everyone has to do it! But my suggestion is... go down before noon! Then you will be able to see everything!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephjones81
30,Not too exciting,"Although it is nice to see lots of familiar names on the stars as you walk, it definitely wasn’t a milestone or self accomplishment. Might suggest this as more of a pit stop to see a certain celebrity’s name you met or adore. But I did not have the best experience as you might be able to tell. However there was a lot of tourists when I went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesecret
40,Must see,"You always hear about it so you have to see it ! Lol ! Stars gave in different categories so you might see a name more than once! They are about 15 blocks so If you are intrested in a special star check its location online before getting there !lots of maps are available when you google it, for free! You do not need a guide for that! Notice that MUHAMMAD-ALI s star, the great athlete champion is the only one on the wall so you can not find it while you are looking down but local sellers can help you find it . Make sure to bring your comfortable shoes !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saaaraahss
10,Awful,"I guess you can say you’ve ticked a box... but that’s about it! It’s actually a scary place to be, did not feel safe at all. There is absolutely nothing glamourous about it what so ever. The stars were dirty, there was homesless everywhere and no where decent to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnitaChloe
40,Came here with no expectations and wasn't disappointed,"You just can't expect to see all the glamour here that you see on TV when watching the Oscars. The Walk of Fame is packed with the stars, and it is really hard to follow/find the star that you came here to see. People walk fast, and it is hard to miss the star you came here to see. Our visit was about 45 minutes, and it was enough. We did not venture inside any shops/attractions. We just walked around. The Solo premiere was happening, so the place was hectic, and the street was blocked. It's one of those ""BEEN THERE - CHECK IT OFF MY LIST"" the of attractions but really nothing to be super excited about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiewaa
30,Hollywood walk,Great place to take pictures & get the feel of Hollywood but please know that the streets are not as clean as they should be & you will see a lot of tourists. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/523carmenr
30,Walk through History,"The more you know about early Film, Radio and Television the more you will appreciate strolling down Hollywood blvd. The icons will tell you what the person was famous for. Start on Hollywood and Vine and make your way to Grahman's Chinese Theater and the famous footprints. The Blvd gets funky at night, so if you have kids, stroll the Blvd. during the day. If you love singing waiters and good pizza stop in at Michelis and if you want to immerse yourself in the 1940's have a cocktail or steak at Musso and Frank's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TruthtellerTraveler6
30,Day Trip,"Our family was visiting from out of state and of course they wanted to see the celebrity stars on the Blvd. From one end to the other is quite a hump, so wear your walking shoes! There are footprints and handprints of some stars in front of the Grauman Chinese Theater. Other attractions are the wax museums and the bus tours to various places like the movie stars homes, etc. Lots of shopping opportunities at reasonable prices and tons of places to eat. Parking is plentiful at different places, just follow the signs and pay at least $25 if you want safety. It can get a lil seedy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ebonycowgirl
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame best placed in Hollywood boulevard,"I would offer to visit Hollywood Walk of Fame for every tourists groups in los angeles, there are many theaters in Hollywood Walk of Fame",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saityardimci
30,Tick the box and go but don’t expect glamorous,We had been pre- warned about the rough area of Hollywood and that it was a place to visit but not to expect much. It was good to see all of the stars and handprints as we had seen them on TV but once you have seen that it’s best to move on. Not a place you need to see twice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshcutt
10,Complete dump,"First time visiting the USA and we thought we would do the walk of fame as we were in the area. Walk of fame? Should be called the walk of shame. We only walked up one side the entire length, the dirt, the smell if urine was so strong I had to cover my mouth. We walked quickly, only took a few photos and got a taxi to come back to where we were staying, so we wouldn't have to walk through the stench agsin. I was very surprised about it. Shame on the local authorities or whoever is in charge of this. I'm sure local businesses must lose out.. I didnt want to go into any of the shops as I wanted to get away as fast as I could. In my opinion, not worth waiting time in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mariabridgetlyons
10,What a disappointment,I was surprised at the state of the walk of fame. It is a huge tourist attraction and yet it seems they do nothing to look after it.It is dirty and has a lot of cracks. If you don't go earlier in the day you can't even see the stars as there are too many people.I am glad I have been there now and seen it but I would not go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/262catherineh
20,Not glamorous,"I had been to Hollywood Blvd before but my husband wanted to check it out as we were in the area. Just as I had told him, it's very dirty and homeless people are everywhere. People dressed up in crappy costumes charging money for a picture. Its defiently not glamorous. He was very disappointed as I expect most people are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/775courtneyk
40,Walk of fame,Starts at Hollywood vine station runs mile either side right up to Hollywood Boulevard where outside Hard Rock Cafe all street traders are trading on top of some of the stars but well worth a visit if you’re after someone in specific check on google like I did with John Wayne which is down on 1500 vine need to get there def going back here are two I took yesterday 👍,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harry277
40,Find your favorite star,"Very interesting place to visit as a tourist, you need spend some time to find famous star, a lots of them paid for their own star, some don’t like the ideas their name will be under people’s foot all the time, they don’t want a star with their name on the sidewalk. Some interesting performance. This is a place to see people and let them see you too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cattloverss
30,They go for a long way,It was fun to walk along & see the stars. And really walking the Hollywood walk of Fame is fun after seeing it on movies. The stars do get pretty slick if is drizzling out like it was when we were there. They are neat to see & go for a long way but I thought the cement hand prints were better to look at. There is a lot of people so looking at the stars can be hard to do. Also there are many street performers who will take a picture with you but you must tip. Some of them are pretty aggressive in a nice way but will get you to take a picture then demand a tip. Just be smart. Also know the people taking your picture so they don’t take your phone/camera & carry your purse across your chest not over the shoulder & don’t rest it on the back of a chair while eating out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redredles
50,Neat,Cool. But I want a list of where they are located! So I can find certain ones & I was surprised at how dirty some of them are. They aren’t all clean!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kbc1fan

20,What an absolute dive!,"It's actually shocking how poverty stricken this area is. They make it look fabulous on the TV with all the glitz and glam...when in reality there is nothing glamourous about Hollywood Boulevard. The fact the stars are on the ground is the only fascinating thing but between the tourist and all the homeless people, they're not a huge highlight.I would not stay there again. In fact I don't think I'll ever return to Hollywood. We were sold a dream! Then we woke up and jumped on a plane to Miami.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sim_Mcs_World
10,Worst part of our trip.,Harassed every 20 seconds to purchase tour bus tickets or take peoples cds for ‘a small donation’. Then they get rude and nasty when you politely say no thank you. We had 2 people chase us into stores trying to get us to buy. No police patrolling to ensure tourists feel safer. Overall just a terrible environment to be in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissSkoda
30,"Nothing special, but a must do.",You cannot come to LA & not visit the walk of fame. But it’s nothing out of this world. It’s crowded and you have to be careful walking because everyone is stopping & taking pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnAir39560466591
50,Not what I expected,We did find the foot and hand prints that I imagined; but they are located at Grohmans Chinese theater!Don’t miss this part of the Walk of Fame!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/770nickis
30,We expected more !,We would have been disappointed if we would have missed it but once there we did not find any magic in this icon of Hollywood ! It is still worth a look !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belleretraite
20,Not that great,The walk of fame ....Not really magic this street...I expected something beautiful and find something dirty with full of megastores for chip souvenirs .10mn walk on the stars is more that enough. Nothing else to do .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RafaelBecker67
20,Once not twice is ideal,"This is an extreme gimick, as is all of Hollywood and dare I say most of LA... pop culture haven. If I were you, plan to go somewhere not in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cstruyk
40,Lovely place for one day,This is place is so iconic. I'm here in LA for a training period and had to come to the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame. The energy here is amazing. A lot of cool people from all over the world that came to see to Stars of the famous actors and singers. A lot of boutiques for nice souvenirs. Had a great time. A must see for one day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/825bayramt
20,"Once, not twice!","Definitely something you would want to see when in L.A. once only. Not twice. The place was so crowded that we could barely have proper pictures taken. The area surrounding the walk of fame is very disappointing, at least not what I had in mind. I expected to be blown away but I wasn't at all impressed. But, I guess it's part of the must do if you're passing through L.A. and make sure to have the perfect picture, you will not want to come back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/virgin2018

30,Good but repetitive,You need to see it but it is a bit samy after a bit and the area round about isn’t the nicest part to be in.Something to tick off your LA list tho,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morago675
50,Cool must do if your visiting,It's so much going on you may forget to look at all the names. Your sure to see anyone walk by . It's a must do a lot of tours and museums nearby,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabeths485
20,Not worth it,"I was excited to see this at first. Getting there wasn’t bad (traffic was decent!) but once we got there, instantly accosted by people asking for money for pictures with them (dressed as characters) or aspiring musicians trying to sell you their music and pictures. The walk is REALLY LONG. I wasn’t expecting that. The worst part is it is filthy. Saw a homeless man take a dump on the sidewalk right by the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/173cieraj
30,Nothing special,Pretty average attraction. Situated on the main strip of Hollywood Blvd.Lots of star impersonators and people dressed in costumes trying to con tourists into taking photos with them then demanding up to 20usd from them. So be mindful and refuse to take photos with anyone. Not as glitzy and glam as one would imagine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janine3
30,nice to see,"Lots of stars, but a map close to the location that is easily available would be good. Hard to locate the specific stars you are interested in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelam71
30,Over rated,"Yes this is a must do trip for many people, however it has gotten crowded, dirty and the street vendors/artists/promoters are too aggressive. It is still easy to take a picture with your favorite star but a simple walk down the boulevard is interrupted by non-stop peddlers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gl0bal_guru

50,hectic,"really really manic place to visit . so much going on and so many people trying to grab you're attention. don't fall for anyone handing you a CD or DVD . just say no thank you . they want a ""donation"" as soon as you have it in hand .plenty of pictures to be had and a real feel of excitement and electric in the air .take it for what it is. an overhyped facade where you can get some pics of the stars on the walk of fame . fun time had and you never know you might see a fat batman or plastic ironman . either way it's a tourist must and I'm glad we went . but wouldn't want to spend too long there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalterWhite01
30,A lot of hype,We visited the walk of fame as part of a guided tour and I was underwhelmed. Hollywood just isn’t as glamorous as the movies. I found most of the stars I was looking for. The stars are well presented however. I think it’s worth the visit if you’re in the area but I would hang around for long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thehippieinme
30,Busy place,"The walk of fame is ok, but be aware it’s mega mega busy. Sadly there are plenty of beggars, hustlers, street vendors etc.... The stars are interesting to view but the street is quite dirty. It’s nice but needs cleaning up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1weetwood
40,It's a must,"This is considered a Must, and indeed it is, there is the combination of all the oldies and newest famous people reflected all along the walk in the shapes of a Star...I have visited it twice, both times very windy and cold, and for my surprise both times very dirty, you’d think, this place that received millions of visitors per year would be cleaner and you don’t see any police officers nor car anywhere. How ever, there are many parking spots, and you can go to the wax museums, see all types of people, the IMAX Chinese theater, it is fun and you can go with the family, not babies (my opinion) people smokes weed freely.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattyG76
30,Stars,"We really did not know what to expect , you see this on the tv and you think wow. Well it really is not wow. You would expect the place to be spotless and really it is not. The streets really are quite dirty and it is a real shame. You really don't get the time to look at the names as people are always pushing past. Really quite disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sirah2013
30,Crazy crowded,I have to say not what I had envisioned. It is actually the side walks of the city. It was crowded and hard to look at the stars to find ones you wanted because of the locals hounding you to buy something they were selling. It felt like being in Vegas with all the hustling going on. This made you feel uncomfortable to actually take your time to find the stars you wanted to see. We drove there to look for certain stars but left within 10 minutes. Am I glad I can say I saw it? Yes but wish I felt like I could have taken the time to enjoy it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToastOnTheTown
30,Yeah,Be ready to be a bit disapointed.Is really hard to explain but will understand if one day you’ll get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BastienG95

30,One to tick off my list,Was very disappointed - very dirty and a lot of homeless and people trying to con you into buying stuff - ie the CD men beware they thrust a cd at you thinking it’s free but they will not leave you till they have some money from you luckily we were warned - there are loads of them. Seeing the stars on the pavement was cool but loads of people about so found it hard to look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jonewitt
20,Hollywood - walk of shame,"If I were in the movie, music, or broadcasting industry, I would really think about having my star on the sidewalks of Hollywood blvd. Having been there on several occasions, I can tell you that it's a must see for anyone new / visiting the LA area. Plan on taking a lot of $$$$$, especially if you're with a family, to see any of the museum exhibits - ( from the wax museums to the Hollywood Museum, and everything between) And on top of that, you'll have to deal with the countless number of homeless people holding signs for money. I really want to take my family in a area where I see someone holding a sign that states, "" I need money for Coke and strippers"". I also realize that those individuals who are dressed in costume, from Batman to Spider man make their money from people taking pictures of them, but they'll get mad if you happen to get a shot of them without shelling out some cash. As far as the Walk of shame is concerned, the sidewalks themselves are dirty, with paper and debris everywhere, but the majority of the individuals always want to stop and take a photo of themselves kneeling next to the star of their favorite person. Wow, dreams really do come true in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909SteveC
50,My dram came true,Hollywood stars sidewalk was unforgettable. I always wanted to see them and just walk. It was my dream since 8 grade. Now I'm happy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gorhayq2018
40,So many people but very cool,My daughter and I decided to check this out during our LA visit. It was a lot of fun. It was fun seeing the hundreds of stars stars. It is a lot of walking but great exercise. There are plenty of shops to shop along the way. If you make it to the Chinese Theater there are actual had and feet prints in the sidewalk. It’s a lot of fun. But there are soooo many people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leaho727
30,Different than expected,"As no body ever tells you bad things about their trip I think here is few things people should know . Hollywood Walk of Fame , most famous tourist attraction is dirty and smells bad ! Homeless people living there sleep and use the walk as their personal bathrooms ! Stars on the ground are dirty and you have to make magic to make them look pretty on your pictures , lots of them are broken and cracked , but that is something that happens with side walks . On the other had is really cool to see stars of your fav celebrities , just to bad that it comes with bad smell in a package :/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bohemian_me84
20,Be aware of con sellers.,"We were excited to walk the Hollywood walk of fame but it turned out not what we had expected. It was mega crowded, the place had a lot of homeless people sadly. It stunk of urine and had a fair amount of litter. There are people dressed up as stars ready to con you into an expensive photo opportunity with your phone. Plus people all over selling CDs which are blank we are told.We didn't feel very safe at all here sadly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daphadills
20,Dirty,Hollywood could do with a wash gor such a famous land mark and tourist attraction its in a desperate need of maintenance.Anyone that visits be sure to wash afterwards,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/410nathant
40,You MUST do this if you are in LA,Ok so there are a LOT of stars set into the pavement (sidewalk) but you really have to do this walk if you are visiting LA. Some of the route is rather seedy and you will be constantly hassled by vendors trying to sell you tours of the homes of the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wizzo2016
20,Narrow and Crowded,"This area was crowded (on a Monday morning)as a you might expect a tourist attraction to be. The street is narrow and the area feels claustrophobic. People try to “give” (want a donation)you their music CDs, and one person became indignant when I refused.I wasn’t looking for any star in particular though did happen to see the stars of Marilyn Monroe, Michael Jackson, and Donald Trump.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/365marthal
40,Iconic but grimey,"Beware of the cd guys, just ignore them, always ignore them... The place is a bit of a circus, but it's still worth a look, the stars went a lot further down the road than I thought they would which was pretty cool",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markrP6479WV
40,Neat Walk,My daughter who is 12 and I visited this walkway in May 2018. The weather that day was overcast and drizzly but yet the area was very busy. There was plenty of opportunity though to stop and take your time to photograph the stars you wish to see. The area surrounding the walk of fame contains many interesting shops and I must say people for that matter LOL. Not an area I would want to spend too long in but was worth it when you’re traveling to LA on pleasure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JR6442
50,Walk walk walk,"The Hollywood walk of fameWas really cool 😎It was really longer then I expectedI liked looking at the names of the famousA lot of action on the street Spider-Man,star war characters and even a giant transformerIt ran into Chinese Theater which had prints of actors hands and feelThe lady that was playing Monroe was unbelievably frozen like a real character from the wax museumWas quite the experience for a jersyian",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atu825
20,Not what we expected,"If in Hollywood it has to be done, just don’t expect to see the glamour of Hollywood here. It’s dirty and smells quite bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/399richarda
10,Filthy and risgusting,Worst real estate in America. Everything small and underdeveloped from its origins 50+ years ago. Lots of homeless. Lots of dirt. Lots of seedy shops. Avoid.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anagorski
30,Hollywood stars,Great to see a few but there are so many it's impossible to keep walking down with yiur head hanging down to see them all so you miss a lot out. surprised Kevin spacey and other shamed actors haven't lost their star.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wilkie87
20,Dissapointed,"Had higher expectations towards this famous landmark. The area has nothing special for me to see, this was just a tick in the box for me",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tomppa75
10,Hollywood is a strange place,"After visiting a museum, my friend and I decided to walk to a nearby restaurant with a baby in the stroller. Not a good idea. Hollywood is filled with strange people without respect. There were many instances we people were smoking and we were forced to walk in their smoke with a newborn.I don't suggest taking small children or babies here. The area smells bad and is busy, ridden with strange people smoking and drinking in broad daylight afternoon hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caribbeanmamma
20,So so...,"With this being right on the Hollywood strip I figured it would be busy but it was over populated and get hustled every step you take either it’s for a Hollywood tour you say no thanks and they walk 50 feet with you trying to talk you into it, or someone giving you a CD and then asking for 5-10.00... it’s way to crazy down there. We stayed at the walk of fame for max 30 minutes and was over it and left! Maybe we didn’t give it much time but every 2 minutes someone was trying to sell us something or scam you out of some money.. most definitely won’t return.. I saw it once no need to see it again!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsBCostello
50,The dream to walk here,"Once arrived on Hollywood boulevard, you observe the stars named after some notorious movie artists.Everyone dreamed sometime to be in L A, to see the long row of stars on the sidewalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y8837LLgabriela
20,Let down,"Definitely don’t get your hopes up for this place. If you are pushed for time and find yourself choosing this or something else...go with something else. Filthy dirty, hustlers, homeless, majority of the stars are dirty and cracked. I understand that high traffic areas are hard to maintain but it really was disgusting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlynb22
20,Dirty and GHETTO,The walk of fame is a little walk of shame with all the loitering by overweight spidermen that dont fit in their skinsuit or the Elvis that has left the building. There is also quite a bit of trash and grossness on many of the stars. We did find elvis and the beatles - so we were happy. LA LA LAnd is the best for gifts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbmusic
30,"Meh, Not Bad.","As a sole event, it's not particularly good. If you know what stars you want pics of/with, Google where they are and just go for them. If you're doing the full walk for the experience, wear comfortable shoes and expect both very quiet and very, very busy areas (unrelated to star names). It's nice when you come across a name you care about, but there will be many that mean nothing to you, and you can be walking for 15-20 minutes, completely uninterested. That being said, it's a good way to explore the area, as you cover a lot of ground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danverec
50,It’s super busy but worth it!,"It is very busy so if you want to take photos of the actual stars you have to basically stand right over it or you’ll have some dodgey pics with other peoples feet. Careful of people on street trying to sell you stuff they literally shove things in your hand then want you to pay for it, unless your actually interested don’t bother stopping they’re relentless. Parking available in the public parking structures and most offer free parking up to 90mins",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicRay2016
30,Disappointed but ok,"What can I say, we were disappointed with the walk of fame. Considering this is where the Oscars are held every year it was very dirty, street stalls, people handing you leaflets or cd’s then asking for donations. We really thought the stars on the pavement would at least be clean, but alas no. Marilyn Monroes star is outside macdonalds and some are close to the edge of the road where you cross. First impressions count. Really think Hollywood needs to look at this area and get it cleaned up. Great visit, saw what we wanted but don’t think I’ll rush back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neathguys
30,Good to do once,If you are like me and expected this to be glamourous you might be disappointed. You will more than likely find the star of your favorite actor or band and can take a picture with it. But the glamour stops there. There are a lot of people trying to make a buck.. some pretty aggressive. Police presence is pretty heavy which is great. Atmosphere is good but is better seen driving. It is nothing like the star induction on TV. There are a lot of tourist traps. Parking could be a bare ( we used spothero). The best part is the mall where you can see the Holiwood sign ( although too far for pictures ) and the Chinese theater which did not disappoint. Be ready for crowds and take the atmosphere in. Good for one time only.. we'll not go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mihais55
10,Lots of hustlers,"I feel this is one of the most overrated attractions in la.The road this is on is full of homeless people and hustlers, streets are dirty and the stars and cool but once you’ve seen one you’ve seen them allIf you are deciding between his and something else do something else, totally overrated",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988chantellen
20,Nasty,"If you like to see dirt, urine , homeless and freaks you will love this block. Went to a film festival out here and every year it is nasty and they never clean up the streets. Watch yourself here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/istanbulrocks
30,Average tourist spot,"You'll enjoy the Hollywood walk of fame if you like everything hollywood. If not, you can skip it and go to other LA spots/areas that are nice and enjoyable. There's always a lot of people/tourists in the area. Plenty of restaurants/bars/shops. Wear comfortable shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlustlivinglife
50,Leisure,Great! Had lots of fun taking photos and reminiscing about old films. The experience was truly Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asclacker
30,Walk of fame was interesting,I can tell you hollywood is pretty packed. Lots of people everywhere it is a tourist place definetly. But for me see i rather just do a quick scoping of this place. Walk of fame is cool to see but during busy times it was a little too crowded for me. Im more a shopping gurl and that was the fun part about hollywood. 😄 LA is definetly the place to be for shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hopeey1113

40,Can do better,"I had higher expectations when it came to this famous place. However it’s sad to see that besides the cosplay guys and the souvenir shops, there’s no real entertainment there.To have a wonderful night after visiting this place you have to go to santa monica or travel to another city or just party somewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarakells
50,great,Good but the streets of Hollywood are getting too dirty. Some areas where the walk of fame is can be better maintained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Latoyaa1
50,Day out on Hollywood boulevard,Don’t forget your walking shoes if you want to see every star there spread over 15 blocks on both sides of street but worth the walk to just see a few hundred apparently over 2000 to see expect to see some names more than once due to being in different categories,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marktU206TQ
40,Great excitement,"To walk in the shoes of where no doubt the stars started some of the greatest careers , but there are so many broken and repeated stars , fun though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/393henryd
20,Do it once for your “resume”,"It is one of those attractions that you need to see if in Hollywood, but do it and then go someplace else. It is dirty, spooky after dark, the smell of Cannabis is everywhere. At least it wasn’t very crowded when we got there. It is really a bit on the shady side",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YNNYN
30,Hollywood stars,"It was ok to see. The stars are all scattered on both sides of Hollywood so if you are looking for a specific star I would make sure to know their location so you know where to find them. The area is filled with bums, shady people, people trying to haggle their mixtapes and salesmen trying to get you to go on those touristy tours. I saw Chewbacca and I legit saw a family want to take a picture with him but they said they didn’t have money for tip and this Chewbacca said he accepted cards on his phone! Keep walking they will all try to get you to buy something. Get there early and park at a meter on the side of the road. Cool to see once and that’s about it. If they could clear out all the bums and crazies it would be a slightly better experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ksauce04
30,Hollywood Boulevard,"Hollywood Boulevard should be and could be a prime one attraction; but it is so overcrowded and polluted with low-lifes that it is a detriment really.It has great attractive buildings - the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, the Chinese & Egyptian & El Capitan Theaters, Musso & Frank's Restaurant and the Pig & Whistle Grill to name a few.But, the stars on the sidewalk are often filthy, where they should be washed and repaired every day.The oh so many buskers and the blaring loud-speaker religious idiots are a major detraction. Get rid of them...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larryrT690MS
30,Lots of garbage,"Cool to see, but was very dirty. There was a movie premiere the night before, lots of garbage around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kemoores2
40,Walk of Fame,"The only drawback to walk of fame is knowing where to find certain entertainer's star. There should be some sort of guide. If we overlooked or missed it then we made it hard for ourselves. Other than that, loved every minute of the discovery aspect of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/95daynam
40,Don’t miss it,What a fun day w family. Walk it. Experience the local “culture” of Hollywood. Characters. Bums. Police. Locals. Tourists. Foreigners. Wackos. Business people. Musicians.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ken_stearns
30,Very busy street,We went there because it was one of the attraction we wanted to see. The street is crazily crowded. Once we saw the stars we wanted to see then that was it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ngimmie
30,Go once then that’s it,"This place is crowded to say the least. Too many vendors, tourists, and what-have-yous. That being said, go once just to see it and try to avoid the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iamciaraledesma
30,Excited for Hollywood,"After arriving at our hotel we couldn’t wait to get to the Hollywood Walk of fame to see all the stars, when we arrived I was slightly disappointed at how grubby Hollywood Boulevard was, the stars are not clean, the whole street was dirty, it didn’t take away the fun of finding all the famous names though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionam162
40,"You're going to visit anyway, here's what you should know:","The first thing to know is that the idea of putting these terrazzo stars on the sidewalk started as a gimmick dreamed up by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce in the early 1950's, as a way of bringing some of the fame and glamour of the movie business to the decidedly glamorous downtown Hollywood. No one could have expected that this would be such a hit, more than a half century later, with no sign of slowing down.The second thing you need to know is ""where, exactly, are all of the stars?"". The easy answer is to start at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. There are stars north and south on Vine, between Sunset and Yucca, and east and west on Hollywood between Gower and La Brea. You can find maps on line pretty easily on the internet with a quick search engine search, so I won't reiterate any of that here.The third, thing to know is that Hollywood isn't the mess that it was in the 70's and 80's but it can still get sketchy, especially after dark. You'll want to remain alert to your surroundings, and realize that some of the street people who dress up as characters can be pretty aggressive -- they'll offer to take a picture with you, but they EXPECT to be paid, and there have even been cases of violence when the hapless tourist didn't understand the nature of the transaction. If you are going to be there after hours, you might consider sticking with the more populated stretch of Hollywood Blvd. between Highland and La Brea -- in front of the Kodak theater and Hollywood and Highland retail and movie area. Plus, you'll have Grauman's Chinese theater (yes, I know it hasn't been called Graumans' for decades, but for me, it'll always be Sid's wacky movie palace).And the final thing to know:Chow. The hollywood/highland complex has lots of good, economical food options after you've spend some time spotting your favorite actor's stars outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougr846
40,My Experience,"The Walk of Fame is pretty cool. It pretty much covers all of Hollywood. It’s so famous and iconic with all those stars in the sidewalk with a lot of famous actors, actresses, musicians and others in them. But the theater itself is very ornate and very old. It’s amazing to see how many stars are here and some of them were from a long ago. Overall I had a pretty good time there and will come back here again to see what other people have stars there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rekul42
20,Must do! - but the place needs cleanup!,"A visit to LA definitely includes this! However, a major clean-up will help as the place(it's a sidewalk) is really dirty and smelly...A lot of tiles are broken too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Making_Memories_L
40,Lots of photos,"Snapped lots of pictures of our favorite personalities. A whole section of the sidewalk was blocked off in front of the theater as they took down staging. Made navigating in a wheelchair challenging. It is loud so it is not for service animals that are uncomfortable around noises (crowds, sirens, equipment, etc.).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3255MCsteveb
10,dirty and full of homeless,"as a tourist and travelling with young children I would give the walk of fame a miss. as it is a tourist attraction you would expect the area to be clean and a pleasure to walk along. I found it dirty, run down and full of homeless. I would give it a miss for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer730613
30,"Been here, done that. Watch for the artists","It's more of a tourist thing to do. You do it so you can snap some pictures of the stars you like and that's about it. I was not interested in going to any of the museums at all. So the whole trip takes a bit more than an hour.Watch out for the very friendly artists though. Some dress as movie characters and are very friendly. Of course they want you to take a picture with them and charge you for it. I get how hard their life is (especially in those costumes in summer) and have full respects for them. What you need to watch out for are the ones that will simply hand you stuff (like a CD). Once you take it they ask you for a donation. Some people just got ""nicely shamed"" into donating some money. I personally do not like this -- if you are selling something, then tell people the price of it. Don't bait people into taking and then shame them into donating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BHUANG69
30,"ok, but no big thrill","it might be fun to take a picture by a star of one of your favorites, but don't go out of the way to see any particular star. check hollywood chamber of commerce to see schedule of presentations...that can definitely be cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnRyan724
30,Fun but combine with something else,"I have always liked this attraction. But it is just walking and looking at names in stars on the ground. Fun to remember who is who, but it's long and often you (or at least I didn't) don't recognize anyone for many stars. It's fun if you treat it as one of the many things to do in Hollywood and don't come for only it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdunn308
30,Crowded,Visited on a weekend it was overcrowded as is to be expected. Solicitors make for a less relaxing experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eve212015
40,Complete LA Experience,"A visit to LA isn’t complete without experiencing the Hollywood Walk of the who’s Who on the star pavement... crazy atmosphere of tourists and local characters vie-ing on a piece of the action. Totally entertaining, air is full of anticipation of what will happen as one is in the midst of this happy chaos..Just a tip from a local - parking is expensive if you use the many parking places surrounding Hollywood and Highland. Instead, park at the mall behind, validate your ticket at one of the store.. Sephora or Starbucks anyone?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Walalang_LA
30,Underwhelming,"The stars are just on the ground which appears to be a normal, somewhat busy street. I had different expectations in mind beforehand. It’s still nice to see recognizable names. Overall, you can’t go to LA without seeing the stars but it could take all but 10 minutes to snap some pictures and go on to the next site. The Blvd is entertaining though, lots of characters up and down the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaiy_12
30,Good to experience,"One of the places that needs to be checked off the list when coming to Hollywood. Get your walking shoes on as its a LONG walk of fame. Best to figure out which ones you actually want to see and go straight to them as there is so many. You will also experience large crowds, people trying to sell you things you don’t want, homeless people and the lovely smell of urine. Oh and people trying to sell you stuff you don’t want, again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snakedoctor321983
40,Find your stars,"Was ok , wouldn’t be in a rush to do it again , goes for miles up and down streets some are clean some are dirty , pedestrians everywhere makes it hard to get a good photo as some people are quite rude will walk straight over your star and ruin your pic , good to do a little of it but after a while gets boring , try to find out where your stars are situated and go straight to that area !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissayres
40,Good to see once but wouldn't rush back,"If you go to LA, you have to go to the Walk of Fame just for the experience. It's fun finding the stars of various celebrities and putting your hand prints on the hand prints of various famous people such as the actors from Harry Potter. Our son took his Pooh Bear all the way from Australia to get a photo on Pooh's star. A word of caution, there are many 'actors' dressed as various characters who will literally grab your kids and try to extort money from you for a photo and they can be quite aggressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodidella
30,Had to do it but once is enough.,"Visiting LA the Walk of Fame is a mandatory visit.It’s great to see all the stars and see some of your favourite celebs immortalised on concrete but the novelty soon wears off.After a while you realise you are spending so much time looking at the ground you aren’t paying attention to where you are going and end up bumping into people and missing seeing some really famous landmarks.We hopped on a tour bus to take us around the sights and we ended up with a washed actress as a tour guide who obviously didn’t find the fame and fortune she desired when she left Kentucky 25 years ago. It was so bad that I nearly stood up to correct her when she made some statements that were clearly just untrue. She reminded us, at least every 10 minutes, that she relied upon tips to survive, but then would name-drop all the famous celebrities she “hung out” with.Highlight of the walk was the Hard Rock Cafe, just brilliant and we really enjoyed it.Souvenir shops were cheap and cheesy and everything made in China (as you would expect I guess).Biggest negative was transport. We were staying in Anaheim and I did not want to drive into Hollywood so we caught the train. Train network was pretty straightforward but it’s clear that no one uses it and the timetable is more of a guide than a schedule.But once you arrive everything is walkable. Once you have done the tour and walk across the stars, been to the Chinese theatre and the Dolby theatre.....there really isn’t all that much to do there (if you have children with you). I imagine if I went 20 years ago, prior to family life, I would’ve enjoyed the nightlife and bars etc a bit more.So all in all, good and a “must do”, but very overrated!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sifterboy
40,Great for Movie Nuts,"I have been to Hollywood before and my recent return visit was much the same as I remembered. The walk of fame is located in an area which is lined with iconic movie magic but unfortunately it is quite dirty and not as glamorous as you may think.Some of the stars on the walk of fame were very dirty or damaged which is a shame, you would think that somebody would make sure the stars are well looked after.Outside the Dolby Theater you will find a number of pests trying to get you to buy their CDs of home grown music or dressed in low rent Hollywood costumes in order to get you to tip them for photos.On a personal level I was very pleased to see Kate Winslet’s star which was conveniently located outside the metro rail station at Hollywood and Vine.A great place to eat is across the road from Kate’s star called Greenleaf.Also off the walk of fame is a wall painted mural of Hollywood stars used in the 2016 movie La La Land.My advice is be prepared to walk if you want to see all the stars, a good two hours would be an ideal time to set aside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/846deang
40,Fun,"We enjoyed our day , there are a lot of ppl that come up rushing to get you to buy things but said no and kept walking , we did get asked to leave the area of Chinese theatre due to some event , seemed unfair Glad we did it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/435janei

10,A shadow of it's former self...,"Went here for a half day to visit the strip but left earlier than planned. Hollywood boulevard is packed with homeless people, beggars and dangerous people on drugs and this was during the afternoon on a Saturday.A quick visit perhaps but in my opinion it's a dirty stretch of road that reeks of urine.

40,Bucket list,We walked the Walk of Fame definitely not what I expected the stars are just down a bunch of random sidewalks but we were able to find the names that we wanted and saw the cement handprints and signatures in the cement that was pretty cool,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bridgetc681
40,Fun place to visit but the area is sketchy,"We spent about 30 minutes walking up and down the sidewalks looking at the stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame recently. It is fun to see some of the names but be aware that this part of town is a bit run down and sketchy. There are a lot of people wearing costumes who want you to pay for taking a picture with them. There are also guys handing out ""free"" CD's for which you then have to pay. Learn to say ""No, thank you"" when approached by any of these people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maui2014NMR
50,Fun thing to do when visiting the LA area,"I’m from the LA area, and I was met with a little resistance when suggesting to the family we go to the Walk of Fame as we are not “tourist”. But once we got there, everyone enjoyed a family activity that we had never done. We walked in front of the Mann’s Chinese Theatre to the end of the block, and back the other way in front of the El Capitan Theatre. A short walk, but we stopped in several shops and read almost all the Stars, taking multiple pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geeneou5
40,All your favourite stars line the pavement,Being from Australia I have wanted to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame for as long as I can remember & I wasn’t disappointed. There were heaps of people around & it did cost us $10 to park for 90 minutes but we got to see all our favourite stars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/482fionaj
30,"Quick walk, quick sightsee, you're done","If you've done it once, there's no need to go back. You walk up and down the strip, avoiding those who stop dead to try and work out who they may have just walked over. Sure, it's cool. But the celebrity is not standing besides the stars waiting to take a selfie with you. And the tourists! Then the people who dress up and coerce you to have (and then pay) for photos with them. Do it once to say you've been there. Then go and spend your time more wisely elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jemkh
10,Not recommended,"Visited here today after arriving late afternoon. Went for a walk along hollywood blvd. It was awful. Dirty run down shops. People pestering us to buy things or use their services. We just wanted to see the stars and get some food. Didnt see most stars as it was busy and there wasnt anywhere really nice to eat.

20,Don't bother,This is one of those that you do because you're here but it's dirty and full of street scum trying to sell their trinkets. Don't waste too much time here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikeoT7667LA
40,Lots of stars to see,It’s fun to walk down this long stretch and see all the different stars/celebrities. In many stretches it is very well maintained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mag275
30,Yeah NO,Sketch area - 30 minutes is enough to snap a few pictures. Be aware of those dressed up as characters- they will want to be paid for any photographs of them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimkZ9035YF
30,It is ok,"I have thought the hollywood Walk fame was more beautiful. At sidewalk there are stars , many homeless, stories and people wearing heroes clothes. My advice, you mustn't take pictures for them because these guys charge money for this. Anyway, this tour is mandatory when you visit Holywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrunoAntonioli
20,Nostalgic walk along a run down crummy place,"This experience is a one and done! I plan to never return. It was trashy and dirty. It’s a tourist trap!!! The only positive thing was to say that I’ve been there. The businesses around the walk have both old trashy to very nice and fancy. My family of 4 walked away saying we’d never come back. My 15 year old, who was excitedly come here, walked away jaded and disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mkdkay
40,Must-do experience,We kind of expected what it would be like at Hollywood Blvd. Parking was ok. We parked at the Highland centre underground parking. You come up through Dolby Theatre.This bit of Walk of Fame is just full of people who also want to see what Hollywood is like.It is very touristy. All the shops are selling made in China souvenirs. And be very careful with people who offering you photos and CDs. You might loss a lot of money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jason526
40,Worth to visit,"It’s one of those touristy thingys what everyone does, but worth popping by to see it. It’s not the same on the pics, you need to experience it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rapeli
50,A Hollywood Must,It’s hard to ever imagine Hollywood Blvd as ever having been glamorous when you see it now but the Walk of Fame is a must see. It’s like a treasure hunt to look for your favorites and you discover some new ones along the way. A must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roslyn28wantagh
20,Not impressed. Not like on TV. Dirty,"We were excited to see the walk of fame having never been to LA before so we were going to do all the hollywood touristy stuff. As we were driving down the boulevard, we started seeing the stars on the sidewalk. The area is dirty and a little sketchy looking until you get deeper into the area. We were not even impressed enough to park and get out of the car to take the walk and read the stars names.... Disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyaB906
30,Saw Induction Ceremony,We lucked out. The only day we were going Tracy Morgan was getting a star. The ceremony was about 30 mins. He was pretty funny as well as emotional. Tons of media. It was funny because people who live and work nearby take it all in stride while us tourists are excited by this.Other than that you can walk around and check out the other 2600 stars but it's hard to do that while looking at all the neat older buildings built years ago. Like the Pantages Theatre. Really neat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ned14
10,Two thumbs down,"One of the main things you would associate LA with (as a tourist) is the walk of fame which we were quite excited to see. Honestly, it was incredibly underwhelming. We didn't even realize we had arrived and were walking on the stars till 10 minutes into our walk, Was a bit disappointed with vibe as well and found the area a bit dull, I guess I expected it to be more buzzing and upbeat. Visit the area only if you are in LA for a while and have plenty of time to spare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fehminaa2015
30,Underwhelming,I was so looking forward to experiencing the Walk of Fame but was pretty disappointed with the outcome. We hopped off the Metro at around 9am and the streets very relatively quiet. The stars were quite dirty and the walk seems to go on forever. As time continued the streets became busier and busier. There are lots of homeless people and MANY people doing what they can to make money. It is quite overwhelming and with all the people it makes it harder to see the stars. I wish I had known before going about the App that tells you where certain stars are located along the Boulevard. Overall I'm glad i've ticked it off my list but wouldn't bother going back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/retucker18
30,Cool to see,It is cool to see and it is free to check out but it is a little unimpressive. The area is fairly crowded and just packed with tourist shops,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaptainCookieDaddy
40,Free to walk down Hollywood Blvd but...,"the streets are not like they are in the movies. Very dirty, many homeless people, and crowded at times. You do get to see the stars names, and see other local attractions on the blvd, but don't expect it to be clean and shiny like when an event takes place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lhf2016
40,Cool visit if you’re nearby !,"It was really cool to finally see the walk of fame! But don’t come if you’re pressed for time. It’s very cool but I wouldn’t say it’s a must see! Also come during the day, it becomes slightly sketchy at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilsonLin
20,Only place I have been pick pocketed - and by a child's character,Only place I have been pick pocketed - and by a child's character. I absolutely hated the seediness and the fact that the young children loved the characters who are professional pickpockets and awful and rude and I hope they get thrown in jail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamytravelsforlife
10,Way below expectations.,"I would recommend nobody to visit this place. It is an absolute toilet and not what you would expect at all. It’s seedy, run down with a threat of violence hanging in the air from the endless supply of street hawkers who pester the life out of you. Find your favorite celebrity’s star, take a picture and leave is my advice, if you can do it without leaving the car then all the better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boomhauer35
10,"Very Dirty, Pushy Vendors","We parked in a parkade at Hollywood and Highland, expensive and cash only, tight parking spaces. We walked out near the entrance of Madame Toussads. Pushy people shoving their personal cd's in our faces, pushy vendors. The Stars in the sidewalk, were dirty and difficult to see with everyone walking. A lot of pick pocketers bumping into you - be careful! Not much to see. We did enjoy Madame Toussads which is a great celebrity wax museum. That was very fun. We tried walking a block each way, but dirty souvenir shops and we were very uncomfortable. Didn't stay long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandi8697
40,Cool Place,"I really like to walk in the walkfame specially at night it was beaufitul and the atmosphere was cool, too many lights and beautiful places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eubs
50,ONE STOP SHOP!!,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is more than just seeing the best entertainers honored. The area is busy with tourists. There are awesome stores like Zara and one of the largest Foot Lockers ever! You can visit places like the Dolby Theater (think Oscars) and Grauman’s Chinese Theater all in one spot. You can also catch tours here and get Ghirardelli chocolate. The Hollywood WALK is the perfect ONE STOP SHOP!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miercolesb
10,Watch out for the hawkers!,Very full on tourist area. Too commercial. Hawkers pushing their goods and forcing themselves on to you. Costume people looking for $ for photo op. Walk of stars a little underwhelming. Hand/foot prints at the Chinese theatre pretty cool. Overall felt dirty. Not what was expected.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimC965
30,"Interesting, but let's face it. They're just paving slabs","We walked the entire walk of fame, apart from one bit that is behind some panels, making it impossible to see what was there. Beware the touts trying to sell tours to look at the hedges and gates of allegedly famous people. There's hundreds of them and they can get a bit aggressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8569FDrichardh
30,NIce To See Famous Stars,It was fun to look at certain stars & their stars (get it? lol)...it also made me learn about people I didn't know and what they did to earn these stars. What wasn't fun was seeing the absolute nonsense in some of the areas...at one point I realize this was not a nice part of LA...isn't this supposed to be Hollywood?!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Action_Jackson2
30,Not worth visiting,A tourist trap and really nothing worth checking out. It is a block a way from an In-N-Out on Sunset? ^^,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pickledorigins
30,I just don't get it.,Kinda glad that Springsteen refuses to have his name here ... what is the point? Nice to see but would not be a priority of mine while in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maura-Irish
20,Not for small children,It smells like piss and so many Homeless everywhere. The stench of cannabis is unavoidable. Do to my personal experience I wouldn’t take small children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rocion415
30,Not impressive,When i decide to visit Los Angeles I put in my mind that the Dolby theatre and the stars of the Walk of fames is something impressive and class (VIP) but the reality is not as this lots of garbage and bad peoples wearing a Spider-Man suite or Batman push you to get to get picture with hem and insult you,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daly3d
50,Excellent,The Hollywood walk of fame was just as expected and was spectacular and was very clean and sparkle. I visited Dolby Theatre at same time!! The only downside was that you had people trying to con you out of money on the street catching out tourists by selling rubbish CDs and taking pictures for $20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthew122777
40,What a buzz,We hit the streets early after a long haul flight and wow were not disappointed. A bit overwhelmed at 1st by the tour operators and superhero wannabees trying to sell us their goods but soon learned how to dodge them. Went back in the afternoon and with the sun setting it was a party atmosphere with the crowds and street performers. Really got us into the holiday spirit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannt745
50,Walk around and find your favorite star's star,The Hollywood Walk of Fame goes for blocks and blocks. You can get maps but I enjoy just walking the streets and seeing who's star I find. Plus you can browse all the shops along the Blvd. Take a stroll !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WizardToby
30,Not what I expected,"You think of the walk of fame as where the glitz and glamour, not so. It is pretty dirty the stars are dirty and some smashed or cracked. It's sad that a tourist attraction such as this is not better cared for. There are a lot of homeless many displaying quite erratic behaviours! People thrusting cd.s into your hand then demanding money for it. Lots of souvenir shops all selling the same stuff!! Madame Tussaurds and the Chinese Theatre are not too far from the central point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngieD267
50,Loved it,Had heard good and bad before our visit and the homeless and beggars didn’t put us off this wonderful experience. Just by chance Wonder Woman was on the strip the day we were unveiling her star which was great. You don’t realize how huge this place is and my step meter literally blew up the day we did the strip.Very much suggest anyone to visit..... there was also the most amazing chicken shop with lemon pepper chicken.... trying to remember it’s name!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/378karlr
40,Iconic,"My husband I enjoyed the walk. As other's have said there are A lot of homeless, litter and street performers trying to get money. But honestly a lot of cities have that in touristy areas. Just use street smarts and you'll be fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittneyLikeSpears
40,Star Studded Walk,Although not in the best neighbourhood in the world this is a MUST DO.The walk of fame is infamous and it is so fun running people and down the boulevard finding all your favourites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DwayneC1980
50,Hollywood,I live in Southern California so I have to admit it’s been really cleaned up in Hollywood. It used to be so dirty. Always lots to see and tourists. I took my visitor there. We even took a Hollywood tour it was fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanj622
20,Very dangerous place,The neighborhood is really dangerous and dirty. It really isn’t worth the visit. After walking a few blocks we realized some guys were following us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/60foodandtravel
40,It’s long but worth it,After a lot of walking you realise it’s a bloody long walk of fame. I recommend going early morning a lot less foot traffic. Google helps out with the locations of the stars you want to see so a little planning can help too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/834shaned
30,Stinks,Visited on the 9/04/2018. Not what i expected at all. The stench of urine from the poor homless sleeping in door ways. Litter all over the place and the stench of weed from people smoking all along the walk of fame as weed is now legalised. I would go early morning for best pictures as afternoon is busy. Would i visit again. No,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wheatman228
30,Free activity,"We did this walk in about 30 minutes, parked the car really easily near the walk. It’s free and a little underwhelming as it’s just a street with stars on the floor and shops/restaurants along the road however, it’s a free activity. There are no hand prints on the stars just names of various stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikkif900
30,Ok for a general visit - bit overrated,Ok for a general visit - bit overrated. The pavements weren’t very clean and noise from traffic can be excessive. Worth a flying visit if you’re in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255pareshp
30,Hype vs truth,"Dont expect much, It's just a street with the names of stars on the walkways. I would recommend a walk around only if you're visiting for some purpose or have to cross the area to reach somewhere. There's a Dome theatre around if you would like to catch a movie and quite a few good restaurants offering variety of cusines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/767abhishekd
30,Not at all what I expected,"Honestly, quite disappointing... yes both sides of the boulevard have the stars named after Hollywood stars.... and that’s about it... quite dirty and grungy... they spot a tourist a mile away walking with their nose down reading the names on the dates and accost you with the sight seeing tour... I guess it’s old stomping grounds of night entertainers for hire as most of the shops still cater to that type of customers :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xoxosyl
50,A true icon,Another bucket list item for us. Was a real pleasure to stroll the boulevarde identifying some of our favourite stars.Unpleasant weather cut our trip short but I'm so pleased we were able to visit this iconic location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/685mickl
50,Wow,It's impressive the number of stars you can find! It's fun too and you can make it one of your own (for $10)!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexandreN994
50,Road to Hollywood!,"We've been going to California almost every year, spring break or summer vacation, we love Hollywood especially the Road to Hollywood, it's a tourist attraction and fun to walk along the road with all the stars,love the place and it's like 24/7 you're always on the go when you are in California. We are coming back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellenrobin2000
50,A Must See!,"The Walk of Fame was on our family bucket list! If you go to L.A., you have to see it! Our family walked Hollywood Blvd. from one side to another all the way past Vine Street. It was a long walk, but worth it if you want to see your favorite star's star. There are Walk of Fame apps you can get that show you were the stars are located.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amwest3
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame a Winner !,Seeing the history of Artists that received Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is a real flash to the past. Just be careful not to bump into people or let them bump into you while strolling. I suggest walking the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the daytime or early evening with friends while it's still light outside. Start your walk anywhere near Hollywood and Vine Street and branch outward :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevemiller007
30,Nothing much,"Nothing much to do in this place, but it’s nice to see it once.Stars on the floor with famous people names. Some shops and restaurant on the street sides.Many parking near by and it’s not expensive (1.5$ per H).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imohddashti
50,fantastic,"For me living here years ago, its fun and excellent way to people watch. You have so much going on around you. Street vendors, side show acts, from the beat of 5 gallon bucket's, to the human, contortionist who puts on a show of remarkable talent one couldn't see anywhere else's.. But the Los Angeles Hollywood entertainment capital of the world. I know you'll have as much fun as I did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryr50
10,A stroll,We thought the walk was over rated. Hecklers trying to sell us their services and products was also unhelpful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterhF3075SY
30,"Kitschy, but rundown","Many visitors don’t realize that Hollywood really isn’t a glamorous area of Los Angeles. Hollywood Blvd, where the Walk of Fame is located, is littered with bordered up former businesses, cheap souvenir shops, garbage, and is not the type of place you’d want to be walking around alone at night. The Walk of Fame is fun to see, but many of the stars are cracked, faded, or vandalized. If you know which stars you’d like to see, you can find out where they’re located online ahead of time. Stop in the Hollywood Roosevelt for a drink at the beautiful lobby bar, or duck into one of the historic theatres (El Capitan, Chinese, Egyptian, or Pantages) for a tour or just to admire the amazing architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gooseboy54481
50,A really cool must-see place to visit with plenty of surprises,"I had to come here on my first night in LA.I saw so many stars' stars, so much more amazing in real life & up close.Lots of shops & other attractions along the walk if fame, it could take you ages to walk down the whole road.If you're looking for a specific star it's best to find out where it's located instead of taking chance as it could take you ages to find but it's worth the adventure...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krisbyman
50,Tourist things,I've been to LA twice now and I have yo say this is a must if your visiting for the first time. It's great to see how Hollywood have preserved their history and given credit to people that have been instrumental in the business.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gilshitravels
30,Dirty,There are a lot of homeless people and the stars are dirty. The pictures don't come out well because of the filth built up on the stars. There is a lot to do and see in the area however. At stop one for the hop on hop off bus walk to the top of the stairs level 4 and you will get a great view of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1683DMdavidh
50,Morning is the best time,the easiest way to have to find the stars is to walk in the morning before 12 o'clock is the perfect time to walk with tranquility,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmimontes
30,It's ok.,"I spend my whole time looking down on the pavements searching for my favorite actor/actress names. After a while, my neck hurts. people tend to stop in the middle of the sidewalk trying to take pics which is very dangerous. Some of the area smell of urine. I personally don't think it's a big deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AsiatripWQB
40,Worth a visit,We recently visited on our short stay. In la great place to find your fav actor / name immortalized in the walkway also visit the Chinese theatre along the road to see signed slabs again busy but worth a look interesting acts along the way buskers and touts for the tours glad we booked ours onAdvance,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosewarr1106
30,Just ok,"With much of the hype & glam around this place, one would expect more once you really are there. But it’s really just a sidewalk pavement with the stars’ names on it.It’s best just to enjoy the sights and shops around the area then try to spot your favorite stars as you walk by. And just for that, I wouldn’t recommend going here just for this. There is much more to see in this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mike321ph
30,Quick trip,Hollywood walk of fame is a complete tourist trap. It is cool to see some things in Hollywood but the hype doesn't live up to what it is. Watch out for street peddlers that sucker you into buying a DVD or music CD that you don't need. I would only recommend spending 3 hours max unless you want a Hollywood tour of homes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/electrical_steve
50,Hollywood a great place to visit!,"My daughter and I really enjoyed our time on the walk of fame, it's always a fabulous place to go, great food and alot of variety, and it's fun seeing all the names on the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariaaM1781SV
30,Not Worth Seeing,"Unless you enjoy people hawking there ""Hollywood Tours"" every 10 feet. I mean these people are ridiculously offensive. Throw in the fact that Daffy Duck and Roseann have stars.......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CanadianWraith
40,Fun place to walk around,"Yes its a touristy thing, and unless youre really into show biz, you might not recognize every name, but almost everyone, including kids, will probably recognize a good number of names. I parked at this garage on La Brea ave (at intersection of North La Brea ave and Hawthorne Ave) and it was a good spot to then walk up to Hollywood Blvd and start walking around. Note that it can be crowded and various street performers, vendors, and such may be there, so keep an eye on small kids if its crowded. In that sense, the atmosphere reminded me a bit of Times Square in NYC, but spread out over several blocks. If its your first visit to the area, Id consider it a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C2768TRmikek
30,Many stars to follow,"Nice boulevard to walk on, but honestly stars are only extra addition to it (being a movie fan, I could not recognize quite a lot of names). Very busy all day long, plenty of people around, it is not always easy to take a photo with a star of your choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_Nobody_1979
40,Good experience,This was my first time doing the walk of fame. It’s what you would expect... very crowded but worth walking around searching for your favorite stars ⭐️,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trail568339
50,Saturday night stroll,"Super cool to walk amongst the stars and see how many names we recognized. Very busy but if you are in L.A., this is a must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LorettaBoy
30,Overrated,It was fun for the first hour or two. Once the hustlers came out to “give out” their mix tapes or the character actors who came out for photos came out they ruined the experience. Overcrowded and little to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbarnes16
30,Impossible to miss. Go for the photo op!,"If you are in Hollywood then the walk of fame is impossible to miss and you shouldn't. It is iconic but also very dirty and somewhat sad because of all the homeless. That said, the homeless do not bother the tourist but the costume characters certainly do. Don't think you can take a photo with them and not throw them a few bucks because even if you aren't posing with them and you try to take their photo, they get very territorial. If you are looking for a certain star then look online beforehand. Otherwise just explore and wander around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baleeve
30,Go just to say you've gone,"We went with low expectations but just to mark it off of our list of things you have to see once while in LA. It was as grimy and as underwhelming as expected. We walked along the walk of fame and onto the Chinese Theater. On the way back to our car, was harassed by a mentally ill homeless person, so that was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJ-Reviewer-One-Day
50,One time visit is worth,"Just walk there once is far more than enough as there is nothing else to do there, you find the actress or actor you follow and that's all",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/781santit
50,Loved it!,"I really liked it, lots of atmosphere and people dressed up as famous actors...not to be missed! You have to tip the actors if you have your photo taken.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelled163
20,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to the Hollywood walk of fame and ended up very disappointed. It is dirty, shabby and very run down. Lots of people trying to sell things nearby. Car parks were a rip off- $20! We found a parking meter outside the car park for $2 an hour. There was lots of construction work with some scaffolding placed over the stars. A local person walked over the stars and spat on several of them- this summed up the area. Overall not what I expected and if I were famous I would prefer my star to be in Cannes walk of fame because that is much nicer and kept clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123Just1987
40,Fun to walk and people watch.,Enjoyed walking along and people watching. Nice way to soak up the LA culture. Lot of people and entertainers in the side walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arathik2018
30,“It was fine” teenage daughter,"We parked at highland and Hollywood. Walked out to the star walk and Chinese theater. Didn’t stay on the walk too long as it has a Vegas feel now- people in dirty character costumes wanting to take pictures with you and then ask for a “donation” - men trying to push their CDs, trying to get you to stop and then trying to guilt you into paying for the CD they put in your hand. I wish they would clean these practices up along the walk of fame- so many teenagers and families scammed by these two types of people. Lots of places to stop and buy tickets for tours. I do t mind these people because they are legit businesses with business licenses. I wanted to go back into highland to get away from these people. Park at highland and go buy a coffee or anything and get 2 hours for $2.00. You don’t need more than 2 hours to get the feel, see some stars, go in some shops and even to wax museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenledet
50,Wickedly Cool,"Written by Cameron (Age 14)My dad and I are on a weeks break to LA and in our 3 days have being here we have been to the walk of fame all three days! The stars go on for miles and are really cool. Michael Jackson, Ellen Degeneres, Robin Williams and many many more have stars here. Whilst there you can go to the Chinese Theatre and see some stars hand and foot prints which is really cool. I’d definitely recommend visiting it whilst in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/senorgaryb

There is so much to see.Victoria Secret is there too - for the ladies!American Eagle, and the Chinese Theater with the hand and foot prints of olden days.

40,"Great experience, but a little bit of a disappointment.","This was awesome to see at first glance. We walked as much of the strip as we could. Lots of shops, food, and sights. However, it was a bit of a disappointment. The street was very dirty, lots of homeless people sleeping on the side of the streets made for a sad visit. The fact that we glamorize the floor with celebrities' names and see so many homeless individuals with no place to sleep puts things into perspective. Hollywood seemed like a fake city. So much wealth, abundance, sex shops in every corner, and yet so much poverty. Sad reality for so many people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lsalcarr
20,Dirty and Smelled Like Urine,"Ok, so yes it’s the iconic “Walk of Fame” and yes you should go see it but be ready because it’s dirty like there is gum all over the sidewalk. It smelled like urine and there was a ton of homeless people and tourists everywhere. There were also these people kind of dressed up as famous actors trying to get you to take pictures with them for money. There is a mall right there you can park at pretty cheap if you buy a coffee or soda at the mall. That is where I would park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1specialkay

30,Not that glamorous walk of fame,"The Hollywood walk of fame is actually in a pretty downtrodden part of LA, we were there early in the morning on the day we arrived (to try to stave off jet lag). It was pretty deserted. We walked all the way from the east end to the Dolby theatre and it wasn't that exciting.There was someone being inducted with their own star, but the crowds we're so big I couldn't see who it was!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginamcbina12
50,We loved it,So much to see and do. There are 2500 stars on the sidewalk. It was great viewing thwm. Lots of vendors. We didn't think it was dirty like other reviews say. It's busy but a must see when visiting Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I5815VOkims
20,This street needs an urgent maintenance,"Stars are dirty, some are broken. Street itself is full of cheesy husslers, 1-5$ per item shops and the average restaurant is hooters. LA municipality needs to take some action:(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Airsealands
20,"Very disappointing, quite run down shops and area","The stars are great, but most of them dirty. Everything is way touristy, the shops and tour catchers are quite run down. The newer End with Madame Tussaud and the museum are all about getting your money, but at least it looked cleaner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viganiko
20,Just like in the movies,"Sorry to miss Wonderwoman doing her famed side plank, there seems to be no order for these stars. Last here in 1979 I don’t remember them being spread over such a large area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/56geraldinef
30,Most do if you are in LA,It is and open door show.You see all type of peopleIt is entertaining to look for stars of actors you admireI thought it was longer walk but I spent the correct amount of timeI also checked for the local street actors and musicians and finalized hearing themQuite something different to do if you want to break the rutine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ecalza2015
30,Nothing special,"It has to be seen because it is so famous, but its actual value and the location per se are nothing amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Penguin1982
30,It was ok..not what I expected,Visiting California so we wanted to do allThe touristy spots. Parking easy in a parking garage ($15). The shopping in the area was good. Nice mall nearby and of course souvenir shops. Not too busy in the morning but got much busier as the day went on. Area driving in a bit sketchy but the was ok. It’s a neat area to see but not what I expected.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3peepsocon
20,Walk of Fame low budget,We were really looking forward to the Walk of Fame in Hollywood. Seeing the stars that signified the excellence of the recipients on the ground amongst a low budget carnival atmosphere was disappointing. Not sure if I would want to have my star there if I was famous. Perhaps the elite should get together and start a new walk of fame in a better part of town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parkes3222018
40,Worth a visit,This is worth a visit! Be warned that many shady characters and strange religious groups are around-avoid them at all costs. This is simply walking down the sidewalk from block to block but it’s super fun to find the stars you like. Avoid at night or on weekends. If you take photos make sure another person is keeping eyes open to the surroundings. Fun times but be careful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinsGirls
40,Exciting!!!,"When you arrive here. You know for sure you're in Hollywood CA. Super busy and a lot going on, but you have to visit when you go to LA CA. I always enjoy going here. You have to stop by the $5.00 souvenir store. They have great stuff for $5.00",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/072107
30,Ok,"Yes you can see the stars names but don’t expect to see them on one street. Area it’s in is dirty and unkept. Surrounded by the smell of marijuana, tattoo parlors, cheap souvenirs, strip clubs, and people wanting your money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eyenurse2
20,Bike Tour,Thought it was rather ‘tatty’. Wasn’t what I was expecting at all but then I was not sure what to expect. More street sellers than you could shake a stick at trying to shove guff into your hands.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V1907CGdavidp
30,Not what I was expecting.,I was expecting to find a clean part of town but I was disappointed. The street was rather dirty and run down.Tons of touristy shops with tons of people trying to walk around. Rather crowded and a little difficult to maneuver an electric wheelchair through all the people on a Wednesday afternoon.We found parking in a garage about 1/2 block from the street which was convenient but it cost $20.00. We only parked for two hours so they make a killing on the parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H4265OCpamelam
40,Cool walk,Cool walk to do. lots of tour guides trying to sell you a tour. pretty dirty but seemed safe. lots of things going on at night and day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beebec2018
30,Stars and shady people,"It was cool to find people you recognise as you walk, but the never-ending shady people trying to sell you cheap merchandise. It's nothing like the way they make it seem in the movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaellC5948MN
40,Holiday,"It was something that I had wanted to see whilst I was in LA. There was another of stars to look at but did not walk the whole stretch of the walk, only a section of it. There was a number of shops (particularly tourist shops selling all kinds of touristy things. All there is a number of people selling tickets for tours for Beverley Hills. Worthwhile picking up a tour from there, if one has not been book prior to going, but make sure not to always stop for the first one. There had been a market in one of the neighbouring streets going off from the main one selling food items and other things. It was reasonably busy in part of the walk so be prepared for crowds. Worthwhile to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinebU9253EF
30,Average,"It’s a must do for tourists as it is the Hollywood walk of fame but it is a little disappointing. We expected something more glamorous but it is what it is, stars on the ground.It’s quite big to walk around as it is 2600 stars but only new a handful of the names",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmaI305
30,Don't spend too much time,We had to see this famous place. It was ruined by the number of people hocking merchandise or services.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chestpain
20,Not what I expected!,Was good to see but the Hollywood area is very tacky and not what I had expected. Lots of shady characters walking around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pabloelmacho
30,Something to pass a bit of time.,I found the walks all very underwhelming. A lot of them are dirty and broken. It was a typical tourist place to go and can say that I’ve been. Would not go out of my way to see it again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GemsyLou89
10,Gross,"Visited for the afternoon as we were in LA before flying to Vegas and we had always wanted to see it. As soon as we left the subway station we regretted it - it was overcrowded, dirty, street performers were threatening people to hand over their cameras for photos.... what a disappointment!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kat13s
40,Crouded Sunday,I couldn't believe how crowded it was last Sunday in Hollywood. It was chilly out but the place was busy. The smells from the restaurants were fantastic. We had to take a Taxi to the LAX airport. It was quite a distance and it cost $50.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/339jeanetted
30,Tourist stop,"Obvious place to visit when in LA. It's in a complete random order, spread over a mile or so, so if you want to see a certain star, then be sure to search out its location first, unless you want to spend your time walking along Hollywood boulevard looking at the footpath and not where you are going, as it does get very busy obviously, looking at the path is not a great choice. We parked just south of the boulevard near Hollywood high school, reasonably priced parking. Worth a visit when in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarrenA296
40,Always something going on,Seems every time have been there is an area where you can't get too because of an event.Parking can be a problem or expensive but there are some areas where can park free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PATTIS64
30,Tourist trap,"The film stars, directors and film footsoldiers are long gone from hollywood. Left behind are the tourists from all over the world, seeking the remnants of ancient greatness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/798perr
40,Park at Hollywood and Highland,"Just pay the price to park at the H&H complex and make it your home base for a day. It’s open 24 hours and you can’t park overnight, but you can park all day (like 9am to 3am even...) So much easier and stress free.From there you can easily walk down the walk of fame starting at the Kodak theater and Grauman’s Chinese, down to the Egyptian theater, Musso and Franks, Wax Museum, Pantages, etc.You can also hop on a Starline Tour or the underground Red Line and get to Pershing Square in downtown LA in 15 mins from the Highland stop. Much easier than driving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLWD13
30,Hunting for stars in a sea of unknowns,Went here with my family. I expected crowds but not such rudeness and pandemonium. Glad we were able to find the few stars my kids wanted to see and then it was time to bolt out of there. Very dirty in all spots.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sakman73
30,Very crowded and overrun by tour companies,"It's cool to walk and see all of the famous names, but the peddling of tours and ""original"" music cds is very annoying. Maybe that's how the tourism board wants it but it seems that they could handle the vendors better and make the public experience more enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jefff727
40,Good to see,"I’ve always wanted to see the walk of fame.We walked the entire length, which goes from the popular section of Hollywood Blvd to a more dodgy area of the Blvd (for want of a better word).It was a very long walk (longer than I’d expected) and especially for our small children. Thankfully we had also taken the stroller (best thing ever)!!If you’re only wanting to see a few key favourites then download the map before you go. That way you wont end up walking the entire thing just trying to find your favs.There were a lot of people who we didn’t know (clearly before our time).Be aware of the impersonators - even just taking a photo from a distance warrants a tip. So do not expect getting a photo with them for free.For tourists, it’s great to see. Certainly depicts Hollywood as we see it on the tv.In the main area there are other attractions to see (Chinese theatre for example.. which we loved! And the kids loved putting their hands in everyone’s on the ground),But, would I do it again??? No - I’d drive it next time ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/May_J83
30,Tourist trap not worth your time,"Most Angelenos do not bother with the hassle of Hollywood Blvd. It has been a tourist trap for decades not and all the sense of grunge and danger which used to make visits to Hollyweird somewhat exciting have long been disneyfied away much like I understand has happened to 42nd St in NYC. Yes there are numerous stars on the walk of fame and the nearby crowded Chinese Theater with the hand and foot prints are a throwback to old Hollywood, however with the sheer glut of tourists, drunk hipsters, performers dressed like spiderman and that chick from Frozen who want $5.00 for a phone photo, and the wannabe rappers who are all pushing their home burned DVD for sale, I would just as soon not bother.If you have the constitution to deal with it, my best recommendation is to park at Hollywood and highland (quite expensive) or uber your way onto the boulevard. Mussos and Franks is worth your time but I wouldn't really vouch for much else there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2131POstevens
40,A must see but crowded,Of course you have to go and walk the street to see the stars. It was crowded in April and will get even more so over the summer. Lots of street vendors and people in costume.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KStaterinMO
40,"It’s a “need-to-see”, but rather overrated","We visit the walk of fame whenever we find ourselves in Hollywoodland. It’s definitely great to see the celebrities’ names in the stars, and to stumble on one that you didn’t realize made it on the walk of fame. Overall, it’s not something to spend an entire day doing-but it’s one of those things you need to say you saw.It’s gone downhill lately, with some of the areas being a little tougher than others. It’s a well-known tourist area, so naturally beware of tourist traps!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizzyMarie23
20,Dirty place,"I live in NOLA and the French quarter can get dirty, this place was a lot worse. If they took better care of the street it would be better. Between the homeless and street vendors we just drove by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/624brentn
10,Dirty!,Just a dirty street really....Ok so some famous people have a star there but it’s just so dirty - 35000 dollars to have a star there....and they don’t spend that on cleaning it?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Temp78
40,Certainly interesting,Great to see what you've seen on the TV looking for the names there is an app to follow them but at the tie I was there I found it frustrating to be honest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djbpool
30,Hide Your Wallet!!,"Hollywood Boulevard and the walk of fame can be great fun, there is so much to look at and so much to do! However, be prepared to be bombarded by seemingly endless crowds of entertainers offering ""Free"" photos, CDs and merchandise. These people expect to be tipped and are very forceful and demanding in their approach. It can be intimidating at times. My best advice would be to leave your cash out of your wallet.Besides the chaos you'll embark on your way out of the train station, Hollywood Boulevard has some great things to see, great shopping facilities and quick access to food!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AaronQuarrell
30,Vacation,It was cool for a minute but to is not with the wait in traffic. Everything was over priced expecially parking. Dirty and my young kids hated it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foxracejones
40,Why is it so dirty?,I was sad to see how gross and dirty the walk of fame is. It seems very neglected. It’s such a cool piece of history and fun to look at all of the names. I wish the city would make an effort to clean it up and make it better,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doublefront
30,Over rated,"This was a let down. It smelled of pee, hecklers everywhere trying to sell you tours and just dirty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angelique717
30,Worth an hour to see it,"We parked under the Dolby theater — it is only $2 if you validate in one of the shops in the building. That area is the most crowded part of the walk of fame so be prepared for a lot of people and a lot of noise. It is interesting to see famous names in the stars and it is an iconic part of the tourist experience. I’m glad we went, but an hour was enough time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMath5516
40,Essential visiting,"Must visit...bigger than I thought (thousands of stars!) - search the Internet if you want to find a specific one. Sidewalk dirty in places as there are so many. Remember the hand/footprints too, in the middle of the boulevard. We visited early in the morning which might be good as less busy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stonerose5
50,A must see when visiting LA,"The place is mostly crowded with street vendors hustling trying to sell you cd’s, T-shirt’s, or otherwise. Just ignore them and look for the star of your favorite entertainer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerWise
30,Fun to search,Fun to search for stars you know. Kids won’t know nearly as many as you will. Parking will cost you here. The walk is not just along one road. Be prepared to wander up and down a few roads to see everything. Shops are just so-so along these roads.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachcolorado
10,Disgusting,Dont bother it’s a sad and depressing thing to see. A lot of homeless and it smells like piss and it’s really dirty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/985irvingr
10,Disgusting and filthy!,The entire strip is filthy - we were so disappointed and certainly did not feel safe - don't start walking until you get to the centre of the strip as it is full of scary people trying to sell things and doped out of their eyeballs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanab696
10,Been there no need for the t shirt,"We went to Hollywood because we were driving through California and couldn't miss it. What a dirty cheap miserable excuse for an attraction. Overpriced, crowded and dirty just about sums it up.We walked along snapped a few pictures of some stars on the sidewalk and after a brief visit walked back to our car. Once inside we drove away. The lingering smell of urine still attached to the soles of our shoes. If there is a more disgusting disappointing sight to behold in California I am not sure what it can be. And yet the tour busses continue to flock to this site, and tourists continue with their selfies. My god what has become of the world?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dudley5817
30,Our Visit to the Hollywood Walk of Fame,"I have to be honest - it was not what I was expecting. Very dirty area with lots of homeless. The stars were nice, but I did not feel very safe and I am from Philadelphia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/558marisolo
50,Found the perfect star,We were just walking around checking out every single star when we found some one famous with the same name as my daughter.Lost of shops and tours departure from there.The Chinese theatre and El Capitan theater are a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelcT6463ZR
40,Crowded but fun,Closest thing to Times Squ. in NYC but terrific fun to read all the names and realize how many stars you know!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Psilber
30,"Had to see, but wont be going back","Let me say, I had to see it.At the time of our visit, they were setting up for the Oscars’ and some of the street was blocked off for construction purposes.Everyone wants to sell you something like a Hollywood star home tour. I was told that some of the houses don’t even have stars living in them.The people dressing in character costumes to entertain need to update their old costumes and yes, they do ask for cash if you have your photo taken with them on their request. Be warned.A quick visit to this area would be recommended if you have to see the iconic buildings, stars on the street etc, but we couldn’t get out of their quick enough. Very tacky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleymG9693GJ
40,So busy,"Expected it to be busy as I can imagine it would be all year round. Go and check it out, it’s worth it. Seeing all the older stars handprints was really nice. Weaving in and out of the foot traffic can get tricky but everyone seems to be pretty happy. Characters in dress ups so you can take photos. Shops and gifts stores all around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolemL13
40,A walk of many fames,"Great place to walk about and absorb the ambience of theatricals and street performers whilst seeing the stars of the superstars. Visit the Chinese theatre and get a peek at Micheal Jackson’s famous hand and feet imprints on the cement outside this location. Loud music, lights, classic cars, Batman & Superman impersonators, double jointed street performances, even rather worse wear versions of Mickey and Minnie mingle with beautiful Hollywood gems. Great vibe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roshinig2018
40,Busy busy day!,It sounded like walking some of the walk of fame would be fun but being in the middle of a beautiful day and spring break travelers made looking at it pretty hard. You could move with the crowd looking down but it wasn’t easy to take your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Haparker01
30,Weekend,Awesome! The walks were cool to see and experience. Looking for your favorite stars is a hunt on its own. It would be nice if there was a directory or guide to let tourists know where to find the stars of their choice. Could be a little more parking friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurafK7174WX
40,"Fun, but crowded","This historic place is a lot of fun. Extra crowded, so not good for little kids or older folks. It was fun to stand in the very spot many stars have!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/787jeniw
40,"Fun to see the ""stars""",So I visited the Hollywood Walk of Fame during a trip to Disneyland. We spent about an hour and half browsing along the Walk of Fame and it was fun to see all the famous names. I ate at the Subway however after we left I learned that there is a Hollywood In and Out burger just off the boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicamL8390WB
10,Walk,"Ok, were should I start. The parking prices was out of this world. The crowd is like ny city, alot of rushing and pushing on the sidewalks. It was very crowded and dirty. I really dont understand how the make this place out to be fabolous and it is no were near nice at all. It is the ghetto in like a 2 block radius out of there. I would not recommend this place as a place to visit. What you see on tv is not what it is in person. I was very disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninasexy256
10,Seedy,Full of drunks and drug addicts AVOID this place at all costs not worth battling with the traffic.parking too expensive and too far away,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ne233l
30,Meh,So crowded and people get really ticked off when you walk slow enough to read the names on the stars. And heaven forbid you stop to take a picture. It is fun to see but the barrage of homeless and street performers take a lot of space.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikam271
30,No so exciting!,"This place was not so exciting for me, though it's a very popular tourist visiting place. If you are interested to find someone's name embedded brass stars just go for it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maruf_Haque_Khan
30,Quick Scan Sufficent,"Hollywood Walk of Fames is famous, so needs to be there to experience. However, the area now becomes kind of messy, outdated, disordered, dirty, so you will be disappointed in someway. You will see homeless people and street people selling stuffs. A quick scan through the area is enough. Not recommending too much time spent there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/589jerryx
40,Fun to read names on the stars,Staying at the Hotel Roosevelt on Hollywood Blvd. just walk out the front hotel door and the stars all around on the ground. Fun to see who got a star and then see what they are famous for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeMahwah
30,No excited,Its shameI thought that this place would be nice and clean but....not enough open coffe shops. The souvenirs shops very average and cheap staff. I don't liked at allIts totally digfrrent what you see on TV.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aidaa971

30,Don’t go at night,"We made the mistake of goin after dark. The kids were scared to death lol. And since we didn’t know who’s names were where, we saw a lot of older names. Fine with me and my husband but the kids didn’t know any of them. So we left pretty quick with them being bored and scared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oktraveler76

30,A Must See if in LA,"This place is world famous so it’s fun to see at least once in your lifetime. However, this area of LA is so dirty and the streets are disgusting. You’d think they would employ street cleaners because millions of people visit this place every year and probably leave thinking the USA is a filthy place. Clean up the streets!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hhalvz95
40,Attraction,A LA thing to do. Tuff parking. It is difficult to find the stars of actors you know. It is too many and random.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrp555

30,See it so you can say you have. BEWARE: THE CD HAWKERS.,"Many people will be familiar with the famous Holywood Boulevard walk of fame. If you are in the area it is definitely something to see: it is interesting to spot famous names as you are walking. But to be honest, it is not spectacular. There are quite a few homeless people in the Eastern half of the walk, often mentally ill or with substance abuse problems. It is very sad to see, and quite poignant on a street associated with such glitz and glamour.In the busier areas you will be faced with 'CD hawkers'. I won't call them scammers as they aren't trying to scam you, just cajole you into giving them money for a CD. I chatted to them happily but firmly said I would not be able to give them any money and they gave me no hassle for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/df86

50,Bucket list,"I only wanted to see 2 stars - Michael Jackson and Bob Marley and I did. I also saw a street performer doing Michael Jackson impressions he was good.The night was cold but we walked approx. 5 blocks. Parking was ok - we used a nearby parking garage. I went with persons from the Carson area so they know their way around.I liked the hustle and bustle on the street - hot dog vendors, various artisans. It was St Patricks Day too so my guess is there was extra buzz on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimiKingston_Jamaica
30,Underwhelming,"Blink and you'll miss it. You won't even know you're on the famous Walk of Fame. Thereafter though, you can have a bit of fun looking out for names of your favorite stars, if you can avoid what is often a crush of people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petern834
30,Interesting & Disappointing,"I was super excited to go the Hollywood Walk of Fame. My excitement turn into somewhat disappointment after we arrived. Parking is a beast down there and the parking spaces are compact. A lot of the great stars are covered with vendors trying to sell things. You will encounter homeless people, hustlers, and etc. The infrastructure of the sidewalk is in bad condition in certain areas. This place is totally different in person versus what's on TV.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/352MD
10,Disapointing,"Waited to visit the walk of fame - all started well. Used Uber to get there all good. Arrived on Hollywood Boulevard to be confronted by drunks, druggies and the pavement covered in dirt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gareth1519
50,Awesome atmosphere,"What an incredible walk! So many names to see. Very busy at night with so many people dressed up in character. The stars appear on both sides of the road. I also recommend if you're looking for a particular name, check on the Walk of Fame - Star Finder website first to see if there's a star on Walk of Fame. It's a super long walk, 15 blocks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Urshy74
20,Once is enough,"Its a must if you are in LA, but really is nothing. Many many many stars, but nothing more. I mean that yes, you can find you stars' star, but then what? Many visitors around, many vivids trying to get money out of your pocket with photos, stories, tours, but really I did not get the feeling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juanv449
50,New to Hollywood,This place is alive . I was so impressed coming from NZ to visit this destination with my wife . If I had more time I would of spent the day here and some. Has definitely given me An objective to return . People are everywhere from all walks of life. It just buzzes with tourists. Driving around Hollywood in a charger and visiting this destination certainly was the best part of our USA trip .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Psarj
50,Why wouldn't you enjoy this?!,"Loved it, i would have loved to have seen every single star but so many. Streets very busy, a lot of people handing out leaflets for tours which are just a load of BS, they are usually untrue. Adults dressed up as characters make you pay for a photo so I avoided them. Loved it here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/francescabT8434FT
20,One and done,I was disappointed. We went on Sunday around 1 p.m. Its dirty and filth everywhere. We sat in McDonald's and ate and I felt as if I needed a shower. A homeless man was sitting in a chair with his shoe off picking at his toes. Homeless people were everywhere. Some sleeping rite on the streets. A lot of the stars looked cracked. This area has not been taken care of. Trash on the sidewalks .very disappointing .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anichols39
40,Stars!!,"Okay, expected glitz and glamour but it's rather ordinary. However, it's fun to spot your favourites there on the walk. Of course, there are lots of people trying to sell you various tours and goods, and you spend a lot of time dodging them. Plenty of shops selling souvenirs. McDonalds on the Boulevard was nothing special but okay for a quick cheap meal. I think it's safe enough in the day time but suspect after dark it's not the place to be. The kids were delighted to find Disney character's names there but too many stars to see them all. Maps of celebrity homes and a comprehensive list of stars are available to buy at around ten dollars. Plenty of parking available too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P4092DEemmac
20,Tourist trap,This is the biggest disappoint for any out of towner coming to LA expecting a beautiful Hollywood Walk of Fame and it turns out to be a Walk of Shame. Careful stepping over the pee and the homeless as you look for an overpriced under cooked pizza for your kids. Go to Rodeo Dr for a better experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joinourvidaloca
30,It's fun - maybe,Interesting. Trumps star appeared to be the most viewed and people were standing around making negative comments. This tourist spot isn't all that interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jschaf
50,Always a good time on Hollywood Blvd!,This is a must for anybody visiting the LA area. Lots of interesting memorabilia and people for sure! It is a mix of movie stars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/007vjc
40,Made in China Everywhere!,"It should be starry place with Hollywood stars everywhere, but it's not. It's only their star sign you can see. Hollywood stars do come here on special occasion but they are more likely seen in Sunset Strip and Beverly Hills. Hollywood has now become like a dirty Chinatown where everything you see is made in China.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JedRevolutia
20,Overrated,"It's fun to see, don't get me wrong. But it's just overrated. And once you get away from the chinese theatre you get to see some weird folks (but that's LA in general).Do you have to see it? Yes. Just don't spend there more than 15-20 minutes, because it gets boring and you just get upset of the amount of people there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larsv165
30,Fun to see the stars...just watch for freaks,"We had fun strolling along Hollywood Boulevard seeing stars... but with the growing number of freaks posing as characters and wanting you to take a photo with them (seriously) and pay them...it’s kind of creepy. We went during the day, can’t imagine it at night. It is fun to see just be careful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/456jeffn
20,Probably not worth a visit,"Pluses1) It’s a famous landmark which recognizes several entertainment starsMinuses1) Dirty, seedy part of town",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaqibQ
30,You really have to be a fan,"Kind of cool but gets reddundant really soon and as you walk and get further away from the main area, it get a little dodgy...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chagallvoyage
30,Only there to cross of the list...,"Is probably not what most people would expect. However, if you have time and are in LA, gotta go there and take a picture.There’s limited parking all around and pretty expensive since you’ll be there for only 30-60 minutes (unless you go to Tussaud’s).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/785agustind
30,If your near by worth a stop,"Good to visit to say you been there. You could walk for miles, make sure you watch where you are going and keep your stuff safe. We walked for a small bit and found a few names we recognized. It was fun to say we visited all the stuff near by including Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Breanne07
40,We really enjoyed seeing our favorite stars on the Walk of Fame,"Many people have criticized this area. We loved it. There are simply too many stars to see in one trip. The stars are dedicated to film stars (including stars such as Godzilla), producers, writers, musicians, etc. Yes, this area is crowded and very popular. Yes, there are some panhandlers and street musicians, yes, there is some trash here and there. But, hey, it is CA, what did you expect. I posted a few pictures of just a few of the famous people on this walk. Definitely worth your time.Tips: use Google Maps to find public parking garage, street parking very limited and full while we were there. Walking shoes and camera are a must. Plenty of other attractions in the area, so you can spend full day in this area without having to move car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCbikerman
40,"Not what you might expect, but it's part of the LA experience","Usually i try to make a general review and in order to do that i try to observe things or ask questions around. This time i will only tell you my subjective and one time experience.First of all, we have a friend that lives in LA and she told us that she will show us other things in LA that she finds more interesting :) and that we should go there alone because she understand that we cannot come in LA and not visit Walk of Fame, but she gave us a fair warning .The parking space that the NeverLost from Hertz took us was 20$ a day. We only stayed there 2-3 hours and of course we paid 20 $ :) I heared that are cheaper parking lots but i do not know where.We were there a couple of days before The Oscars, the preparations were allready in progres. The street was full of tourists and it was a chalenge to look at, or photo the stars, so at one point i gave up and just walk with the flow.I enjoyed more the foot and hand prints in front of the Chinease Theatre.I look back right now and actually start to understand that the street is alive. Maybe we all expect to go there and see things like in a museum, but the area is just a part of the LA, is a regular, busy street, with her own spirit and a hell of a story. :)Yes is crowded and dirty but you can't miss it :)Tip: magnets and souvenirs are a bit cheaper at the small store right in front of the Chinese Theatre that the big one down the boulevard( but there of course you have thousands of products)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mihaelan2013
30,Not sure,"I love the walk of fame for what it is, it's always kept clean and has a good atmosphere. However, the amount of homeless people and people demanding money is rediculous; made us feel nervous and unwelcomed and felt like we had to rush through it rather than enjoy it to the extent we wanted to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/729bethe
50,Walking the Walk,"There’s a lot to see if you’re interested in the stars who have a space on the walk. Some are in better shape than others and depending on the time of day there are some characters out there. As always, be aware of your surroundings and have a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johno751
40,Not what I expected Lol,"So I thought it was a whole proper strip with the stars- didn’t realize the stars were all over the roads on downtown LA. Lol! After a while, the glamour faded and was just walking on pavement. Still fun to see names you recognize! Not sure if the level of fame is connected to where the star of the celebrity is or if Random! The famous ones seems to be nearer the Chinese theater and around that area. Lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaSan85
20,Hmmm,"With the glitz and glamour level of expectation set from what you see on tv, the fact that the Chinese Theater and Dolby and El Capitan are just right there ... it is actually quite surprising to see that it is no different with any walking street in down town.Not mentioning that some parts are quite dirty and dodgy. Lots of people taking weed in public walking around and lots of homeless people on the area.Would strongly suggest to go during day time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanara
30,Shiny and expensive Paving Slabs,"As for much of the rest of LA, it's not as impressive in real life. This is a sidewalk / pavement with some shiny and expensive ($30k) paving slabs laid down. There's also the usual range of rip-off merchants and people in costumes trying to get money off you to take a picture of a paving slab (you can do this for free) with them in it (not for free). If you're already in the vicinity, come and see it, take a picture (for free), tell the hawkers to get lost and then be on your way. Try not to look visibly disappointed, it un-American.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillyFogger
30,Do some research,"Hollywood is great, but it's not as glam as you expect it to be. It's dirty.Don't worry, it's not THAT bad as well. If you're really up for the stars names on the floor, good, but I would say, google some more local things to do. Also, you do need a car to get around or UBER/LYFT you could also use the metro if you're up for it ( it does kill traffic ) - There's a lot of traffic in LA in general, so do know that in advance. There's some gift shops and restaurant, you can also go see a movie or shop. There is ALSO near the regal theater, a REALLYYYY dope music store with Vinyls and CDS and walkman players and all that stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferlynnc2016
30,Part of Hollywood experience,"We saw this last year with our kids while we walked Hollywood Blvd and went through several of the museums, and then this year stayed a block away during Oscar weekend. The boulevard is definitely dirty and full of homeless people, other tourists, etc. but it is interesting to see who has a star (lots of people I've never heard of) and walk past the well known ones. Best time is probably very early in the morning before the crowds get there so you can actually see the sidewalk and stop to take a picture without impeding the flow of pedestrians. I wouldn't come specifically to see this by itself, but it's free and there are lots of museums, the tour buses, and shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mel65B
30,it's not average but,it's not average but the interest is detracted by filth of every kind decay and decadence. besides that there is homeless and nut jobs everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhodie
50,Always action on Hollywood Blvd,There is so much to see and do on Hollywood Blvd. it is fun to find stars on the walkway for celebrities you remember from the past and those you like currently. Then there are two wax museums to see figurines of your favorite stars. O found it interesting to see how y’all or small some stars are vs what I had imagined them to be. You also have the Riply’s Believe it or Not and other place. Good shopping stores. And several really amazing movie theaters. Lots of performers in costume. I love the grilled kraut dogs sold by street venders on the sidewalk. Great place for the entire family for the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Socalchat
20,Disappointing experience,My wife and I drove to the walk of fame at night. Parking is hard to find. Most of the strip look dark and sketchy. There are some comedy clubs and a few bars. The only highlight was we got to watch an actual filming set as they blocked the road to do that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerryh3890
40,It is great to see the names but,"It is classic Hollywood. You have to see it, but to me, the handprints at Chinese Theatre are much more impressive. I think if there is a star you really need, look up where it is instead of doing the whole walk. Expect homeless people and crowds on the walk of fame during the day. People selling photos will bother you too. It is better at night, but then shady people (sex workers) are there. You are visiting L.A. so you go, but don’t expect glamour. It is fun to see the names though. If you wonder how certain not as famous people got there - they met the minimum requirements and paid for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carwash182
30,Like it but not love it,It’s a historical place and it’s good to see it. Apparently is very crowded. Prefer to visit it at night because of the lights and atmosphere. During the day is very boring and not so charming. Be careful with all strangers that will put something in your hands. They will always try to get some money from you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiryanaY_12
30,"Walk of Fame is a must, but shows dirty sad state of Hollywood currently","Love Hollywood, you gotta go see this but it is dirty, homeless everywhere, just not a nice area. Neat to see people you know in the walk but other then that just okay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whoshavedmycat
30,"Must do, but move on","The Walk of Fame is one of the 'must do' parts of LA for any tourist. It's moderately fun searching for a hero to take a picture of their star, but you will be playing 'avoid the stop and click' game and getting frustrated before you know it. Be aware of walking at night and watch out for the street hawkers and 'characters' who are enjoying themselves little bit too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geetarchurchy
20,Don't Expect Much,"The only thing worth seeing if you come here is Grauman's Chinese Theater, now called TLC Chinese Theaters, after being called several other names over the years. It is fun to see the footprints and handprints of the stars of yesteryear (if you are under forty you won't know who any of them are), and to see the old Hollywood photos and read about old Hollywood. So if that interests you and you are old enough to remember, or want to show it to your kids, great. If not, stay away. ""Hollywood and Vine"" was the Hollywood myth everyone dreamed about, but it's more an idea than a reality. It's simply a traffic clogged street corner. Hollywood Blvd is littered with T Shirt stores and cheap souvenirs, and littered with litter. The Hollywood Walk of Fame covers many many blocks along and all around Hollywood Blvd, and looking for your favorite, more current stars, can be fun. What makes the whole thing difficult are the way too aggressive street panhandlers dressed in costume; superman, batman, superheroes, popular movie and tv characters. They are aggressive street hustlers and do not take ""no"" for an answer. If you take a photo with them they will demand much more than you thought it would be. There are scam artists selling blank or pirated low quality CDs, panhandlers, and it's all very crowded and tight so it's hard to break out of the crowds of people, or even walk by. Stand your ground, don't let anyone extort money from you, and if you want a picture with someone in costume, settle on a set price beforehand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eboosler
30,Not as glamorous as it once was,Okay for first time visitors that may feel that this is a must see. All sorts of diversity in street acts in various acceptable ways of expecting tips. Don’t be fooled. That is NOT a Disney sanctioned Mickey and Minnie and the overweight Spider-Man never starred in the movie. Hollywood stars of all generations. Glad to see it but California has more beautiful sites to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/954marymargaretk
50,Class!!,I came from Ireland to see the famous wall of fame and it didn’t disappoint. There was so much to see and I even went on a tour of movie stars homes! Was great! And I really enjoyed it! Our tour guide was so good!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caitiek2018
40,More fun than expected!,"I had low expectations for this attraction being generally skeptical of large tourist attractions in general. However, my daughters and I actually had a good time (even in the rain) spotting stars and taking pictures next to ones we recognized. We only walked maybe six blocks, just enough to get a taste. Sure, it's crowded. Sure, there are people hawking tours and goods on every street corner. But it's a really fun trip down memory lane and interesting to see how many stars you actually recognize----even for people who aren't that into the Hollywood scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferH456
30,Not that good to be honest,Personally thinks this place is overrated. The entire sidewalk took us around 30 minutes plus gift shops around 1 hour. If you are not doing tours or going into the theatre this place can definitely be skipped.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/301ling
30,Just a landmark,"If you visit LA, you must go to Hollywood Walk of Fame. Don’t expect much, it’s just a landmark. Downtown Hollywood is ran down, I was expecting more. We were on guard and didn’t feel safe. A lot of businesses have closed down and you see people sleeping on the sidewalks. It’s sad to see this! As a woman, I’m glad I had someone else with me, I wouldn’t go by myself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judithc951
30,Mostly crappy toursim,A lot of the businesses surrounding the stars are crap...peddlers of utter junk. I write this sincerely. Bypass whatever is being sold and enjoy the free scenery. Just don't place high expectations on the location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roadkillz
40,Nice walk,It was nice to walk down the walk of fame and see some of our favs and greats ! Touristry place and a must see if you are big time into hollywood films,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LathaRajagoapalan
30,Over rated,"This is something you need to do at least once in your lifetime to tick off your bucket list but probably wouldn’t need to come back again. It’s great to see the famous stars and learn the history of old Hollywood but the amount of people pestering you for money is unbelievable. Street is dirty, smells like urine and marijuana and full of homeless people- not the glamorous Hollywood you would imagine it to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephanie1992s
20,Not what I expected,"I expected this place to be very fancy, but it was covered in dirt and there were a lot of homeless people. Be careful - there are people who try to sell you different products. They can be very agressive. The street is also very crowded. I felt like it was a waste of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandradR5718XZ
40,Nice stroll,"When we had down time, we would walk through the stars. It was fun to see some of the greats. If you roll with the flow, you'll be fine. If you're uptight, the locals might bother you. It's a tourist area in a big city so yes, you'll have all that that includes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marilyn1962_99
30,Overhyped,There is nothing except names of Hollywood stars written on the floor... definitely expected much more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/958amitb
50,Mr.,"Last thing we did before leaving. We saw Lionel Richie today talk before putting his hands and feet in the cement in front of the Chinese Theatre. It was exciting. We only walked about 2 blocks and took about 50 pictures. Old stars, long gone and a lot of younger. If you have the time, this is a free walking tour. Go and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lloydn603
40,"A must-do, bucket list experience.","My kids are 12 and 16. Didn't think they would get much of a kick out of a visit to Hollywood Blvd and the Walk of Fame, but we all loved it. It was fun just walking along and searching for the stars of our favourite celebrities. We found Michael Jackson, Robin Williams and even ones we didn't expect, like Shrek! It was surreal and exciting. I would recommend it. So much history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O3898CCcherylb
30,Its something to see,"Its a pretty neat experience . They have live music playing, and vendors on the street. Plenty of restaurants to choose from. Just be cautious of your surroundings at night. Plenty of homeless people that live on the street and in doorways. I would say that if you have never gone to Hollywood you should expedience it once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackplate2003
40,"Stars,Stars,and more Stars.","I have lived in California my entire life, and never actually ""Star"" hunted before. my goal was to see Marilyn Monroe star (In Front of McDonald...I know right). Crazy part is ive walked over it several times, in the past. Looking at all the stars, was super fun. Felt like a tourist in my own state, which I thought was adorable. Some homeless but they are very nice (I am Homeless friendly), Some weird folks but that's Hollywood for You. great for cheap/free entertainment, seeing how LA is uber expensive. Tons of cheap gift shops, and fast food. Not a lot of authentic stuff, very generic but overall fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lethiah
30,See the stars,"Hollywood Blvd was smaller than I thought it would be. Not overly crowded when we were there (Saturday morning), but still a few people trying to scam you out of your money by giving you something then demanding payment for it.Find a few stars that you admire, take a picture and you're done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karencX5901KK
50,A one of kind experience,After living in LA for long time we still haven't been to walk of fame . But because my husband insisted we went there on Saturday evening around 6 pm the atmosphere there was very lively lots of amazing local artist were performing on the walk path we covered both sides of road did a little trip to ghirardelli chocolate factory which was amazing. You have plenty of options for food and a mall .It was fun to see the celebrity's stars on the path but it was my least favorite thing.Parking -Is available and may cost from 2-15 $ (road side parking is rarely avilable though)Best time to visit - After 7 pm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rs243

40,Be a STAR yourself Friday Night Lights,"Enjoyed Hollywood Blvd with couple out of town. Friday night full of excitement and action. Street in evening alive with people around world. Tourist families and super heros. U Can see your favorite stars on walk of fame, GO in front of Grahmans Chinese Theater put your own hand or foot in Stars prints since tradition of Hollywood to encase the famous in concrete with there signature as well. Numerous characters outside on blvd for kids picture of Spider Man or Super Man and Adults with Look alike of Elvis or Marilyn Monroe.

Wax Museum on blvd also see Stars in wax figure more fun pictures as well as Ripley Believe it or not with characters and interesting facts of tallest shortest people in world alot of fun. This place has alot of traffic parking hard so find long term parking in the lots need good four hours enjoy food, huge mall great food inside.Picture Hollywood Sign great view 3rd story walk way inside the mall perfect secret spot just go inside see people taking pictures upstairs. The Disney movie Theatre on blvd just across from mall for kids and of course famous Grahmans Theatre see movies as well.

50,Visitors from England,"you get to see your popular stars on the floor. Famous ones are near the Chinese theater. It may take 10 to 15 minutes, take your time and take pictures. If you are looking for a particular one, Google it or ask the tour sale men around. Is all free or it can be part of your paid tour. I must say some are far from the Chinese theater. Make sure you see both sides of the street",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoyPraise
30,Very touristy and crazy,"Hollywood is crazy. It’s something to see if you like that kind of thing, I love looking at the strange mannequins in the wig shops and there is so much odd stuff to look at. Reading the stars will make you dizzy after 5 mins but it’s fun if you find who you were looking for. It’s not dangerous but after dark it gets a tiny bit wild, I always keep my guard up when walking alone. You should only plan to spend an hr here, then do something else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alunaf2016
40,You must see,"Among other places in LA, that's another spot you must go. But there nothing special or the expected glamour.

50,A Must Do On Your List,Just park anywhere near the Chinese theatre on Hollywood Blvd. And walk in either direction and make a giant rectangle. It is quite a long walk to see them all but it is fun and triggers all sorts of memories as you go from name to name. Be mindful where you park. I parked on the street as many others had done and I received a $68 parking ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y654TAmarkw

20,Not worth the parking fee,"I know you flew all the way to California to see something interesting and grand. This is not the place for it.

20,Looks better on tv,"This is of course a must do in LA but I’m glad we were staying near the area and didn’t make a special trip and have to find parking. The sidewalks aren’t as clean as they look on tv or in the movies. There are a lot of different types of characters walking about that you can take pics with for a price. While it’s fun to see the various star names on the sidewalk, it’s a pretty seedy area and after you walk a few blocks you’re pretty much over it. At least for us that was the case",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinevalleyite
10,Dirty and dilapidated.,I was super disappointed with the condition the Hollywood Walk of Fame is in. Do you want tourists? Their is so much garbage and homeless people everywhere it hardly seems this would be the “American Dream” people see in films. So disappointing!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/korapeters
50,Great Experience of the Cali life,"Very Busy area consisting of ppl dressed in customes trying to get you to pay to take a picture with them... ppl showing off there talents for a few . There are lots of shops to buy souvenirs and the Dolby theatre (home of the Oscars) Avenue if the Stars, Chinese museum & madam toussaint wax museum, Theatres and other attractions to see and tours around the City. My favorite thing is to locate where the names of the STARS I love.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rouxbaby

50,Touristy but fun,"I’ve visited the walk of fame before, but each time you go you find or see a star you missed prior. It’s fun to locate your r favorites and take a pic! I recommend...!there are always characters on the walk to entertain you and it’s pretty safe here too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adventuresofsonyat
30,Fun to See Once,"The heart of Hollywood is an area that is fun to see once. But it is a big tourist destination with a fair amount of crime and aggressive sales people pushing their tours or CD's. Went several years ago and the kids enjoyed the wax museum while we looked at all the stars. Took my mom back there last week and she loved seeing all the stars and the Dolby Theatre. Interesting to see them setting up for the Oscars. Keep your belongings close to you and pay attention, as with any very public crowded place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdgierl
50,Worth It,This is a definite must do if you are in LA. You can look up where your favorite stars are and get a photo or you can just wander and explore. We did it a couple of times but we were staying right off Hollywood and Highland. You will love this if you are a fan.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnpV4713TS
30,"""Not Much More Than What I Imagined""","Nothing special to me, once you get past the stars on the sidewalk. You can look up their location online to see what area of Hollywood Blvd. to go in to search for them. HOARDS of people everywhere, basically the definition of a tourist trap. Some decent restaurants on the Blvd, and TCL Chinese theater, where they do all the premieres. There's also a mall next door, with standard stores. parking is high in this area, so take Uber. Traffic is always heavy around here though. Good clubs nearby at Hollywood & Highland as well. Pricey. If you take a pic with the people in the costumes, they'll ask for money. There's a main souvenir shop where everything is $5-10, and it's your expected Hollywood souvenir items. Best thing on the Blvd to me is the Foot Locker lol. Make it a stop, but not THE stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craig1086

30,Interesting,"Found ourselves walking with our heads down looking at all the stars. There are some shady looking people but you just keep walking. Lots of homeless people but they didn't bother us. Lots of people trying to get you to book tours. Read here about people dressed up asking to take a photo then expecting you to pay, so we kept walking. Interesting place but not somewhere to walk around late at night. Black Panther premiere was on while we were there, interesting to see what a premiere in Hollywood looks like Marquees set up, security everywhere but didn't line up to see the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoranYag70
40,Worth a look,"Great for a walk to remember your favourite stars both long dead and still going strong. Equally interesting is the eclectic group of people in the area, business people, tourists, drunks and druggies. There are some terrific bars (try the Irish) and some great shopping in the area. Also the usual crappy souvenir shops. Worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_ragarratt
20,Just meh,There's nothing really special about the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Most are dirty or covered with gum so it's not really impressive to see. I guess it is one of those things you must do when in Hollywood but don't kick yourself if you don't see it. We were much more impressed with the hand and footprints in front of the TCL Chinese Theatre (formerly Grauman's) There are definitely better sites to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swtraveler15
30,cool but scary place,Its nice to walk around and see all the stars specially ones of your 'heros'. However the place gets scary for tourists as everyone tries to hustle you. The place seems shady.

20,Not for me...,"This place wasn't for me. Although it's neat to see some of the famous stars along the sidewalk, the crowds and sketchy people ruined it for me. No, I don't want your demo CD. No, I don't want a picture with you. No, I don't want to go on a celebrity tour. No! No! No! Is it a must see? Kind of. Will I return after seeing it once? No.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sloaner83
50,Just cool,"Must have to visit in Los-Angeles! A lot of people , celebrities , tourists, restaurants, I strongly recommend !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901maxima
30,Be ready to be hustled!!,"This is one of those places you have to see when visiting LA for the tourist experience so I’m glad to check it off my list!! What I didn’t expect was being hassled at every turn by people wanting to take us on a tour or buy something from them. There are people dressed like famous movie characters who come up and ask if you want a picture with them and once you pose and take the picture they ask you for money!! 2 guys dressed like Star Wars characters asked us to pose for a photo and we did, using our camera and we took the photo. Then the guys said they normally get $20 per picture!! We said we only had a few dollars with us which was true but he said he would take a credit card. I refused to give them $20 for maybe 2 minutes of their time when I didn’t ask for the picture, they approached us! So between that nonsense and so many homeless people, be ready!On a good note, we ended up agreeing to take a guided tour of celebrity houses when they offered it to us at half price and thoroughly enjoyed it! The tour bus was old and worn out but the guide was amazing and the price was right! But be aware that on top of what you pay for the tour, they expect $25/person as a tip too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COgirlinGA
30,Interesting Experience,"All the reviews of this are true, both positive and negative. Yes, it is crowded, there are homeless, rather aggressive people trying to foist their music CD on you, sometimes sketchy characters in costume working for tips. But it is all worth it to see all those famous names in those pink stores. Let’s face it, you’re going to come here anyway.The walk of fame is long and it would takes hours to see every star. They are mostly along Hollywood Blvd. but are also on side streets. You can either walk along and take pictures of your favourite celebrities’ star, or google the location first and go find them.There is lots to do in this neighbourhood: Hollywood Museum, wax museum, Dolby theatre, Hard Rock Cafe, several souvenir stores, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tshep42
50,Must sed,This is iconic Los Angeles. Took family of five that was visiting. Very fun to see stars and old movie houses. Gets crow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alli2019
30,Aussies in LA.,"Walked and viewed the many stars on the Hollywood walk of fame. Good to see notable names from the early days through to now. A good stroll. Unfortunately some stars need to be repaired, some areas need cleaning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CardiacChik
40,Avoid weekends or go really early!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is an LA must do and it’s great. You’ll see Spidermen in ill fitting outfits to cat women, Star Wars characters etc etc all plying their trade to have photos taken with them (at a small tip of course) but it’s mainly all good fun. If you possibly can avoid going on a weekend of at least if you have to early in the day when the crowds are less. There some great memories when you see the old names and their movies!! Good fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/179wadeb
40,Excellent Place for a Lovely Time,"Its an enchanting place, filled with Stars edged on the streets having the great performers of hollywood & worldwide. the roads are filled with performers and exciting attraction, entertaining people and energizing the atmosphere. One must take pics with look alike of top characters like super man, batman etc...there is easy metro connectivity leading back to downtown or any other place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/791manast
30,Great to ser,We walked the length of Hollywood blvd and saw a lot of the stars in the walkway apart from that not much else.We had to walk along way to see the Hollywood sign but even this was miles away.Lots of homeless people which was sad to see in such a place.Everyone very helpful when using the metro system to get around places.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scrumpy999

50,Stars from past and present,"This is a great trip for all ages...the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Roy Rogers, Shirley Temple, Marilyn Monroe, Nicolas Cage, the list goes on and on and on...The excellent news about the walk of fame is that it's free. Yes, free. You can just walk around, take pictures and leave at your leisure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cszostak
40,AAD LA 2018,Very nice place to visit to see the names of the world renowned people. Located at Hollywood street. Shopping area is very good and one can buy souvenirs easily.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/450muhammedk
40,Tourist trap,"Always wanted to visit and I did, it's a tourist hot spot for sure but loaded with stuff to see and do.the thing I didn't like is when people trying to sell you they're cds, soo annoying. Everything is so close and at hand whatever you need, atm,food,,drink etc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imaddg
30,Not my kinda tourist spot... :(,"I have to be honest, I agree with a few of the previous reviewers. This place was filthy when we went (Jan) cold, and full of characters who I did not feel comfortable around. I know it's THE place to be when you're touring around, but to be honest, I didn't feel safe, and it's just a lot of walking. Such a shame, I wanted to love it, and pre 'walk' I was so excited. Each to their own....but not for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RescuedVegan
30,Uneventful but I suppose its something to see,"It wasn't that great to be honest. It's highly overrated. With that being said if you're really into movies or want to bring your kids to wax museums I suppose you'd like it. It was rather busy and uneventful. I wouldn't go back, but I'm sure some people would enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/453seanb
20,Don’t go in weekends,"We made the mistake to go on a saturday, when the whole place was just packed with people. Wanted to walk down the boulevard to see all the stars but we were constantly blocked by street artists and people trying to sell stuff. In my opinion this was really annoying, especially sellers and artists blocking the street or the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/firstclassvoyager
20,Needs a good clean!,"Sadly once again the illusion of this iconic tourist attraction is greater than the reality.The walk of fame needs a bucket of hot soapy water and a good water blast as it absolutely filthy and disgusting.Such a shame that it is in such a poor condition and the city of LA dont have more respect for it, I wouldn't waste my time going there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/truekiwiNewZealand
40,stars and stars and shops and crowds,"stars go on for ages, lots of cool names. Outside Chinese theatre are the footprints and handprints in concrete of lots of star names. Also people dressed up as superman and Spiderman etc want to have pictures taken with you for money. Lots of crowds as people shop and see the sights. Lots of cheap souvenir shops. There is also a MacDonald's nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonjpayne2017
40,Find your favorite celebrities,This is one of the main tourist attractions. Always crowded. It's fun to find your favorite celebrities' stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/299saurabhg
30,Lots of stars,"Stars, stars an more stars , it just keeps on going and going , certainly worth a look if your in LA . The characters along the walk are good for a bit of entertainment and it’s cool to see some of your favourite celebs stars, however at the end of the day it’s just a pavement with stars on it 🐯",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OzTiger2017
30,Didn't blow me away....,"If you're in LA for the first time, it's fun to go and check it out, however aside from the one block of hustle bustle and eager tourists, there was definitely no WOW factor to it. Take 10-15 minutes, go find and enjoy some of the names that mean something to you, and go onto your next destination. Also be mindful of your personal belongings as it is very crowded at times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cro_sandy72
40,Scenic,"We had to check it out of course. Very busy sidewalk, lots of people walking, side entertainment sometimes blocking the walk way, lots of vendors. I'm from NY reminded me of Times Square. However, I too blocked traffic as I stopped to take a picture of some of my favorite stars! Very much worth the experience, make sure you walk down/up both sides to see your favorite stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q4869IZkimd
20,Nothing special,"It's not anything special. Just some tiles with names on them. There's one block where everything is happening and apart from that, the whole area is just dirty and unkempt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liamliam123456

30,Cool to see,Neat to see. But it was unkept. Streets and area were not taken care of at all. Expected more. There were various lots to park at. About $10 for parking. Good thing was that you can see the Hollywood sign in certain spots.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478dawna
30,Travel,Just taking a walk to all the Hollywood greatest star ever whose names are written in the star all over the ground / floors of Hollywood avenue. It feels like you are also one of a kind seeing the exact place where the film where shooting at. Theres also a mall just climb up the stairs and lots of restaurant and walking distance to the wax museum. Its fun day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nyliramzurc
40,Hollywood Walk Of Fame,"I have recently traveled to Los Angeles, California. The first night I flew in, we decided to go to the famous, Hollywood Blvd. It was very fun to see the stars and hand prints. If you are traveling with children I do sugest kep a very close watch on them. There was some people on the blvd that were sketchy. Also if you are sensitive to smells like pot, I do not recommend, because you can smell the drug (not the whole way through but in some parts). It was an amazing experience that I do highly recommend you take! Hope this review helped :)))",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samjes119
40,A must to visit,A great walk and see lots of named stars embossed into the walkway dating back to silent movie stars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JB084439
40,You've not been to LA if you didn't see this,Probably the most famous tourist attraction in LA. Directions : Take the Metro red line to Hollywood Highland station. The walkway is right here as you exit the station and extends all the way till Hollywood Vine station where Pantages is.It's buzzing with activities you won't miss it. Turn right as you exit and walk ahead for about 5 mins and you'll see TCL Chinese Theater and that's where you'll find the hand and foot prints of world famous celebrities cast in concrete.Cater about 2 hrs here as there will lots of opportunities for photo taking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dyhx
40,Nice to see,"Its a little bit crowdy street, but still nice to see. There is Chinese theater, where all Hollywood movies have their premiere. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jankuba21
50,Hollywood Walk Of Fame,"I recommend finding a restaurant, bar, movie theatre, museum, etc that is on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame. That way you are going there for an activity. You will enjoy the Hollywood Walk Of Fame much more of you also have something else you are there to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonnyVegas45
40,Needs a face lift,"I was really excited to see the walk of fame, imagining strolling over the stars of my favourite celebrities. And it is an experience, but not at all like I imagined. The stars themselves need a little bit of love as they seem like they have seen better days. And be ware that the Hollywood strip of filled with an array of characters ready to take a pic with you... for a price. But it’s all part of the Hollywood experience. The facade of the rich and famous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cazr2018
40,Tourist must see,This is an iconic spot that I always wanted to see. It's one of those things that I can now say I've done. It is incredibly touristy as you might expect. This part of Hollywood is nicer than the rest of Hollywood which is a dive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricknie
50,Worth it!,A good walk on a busy and famous street. Lots of familiar names! Be careful of people trying to give you CDs or ‘free’ things - they’re not free and want money!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anyothername1987
10,What an awful place,"I must have missed the point but this is a truly awful place. Dirty, busy and dangerous. People constantly trying to force CD's into your hand and then demanding money. Lots of what can only be described as unwell people who seemed out of their minds on drugs all to see some stars with names on. I was with young children (11 and 9) who were genuinely terrified. Stay away from this hell hole",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterLarsen_01
10,Exactly the Same - Not Glamorous at All,"I’ve been to the walk of fame a few times, with various people as a Tourist, but now I only go to visit one or two particular shops.The walk of fame extends pretty far along Hollywood Boulevard, and also includes several offshoots into side streets as well.As you walk along, you’ll find overpriced Tat stores, people trying to sell you their “CD” as an up and coming artist... (Whilst getting in and out of a $100,000 SUV) people dressed up as movie characters trying to get you to pay to have a photo with them... then there’s the Homeless.Hollywood has a Massssssive Homeless problem, in Fact most of Los Angeles does.As you walk along you’ll constantly come across homeless people, some sleeping rough and others rooting through bins and what not.The Streets aren’t clean and sparkly like you’d expect, they might be a bit tidier around the Chinese theatre but that’s the “Glamour” area of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E3429QHphilm
40,Very crowded but safe.,"We went having been dropped off from a tour. It is a little crowded, but interesting to find your favourite stars on the pavement. I have taken lots of pictures, so I can make a collage when I get home. If visiting the Chinese Theatre it is worth strolling along the road to see them. At the end of the walk there is a statue of the four most iconic famous women stars, together with Marilyn Munro at the top of the statue. Inside are plaques of the Beatles. In order to be on the Hollywoood Walk of Fame, you have to be nominated and pay 50 000 dollars to be included on a plaque. There are 2400 stars on plaques at present. There are blank ones embedded in the pavement so future stars can acquire them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieQ937
20,Would have been a No no if not a must,"You can’t visit LA and not have a “walk of the game”. Having said that you should know that this street, which I visited at the dark, isn’t the most pleasant place to stroll around.The stars are exciting as always of course but there surroundings just don’t look right for them. I would expect the authorities to beautify the place appropriately.If you got here, don’t miss the area of the Chinese theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meyravg
20,Way too crowded,"A much worse experience than you would expect. A lot, LOTS of tourists, and practically there eas no place to stop for a photo.Parking was 25$ and full, while on the other side there are parkings at 10$ cost, with same walking distance to the walking street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/747phamg
20,Ok but not amazing,This is just as it looks - Stars with names on a dirty old sidewalk. Our first impression of Hollywood was one of filth. So the first set of stars on the walk of fame were filthy and disappointing. I am not a huge starstruck person so wasn't a big deal for me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Canadiana25
30,Disappointed,"Went on a tour of the LA/Hollywood area and the tour started at the Walk of Fame. Have wanted to visit this place for some time. Was disappointed with the overall experience. Lists of homeless, and every time you turned around some person was trying to sell you something or in a costume trying to get you to take a picture with them for pay. Some enjoy that sort of thing. Just not my cup of tea. Did get to see some of the stars hand and footprints. Kind of interesting and the price was right if your looking for something to do. Free",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KurtR67
30,Hollywood “Walk of Fame” Tarnished,"Recently, I had the opportunity to take my family to visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I had many memories of visiting Hollywood and the Walk of Fame and the many “Stars” representing those of, for the most part, Hollywood past. It is still exciting to see and share the experience but it is somewhat tarnished by the many pan handlers, homeless, and dirty sidewalks. It is worthy of a visit if you have never been but be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1WorldTraveler9
50,my daughters leg of our trip,We enjoyed checking out all the stars. We walked up and down nearly all the streets they are on. We used our phones to pinpoint some exact locations of ones we HAD to See. February is when we went so it was not very busy or packed that you are elbow to elbow. Very nice weather added to our trip. Very neat to see and do if you ever have the chance!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpenberth076
50,So much to see and do!!!,I've wanted to come here my whole life and it did not disappoint. There was so much action going on my head was spinning!! We saw a lot of our favorite stars stars. I even got to do one of my own. It was an awesome trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/telias2016
30,Hyped Up,"While it was fun to point out the stars of celebs that we like, the whole experience seemed way over hyped. Mostly it was just walking down a run down area that happened to have stars in the sidewalk. Also, generally a dirty area with a lot of litter on the ground. Many of the stars were cracked or had other signs of lack of upkeep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/165sabrinau
40,Fun,Crowded as NYC. Amazing to see the names of so many great performers who are no longer with us. Suggest you hold onto your belongings! You will be bumped and jostled. Well worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OpinionGuru
50,Fun!,It's great to see the historical performers that began the entertainment industry in our country! Great fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elyse2772

40,A walk down Memory lane,Great tourist spot. Good people watching. Fun and funny performance artists. A challenge knowing who all three stars were!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllenI772
50,So much to do and see,"There is so much to see, so many stars signatures. Lots of shops, restaurants and entertainment, tour buses galore. This is a really fun place to walk around. We really enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ednacorliss
10,"Turn around, get back on the bus or Uber out of there - head to a bar instead!","Had the unfortunate experience of going to the Walk of fame, I was expecting a lot more, boy, were we in for a shock. Dirty sidewalks, over priced gift shops and homeless/druggies everywhere. The walk of fame was dirty, shonky people trying to sell you a plaque on the footpath with your name on it for a price. Tip - if you must buy keepsakes, walk down to the other end of the street and it will be much cheaper. Our Uber driver suggested a walk down either side before leaving, we made it down one street before being bombarded by salespeople. Very underwhelming, sad but constant theme in LA, homeless people and bums everywhere. Do yourself a favour, skip this iconic tourist trap and spend the money at a bar, it will save you money and time. Don’t waste your time here - it’s time that you won’t get back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaxterE15
30,Worth the stop,It was worth the stop. I enjoyed walking up and down the street and reading all the stars and getting a few pictures with some of my favorites. I wouldn't spend hours and hours there but I am glad I visited and can check it off my list of things to do in my life. At the end of the day you are just walking and looking down. When we were driving away I realized that I was right near Capital Records but I never looked up long enough to notice! The street vendors trying to sell you bus tours for the stars homes were kind of annoying and most were also a bit rude when you said No Thank You but overall it was a pleasant experience and I would recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzikay1
30,Worth a few minutes to say you were there,"It is very difficult to see all of the stars. There are ""character actors"", promotion sales people, ""homeless?"", corner musicians. It feels like you are walking the gauntlet.The local news reports that the homeless population has double in the last couple of years - they are everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockcole
20,Hollywood Blvd,We walked both sides of the street and what I remember most was the smell of pot and piss. The side walk was quite busy and nearly all the individuals there were addicts or street people. We witnessed three arrests and one car accident in the hour we were there. People we laying on the ground all over the place preparing to sleep for the night. I would tell my friends just to visit the few famous addresses and move on. Don’t waste too much time walking around looking for something special as there is not much else to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Av8ter98
50,Hollywood fun!,"The Hollywood walk of fame is fun spotting your favourite stars! The older you are ( I am 78) the better - as you will recognise so many of the original stars of your youth. I found Ester Williams down near Sunset and Vine last week. The walk although centered around Hollywood and Highland goes for a long walk in all the surrounding main streets. Good fun for all, but very crowded around the Chinese Theatre area!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/953jim
40,Three Generations,"It was fun walking the street's sidewalks and discussing the various stars. Of course, the youngest had no clue as to who most of them were. That was a real lesson for us and our own legacy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bob19512014
40,Ehhh,Was definitely not what I had expected. Lots of bums and homeless people making the area feel super sketchy. No good places to park for less than $25.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicaz869
40,Czech girl in Hollywood,This was a very nice trip to see the famous Hollywood walk of fame. I enjoyed looking for my favorite actors and when I found them I was excited to také a Picture with their star!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barborao663
30,"If you're in the area or on the Redline with a day pass, have a walk","Walking down Hollywood Blvd is an interesting experience. Not only to notice the names on the stars or see the various icons for film, music, directors, etc -- but because there are so many people stopped by their favorite celebrity's names having someone take a photo of them, or trying to pose with a selfie stick. Walking and avoiding the posers can be like being a character in an arcade game. (And then you can add in walking around crowds that form around the unofficial movie/cartoon characters and dodging the guys who want you to go to the $5 souvenir store, which is not a good deal or the guys giving your their CDs and then following you for money.)Starting at La Brea and going eastward for 1.2 miles to N. Gower Street, Hollywood Blvd is dotted with stars. In fact, you can see them on Google Maps when in satellite view.If you want to see the area on the map, enter Statue of the Four Ladies of Hollywood for La Brea side (it's on the south side of Hollywood Blvd and is a major landmark) and the Fonda Theater (north side of Hollywood Blvd) for Gower.Not all the stars have names though. Some are blanks awaiting an icon and name. Some are in a single line while others are staggered side by side.Parking isn't easy around Hollywood Blvd so you may have to park a few blocks south. Or you can pay upwards of $7 a parking lot. If you happen to have a day or multi-day pass for unlimited metro rides, get off at the Hollywood and Highland station or Hollywood and Vine and have a walk. But if you're all the way across LA, bear in mind that a 2-mile drive is 15 minutes if not much more, and this is not that amazingly great. Maybe drive over there after well around rush hours, preferably after 7. Unless there's an event on Hollywood Blvd that night, it's much more doable at night.Another reason to be there when it's dark out is that Hollywood Blvd is much more unique and beautiful when it's lit up at night.The stars themselves aren't something I'd call spectacular, but the experience of Hollywood Blvd is unique.You could walk the entire area in however long it takes you to walk 1.2 miles on a crowded street, but you'll likely want to stroll and take in more of what Hollywood Blvd has to offer so I am writing 2-3 hours for your visit. But you can also pop out of the subway and look at a few stars for 10 minutes and be back on your way.(I have lived in the area on and off for many years and seen the Walk of Fame many a time under many circumstances at every time of the year.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebSoloTravel
50,Walking On Stars,"It was very fun walking and looking at all the names on the stars. We took photos of many of our favorite people. Other visitors were doing the same, lots of great conversations going on. There are lots of stores that sell Hollywood type of items. Just remember to avoid the hustlers on the street trying to sell worthless cds, etc. They are rude. Focus on your fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diana7diana
30,Bit of a let down,I guess i has to be on the list but to be honest it was a dissapointment.The walk of fame goes a long way and many parts are not washed down and lots of litter and tacky souvenir shops were in place. Don't expect too much from this one although certain parts are for sure better maintained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/portfolioman
50,Toddler takes over LA,This is a really nice area. Must do the tour with the Hollywood Mansions . I paid $35 which included my 17 month old . And nice area to take pics and the people are nice . Daytime parking $10.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/court87808
30,It's not what you think,Is just a sidewalk mostly dirty with the stars name in bronze border stars.The walk goes on for blocks must of the current actors are not in prominent places as the stars are placed in the order they were awarded. It's worth seeing it once and then you are done,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexlL3654CM
30,See It Once,"See it once, don't go again is basically the idea. It's so famous that if you're not from Los Angeles you need to go see it. But after you do it once you're done.Beware Scientologist recruiters offering personality tests. They want your money.Some interesting shops line Hollywood Blvd but the secret is no one who actually lives here hangs out here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diaozhadelaowai
20,UGH,"While the concept of honoring all of these celebrities is cool, walking the streets of Hollywood isn’t. Trash, pan handlers, gang members are rampant all up and down the Blvd. Just drive up and down Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards for some fun and then go toUniversal Studios for real Hollywood fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dwilcox000
10,It’s Hollywood...,"I know before I moved here I always had this glamorous view of Hollywood. I’ve visited the Walk Of Fame several times with family and friends while they’re in town. 100% of them have said they’re glad they went to say they’ve been there. But they would never go again. It’s nasty. You will see homeless people who’ve used the sidewalks as their restroom. Be careful what you touch. It will be extremely crowded and very chaotic. Ironically, the symbol of L.A. doesn’t truly represent the city. Except for tons of homeless and human feces on the sidewalks... We have that in a lot of areas unfortunately. Keep a close eye on your kids and valuables. The very best thing in the area is the Jimmy Kimmel show. But you’ll need to reserve free tickets way in advance. There’s also the Roosevelt Hotel. It’s down the street and is really cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimtravelnut
20,Dirty & less than desirable!,Something to see if you are interested in a quick photo w/ your fav's! Hollywood is dirty & less than desirable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/864lorig
40,Worth some of your time,"The Walk of fame is really long, not just on Hollywood Blvd. it is fun to see all of the names of people you recognize as well as those you do not. There are so many tourist on the main few blocks of the Blvd. that it really is hard to stop and read the names. Walk a few blocks east of Hollywood and Highland and you will have the stars all to yourself. You will never do the entire walk. Enjoy the part you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LarryT1188

If you want to get the best view of the stars on the blvd, uninterrupted, you need to go there earlier, before 10:00 am, earlier the better where there are not many people there, make sure to check out the foot/hand prints of the most popular stars right in front of the Chinese Theater.... if you want to see the craziness of the street, then come after 12:00 noon, where you will see everything you want to see and more.... Watch out for the costumed character impersonators- superman, captain america, Spidermen, keep in mind, they can be very pushy, say NO if you don't want them to push you into take a picture, if you choose to take a picture with one of the characters, be sure to ask how much they charge first before jump in for a picture. There is no regulation therefore they can charge from $5 up to $20. Also, do not take any ""free"" items from the peddlers, such as CDs etc., they WILL want money from you, and there is NOTHING on those CDs. Remember, Nothing is free!On the other hand, there are a lots of city tour peddlers, it is ok if you want to buy a tour departing right in Hollywood, that is fun! but pick wisely.Parking: if you drive, park at Hollywood and Highland shopping mall parking (enter from Highland blvd.), you can go to Information to get stamped for two- hour free parking. Remember, park on the street of Hollywood is hard, and you will get nearly $100 parking ticket if you parked wrong, read street sign CAREFULLY!There are a lot of restaurants and bars along the Hollywood Blvd., some are a bit shady, but do check out the Hollywood and Highland shopping mall, it has shops, restaurants, and night club Ohm, one stop for all your needs.Well prepared Hollywood visit will let you have fun without all the craziness and disappointments.Oh, if you are lucky, you may come across the ceremony of a celebrity getting his/her star on the blvd! Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheenaGao
40,Shouldn't miss,"We walked most of this area. It is truely an LA experience, not to be missed. If you want to see certain stars, I suggest you look up where they are. Most were in good condition, but I was disappointed to find that a lot of the stars needed repair or cleaning. I know there are many people walking the area, yet in my opinion, I think it should be better maintained. We had a lot of fun walking around, taking pictures, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lillieh498
40,Half an hour maximum,"Tourist are so excited to see the stars, but after 1/2 hour walk it is the same starts, same souvenir shops, same, same... I recommend going to the Chinese theater and their shops and spend an hour watching the ""crazy"" people... fun for the family. Meuter Media",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeuterMedia

You can also buy disney merch there as well. you will get harassed by people trying to sell you cd etc. Just don't engage.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeighroySydney
50,A must see,Difficult to read all the stars as lots of pedestrians and just couldn’t pause long enough however having heard about it it was good to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YorkshireGrandma
20,Sightseeing,"I thought it would be nicer, it was real dusty looking and dirty. Wasn't worth the drive that we took to get there. The stores a long the strip also looked kinda run down as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/956laddib
40,A lot of stuff going on here!,"Here you can find a lot of souvenir shops, museums, shows, entertainment, restaurants and some buildings, like Capitol records and Dolby theatre. There are also some other stores like Foot locker. You can also see the Hollywood sign from some spots during the walk.A tip is just to walk around, look, and enjoy the crazy and entertaining vibes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lillafrokenj
50,Enjoyed it,It kinda reminded me of the las vegas strip as it was that busy with people walking around. Not sure where you can park but we ended up paying 15 bucks to park in the parkaide as we were strapped for time. Was enjoyable looking for all our favorite celebrities stars. We are glad we went and checked it out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cakeme2013
20,Tired and overrun by the Homeless,"During a college visit, we spent a fair amount of time walking the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I really feel for the homeless and the lack of resources to help them. That said, the City does virtually nothing to prevent groups of homeless from collecting along Hollywood Blvd. We saw as many as 6-8 homeless young people congregate on the walk and the smells alone are enough to chase people away.In the mornings, the remnants of the homeless using the storefronts as toilets really make you worry about Hep-C and other diseases. Old Hollywood has seen its better days as the Chinese Theater is no longer in the best shape along with the Walk of Fame itself. The only modern facility is the Dolby Theater area at the corner of Highland and Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E5540LBmichaelh
30,It was ok,We walked quite a few blocks. It was dirty homeless people everywhere. Not what i expected but i did enjoy seeing all the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/54cm_1962

50,Nicely Crowded place,"this place is the most ALIVEplace in the whole LA Area, where it is all the times crowded and full of people who went there to enjoy their time, i think the streets is well known and there is no need to mention that on the ground you will see the honor stars of all the celebrities.if you go there do not forget to visit THE MOHAMMAD ALI start, which you wont find on the Ground, because it is the only SPECIAL star where it was on one of the Buildings because Mohammad ALI refused that his name to be on the Ground because he has the name of Prophet Mohammad.one thing people dont like about this place that it is full of Homeless, but comeone, these people are there to do something and get some money where they can buy some food, also they entertain you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anasjabeiti
50,Iconic,"The Hollywood wall of fame is a must see. The walk of fame is surprisingly long because of all the immortalized stars throughout the years. There are many other attractions, shops, and restaurants along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525claytonh
20,Horrible,"This was the second time I have visited this place , the first in 1997. What a difference in time. It is now a dirty grubby hole with homeless people everywhere, everything is dirty with cracked side streets , filthy shop windows and just as equally dirty inside the shops. This place needs to be bulldozed down and rebuild. Unfortunately who remembers Hollywood . I would personally visit other places never planning on coming back again to this rat hole. Don’t waste your time when there are other fantastic places to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoelA643
10,Don’t bother,This has to be the worst part of our LA experience the place is dirty full of hood rats and homeless and potential crime You can’t get near the Chinese theatre handprints of the stars as it’s barricaded off . Hollywood is a myth unfortunately,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B5814PApetert
50,Walk of Fame in Hollywood,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a mustsee in LA. This was our second time to visit the Walk of Fame. It’s nice to be reminded of some of the golden greats of early cinematic days and the stars of today and forgotten stars of yesteryears. It’s close to loads of other Hollywood attractions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/motorcar1
50,Another child dream that came true,Where all dreams come true. Avenue of stars was a great experience and loved it every single moment. Exactly like the movies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quimzinho
10,So dirty and full of scammers,We were so disappointed when we arrived to what we always thought was a great place to visit. It was full of homeless people but they weren't the problem. There are scammers everywhere. Claiming they are the hottest new thing and using stand over tactics for money. So many people in costumes getting people to take photos with them then demanding money. Also it was filthy. The place needs a huge clean up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angels_Are_Devious
30,Dirty,"There is one block of the walk which is nice, the rest of it looks like it needs to be power washed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adnej1
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame.,My first time in California and it was everything I thought it would be visiting Family in California for the first time it was very busy and walking looking down was really fun can't wait to do it again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/66beverlym
50,Exciting,"Hollywood’s walk of fame is one of the popular spots in Los Angeles for tourists, really fun and unforgettable place, however be aware theyre are a lot of street entertainment, the people in costumes asking for pictures will want tipped, guys offering CD’s or holding snakes will be there to make their money too. This used to not be the case as much but as years have went on more and more people have seen this as a money making opportunity, therefore go to this place with the intention of only speaking to people that you know and you will be sure to have a great time and see some celeb names..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/309376
50,Pre-Bday Celebration,Fun & exciting...was able to get my own personal star made! Nice to see all the many famous people thsts represented.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roam752414
20,Disapointed,"The entire BLVD was dirty with lots of sketchy people, Uber driver told us to ignore the homeless because they can get angry and few tourist had been stabbed. The entire BLVD was not well kept and dirty. Knowing that the nominees of the star have to pay $40,000.00 for the making and maintenance of the star saddens my to see most of them in need of repair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisacG4605RS
30,Nice addition to your walk.,Nice to look and see who has a star. They need to fix a few that are cracking but it’s free and interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C1078KLchrisw
40,"Visiting Hollywood, California",Great time. Lots to see. Enjoyed seeing the names on the stars. Great places to eat at. But was crowded on a Saturday night visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elained122
40,Craziness 24/7,"If you don't like stuff being loud this place isn't for you. First night I was there a helicopter was looking for somebody in the vicinity. I kid you not some guy drove past and said ""They killing people over there, stay away"" I laughed about it but he might of been telling the truth. Lot of people trying to sell you stuff, protest happened a couple times. Cool place if you don't mind the craziness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isiahb2018
40,Nice for Visitors,"Hollywood is not the best street people can walk on, but when you are down near Highland where everything is happening, it's a fun place for visitors to go. There is a nice mall, a Hard Rock, and lots of people watching. Just be cautious because like every touristy area, there are pickpockets and anyone waiting to take advantage of someone who is unfamiliar with the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/profhanover
50,Must experience at least once in a lifetime,"Totally awesome and busy place. Great food, souvenirs and things to do! The walk of Fame just go and experience it at least once in a lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsAira
30,"Fun walk, but needs maintenance",Its was fun exploring the Walk of Fame... The famous names made me gush with delight.But cleanliness and maintenance of overall walk is an issue of concern.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mitzlife
30,Not a big deal,"This place was a real chocker, specially since it's so famous. The walk of Fame was long gone. They should name it the walk of garbage. It is really dirty and it seems like they do not take car of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurarQ6580LC
20,Disappointing,"After all the hype, the walk of fame was a letdown.Unlike what you see in TV, Hollywood Boulevard looks like any other street in LA but with costumed characters like Spider-Man/Superman and others hustling tourists.Felt uneasy about walking the streets.Should have been more upmarket and classy with all the history of great entertainers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drjees2018
50,Bored in L.A.,Went to Hollywood walk of fame to kill time. I was not disappointed. Took lots of pictures and had a great time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y9726QZfredb
30,"For celebrity lovers, but otherwise, it's ok",I got excited seeing Minnie mouse and some celebrities but it is rather hard to find them amidst people behind the scenes we might not know. Also it's filled with people selling stuff and dressing up in costumes to take pictures with you for a tip. I hate that because it's very crowded and you get bombarded by people trying to approach you to buy their stuff or service,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R569UQchristinek

30,Just ikay,"Underwhelming. Once you’ve seen one star on the ground you’ve seen them all. I suppose there’s something to saying that you have been there, but that’s about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sg2011523
30,Busy bustle,"The stars walk you couldn’t do it all it’s too long. But found what was wanted to see. So many rap artists thrusting CDs at you telling you it’s free, then wanting a donation for it. Just annoying and rude they don’t like being told no. Also a lot of people dressed up trying to get money to have your photo taken with them. Some really well done impersonation, but Spider-Man weighing 110kgs with a gut and Spanish voice isn’t impressive, especially when he is wearing a small suit showing every crease in his body. Not kid friendly!!!Many of them where really good but again NO is not there preferred answer. Just makes for an obstacle course whilst navigating your way around the starts. Lots of souvenir shops to buy stuff, some excellent some revolting. All in all a good few hours of entertainment, Scientology recruitment drive was funny to see. If you like people watching here is he best mixed bag I have ever seen. Could be inappropriate for younger kids, my teen laughed a lot off and was revolted by more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovesAsiaLots
50,Walk of Stars,This is something you can do yourselves no need to get a tour guide to show you around. There are more things along Hollywood Boulevard to do than just look at the stars as they go for a couple of blocks so you may want to just do the ones along both sides of the Chinese Theatre as once you cross over Highland Street on Hollywood Boulevard there is not much to see down the other end and it’s a bit dirty and dinghy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen9966
30,You need to go and take a look but lower your expectations a little bit...,"Being in LA you need to go this place anyway, as it is one of the iconic places for tourists. The good: you can see some famous theatres (El Capitan, Chinese one, etc), you can get a view of the Hollywood sign on the hills, you can see the walk of fame with the star names on it, you can find a lot of reasonable priced souvenirs from LA and you can even find some good and affordable fresh prepared food (recommend Latin Fusion Kitchen). The not so good: some areas adjacent to this place are a little bit rundown and you find some homeless people on the street. If you're going with a family I will recommend to go during the day. Good but not great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/505walterv
40,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"Loved looking at all the famous peoples’ Stars and taking photos. We were fortunate to be there when Minnie Mouse received a Star, and were able to see Katy Perry & witness how crazy people are to see a star for autographs & photos. It was fun. We enjoyed shopping for souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/germainel2014
30,Nothing special,"We went to the Hollywood walk of Fame because I guess it's a must see if you are in LA. But I did not find it terribly interesting. But I do think that if you're in LA you should go to see it. But now that I have already bee, I really don't think I will go back ever again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U3372DEchrise
40,Worth a visit,"Somewhere you must visit if you're in the area, quite fun finding the names of stars we like. Would highly recommend going quite early in the morning so that most of the crowds and poorly dressed superheroes and characters aren't out yet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ryant1995
30,"It Could Have Been Worse, Could Have Been Better","It bothers me to admit this, but I wish that I had enjoyed my time here more than I did. The friend I went with made the time I spent bearable.It's obvious that the location has a lot of history. And you can read about the history at the Hollywood Museum. That's right there, too. And I think it's quite a bit more entertaining. My biggest issue with the Walk of Fame wasn't the people hawking their wares on the stars, or the homeless and destitute you will encounter. My problem was with the great history drowning in what I would describe as an aura of decay. Yes, it's crowded. There's trash, and you'd wish there'd be a bit more upkeep on the stars. There are nicer areas, and better things to do around the Walk of Fame. If you absolutely want to see the stars, do so. But keep in mind that the next time you're in the area, you'll just be using it as another sidewalk to get somewhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenmM3894XX
30,Our world’s most star-studded sidewalk,"Must be a great attraction . . . I’ve been here over 20 times. I used to have a business partner in LA, and have been to Greater LA over 100 times on work, and over 30 times on vacations and shopping trips. On over 20 of these trips, I’ve brought my guests and friends to Hollywood Boulevard to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Although I rate it as an average attraction at best, it is a world-famous attraction. But what do people see in it? I guess they like seeing the names of their favoured stars. Surprisingly, it isn’t that old. The first eight stars were dedicated in 1958, and the Walk of Fame was officially completed in 1960. Over 2,000 stars and celebrities are forever immortalized here.I guess the conceived marketing tactic worked, as more than 10 million visitors from around the world come each year to experience this attraction. They come to Tinseltown to have their photos taken beside the pink, five-pointed stars. Really . . . But why? Is it that great of an attraction???",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KodoDrummer
40,Hollywood walk of fame,"Hollywood and Beverly hills both locations make you believe you are too close to actors , actresses , directors , musicians , radio jockeys ... when in downtown u can walk the fame approx 2500 such stars who are successful in films , radio , music or art ... u can find them on this walk .. quite impressive in case ur a movie buff must place to visit once in Hollywood .. keep about an hour to have a good look of place and feel it .. there are good shopping and food areas around the place .. enjoyed it well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vimals2016
40,Have a CD,"This attraction like many people has been on my list to visit in Hollywood, it gives a certain feel of what it would be like to live like a celebrity. The stars are set out along Hollywood Boulevard ranging from busy areas, to areas that are not as nice. Walking down the street you are approach by numerous gentleman trying to give you their CD, and then ask for money to help them. This is something that becomes very irritating after a while amongst trying to avoid walking into other people on the street. One of the men became quite aggressive to one of my friends when trying to give him a CD, and had resulted in a few heated words coming from the mans side. I personally ignored them and simply said ""No thanks"" and continued on. You will also notice the smell of a certain narcotic when you are walking down this road which is very off putting. We had noticed the presence of two police on the street, but they did not intervene with the men selling cd's.You will notice homeless people on the street, which can be upsetting at times - I personally would not give them money, as we had witnessed another person give money and became surrounded by other homeless people seeking the same. All in all I would say that the stars are amazing, but you will notice that some of them have suffered damage and appeared dirty which was a bit of a let down. I personally would visit this attraction again, and would advise people to be careful of others around you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlevans15
20,Not impressed,We walk for a few blocks and that was it .What is a star on a sidewalk ???To be seen if you go there once .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katevalclyde

50,Much to see.,We went there with another couple when we went to be on the Price Is Right. We decided to go sightseeing and stopped to see the stars. Parking is rally hard to find but it is worth it to see the stars and the area. We stayed at the Old Holywod Hotel and just walked to the Studios near there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leogg65
30,What I Expected,"If your in LA this is probably something you want to see and walk along, there are lots of other tourists doing the same, it is a very busy street and sure you see the stars but because the place is packed you can't really stop to much, but there are 15 Blocks of Stars so you will see plenty if you go further down to less busy areas of the Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunshineqld
40,Great to visit,"You will be approached by people trying to ""give"" you a CD, or have their photo taken with you, but a firm No gets the message across and they leave you alone. There are about 2400 stars (I think), but you can Google where they all are, so if there's any you particularly want to see find out where it is in advance (some of them are on Vine Street instead of Hollywood Boulevard).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988jonm

Não recomendo!The Walk of Fame is one more of these pseudo tourist attractions! A feather! Do not think you will find the Calçada as they appear in the photos!

40,Good but depends on how much time you have,"It is a good solo walk but it really depends on what you like. It is a one-time thing where you can walk and have a look around at other places like Dolby's, Chinese theatre etc. But if you are pressed for time, you can skip doing the entire walk. It gets very crowded during the day so try and do it early. [You can definitely do this on your own and skip booking a tour for this one]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/85kirank

Amazing !,"This is a must if you visit Hollywood , you could see the stars of many of your favorite artists and arou d there is the famous Chinese Theater, the wax museum, Ripley Museum , and many famous spots among tourists .. there are restaurants and bars, clothing shops, etc and around there you could be able to take pictures with people dress as spiderman , Marilyn Monroe, Superman etc .. theres so much fun .. dont miss to take selfies on this spots !! ..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aventuramty

30,Go in a group,"My adult daughter and I were dropped off at the start of the stars — we started about 9:30 which was a bit scary as the area is sketchy. We walked and got great pictures — lots of stars were defaced - sad. When we got closer to the 11:00 hour - started to get busy with lots of guys trying to sell tour trips, CD or rides to see homes of the stars. It was a check on the bucket list but would recommend going in groups.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/19dianad
30,Nice place to see once,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a nice place to visit once. A lot of stores a lot of shopping a lot of chain restaurants to eat at. You could see the Hollywood Sign from some of the buildings as well. It's a nice place to visit so you can at least say that you have been there. If you are in that area I highly suggest the restaurant named The Griddle. The Griddle has amazing breakfast one pancake could feed an entire family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/firenando40
50,Once in a lifetime,We had a great time visiting the Walk of Fame. The only downside is that is crowded all the time and vendors everywhere trying to sell everything under the sun. Be prepared to walk and pay some fees for parking but it’s worth every second. Enjoy the pics!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DwayneandCamille
50,AN EXPERIENCE LIKE NONE OTHER,OMG!!!! The Hollywood Walk of Fame is an EXPERIENCE LIKE NONE OTHER. We arrived off the tour bus and right at the STARS.

OMG!! is WHAT I CAN SAY!!!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q901XKjonathand
40,A very touristy thing to do,If your first time in LA of course you must visit Hollywood and check out the Walk of Fame for the Stars on the sidewalk. Not terribly exciting but one of those tourist visits you must tick off the list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanosV8

40,Nice,It was great to see all the stars names and all the attractions on the walk of fame. The bad thing about it is that it is dirty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/726nigelp
50,Cool to see,"If there are stars you know you want to see, be sure you've looked up exactly where they are located! It's cool to see the stars but it's an extremely crowded and busy street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laraleifs
50,A Must Visit when in Los Angeles,This walk lasted a quite a few blocks and it was fun to look for some famous stars names. People would stop and kneel down to take pictures. Remember to put on comfortable shoes when visiting there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCMMZhang
30,Underwhelming!,"I'm not sure what I expected, but I was underwhelmed. The stars are randomly set in a scruffy street and are difficult to read, often damaged and just offered no wow factor to me unfortunately.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933beea
30,"Cool, but gross and touristy","Find the star you want, take a pic and leave. The street is full of desperate folks wanting money and attention for not a lot in return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shane8888
20,Tarnish Town,"When you think Hollywood, you think glitter and glamour. Not the case. It’s run down and dirty. The sidewalks are crowded with tourists and vendors selling you tours, food and cheap souvenirs. There was also a problem with panhandlers stopping me ever few feet asking for money or something to eat. With the large crowds it made it difficult to see the star’s stars. Glad I got the chance to see the Walk of Fame, although once is enough for me. It was okay during the day, however I wouldn’t want to be there once the sun sets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmilyP484
50,Make it your own,"Don't let others influence you. If you are already interested in it, go for it! This is so much fun! Just walk around. See where the rich and famous are and where the people sleep on the street on their stars. Walk into the wax museum, shop, see the Hollywood sign, have someone draw a picture of you . You can get a map to drive yourself around too see where stars live. Or take a guided tour. Tours are fun and informative. Make some research where to eat, and buy trinkets for very very cheap! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bingitt
50,If your in Los Angeles it's a must do,What a great place the Hollywood blvd seeing the stars on the walk of fame. Getting pictures taken next to your favorite star and a place where you can get your picture taken in front of the big hollywood sign. So many wonderful characters that dress up to look like the person in the star. but watch out if you have a picture with them they will want money. outside the chinese theatre where foot and hand prints in cement of stars to compare your foot size with them,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woebetide
50,Nice ...,"You will always find at least three stars whose work you’ve adored your whole life. I was very happy and proud when a street vendor asked if I was from India and commented, someday Shah Rukh Khan would have a star here ....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/776rajatd
40,It's a must seeq,"Everyone really should see the Hollywood Walk of Fame if they're ever in the area. And by that I mean you should walk a block and call it a day. The area is pretty seedy and I didn't really enjoy being there, but I wanted to see a bit of the Walk. I enjoyed the Disney stars outside the theaters, and was excited to happen upon Betty White's star, but I didn't go hunting for my favorite celebrities. It's a 1-and-done kind of activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaniC4590
30,Can say I did it once,"spent the day doing landmarks of LA and we thought the Walk of Fame would be fun. We did it once, but would never go back. You see one star.....you have seen them all. If a celebrity was actually getting a star that day it would be exciting.While walking along the street we were accosted several times with people selling CDs.very aggressive panhandling and none of us felt comfortable. we took some photos at Graumans Chinese Theater but didnt go in to see a show. we then decided to visit the wax museum along the same street. very expensive and not nearly as good as the one in SF. We were glad we experienced it but didnt stay long. For me, not impressed enough to ever go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NovelleL
20,Underwhelming,It was great to see the star lined street and to find some of your favorite stars. It is basically several sidewalks that have huge crowds walking up and down them so I found myself stopping in the middle of people trying to walk to get a glimpse and picture of some of the star who's names caught my eye. It is so iconic that I felt I had to go and see it and I am glad I did (saw the hand and foot prints of the start in front of the TLC theater at the same time). I have no need to go back. it is an unattractive part of LA and full of tourist crowds. If you are going to go I suggest going early and making your time walking around short and sweet.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Myflowergirls2
40,Worth a visit!,"It's nice to walk around and look at the stars on the Walk of Fame! It's one of those 'touristy' things to do in Hollywood, but fun none the less. You can walk for quite awhile, the stars go on and on.The only thing I didn't like, was that area on Hollywood Blvd. I found it to be dirty, with garbage on the street. Sometimes you can be approached by 'interesting' people. Not the most appealing area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DSpad
50,Fun,Always great to see the stars on Hollywood Blvd. Hard to find the ones you want to see but there is an App for that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTraveler1976
50,Goes forever,"It was very interesting seeing all the Stars along The Walk of Fame, But I didn't realise that they actually have to pay to have a star with their name on it, I just thought they were given to famous people, it goes on for Klms and very interesting seeing all the old actors along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmason15
30,Expect the unexpected!,"So for years on TV, I have seen the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and had formulated a very definitive opinion of what I would see. The surprising part is it was quite a bit different then I had expected. I would characterize this as somewhat of a people adventure, where the people hanging around on a typical day will provide much more entertainment then anything else.I saw and experienced more interesting people in touring this area of Hollywood then anywhere else. And needless to say none of them were famous.Also consider the level of adventure based on the time of day, after 10:00 at night it gets really interesting. All in all we were safe, and had lots to talk about after spending a couple of days off and on in this area of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_tornado67
10,Dirty,I was blown away with the feeling of how dirty everything was with garbage In The streets and trash everywhere. Also felt very unsafe with amount of strange people and lack of police presence at a tourist attraction. Parking limited and a good ways away. Make sure to visit this place during the day for safety reasons and in groups.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewhC5452QY
20,Interesting,"We visited in Jan 2018 and was I surprised. I didn't read up on any reviews of Hollywood prior to visiting the walk of Fame, so I had no expectations but it was so dirty, people on the street every 20 metres asking you if you want to go on a tour and people trying to sell you CDs and dvds. I couldn't get out of there quicker. The times that we were left alone it was interesting to see all the names on the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessm498
50,EXCITING,"Holidaying in your country with wife for 2 months. First in 2013 & now 2017. Both times stayed at Loews Hollywood which is right on the doorsteps of walk of fame. LOVED walking in the different areas to see the different stars exciting to see stars of people I grew up watching on TV, listening to on the radio. Lots of stars I don't know so finding out information on these people & how the affected their industry. Goes on for miles even down near Capitol Records building. Never have found a place that has the complete map that tells you what streets/roads particular stars are situated on. Still haven't seem them all. Hoping to get back there again one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickt2311
20,Average,"On a sunny day not bad to go for a walk here but it’s not a very appealing street. A lot of the people on the star are unknown to me. I guess the stars who are on it are vain enough to pay for it. Its a bit of fun to walk around and perhaps see some stars of famous people but it had a vibe of poverty on the shops, streets and people. Busiest place was around the chinese theatre but it didnt feel special. Theres a quiet mall next to it and then you can walk quickly back to the metro and get out of there.Would not come here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryO81
50,My self-guided hike,"Yes, it is a bit of a hike, so wear comfortable shoes. I decided on doing this in the middle of the week to avoid crowds and I'm glad I did. There was plenty to see and the food smelled great, as I looked for familiar names on the stars. Of course, you have to be cautious of opportunists, looking to make a buck and you will see homeless people on the sidewalk, too. All that glitters, isn't gold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harry_Hughes3
30,Worth seeing but underwhelming,"Spent over an hour walking and reading the names on the stars.It was great at first but there is really a lot of people that you don’t know and your kids will not know and therefore perhaps not great for the whole family.Was surprised that some actors had more then one star, not sure why that is.We did the walk early afternoon and as we progressed down Hollywood Boulevard, the crazies appeared. We did not feel threatened and were not approached by any but we still felt a little unsafe.Very touristy and hence the push from tour guides whilst you are walking but they were ok.Definitely worth a look. I think the tip for early in the day is the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannab692
30,A bit disappointed!,So obviously we had to visit the famous walk of fame whilst in LA just to see the stars. However it was so greatly disappointing firstly the place is just packed with people you can't even see theFloor and it's so dirty everywhere it's just constantly stunk of old rubbish bins. It's great to see the Chinese theatre it I would recommend just driving the strip instead of walking around- I Felt like I needed a good wash after being here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joeyanna1234
40,All your Hollywood Dream!,"A full 1-mile route each way and be prepared to walk. It is often nice to try to find the Stars that you love to have the photos taken with. There are many buskers and costumed personnel which do expect small tip if you want photos taken with them - for this, do be aware not to take photos of them without their permission. Always ask if you want to!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TriStupe
30,Friends looking at friends,Hollywood is kind of interesting if you walk on the famous Stars.... Other than that it is just like anywhere in LA...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donh941
40,Busy and Fun,"This was my first time in California and I had to most definitely visit the walk of fame. First of all just be prepared because the streets and sidewalks are very very crowded and busy! My wife and I Participated in a walking tour which was very informal and we also enjoyed many shopping malls and stores on the strips. There is a lot to see and street performers come out at night. Don’t be afraid of the bums just keep it moving when you feel afraid. It’s just like any other big city , huge, busy, people trying to sell you things, good food and selfies. It’s the Experience that counts!!! Have fun and make sure to ride at least one double decker bus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superfresh85
20,Walk of fame,"It definitely isn’t what I expected, nothing glamorous about it.At night I felt very uncomfortable and not at ease, the day was better, lots of homeless people on the walk of fame, made me feel sad.The best time too walk, the walk of fame is early morning when there isn’t so many people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rena1970
40,Reminds me of Times Square (for all the wrong reasons).,"It was cool to see, and I was surprised that some people had more than one star. Be prepared to be hassled for tours, mixtapes, and pictures from the random people walking up and down the street. Maybe an hour at most. Very touristy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rcgreen15
40,Start of day long trip.,"Enjoyed seeing the stars, theaters, etc. We were there early (before 9am). Some 'unsavory characters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeromeh894
50,Must see,The walk of fame is a must see site in LA. It’s great to see so many celebrities and their star achievement. Don’t forget the 1 star which isn’t in the ground. Can you guess who? Overall a good site to see. The area is very busy and can get crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shauns_Holidays
30,"An honour for them, dirty and average for you","While I'm sure it is a great honour for the celebs to be given a star, the actual area is filthy and crowded and while it was fun spotting names as you walked down the street I wouldn't plan on making this an actual activity for the day. I didn't expect much and wasn't disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zalgariath
30,Worth a visit - but once only,"We had visited previously on another trip, however, one of our group had not been to the walk of fame ......,It was a very busy Saturday and not really that much to see ...... shopping is Ok is you want souvenirs or clothes - especially sports",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hynet9
40,More than I anticipated,A fun jaunt down memory lane - filled with names you know and names you feel you should know. I wouldn't go to the area for just this but it was fun to get my boys pictures by Kermit the Frog's star. A silly and fun addition to a crazy street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385krisj
30,"Lots of Stars, but only of the sidewalk.",Too many people gathered in one place. But while using the Metro early one morning we did notice there wasn’t as much people.There’s a few street hawkers which you should try to avoid or have a chat to if you have time. They are interesting people who are in LA LA Land trying to make their dreams come true.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattmD8589MN
20,Disappointing to say the least.,"Visited this location as part of a guided trip and was looking forward to it as a big film fan. It was a massive disappointment. The stars are laid out on both sides of the street and lead down side streets as well but there appears to be no care taken with their layout. They are placed facing different directions and many of them are cracked, broken and appear disowned as there appears to have been no upkeep on them (despite this being part of the cost of having one in the first place). The area didn't contain many points of interest for myself outside of the Chinese theatre and the street appeared to be filled with people either begging or shouting abuse at tourists.There are many gift shops and a few restaurants in the area but this is not the most pleasant of areas for the walk itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/703garethm
40,Must see,"This is a must see if you're in the area. There are more stars on the north side of the street than the south side. I'd recommend visiting in the morning rather than the afternoon. We got down there at 9:30 before the TMZ tour and the streets were pretty quiet. By the time we returned around noon, the streets were so crowded you could hardly walk around, let alone take a picture next to a star. Poor Donald Trump's star was all defaced and people were stepping on it in disgrace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gaylek2018
50,Exciting place,"My family and I went to Disneyland for our sons 5th birthday and then we went Hollywood. Hollywood was exciting, very vibrant and lively. Hollywood Walk of Fame is unique experience. While walking on famous Walk of Fame we often stop to take pictures of our famous stars. There is plenty of shops and restaurants. If you are in LA area you should visit this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rahmanek
50,A Trip Down Memory Lane,"Connect the stars with your memories, Hollywood is in a rebirth. Spend a day walking Hollywood Blvd. and experiencing the visitors and the locals. Be wary of the street life while watching their interaction with tourists. The boulevard can be reached by subway from Union Station to avoid the parking. Have lunch or Dinner at 100 year old Musso & Frank's. Walk the Hollywood Roosevelt hotel lobby for a taste of the old days, it has been wonderfully restored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesv8
40,Just a street with the stars,When you think of Hollywood you think of the walk of fame but once you are there it is just a street with the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ashdodgirl
30,"Not Beverley Hills, but still worth a couple hours","First, for the uninitiated, Hollywood is NOT Beverly Hills. Don't expect glitz, glamour, fancy stores and stars. Hollywood lost it's glamour in the 1940's and has not completely recovered since. Expect tourist traps and seedy stores. However, Hollywood DOES have the movie industry history. If you can accept the seedy side of it, it's a fun couple hours viewing the stars on the sidewalk and finding your favorites, averting your kids' eyes from some of Hollywood's more risque offerings. Defintely stop at the Chinese Theater and fight the crowds to see the stars' foot and hand prints. Jackie Chan even left a nose print! Many famous movie and stage theaters are there, such as the Chinese, El Capitan, Dolby and the Pantages. Parking is easily found at the multiple parking lots on the side streets. Also a good departure point for tours of the stars' homes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814ianb
50,Fun with Stars,"Lots of Fun, walking from beginning to end on a round trip through out Hollywood Blvd. and finding the honorable stars from people that we liked the most, and getting excited about it.Photograph trip, history of the city, fascinating stores, restaurants, graffiti will keep you busy for about three hours, in a slow pace, almost 3 miles round trip with 2600 + stars to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/111jol
30,an icon that may be past its prime and time,"once on the must-see list of anyone visiting los angeles, the Hollywood Walk of Fame is a shell of what it once was. No longer does the area hold the allure of hollywood, it more closely resembles bourbon street with its dive bars, street performers, and people hocking wares.this is a shame since when you do take the time to walk down and see the many past (and current) names, it is pretty humbling and fun to recite the films, songs, or shows that person was known for.if go, avoid the summer when the heat, smells, and crowds can be overwhelming. also, as it can be a little dirty may want to consider donning a CDC Level 4 Hazmat suit if place a part of your body on a particular star.when i bring visitors, i prefer early fall or winter mornings or just after a rainstorm, where the air and streets are cleaner and quieter and one can glimpse what this once was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michael_dimaggio25
50,Great Tourist spot,The Hollywood walk of fame is quite busy over the weekend but a must visit if your destination is Hollywood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olumidek
20,Waste of time,Not what I was expecting. Just a badly maintenanced street where homeless asked for money and people tried to sell you staff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirsifromTurku
50,What a place !!,"I was told by my travel agent that I wouldn’t need more than a day as it’s quite boring ..well it was fun and alive and never boring I spend most nights just walking Around , Johnny rockets , hooters , the Hard Rock Cafe & Popeyes chicken were all amazing places to eat as we don’t have them in Australia 🇦🇺Hollywood & hyland shopping centre !! Lots of cinemas and wax museums, pretty woman apartment is just off it if your a fan !!Just beware of rappers trying to give you there cds as they will ask for a tip and can we very pushy , also anyone dressed up will say yes to a pic then ask for a tip !! Visit the Hollywood museum I’d you love old Hollywood !! Lots of tours leave from here :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/364kylieh
30,A bit disappointed!!,"Maybe I’d got the wrong end of the stick- but I was imagining a glamorous road with beautiful buildings and lights... kind of what you see on the tv. But instead we were greeted by a normal road, with sooo many homeless asking for money, and people trying to sell us tours and tickets. It was hard to see the names due to all the people and often, if you stopped to take a photo, you’d be immediately approached by someone asking for money. I’m afraid in the end we stopped looking and just carried on matching! The hand/foot prints outside the Chinese theatre was fab though!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaomiM255
30,This is like the Times Square of LA,"I really wish I could have enjoyed myself here more. The first problem for us was that we were with another couple and they were very high maintenance. If going to this place I suggest just going with one person, or having a plan on how to navigate it. There are people EVERYWHERE and there are also people trying to sell you stuff on the streets everywhere. The stars in themselves are very cool and I would go back to see a couple peoples, but I would definitely only go with one other person and I would have a solid game plan to tackle this crazy tourist attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sbodami
40,Very Crowded,It is actually what you expect. A crowded sidewalk with all of the movie stars you want to see. After a while you lose interest in the stars. With all of the tourists and the double decker buses it is a busy place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/847lucillem
10,"Dirty, Crowded & intimidating","We were so looking forward to see it that we got an Uber from downtown as we had only few hours left.

If you can skip - do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dreamylemon
30,Not what I expected,"I been wanted to visit this place for a long time, It was not what I was expecting really is very dirty, small, crowded and expensive.

50,Wow so many things to see! You can park for $25 all day at a nice garage!,"We found the walk of fame that is not located on a street named avenue of the stars. You have to drive to the heart of Hollywood to get there! You may find a lot of people trying to make a living with photos of movie hero’s, or a shop may have your favorite gift. You may even get to walk on the red carpet like we did a day before the Star Wars movie came out! You can do many free things in Hollywood it just takes timing. Everyone always has a great time so have your cameras ready you never know who you might see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yehbut
50,Definitely a walk down memory lane,We spent some time walking the walk and talking the talk about the stars! Was a great way to have a family chat about stars and who they were... an important part of your LA trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1604RUpaular

My husband and son returned to the area in the evening, lots of crowds. They said that it didn't look as bad when the sunshine didn't show the flaws.

20,Names on stars along the road,We found the streets the walk of fame went along were quite dirty. The shops along most of it are knock off lingerie stores or bong shops. And loads of people needing serious assistance (housing) along these streets. I would have thought the city would have pride in all of the names on stars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnWandereThomson

40,"Names, Names, Names","Walk of Fame is definitely a place you have to visit if you are in Los Angeles. But, I would say that it is wrong to consider Walk of Fame an attraction per se. In other words, since this is part of Hollywood Boulevard, it is good that you see Walk of Fame while you are on your way to other attractions on Hollywood Blvd, such as Dolby Theater, Hollywood Museum, Madame Tussauds etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lekler
10,Not what it’s cracked up to be,"Watching movies and pop-culture hammers into you the glamour of LA and the walk of fame. What an honour to have a star there.So we rocked up and it was not what we expected. The walk is not glamorous. It goes past car parks, dodgy sections, beggars and homeless. People in grotty costumes. People yelling and flailing their arms around. It goes for a long while in front of not so cool places. The area itself is dodgy.Did not feel safe and did not enjoy it. We didn’t bother walking far. LA was a let down. You should street view it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielAiello
50,Fun To Look For Stars,"Even with a map showing the locations of the different Stars, it is still hard to locate certain Stars, because there are so many of them. It was really fun just to walk & find random Stars. It was also a very nice long walk, not only looking for Stars, but also enjoying the many different stores & shops along Hollywood Blvd. Just beware of heavy crowds depending on the time of the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeH-LI_NY-ExPat
50,Walk of Glamour,This is a free activity but priceless!To see Jay Leno's star and know he had slept homeless nearby as a young man breaking into Hollywood...this is a reason these stars are so important to visit and take care of.There are restaurants around. There is an old hotel with a bar close by. Imagine old Hollywood and then go find the most recent stars for the most recent beloved.

Best not to go in direct sunlight, I prefer the mornings or evenings when the sun isn’t directly overhead, or the fall/winter when all of LA is perfect during the day time!Just know it’s mostly shopping and site seeing, and taking pictures of your favorite stars “star”!

I had a guy yell F@@@ You because I was sitting in a parking spot waiting for my GPS to load. Another flipped me off because I let a car cut in front of our lane.

40,A Must See in Hollywood,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is iconic. If you love the movies and Show Business, then this is a Must See.The truth is, this area is Very Touristy, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Not many locals hang out here, but there is a lot to see and do. Bring your camera, as you will have a lot of memories to take back with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349darrylh
30,Depends how much you love the Hollywood star,"Typical tourist place! There is super crowed and busy. not much to see in general unless you are very into Hollywood Star.

Actually, they want to get money from you for taking a pic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zitalai
20,"Very dirty, sleazy and didn’t feel safe","Very disappointed with the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Loved seeing all the stars with names but was very disappointed that the street was not kept clean, the stars were all dirty considering it’s a major tourist attraction.Lots of sex shops on the boulevard mixed with lots of beggars didn’t make it a suitable place to take children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fairyfairhurst2014
40,a Must See when in LA,"it is a fun thing to do. looking at all of the Stars Star and knowing they were standing right where you are. a Great Tourist attraction and checking it out leads to other great Hollywood finds.

50,"A Hollywood, Shining Star!","I'm star struck especially with old Hollywood stars like Cary Grant, Judy Garland, Jimmy Stewart and Audrey Hepburn. It's mesmerizing to walk down Hollywood Walk of Fame and see all the famous icons name's appear right before your eyes as you walk down the boulevard. This is truly the shining star of Hollywood, California, the unique Hollywood Walk of Fame. Keep your phone handy to take pictures of your favorite star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

30,Not that big of a deal!,"If you are the star struck type, perhaps you would enjoy walking on Hollywood Blvd and see the Stars' Names on the sidewalks. But having lived in Los Angeles all my life, I think it is a total touristy thing. It is crowded with tourists, a lot of strange people, dressed up in costumes looking for handouts and lots of touristy stores looking to sell you junk touristy things. I would not go out of my way to see this, unless you really want to see names in cement. The Chinese theater is interesting in the area because of all the foot prints of many very famous stars of yesterday. Plus the architecture of the theater itself is interesting. So if you find the ""need"" to go to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, check out the outside and inside of the main theater at the Chinese theater.. I think you might be disappointed though with the Walk of Fame..total tourist trap. No one who lives here goes there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K5251NMkathyg
30,"Fun, but plan on other things to do",It’s fun to walk but make sure you have a plan of where you’re headed in Hollywood and go during the day. Night time is a hectic time in Hollywood and it’s not the best neighborhood. The stars are fun to happen across an actor you admire or musician or the like so the sponteneity adds to the experience. In the end it’s just a sidewalk...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BennySD
10,Read the names elsewhere - crowded and cumbersome,"A real waste of time. You'll see a name you recognize, and you'll say, ""Look! It's (someone famous)"". And so what? The names are embedded into a sidewalk with an icon of the field that they were in. These are not autographs, these are not photos, these are not even handprints. It is not even a list of names, which would be infinitely easier to read. It is instead a name written on the ground, amidst a pushing crowd, all of which makes it difficult to walk and read at the same time. After 10 names, trust me, you'll be done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkane8
40,My Walk with the Famous and Not So Famous,"I could not leave L.A. without walking on the stars of people I will never meet! It was not an easy feet (pun intended). Of course it was busy and if you walk with your head down, you run the risk of bumping into people. I was able to track down the stars that I wanted to see. It was also a challenge to find stars. I would recommend getting the address of the stars that you wish to see ahead of time.p.s. I will be submitting my application!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rivka13
30,Must see but brace youself,"The stars are what they are. It is interesting to do the walk but along the way you will be faced with trashy souvenir shops, gawking crowds, panhandlers and religious barkers in one area. Better during the daytime as well. Hollywood Blvd has a different look after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7011UDmichaelp
40,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"All stars names are carved on the walkway, spread across almost 3 miles on both sides of walkway on Hollywood Blvd. Starting from 10, 11 AM, walkway gets crowded and hence might have to wait to capture pic with your favorite star walk of fame.Preferred to visit mornings, before 9AM or so.Also, remember that a lot of walking is involved and required.I'm there around Hollywood Blvd area, and hence got chance to visit this place couple of times in a span of 3days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Satish_Kolla
30,Just Ok,Took the family into the city to see the walk of fame. Nothing special. It was very crowded and filled with tons of street vendors and CD peddlers. I guess it was nothing more than a bucket list item to say I have been here but likely no need to return,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jnc7200
40,Fun for tourists,"Hollywood Boulevard is not glamorous, but something that every tourist must do. It is fun to walk down the street and read the names of celebrities embedded in the stars on the sidewalk. There are also historical sites like the Pantages and Egyptian Theaters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerryTraveler240

40,Quick stop to walk along the Stars,"I would compare this place to walking through a much smaller version of Times Square in NYC. Lots of people, characters, vendors, and street food packed in around big name businesses. We walked a few blocks one direction, grabbed some Starbucks, and then walked back to our car from the other side of the street. It was worth the quick 45 minute stop to see the stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Choolwhip

30,Crowds of tourists,If you’d like to see you favorite movie artist’s star then this is for you. Otherwise not much to see unless you go to standard tourist venues like Toussaud’s or Guinness Book of World Records.

30,First Time!!,"You see it in movies, but just wanted to experience first hand. My daughter wanted to see it, so we came here while in LA. We came at night, and the boulevard was buzzing. From the low rider cars, and bikes, it was a sight to see. There are stores and bars all along, and we saw stars name. This is something to experience since it is a Hollywood attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevina520

40,OK but still wonderful,This walk was okay but many of the stars were old time actresses and the stars were not well preserved with many cracks and patches throughout the walk. Do NOT BUY TICKETS FOR TOURS. It is a waste!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sidarthg2017
30,Wish I had read the reviews 1st!!!,"Ok where to start?Bucket list tick, Experience definitely not what I expected & really wish I had read some of these reviews before I went.Firstly I really wish I had taken a pocket full of quarters or $1 bills.Yes the stars are dirty but so is every footpath & this one has thousands of people walking on it a day so what do you expect?The areas change pretty quick from lively entertainment stores to increased smoke stores & the odd intimidating character, but just cross the road & come back down the other side.Dressed up characters & entertainers everywhere. Some very forceful with absolutely no shame. Get your photo taken then all of a sudden the comment ""And all l/we ask for is a tip"" Now this is where the quarters & even $1 bills could have come in handy but after a photo with a couple of Jonny Depp characters the smallest note I had was a $5 & I did feel caught off guard & handed it over, they where great lookalikes so didn't mind until the one I paid asked ""And my friend?"" I was more prepared for this rudeness & said cut it in half or tip me for using my phone.Next came the tour promoters & yes 98% where terrible but a couple did offer a really great rate so after doing some research I might look into it if I have time.The homeless didn't bother us too much but there was a couple of moments they make you feel bad or ask for things, We got a hotdog that was overpriced compared to the larger cheaper tastier version I had in Toronto. LA $5 - Toronto $3 but I probably should have asked for a price before asking for one. Next thing a young girl was asking us if she could have one because she has tried for work but can't get any and was starving etc I wanted to believe her & got her one too.Next came a rap artist selling his music & we say No but then they are writing it out to you & signing it while asking for small tips of say $20, $15 or most give $10 but when I said sorry $5 or nothing they seem happy to take it.I wanted to give the odd $1 to street performers if I was interested in watching but that's just me.I was lucky enough to find one shop where the guy was telling me what to watch out for (too late haha) & offer fair prices on some hats $5 each & discount for 3 so that was good & was the same prices as a huge store having a clearance sale so wasn't totally robbed blind but my advice is take change & take control.Maybe you should get a tip for those people meeting you or maybe you understand they are just trying to make a living too?I will go back a little wiser to make sure I didn't miss anything but only if I have some spare time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaunc311
30,Not what I expected,This is basically the sidewalk of hollywood bvd which gets very dirty in some spots. Its charming to see the names of stars but this sidewalk is not the best part of the city to enjoy a walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadial561
30,Meh! Crowded & sleazy!,"We came here with relatives to show them ""Hollywood""! Even though we live in the LA area, the only time we come here is when relatives come into town!

Lot to learn from the United states.Minus, quite crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanngure

30,Glitz and Glam,"It's a great thing to be able to tick off your bucket list but the Walk of Fame isn't all it's cracked up to be.

40,Walk of stars,"Take your camera with an empty card... you'll need it! So many stars, so many names from actors to musicians that I like... picture + picture + picturessss.

You will find also a lot of street artist dressed of numerous characters but be aware that to take a picture you'll have to pay!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761sarat
30,A bit overrated in my opinion,Was expecting more. Most of Hollywood boulevard is pretty much run down and quit gross! The walk of fame is pretty much all of Hollywood boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kovilan_Naidoo
30,Overhyped,"I’ve visited before but this time, my husband was with me & we walked along the sidewalks. The stars are neat to see but I feel like they’re kind of a overhyped. Not well taken care of and even defamed in some spots. Worth a visit if you’ve never seen them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VioletMN
30,Fun but overrated,"It's fun... for 5 minutes. After that, you'll probably get tired of looking at a dirty pavement.Also, beware of the people who let you take photos with their pythons: they tell you one price then get mean if they think they should get more, for whatever reason.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValayaR

30,Not glamorous at all,"For some reason I had expected this to be glamorous but it wasn't. The stars are not very well organized as they run on both sides of the street in both directions at once so some looks like they are upside down. Some stars has more than one star, while others have none. It would have been better to give multi talented people more symbols on their one star IMHO. To make matters worse stars are given to some brands, which cheapens the walk of fame and makes it commercial. Also there were sales persons lining the street constantly trying to coax you into buying a celebrity home tour. People were walking all over the stars, there was a chewing gum on a star, people were stomping and spitting on a specific star. So sadly I think the Hollywood walk of fame are over rated and it's no wonder that some stars like Leonardo DiCaprio seems to have turned down the offer to have their star on this sidewalk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/268karins

Is that great might of been 30 years ago now as you try to get past Chinese tourists , homeless, street venders etc not that sure. its a fun thing to see as you wander down Hollywood glad I have seem it but would not rush back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeilA1372

30,Disappointing,"More like Hollywood walk of grime- sadly this walk was disappointing and not what I imagined at all. Not only do men force their rap CD’s into your hands (who even uses CD’s anymore?), when you decline they say things like “ignore the black dude”, “it’s only a CD it won’t bite you” or “take your picture of the star and go.” KEEP YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS and walk on a mission to avoid these people who are just peddling crap to tourists...I was expecting maybe some nice restaurants nearby to eat at after- don’t bother there aren’t any- get straight in an Uber and move on once you’ve taken some photos of the stars you like.It was confronting and annoying- I wouldn’t ever go back but I guess when you’re in LA for the first time and it interests you, it’s a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliH1993

20,Not what I imagined,"First of all, there were people on the street everyday forcing you into conversations and pictures. What angered me most was the so-called famous ‘singers’ on the street handing out their CDs when people clearly did not want them, and afterwards asking for $5, $10 tips when they clearly didn’t worth the price!!! This is what I call theft to be honest. And when my Mum refused one, the “celebrity” called my Mum ‘mean lady’! This is what surprised me, people with such mannerisms can just harass tourists on the street, scary and hopeless.There were garbages on the ground, people selling stuff and covered up the stars... Very very uncomfortable I have to say, it was pretty disappointing since I was looking forward to visit it since I was a child.This is a very overrated place and I only recommend going there in the mornings where it’s not crowded. Because our hotel was right on hollywood blvd, we cannot possibly avoid the harassment on the street everyday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstylinson

50,Just as expected,Lots of stars on the ground for you to oh and ah over as you walk down the sidewalk. What I was not expecting was so many street vendors trying to hustle you or just be in the way . How annoying. I did learn that Mohammed Ali is the only star that is not on the ground. I would recommend looking for a location list is you are looking for a specific person. I couldn't figure out the method to the madness but I'm sure it exists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alaster83

30,Always crowded!,Be prepared to always see this place packed with tourists and specially on a weekend night. In my opinion this place is a little “meh” overrated but people love taking pics of their favorite celebrity stars. Parking will be no less than $20 on a weekend. Not sure of the weekday price. They sell a lot of crap everywhere and all kinds of weirdos and people dressed up in costumes so that you can take a picture with them for a $tip. There’s lots of souvenir spots here and a couple museums like the wax museum too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/682cindy
40,Trip,"I recommend wearing comfortable shoes, and to go during the day. There is a few homless people during the day but not as many as at night.

Overall good day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katieeee1234x
40,A walk with the STARS,It is the Hollywood experience you expect. The street hustlers are plentiful and in full sell mode. Have your picture taken with Marilyn Monroe or some Star Wars character.

Having said that, this place is just not as well maintained as expected. Homeless people, people trying to give you their cds for ""free"" etc etc...the place stank of pee, it was dirty and disgusting. This being such a popular tourist destination, it was very disappointing to see the lack of maintenance.

30,Good Fun To Go Star Spotting,"We really enjoyed the walk of stars, ticking off the celebrities as we went and hunting for some favourites.The place is a bit tacky truth be told, grotty even. But it's good fun. Too many gaudy souvenir shops and over the top window displays.

30,A tourist favorite.,"Its fun to say you've visited Hollywood Blvd. People want to see the stars in the sidewalk, the foot and hand prints at the Chinese Theater and all the interesting people walking around. There are many characters in costumes trying to sell you cd's and selfies. The tour buses to the stars homes make many stops on Hollywood blvd. There is a nice mall there and plenty of restaurants and fast food places. You can spend a few hours there just walking around and looking. The El Capitan Theater usually has the latest Disney film and the Pantages Theater has Broadway type plays. Just have fun, enjoy the scenery, the characters and remember you don't have to buy anything or spend money on anything if you don't want to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/berniek1949
30,Disappointing but had to see,"My family and happenes to be driving along Hollywood bld when the wife spotted the rock. So the wife and daughter hot out whilst I parked the vehicle.I think the rock was prompting his new movie. We walled around along the star walk and tbe family was disappointed at how dirty the streets were and the constant begging by homeless people and self made rap artist pushing there CDs onto the public and asking for a donation.Mind you thjs has happened to us at every major US tourist attraction. So be warnws id you are approached by people saying they are giving it away and come back at you with ""we are only looking for a small donation""I'd advise families to avoid this spectical cause your time is short and spend it on better things then the hollywood freak show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Falaniko

First of all, it was great to see all of those star sign with your favorite stars's names. Then sth start went off where we found walk of fame street is a total frauds and too dangerous to walk alone. You may encountered with people who force you to accept their cds and would asked you for money and would rip you off if you don't give them that money. Then there were a lot of people would called you in an awful way, a lot of them are scary too. I hate to say this wasn't something I would expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sokchettav
30,The sky is on the floor,"My hotel is Loews hotel and it is very very near to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. We did not take much notice of it since it is there all the time. However on Sunday late afternoon after we came back from a tour, we took a stroll along the stretch and thought it was Halloween as there were people in costumes loitering that stretch. Luckily, we were warned beforehand by our guide not to take any CDs or take picture with a particular Darth Vader character who is asking for usd$25 if you want a picture with him. These people in costumes will ask to take picture with you for a fee, some more aggressive & demanding than the others. Those giving away CDs are also asking for a fee to fund their music career. Interesting but beware.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7704366
30,Tourist attraction,It’s alway entertaining to stroll down the walk of fame. You never know what you might see. The weather was perfect and it wasn’t too crowded. Overall I felt safe but it just takes using common sense. Lots of vendors n people giving tours. I advise taking at least one tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damckin_99
20,Who Is This Person?,"The Walk of Fame has two unfortunate negatives. One is the location. Hollywood is a dive of a place. If they could make it like the 1930's and 1940's, it would be a wonderful, SAFE place to visit but alas the City has let it go down hill with all it's commercialism. The second negative is no one knows who the people on the stars. I do because I'm old and love entertainment. I think a blurb of who they are should be next to the start or a pamphlet they can carry and read who the people are. Maybe even an APP that you turn on and you can listen to when they walk over someones star. Hollywood has so much potential but no one is taking advantage of it. Sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michiganbartman

30,Not impressed....do your homework before going to avoid wasting time,"There has been a lot of talk about the 'Walk of Fame' and being being on holidays in California, we could not drive through LA without seeing it. check list! Done!It was a bit of a disapointment as I imagined it more classy and special!It's a very very long street and I advise you to search a bit before going if you want to see a special star. In my case, I wanted to see Marylyn Monroe, the Beatles and some others...We searched and even asked people along the way but it was quite a hassle and took us a lot of time.Now, you know, do your homework before and don't waste time.The Hollywood boulevard is not very clean, to the contrary there's a lot of spilled food and drink on pavements, specially in some parts like where Marilyn Monroe has a star in front of the McDonalds restaurant on the 6700 block of Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asthebirdflies

We walked he entire length of the Walk of Fame on both sides of the street, didn't feel safe and felt dirty after we were done.

The Staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was free and however if you need towels and other supplies such as phone changers, you will need to pay for those things from anywhere from $2 dollars to $10. Guests were very friendly in fact I had the pleasure of meeting people who were local and from other countries during my stay. Overall my stay at the Hollywood walk of Fame was excellent and I was happy during my stay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanrE9532JS

50,Shopping and site seeing,The shops on the walk of fans was very concur in pricing I expected since they were located on the walk of fame for them to be very costly. The stars were very interesting to see I had fun finding stars of many different stars. The entertainment that people were providing on the walk of fame made it even more better. There were varieties of shops that offered pretty much everything that you can imagine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jusanuff

30,Interesting and unique experience,"There’s tons of names on this street (both sides) that many people won’t be familiar with at all, the walk is very long however it’s still definitely worth a visit.The downfalls of this experience is street traders setting up shop right on top of some stars’ place, so not all names can be seen all the time, there’ll be a lot of people trying to force CDs onto you, despite I politely them I wasn’t interested, some of them didn’t seem to understand the message, the walkways can often get very overfilled with human traffic, making walking along the side walk can be a challenge at best during the worst times.Overall though, it’s an enjoyable experience, there’s people dressed as film characters (I remember seeing someone as Spider-Man, and another as Willy Wonka) these people won’t hassle though, which is good!Worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fiammanera1197

40,"SLEAZY, BUT WORTH IT...","It is somewhat sad, that the Hollywood of the classic movie era, exists no more. Now, Hollywood is a concept, rather than a place and ""Hollywood stars"" today are neither. Most live in other areas in and around Los Angeles or abroad. None have the glamour of the true stars produced by the greatest movie studio ever--MGM, now merely an office building. So too, is the way with with the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Hollywood Boulevard, the actual street, while much improved in recent years, is still a grungy, gritty place. Don't go there expecting glamour or actual stars--you will only be disappointed. That said, any visitor to Los Angeles should see it, as it is a shadow of what Hollywood, the place, once was. For those classic movie fans it is fun to find the star of those who you remember from the glory days of Hollywood. You will be equally surprised to see so many stars immortalizing people long forgotten who you have never heard of. The best way to see the Hall of Fame is to lower your expectations, treat it as it is meant to be--a walk down memory lane. Take your phone and google the people who have stars but you have no idea who they were. Approached this way, the Walk of Fame should be regarded as a fun museum of an industry that is no longer glittery and fun, but rigid and corporate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RandolphF_13
40,Finding a star,We walked around for a little and found several stars that we wanted to see. You can Google them or hope you have good luck :) we also stopped in a wedding place and watched a couple street artist create paintings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelsey2993
50,Stargazing and people watching,"Every time that I have a friend visit from out of town, they ask me to take them out to walk along the Walk of Fame. I appreciate the opportunity to see the Walk of Fame through the eyes of a tourist, given that I walk on it at least three or four times a week on my way to the grocery store or some other mundane errand, and often have to avoid stepping in something gross like dog poop or worse, something a human has left behind. Yet, despite its very lived-in character, the Walk of Fame has somehow retained its sheen of show biz glamour.Why visit the Walk of Fame? To me, half the fun is seeing how many other tourists are there looking for the stars of specific celebrities, posing next to them for photographs, pretending to kiss the star, or even pretending to cry for long lost idols in some cases! A couple of nights ago, I noticed a memorial wreath on the start of a celebrity who is death anniversary was that day. People really do come interact with the stars on the Walk of Fame, which stands as a testament to the allure and glamour of Hollywood, which has not faded much since its early days.If you are planning a trip to a specific star, you can find guides to situate where your favorite celebrities’ stars are placed. Be sure to spend some time on the Hollywood Boulevard strip near Highland, where there are many street performers wearing the costumes of beloved superheroes and licensed characters, as well as assorted musicians, magicians, comedians, and other buskers. You will also find numerous souvenir and gift shops where you can buy anything from keychains to, ummm, “smoking accessories,” plus a surprisingly wide array of curious and appetizing snack foods from all over the world - a reminder of the glorious diversity of Los Angeles! You will also find all manner of fast food, fast casual, and sit-down dining. There’s also a mall at Hollywood and Highland, as well as many local businesses, if you really need a new pair of shoes after walking in LA all day, or just really want some cool new threads from the entertainment capital of the world.However, as is evidenced by the various head shops full of souvenir “water pipes,” some elements of the old tawdry Hollywood Boulevard strip still linger on the Walk of Fame. There are number of lingerie shops and a very large Hustler store, so you may find yourself in some awkward conversations with your kids if they spot them. Be prepared. And be aware that LA has thousands of homeless people, many of whom live on the Walk of Fame because it’s full of foot traffic and great for panhandling. Please give back to our city by passing on dollar bills, your leftovers, or a sandwich from Trader Joe’s to a person (or a few people) in need. Be kind - they live here, and as a tourist, you can leave behind something positive in LA (and do so at the same time as you grab a cool snow globe for your aunt...) :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theaf2018
30,Expected More,"The walk of fame itself is quite a walk, but the ‘famous’ part of it that’s in and around the Chinese Theatre area’s actually quite small. It doesn’t take more than an hour or so to ‘do it’. Chinese Theatre’s definitely the highlight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brandons163
40,Fun and sobering if you do this with a younger person!,"This may not be something to go out of your way for- but I found it a lot of un.. Of course there are stars from many periods of Hollywood life and if you stroll with someone much younger than yourself ( I did) you will find that you remember a whole lot more names than they do! ( and I don't mean just the stars of the 30s and 40s but also the stars of the 50s and 60s ). Still, it s a lot of fun to remember the people who your parents loved or you remember from your childhood.

10,Disappointing - dirty and smelly!!,"Disappointing, would not return. Very crowed (which I was expecting) the main issue is the smell and how dirty it is.

The Apollo stone was on the corner of a crossing, try taking a photo whilst people wait to cross!Our overwhelming recollection is the sheer number of people trying to sell coach tours.... a polite refusal, acknowledged by a sarcastic comment and then repeated every 30 feet didn’t exactly make this a relaxing stroll.We don’t need to do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LocalizerUK

40,Hometown Visit,"Anyone expecting a glamorous experience when visiting Hollywood Blvd is in for some disappointment. Growing up in the neighbourhood, I knew what I was in for. I heard that the area had been gentrified which made me a bit sad. When we visited in November, I saw that from La Brea to Highland, Hollywood Blvd was completely changed! It's now more like an outdoor shopping mall than a street. So yes, a bit more gentrified. We had a great time at the Chinese Theater checking out all the footprints. Something I had never really done whilst living there. There are still the odd colourful characters.From Highland to Vine - it's completely the same as it was when I was in my teens. A lot of the same shops and haunts - my old pizza place it still there and the Supply Sergeant (a military surplus shop...very cool). I'm delighted to see Musso and Franks is still there. This is one of LA's oldest restaurants and worth a visit to this part of the Blvd.What can I say - it was a trip back in time for this Hollywood kid. I'm good for another 25 years. Except next visit to LA, we WILL dine at Musso and Franks. This is a 'must do' if you like old school restaurants, but we missed it this time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J4557WXveronicab

30,Worth the visit but don't expect it to be all nice and clean,The area is not really nice so don't go expecting to find the sidewalk all nice and clean.

They happened to be filming outside one of the theaters while we were there and the kids thought that was cool. Got some fun pictures. Glad we went...definitely worth doing once. The downside is that we were disappointed with how filthy it is on most of the strip...not comfortable being out there too late at night either (for those two reasons I only rated it with a 3). It seems like it could be cleaned up since it is such a tourist attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnc763

30,Fame...,"The Hollywood walk of fame interesting, was slightly let down as I didnt realise that it was on thr pedestrian walking pavement. No matter. Seeing the famed hollywood nearby made up for it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackieBridget2
50,Fun,"Even though I was born here, its fun to take visitors down the walk of fame and take photographs.So many stars to look for, it was fun and easy. Good way of walking off lunch too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saw55
40,Busy area,Came here on a starline tour and didnt have quite enough time to have a proper look around.But it is quite a crazy place with alot going on..Cool to finally see the stars names on the boardwalk and to get few photos of your favourites.Plenty of Souvenir shops around..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Racheenz
30,"A Quick ""See & Go"" Must Do","If you are focused on taking a photo with one of the stars of your favorite stars then this is a quick experience. Ignore all the touristy hoopla, unless you have fun with this stuff, take your photos and then take a quick walk down the street the Mann's Chinese Theater where you can check out the handprint and footprint molds of some old Hollywood stars. Allot 2 hrs max.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raqs2015
30,Dirty stars,It was cool to see but the pavement is dirty and hollywood boulevard is dirty. Not where I would want my name.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timtamalam
40,Interesting place to visit,"Officially this is a ""free"" tourist site that is really spread out over many blocks and side streets and lots to do. You can take pictures with characters for a tip. You can shop. Eat. Go to the movies. Etc. but it is a great place to peruse your favorite stars star and put your hands in the molds of others. I recommend it but it is no more than an hour stop if you are just looking at the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jrivvy
10,Classic tourist fare ..... Skip it and do something else with your time in LA,"If you like Times Square, Fisherman's Wharf, The World of Coca-Cola, or Captain James T. Kirk's future birthplace (in Iowa), then there's a small chance you'll enjoy the Walk of Fame. Even then, it's doubtful. The area is a total tourist trap, crowded with street vendors, panhandlers, over-priced ""attractions"" like Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, and the like. Why, pray tell, waste even a couple of hours here when you could be enjoying all the really wonderful things LA has to offer. Trust me, this isn't one of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fair-But-Tough
40,Friendly,The Walk of Fame was calmer than I expected. Though we did go before lunch. Was able to get a really deal by one of the sidewalk sellers for a tour of the Hollywood Sign and some of the local Star's houses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543mandya
50,Loved looking for all the stars,I'm not sure exactly how many stars there is but there is definitely a lot! Some looked new and some looked old and in need of repairs. I was really only looking for one which I ended up having to Google as it was a lot of walking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/591MICHELLES
40,Worth doing if you're in Hollywood,"Very busy street but worth doing it for the experience. A lot of cool shops and tourist attractions, you can look for your favourite actors on the walk of fame, and there are plenty of people dressed at spiderman, Marilyn, Minnie mouse etc. We didn't spend too much time there as it was crowded and very touristy, but worth doing if you're in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babsd33
50,LA trip,Had a good time looking for the stars. Went to see the Bob Marley star. Also went to look for the Selena star but didn’t make it. It had gotten pretty late by the time we headed out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miller9115
10,Streets were disgusting,"What an awful experience. Dirty streets, pan handlers were pushy and confrontational. One accused us as being racist since we would not take their CD. Just very awkward and nothing nice about it. Even the costumed characters stunk and were just sloppy. Made you feel like just running away. Not pleasant at all. Definitely not the glitz and glamour one would expect. More like dirty and slummy and a place to avoid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chevdiver
40,"Hectic, Funny and Unmissable","Full of characters, this strip of Hollywood is hilarious. While looking for the stars of your favourite TV and Movie stars or Singers, you'll be accosted by people trying to hand you their latest rap album, sell you tickets to things you don't understand and take you on tours to God knows where. Ask a friend, local or the person at your hotel for a rough guide and then just go and do your own thing. It's what you make it and if you want to have fun, you will!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mikel_Blooth

One afternoon, I happened to be there for a movie premier--stars, lights, camera, action!!! The next morning, I was there with the'street people.' It was a reminder that not everyone 'makes it' in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garycO7968VX
40,A must see but dirty,"One of the most iconic Hollywood attractions, the walk of fame is a must-see! It was lots of fun finding the names of our famous stars. It's also lined with souvenir stores to buy cheap rip offs of souvenirs. However, the street is dirty especially compared to Australian standards, and there a lots of homeless people. You are likely to be harassed by people trying to sell tours, especially if you look like a tourist, so keep a low profile if you want to avoid that. There are also lots of people in costume who will charge you to take photos with them. I suggest you do not engage. Please be aware that anybody offering a free mixtape is most likely handing you a blank CD and will make a scene if you don't tip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M6296NXryanm
30,It's nice to check off my bucket list..but not worth the return,"It's nice to walk through on a nice day but there are a lot of tourists and a lot of people asking for money. I would definitely not suggest walking this alone or alone at night. However, it was nice to take a walk to see some of the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annajG1440DI
10,Not all glitz and glamour,"Hubby and I arrived early September and we were not fans, yeah it's a great tick off on the bucket list but it is very dirty and the people that are right in your face claiming to be the ""next big thing"" and jamming cds in your hands saying it's ""free"" then hitting up your husband for $20 is not cool! 'If they get rid of those people it would be a much more enjoyable place.Tip to travelers don't make eye contact with them they do prey on travellers knowing that your not quick enough to get away from them and then they will con you out of $.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danib83

30,Still searching for its appeal...,"I've been to this place twice in 1 year. I only came back because I wanted to show it to someone else since it is a tourist spot. However, one visit is enough. Unless you want to shop around or eat in a buffet restaurant (will probably do a review later). Being a tourist spot, be ready for crowds, people wearing costumes or offering to take photos/tour with them, and the likes. In short, it was a really busy area. Also, when we passed by an adjacent street to where our car was parked, urine smell was really evident so it is best to keep expectations in check (low?).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/have_faith_BDM

30,Must see but once only,It’s a little underwhelming in reality but if you’re in LA and Hollywood you gotta check it out right,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Damo35
30,Maybe not at night,As a family this was a little sketchy at night. Lots of bars and clubs with street people. Multiple police vehicles were out. People were walking in the middle of the roads. Stars are fun to see on a quick drive on the street though to say you saw them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amber1127
30,Beware of the CD scammers,"Visiting is something that ticks off the bucket list but Hollywood and the Walk of Fame isn''t as glamorous as it first seems. You will find the CD scammers , beggars etc.The main attraction is the brass stars embedded in the sidewalks along 15 blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and three blocks of Vine Street in Hollywood.In the area one can visit the ChineseTheatre and the many souvenir stores located along this Boulevard.It is busy with many tourists visiting this popular attraction.Just have your wits about you as the CD scammers are in operation. I avoided speaking to them or making any eye contact. They will give you the CD and refuse to take it back and coerce payment. Another trick is to drop it if you refuse to accept the cd and charge you as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommomelbourne
30,WAY pass it's glory days.,"What used to be a place for the great and near great to be seen is now over run with tacky shops, homeless, star struck tourists, and people with mental issues. The walk way with the stars is showing a bit of disrepair. Go there, check it off the bucket list then go home and shower. The only place with any class was the Hollywood and Highland building where incidentally was the easiest place to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/702billh
40,Cool place to be,"With around 2000 starts (including Mickey Mouse, Quentin Tarantino, Bruce Lee and MANY more) on the pavement, this place definitely attracts attention! Starts, hands&feet prints, Oscar ceremony theater, souvenirs, shopping, food,....all that and more can be found around this area. So no wonder it's a bit crowded there....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/902mirkak
30,Weekend in LA,It's ok. Not what I expected. I would go just to say I went but it's not at all what I expected. Downtown LA is quite a disappointment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/champs3412
30,Touristy,Gotta do it once . It’s fun to see Greta Garbo hands and Clint Eastwood.. but its dirty there .. I’d go in the day time and make sure there is no film preview or special event . They block it all off if there is.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sansa31
30,"Not Really Worth A Trip, Unless . . .","Okay, so it's a sometimes (not always) nicely groomed sidewalk with the names of celebrities, mostly from Hollywood, engraved in the center of stars. Most of the time it is pretty crowded, and it is not far from a pretty gritty neighborhood. If you are one of those who is utterly obsessed with the Hollywood crowd and its contributions (or non-contributions) to the rest of society, it is probably not worth going out of your way to see this. It is possible, of course, that I say this because I am a long-time jaded Southern California resident who has grown tired of the Hollywood hype. You would be better off spending the same time in Santa Monica or Malibu enjoying the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Graemeauton
40,Yes it is,"You've seen it on TV, and read about it and thought you might bit ever get to see it. And then you do... Despite the, in my opinion, corny nature of it you can't help but eventually take a picture of one of the stars or two or three. Just get over it and walk along and have fun remembering the names and what they did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854glenm

30,Perfunctory visit but avoid the stretch after that.,Been there done that and don't visit again. That is how tacky this place is. Not to mention all those superhero hecklers asking you to take photos. What irritants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KamalMamat
30,Good to see,There were Latino Music Awards on the day we were there so half the boardwalk was covered up but good to see in person -enjoyed looking for names we knew. Very very busy area but enjoyable all the same.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittleWhiteBear_6
30,A Tourist Must,"Living in Los Angeles I don't go out of my way to visit the Walk of Fame. Yes, there are times I am on Hollywood Blvd. and I see the stars. I smile at some names, and am truly puzzled by others. I am also painfully aware that merit only partially factors in to getting a star. There are two other HUGE factors, who will attend the star ceremony and who is paying the fee which is now $35,000.Not to take away from the concept, but when i see people mention on social media that this or that person doesn't have a star, well it's because no one put up the cash!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorotheas117
30,Think the place have lost it’s vibes,Wanted to visit this place to have a feel of the walk of frame from TV. But was quite disappointed that this place was much run down and there is t much hype anymore. It’s just like another street down the road,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RolandTAN
40,Stars Stars,Pretty cool place not very clean but really neat. The old stars and hand prints bring you back to the good old days of movies and music. Lots of stores to shop in and places to eat. You can even get your picture with a few strange looking people in costumes. Pay to park makes it easier run us $20.00 but money well spent. This is one of the bucket list places you have to visit at least once in your life. Very weird things can be seen as well. Up in the mall area you can go up the stairs and get a good picture of the Hollywood sign up in the mountains pretty neat to see as well. Bring you dollars but keep them close and you should have a good time. Lots of vans to take tours as well (kind of pricey).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelalot184
20,Bullies on the footpath!,I was so looking forward to seeing all the stars on the footpath but as soon as we walked out of Dolby Theatre car park we were virtually 'attacked' by this big guy called 'Mr Muscle' who insisted on taking a photo with me and then my husband and then proceeded to ask for $5 per photo! We gave the money to him as we did not want to cause a scene but then straight after him then another guy giving out Cd's (saying he was the next big thing on the music scene) giving us his spiel and signed a CD (which we didn't want) shoved it in my hand and said a donation was needed!....I only had $2 on me and he was very aggressive saying that's not enough!...to keep the peace my husband gave him a few dollars more and we moved away from him. I did manage to take a few photos of stars on the footpath but the whole time we had characters asking to take pics with us etc....I was very annoyed by this stage and just wanted to get out of there!....if you do go you might just have to be firm with them and say NO as they are very aggressive. I think something should be done about them as for me it took away from the experience I was looking forward to. I will never return for a visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdhgirl
40,Caution is the word,"Hollywood hall of fame is a must see in LAI've read the other comments about the walk and all i can say is yes, it's dirty, thats a shame. Yes, there are lots of homeless people, but they know where the tourist will be and get the free handouts. Yes, you do have the entertainers on the street and they can be a bit aggressive, but just walk away no one says you have to give them money after you take a photograph, give them a dollar if you wish, they're not aloud to set a price. If you do go, just be aware of your surroundings and stay alert.Also, the area is loaded with undercover police officers, so there is a police precise around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gemadar2017

20,Visit to tick it off then go...,"Before arriving into Hollywood I was naive about the area and didn't expect what I found. Although I didn't expect glitz and glamour I expected something similar to Leicester Square or Times Square - bustling, lively and plenty to do....It's super cool to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame and see your favourite celebrities stars as well as the Chinese Theatre... that's pretty much all there is. With a bit of shopping, a Ripleys believe it or not and a wax museum that's where the entertainment ends.Poorly dressed characters loiter by the chinese theatre and the streets are lined with people hustling for money. The streets are dirty and unfortunately it appears Hollywood has a HIGH homelessness problem a lot of whom appear to have mental health issues and walk the streets with shopping trolleys. It's an area I didn't feel safe in and would have preferred more police to be around ensuring safety.I stayed a block away and at night sirens could be heard and we didn't want to venture out.I would recommend to visit the walk of fame to experience it, during the daytime but then to crack on with other parts of LA which are much more pleasant and welcoming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thefitnesswanderer

This usually doesn't bother me, however as you continue down the walk of fame you hit the Chinese Theater where you'll find grown adults dressed up in costumes. They'll try to get you to take a photo with them and when you do they ask you for a tip.... I would just stay clear of the area completely.

I just said no thank you and i found them all very polite,courteous and very friendly. Same with the people who are trying to sell you tours.

Did get to see some of the celebrities stars I chose to see but definitely wouldn’t go there again. Would recommend a visit to where the Hollywood sign is though , that was worth the hike.

30,Walk of Fame Hollywood Boulevard,"Well, what do you say that hasn't already been said about the Walk of Fame?It is a must-do if you are in Hollywood and it takes no time at all if you are there anyway.Just walk along the sidewalk and you can't help but see them. The hard part is - it is usually quite busy with pedestrians, especially around El Captian/H&H Hollywood Central area so you'll have to be quick if you want to stop and photograph your favourite celebrity (once you've found them).Do beware of husslers out on the streets. There are plenty of those too.This area is full of eating establishments, lots inside the H&H Hollywood and Highland Centre (straight across from El Captian).Toilets are also available in this centre.Hollywood Boulevard is a candy store for the eyes with a range of attractions to grab you attention.

There are many things happening here at the same time, people from all places and walks of life mill around checking out the stars of their favorite celebrities. Do not forget the handprints of the legends outside the Graumann Theatre. If you happen to be in LA, call the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to find out if a new star is scheduled for installation on the Walk of Fame during the time of your visit...you will surely see some stars during the ceremony. Also remember to see the outside of the Kodak Theater and go up to the third floor of Hollywood & Highland.

20,So many better things to do in LA,"I’ve lived in LA for 2 years and had never been to Hollywood so thought it was about time we checked it out. It’s underwhelming and honestly, just kinda gross. It was mildly entertaining seeing stars from celebs you know or like, but still not really worth the trip. If you’re just visiting LA there’s a ton of better things to spend your time doing than this. I went in the middle of the day and it felt pretty sketchy, can’t imagine what it’s like at night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/676bethanj
50,Fun Walk - Free - Parking can be expensive,"Start at La Brea and Hollywood Blvd and walk East. Do not park at the corner strip mall, they tow. Walk to the Mann Chinese Theater and try out your hand and shoes in the concrete impressions of the famous actors, old and new. check out the Hard Rock Store and restaurant. Walk to the Ripples Believe It or Not Museum (corner of Highland and Hollywood Blvd). Our teens loved it! Even I enjoyed it...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaVinca
30,"Very touristic, nothing really interesting",It's probably a stop you have to do when in Los Angeles for tourism but there's not really much to be seen here... a lot of stars on the floor and the chinese theater but otherwise it's just a road full of shops for tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MassimoCw

30,Ermmmmmm,"Right - i have to say i was slightly disappointed with this but at the same time it is one thing that has really stuck with me since i have come home, so it must have made some impression on me. I loved seeing the stars even if they were a bit dirty and damaged in places. The people doing the hard sell on things was the bit i liked the least. I found them quite intimidating when they walked right up to you but i didnt feel as scared as i did in san francisco. All in all i enjoyed it and it had to be done, just not sure I’d go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennycL4906PU
30,"Lots of Incredible Names, but Not As Glamorous As You May Think.","Hollywood is a city known all around the world. The names of on the Walk of Fame are people who have contributed and moved the entertainment industry and our society through their arts, talent, and influence.If you have never been to Hollywood, then just understand that it is a city and therefore you can expect characteristics of a city (ie. traffic, homeless, liter, etc). My first time going there as a kid I was very surprised how dirty it was. Eventually I ended up moving to LA as an adult and learned to take things in stride and appreciate the city for what it is.As long as you go here with realistic expectations you will have a better time.Overall, the Walk of Fame isn't much to see. There are just stars with celebrity names on the sidewalk. I would not lay on the ground for a photo unless you REALLY like the person since people spit on the ground all day.If you don't have much time to spend in CA, I recommend doing something else like go to the beach, mountains, or a museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeoNorth

20,Disappointing,This is a hard one to write.It is obviously a must-do when visiting LA but it is beyond disappointing how dirty & undermaintained this attraction is. Considering it would have to be one of the major drawcards into LA city itself I was beyond disappointed at how poorly the stars & the walk in general are maintained.I had been warned about it but was still surprised. I expected the sellers & the homeless & were able to deal with them & move on but some of the starts are even hard to read they are that filthy.The city of LA should be disappointed in themselves.

30,Hollywood is truly a packaged experience,"Hollywood Walk of Fame comprises more than 2,600 five-pointed terrazzo and brass stars embedded in the sidewalks along 15 blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and three blocks of Vine Street in Hollywood, California - Wikipedia . The walk down Hollywood Boulevard is a worthy experience just so that you can tick that box but that description is just what is... not much else ....The street feels like many other CBD streets with a number of shops and hawkers, lights and bold branding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/semedigital
40,Just as you imagined,"Michael Jackson is by far the busiest - hundreds of Asian tourist crowded around the star makes this bit of the walk a real sight.

40,Like getting closer to those who used to love,"That is a really nice memorabilia for people, shows etc. Because of the scandals going on now, it is distasteful and not too much has meaning. You approach to the each star with skepticism and caution. It is ""SAD"" as mr. t says",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreeJohnny
30,Watch Where you are Going,Hollywood is interesting to say the least. You can spot the locals because they are not looking down at the stars as there walk along the sidewalks.

40,I guess you have to go!,You can’t be in LA and not visit Hollywood but really a couple of hours is sufficient. If you plan to do any of the celeb tours do not book online or pay full price if you wait till the afternoon the tour guys on the street will offer it at more than a 50% discount price. If you want to eat 25 degrees on the walk of fame was an excellent spot for a good lunch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcg1979
30,"Fun to see, but do it during the day...","It's been years since I've been there, but I wanted to take my 17 year old niece who hasn't been. It was fun seeing who we could find. We didn't realize that there were also stars on Vine, as well as Hollywood Blvd. Capitol Records is on Vine, and we walked right up to it without realizing it. The Beatlles' stars, among other musicians are right in front of the Capitol Records building. I was surprised more people weren't crowding the street, but we went about noon, and I figured that most of the ones that frequent the area on a daily basis were probably sleeping somewhere else. After our show at the Pantages Theatre, it was clear that it might not be the best place to have a minor at during the evening. It was still fun, however. We walked along these stars for about an hour and a half, and got a kick out of it. I wish someone in the city would take care of these streets a little better. It is a little run down. Still worth seeing though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benzslkgirl
10,Meh,For being a California native this was really my first time walking down the fame. Obviously it’s a touristy thing and the folks hanging around charging for you to take photos with them I suppose is expected.

Don’t waste your time, it’s not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danni19721972
40,Interesting to see and a great place to people watch,"This is definitely a good place to people watch. There are a lot of weirdos out there, especially around the Chinese Theatre. This area is always crowded no matter what time of day. If you do want to avoid the crowds then the best time is really early in the morning. I was very impressed that they really have cleaned up the area down by Hollywood and Vine where the real celebrities like Cary Grant and Clark Gable are. When I visited many years ago, the area of Hollywood and Vine was in a dumpy and dirty and kind of scary end of the Walk of Fame. I was pleased to see that they are taking care of that end of the walk. Now there is a Trader Joe's at that end of the walk and they look like they are working on beautifying the area. Around the Chinese Theatre though, there are a lot of characters, dressed in costumes, and if you take a picture with them, you do need to pay them. Lots of souvenir shops along the walk, fast food places, etc. Definitely something for everyone on the Walk of Fame. Personally, I like it...it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think it's something to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbrenz
40,Fun to see!,"While the neighborhood is a little shabby, it's a fun walk down memory lane. For those old enough to remember some of the older ""Stars"" seeing the radio symbol for some was cool.

50,Everything Goes,"If you want to have fun and have some good laughs you have to visit the walk of fame. We loved it but you have to keep your eyes open. There's lots of homeless people and people begging for money. There's lots of street vendors selling stuff and don't get fooled by the weird people dressed up. If you take a photo they try to demand money. There's also no named rappers trying to sell their music CD'S which are junk. Besides those negatives there's a lack of law enforcement. We didn't see 5 police the entire week and this is where they are needed. The walk of fame is definately a must see but make sure your safe while there. I kept my wallet in my front pocket. You can visit Jimmy Kimmel Live, and lots of cool shops, and things to do. We went to see some 4DX movie and it was $140 for 4 tickets so that's not cheap and no I wouldn't do it again. We did enjoy a local pizza shop off the walk of fame. A piece of pizza is about $8 but it's very good and worth it. Other than that once you see it you have seen it. Not a place Id revisit but worth a look. If you want a hotel right in the center of this stay at the W. The reviews on here weren't great but we visited it and it's NICE!

On a walking tour we found out that each person pays 40grand for each star, and the local council are responsible for keeping it in good condition. I would be complaining if I had my name down there. Now, the stars are going to get dirty as tons of people walk across them everyday but it is clear that these haven't been cleaned or maintained in a long time. It's such a shame to see them in this condition, as they are one of the selling points of the Hollywood Walk Of Fame. Very sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinyredpanda

The thing is this , search for the name of several of your favorite celebrities who either has their signature or foot / shoe print inscribed then have a photo taken with it . After it is done , no need to go back . Do this in the evening , this week has been a thermal experience when you are in the city and it might hamper the experience.

At the other end of Hollywood Blvd. is the Pantages Theater, a spectacular 1930s theater, but you'll have to manage to get inside, as the outside is unimpressive.In between Highland and Vine streets, you'll find the stars in the sidewalk and the boulevard itself.

The street is disgusting full of rubbish and homeless people everywhere and it stinks. The place needs a whole new upgrade. The stars go up both streets and is a long walk to see it all. It is very difficult to get anywhere as everyone is looking down at the stars and the shops around are all tacky, quite creepy and expensive.

40,Quick Stop,"Stayed in Hollywood after spending the day at Universal. The Walk of Fame is really cool the first time you see it. It’s a great mixture of old and new stars. It’s a lot more spread out than you’d think so it would be beneficial to google the locations if you’re looking for specific stars. The most populated areas can be extremely difficult to negotiate as there are usually a large amount of people congregating. There are always street vendors and performers congesting the area as well. As with any attraction, the best time to go is in the morning.If you’re not used to seeing large amounts of homeless people it may be a shock initially. At first you’ll feel sympathy, but then you’ll see someone urinate on a wall while you’re waiting to cross the street or have someone cuss you out because you gave them a plate of food when what they really wanted was cash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrish77

40,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"This was the “we just got to town what do you want to do” tourist attraction. It was a random Wednesday in October and about 5pm when we arrived and not busy at all. We parked in the garage just off Hollywood Blvd on Vine, and walked down to the Chinese Theatre. Lots of familiar names on the street and plenty of shops along the walk to pick up the must have souvenirs or just to window shop. I was pleasantly surprised at how “not to dirty” the area was and for the most part it is family friendly. But at the same time, there is a level of caution that should always be used. Lots of peddlers that at times were a little aggressive but just say “no thank you” and they will move on. Overall it was a very cool and fun place to see in person after only seeing it on tv and movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G9778DIjimh
40,Worth a Visit,"Landed for my final journey to see some old friends living in LA...First stop was Hollywood..It was nice to see, one big long road full of walk of fame stars, the Dolby theater, plenty of tourist and photos to be taken, the Hollywood sign in the background.I wouldn't go back again as i have see what all the fuss is about but i wouldn't put it down as a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeanC1586

It was nice. There's the normal solicitors, costumed superheroes and a rather creepy Spongebob. I felt safe the whole time, everyone followed the ""rules of the road"" while walking, so there were almost no people-clogs, only right in front of TCL.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/britniro

Search for your favorite actor/director name, can take pics with people dressed as your favorite movie characters but bit ready to pay tip.

Also check out the building where Dolby sound theatre is, Oscar award show happens",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/441ipsitad
30,Doesn't Live Up To Expectations,"Maybe it's just me (but I suspect not) that you envisage the walk of fame being a wide boulevard, all clean with maybe the odd palm tree. If that's what you think you'll be disappointed. It's a normal street which is dirty, boasts a string of cheap souvenir shops and the only 'stars' are the stars themselves.On the plus side it is free and you will recognise some of the names on the stars (names may appear more than once since the stars are awarded for various categories (radio, motion pictures, TV) and there are apps that you can download to help to locate them.You don't need a guide since you can either park nearby or get a taxi.This is a 'has to be done' attraction but don't expect too much!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Philip_Marsh
30,It's okay,"The walk of fame is long, with lots of stars and after we saw a few names we recognised, we soon got fed up. Hollywood is a bit tatty / tacky, and we were glad to leave to be honest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardN28
50,Worth doing!,Took us about 2 hours to walk the entirety. Had a stroller and found it easy to navigate through. We did metered parking so it was a very cheap excursion for us. Kodak Theatre is the only area we experienced congestion. We went early in the morning and left just as the volume of people was picking up. Will definitely do it again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelandCuisine
30,Walk of Fame,"A nice place to visit to see attractions such as Walk of Fame, The Chinese Theatre, Rock Cafe and others. Watch out for the guys who 'give away' CDs. For a donation! Suddenly you find it costing $20!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilanS509
30,Im not too sure about this place,Youll find good little stores and food places yet theres a few weird people who shouldnt be let out on the streets un-assisted,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Niaozz
40,"It's commercial, full of tourist and can be very busy at weekends.","Not quite sure what I expected but I was truly shocked by the number of homeless people. Maybe I am a bit naieve, this is a huge city after all, but I just wasn't expecting it to be so raw. On our first night trying to find somewhere to eat, strange people entered the restaurant near the walk of fame talking to themselves and behaving oddly. The smell of hash is quite over bearing at times, this was a Saturday night.I suggest you visit early day time when the streets are quiet. The walk of fame is pretty dirty and Mr Trump star gets a lot of attention and abuse. Quite a few of the stars are cracked and I was disappointed that even getting up early in the morning, there is no one cleaning this street. Not what I expected, sadly lacking TLC.Good tip. If you cross the street to the shopping centre and take the escalators up two floors you will see in the distance the Hollywood sign in the hills, can't fault the location, it's pretty cool.The sales vendors here are also pretty hard core, my husband innocently told them his name and hotel and unbelievably someone came to our hotel for his tour.... That he had not booked.This is your chance to be someone else, do not give out your name or hotel, these kindly looking older tour guide types are chasing the dollar at any cost. Shame, as I suspect some of these tours are pretty good.Also they offer child prices on the day as opposed to booking online in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edinburghcitymom

10,Stinky & overrated!,"Dirty streets and crowded areas make this tourist attraction disappointing.Before all the tourists turn up (around 10am), you'll see a shockingly large number of homeless people sleeping on the pavement and in doorways throughout.Cheap, tacky shops and greasy diners complete the picture.If you're forced to be in L.A., try and stay here for as little time as possible. Use the city merely as a through-way and head to San Diego or Orange County instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderGreen
50,Must See!,"As your typical tourists, LA looks like a town stuck in the 70s. But these stars remind you of the good old Hollywood that we glamorize. We danced on Fred Astaire's star, clicked our heels on Judy Garland's star, and I can't say what we did to the former host of the Apprentice's star trip advisor won't let me but it was a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieMcFreeman
30,It's okay,"I didn't have the patience to walk over all the stars really. An interesting experience would probably be walking to find your favorite entertainer's star and taking a picture with it. Then again, it's not the cleanest of pavements to walk on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erickirani
40,Cheap experience,Walking along the street you can see and recognise many names of theatre and film in the US. A free experience as you wander along the street - BUT beware of scammers. who want to take a photo with you or a bus trip around the homes of the famous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonypark50
20,Must be a big fan,No one tells you it stretchs for miles and some areas don't loom like you want to wander into them. You should look up the location of the star you want before you go. If not looking for someone specific then the ones near the Chinese Theatre are good enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neels80

30,Walk of shame,"While the whole idea of the walk of fame is glamorous it’s far from it, there are some amazing sights to see but there is also the tat and people in outfits hounding tourists for money for photos as with most of Hollywood it’s a place to visit but is very focused on what cash they can extract for the visitors",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Richardat10
10,Interesting,First time on Hollywood Blvd and clearly no reason to go back. Thought the area would be a bit more special. Very popular for tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mary1055407

40,Good walk,Visited with my 13 year old and 9 year old. It was fun to walk down the sidewalk reading the names. It was pretty crowded but not unbearable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eddita
30,Good to see,"It was good to see the Walk of Fame and the Chinese Theatre and we walked along Hollywood Blvd. We also saw the Hollywood sign from here too which was tiny but great to see.We enjoyed being tourists here, but the number of people trying to force CDs into your hand so that they can then charge you for it was unbelievable. Quite off-putting too.We've been and seen but that was plenty for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackieR71
20,Yuck. Dirty and Disgusting,It’s dirty and writhing with very strange people. We go to the Pantages on a regular basis and I try to carry a small purse and wear no jewelry- even costume - and dress low-key to not attract attention. It’s not a pleasant environment and hasn’t been great for many years. Parking also is expensive. Hold onto your wallet....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judysinger
30,Dirty and Seedy,Not the luxurious Hollywood you may imagine. It is dirty and filled with random people. Not high on our list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ksJ8971PD
10,Busy crowded and overrated,We arrived here as part of a tour were underwhelmed. Hollywood seems to have past its use by date and the names on the sidewalk were hard to see due to the large number of people.Wouldn't recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebraK511
50,Glamorous walk,Iconic place every tourist is excited to see. It is glamorous and very long. You can take a pic with a star of your favourite person awarded by a star there.Be aware of the people who try to give away CDs as they will ask you for money at the end. If you say you do not want it or will not accept the CD they will accuse you of being racist.Thats the only downsize of this place. What a shame no one does anything about that snd they ruin it for tourists.I went through there so many times and every time it was full of them.On the other hand there are nice and friendly impersonators who do a really great job to entertain people and kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tourtravelling
20,Not so glamorous walk of fame,I was excited to see the stars. I did not expect the vast number of pan handlers and people dressed in costume begging for money. Chewbacca looked like he hadn’t had a bath in years. One guy shoved homemade CDs in my husbands face and insisted we buy one for $5. He began cursing when my husband declined. My young daughter didn’t feel safe. Doubtful we will ever go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKMPTravelers
30,Stars and so much more,"Well, the wife has always wanted to go to Hollywood. We went and got a bit more than we bargained for.Between the protesters walking up and down the streets with their huge signs. The drug deals we witnessed while sitting in a Starbucks. All of the grime, homeless, and the pushy peddlers on the street looking at the Stars didn't get much of our attention.We found a few of the stars we were looking for but ended up quitting the search early since the heat, the peddlers, and the very pushy homeless made our time there less than pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timothysT5325EI
50,It's a nice walk...,"It's interesting, from a historic sense. Seeing all the names of those who have spent the $$ to get a paver installed. It's fun seeing some of the old names, and thinking of all the stars who have sat on these stones and had their pics taken.If in Hollywood, it's a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyB_1965
40,Defining L.A. Feature,"Every city has its defining features, and this is one of them, for L.A. The stars are nice to see and all, though I will agree that they are not awarded based on merit, but rather applied for and paid for. It's debatable if that is right or wrong, but that's for elsewhere. Also, I will agree that the place could use some more love and attention, based on the condition it's in and how iconic the Walk of Fame is. There should be more capital dollars put towards the maintenance of the stars. It is a really busy place, and one of the more lively places in the city. You'll see Hawkers trying to sell stuff, and people posing for photos for purchase. Yeah, there are some homeless people, but they keep to themselves, for the most part. Overall, this is a cannot-miss for visitors to L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arjunpatel1210
30,Not what I expected,Saw lots of stars on the floor but was expecting this area to be a bit more upmarket. Didn’t feel particularly safe here so wouldn’t go back now I’ve seen it. But still glad we visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UK123123
30,It's what you expect.,"It was fun dandering around and spotting your favourite actors, singers etc but it's important to stay aware of your surroundings. A couple of times I was aware of someone following me, I just hooked my bag tighter. One got close enough for my partner to notice and step in to block him from me.Just be aware of your surroundings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoasterNerdett
30,The walk of fame could do with a little love and attention,"We were disappointed that even in the top locations the stars were dirty and cracked. As this is a prime tourist attraction it is disappointing to visit the star of one or your favourite acts and to find it has been left untended. As a Queen fan, I was particularly disappointed that their star was filthy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rustygrecian
30,Nice to see the Stars,The stars are nice to see. But it's dissappointing to find out the stars aren't awarded based on Merit. they are applied for and then Paid for is the application is successful. But the Walk is good. Very busy street though. Lots of Hawkers trying to sell stuff. People in costume trying to make a quick buck posing for paid for photos.Quite a few homeless people on the streets also. but they generally kept to themselves and didn't really come near anyone.But it is one of those things you have to go see if you go to Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_In_Ulster

10,Los Angeles,"Wow I was warned that it was dirty and unsafe but what a disgraceful city. Homeless, dirty, smelly and unsafe. We felt intimidated and vulnerable at times. Will never go back. Although our Air BNB was great and everything that was advertised I won’t be visiting again. The mayor of that city should be ashamed given all the tourists that visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jopeplow
30,Not horrible,"So I was expecting this to be pretty boring but my wife wanted to check the area out on Hollywood Blvd. Turns out it’s decently entertaining. There’s some good people watching. OK shopping. Some decent history. Street performers are not high quality except for the Captain Jack guy, who is exceptional. I’d give it a go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xamers
30,Meh...not what I had envisioned,"This is one of those things you do just for the experience. Hollywood Blvd is very dirty and crowded. We had a hard time getting to see some of the stars due to the many street performers and food stands setting up shop on the sidewalk. Overall, it was an OK experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shernandez710
30,Neat experience,"If you're in LA, this is just something to do. It's cool to see all of the people that have been given stars. Some stars were quite dirty, but it's frequently walked and spilled on. It's a free activity and part of American culture- you can't beat that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760erins
40,It is what it is,"I’ve been to the walk of fame a few times in the past couple of years. It’s worth seeing and checking out the stars, the Chinese Theatre and the other attractions along the street.It’s a tourist area so expect the hustle and bustle that’s associated with these kind of attractions.I would say it’s no more dangerous than any other city. Just be sensible and you can walk down the hall of fame at any time of the day or night without any major issues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/656dylanm
50,Street entertainment,"There is always street entertainment here..or people trying to sell you something- like a c.d. impersonators, a chance to hold and get a picture of a snake, tours, all that sort of thing. The street is always filled with people looking down and taking pictures of the stars so just watch your step. You need at least an hour to really appreciate the walk as it is on both sides of the street and stretches far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/546alician
50,Step on the History,"Highly recommended to do this with family of young and teenage children. Very busy place, can have photographs with movie characters while walking. Need to pay them a tip though. Do this right in the morning when the crowds are less and able to step on the movie star of your liking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354rambabum

30,Mediocre,"I felt a real letdown when we visited. Throngs of people just aimlessly walking around looking at the floor and taking pictures of anything. It's kind of a low budget version of Times Square. There are still too many homeless people and too many people hawking crap. Then there are those dressed in nasty looking costumes looking for you to take a picture with. It just felt uncomfortable. We took our obligatory picture of the theatre and got the hell out of dodge. Luckily the parking was by the hour. In all fairness, I know about the history of Hollywood and the importance of this place as related to the film industry, but I feel like they need to make it so that people want to return instead of just checking it off their bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuanOquendo
20,Overrated,"Took a stroll along the famed walkway as we had dinner there. Crowded; smelled of weed; all sorts of movie characters trying to entice you for a photo and spare change. Been there, done that, never again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueW1145
20,Hollywood Walk of Yuck,"The stars were interesting but difficult to enjoy as we dodged sketchy hawkers, panhandlers and windows full of adult clothing. Not recommended unless you want to walk on the gritty side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/498richm
20,Pointless,"No great atmosphere, no interesting architecture.The only highlight is Grauman's Chinese theater. You cab skip it unless you are a huge fan of someone who has a star on the sidewalk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natansil
40,Much Improved,"Last time I was in L.A. this place was full of bums in superhero filthy costumes begging for tips. The theatre has managed to close off their property some to eliminate this from the looks of it. There were still no shortage of tourists along there taking pictures of the celebrity hands in the cement and stars along the walk. You will still encounter a few bums/superheros along the way, but not to the volume it was a number of years back where it was overwhelming. The area is still pretty busy (and filthy), even in the off season. That being said, it is still an area most check out on their trip to L.A..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
30,Not what I expected,The experience of walking among the stars was neat but the location itself was not what I expected. The media and movies makes Hollywood seem that its a very glitzy place but that is a far cry from reality. The walk of fame is surrounded by a dirty and smelly city. We walked a good distance of it and it didn't get any better around the Dolby theater. In front of the Chinese theater there was a high women throwing things at tourist as the passed her and calling them curse words. I was also surprised at how many homeless individuals were out on the sidewalks. I would have thought the area would have been cleaner since it was such a tourist attraction. I was disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alleycat219
20,Walk of filth,"This is a disgrace, what should be the shrine to cinematic legends is a run down tourist trap with garbage laying all around, homeless people laying on the walkway (LA has an economic problem for so many to be jobless), and a lot of the stars are now lopsided or cracked from wear and tear of people constantly stepping on them.Some individual ""stars"" are repeats and some are for people who don't deserve one because their careers are either not lengthy enough to merit one or they are not in the entertainment industry. Where is Haruo Nakajima's star? He deserves one for playing the original Godzilla in costume for several decades. Why some flash in a pan reality star or some other fake who did nothing to earn it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8078NCkevins
50,A Hollywood top- of- the- list visit,"One of the free and fun things to do in Hollywood is the Walk of Fame. Approximately 15 blocks long (so wear your walking shoes), is block after block of famous and not so famous people. Many stars have more than one star depending on the category. They even have stars for fictional characters (we saw Donald Duck). You may not want to walk the entire 15 blocks, but even in the few blocks we walked we were entertained by the stars we did see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenr873

40,Walk of fame!,"I don't know what we were expecting on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but we were a little surprised at the generally run down feel of this area of the city. Don't get me wrong, it was great to see and experience the Walk of Fame, with the names of all the Hollywood greats at your feet, but we felt the area could do with a general tidy up and a good clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davival
30,"Busy, dirty, not what I expected","Although finding the stars you want to see is fun the area itself is dirty, very busy and bustling with street performers trying to sell you things. It’s worth a visit once just to see it for yourself, but once is enough",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mytravel-7202
30,Hollywood is Still Dirty and Smells (I'm an LA Native),"I always feel sorry for those tourists who come see the Walk of Fame to get a glimpse of Hollywood and don't realize how scummy Hollywood actually is---smells like piss and pot most places and there are a substantial number of scary looking homeless people. I would NOT recommend doing a walking tour of this area unless it's in the middle of the day and even then, I would be careful. If you want a real sense of Hollywood, I would recommend driving along Mulholland Drive just before the sun sets; going to eat a filet mignon at Musso & Frank's in Hollywood (rich celebrity history); and seeing a movie at the Arclight's Cineramadome (I think it's the best movie theater in LA).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5193HZmelissad
20,"Some stars on the ""Walk of Fame looked Really Fake!"" A Big Let Down!","Husband treat me to this adventure the day after my birthday 09/24/2017, and could not believe how it looked down there! Some of the stars looked like someone placed them there without the express permission of the owners. Some of the businesses along the walk way were not at all inviting, even their entry ways were too filthy to ignore. There's construction going on per one side of the street, which covered over a good portion of the stars, (Very disrespectful and disappointing that whomever covered over them must not have cared too much that they'd done it). There was very strong urine odors reeking from inside some of the business' doorways. Last, parts of the street looked like some of my home block's, only with stars on the sidewalk! My advice; ""Look them up online, that is if you'd like to just check them out. If you decide to go in-person, just remember that you've been forewarned. #ForewarnedIsToBeForearmed.

30,Do not let your guard down,"They have tried desperately to clean this area up and for the most part they’ve done a great job but please be aware that sometimes the people dressed in character costumes can also have serious mental issues and can be dangerous. If you take a picture with one of them be prepared to pay them. One woman was killed because she thought the guy was joking when he asked her for money and she laughed, he pulled out a knife and slit her throat.So enjoy, take in the fun sites but just be careful not to engage with suspicious looking people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinebassick
30,A historical walk of fame in Hollywood,"As a California and Los Angeles native, I have been to the walk of fame for many different events like movie premieres, new bars and restaurant openings etc. The place is an historical street, so of course there are going to be many people (locals and tourists). Unfortunately, the streets can be a little dirty, because of the crowds. If you wan to see your favorite star or the handprints of old Hollywood celebrities then this is the place to go. There are small places to eat, but not many sit-down type of distinct restaurants in the area. I recommend going in the day, as it can get a little shady after-hours, but definitely worth the trip if you have never been. One must also take the time to see a move in Grauman's Chinese Theatre. It's fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/771robertv
30,Iconic?,"As someone that lives in LA, the Walk of Fame is a tourist-filled place with really no attraction. I find myself on it when attending events at El Capitan or the Kodak Theater, which is really the only time people in LA go out of their way to get to Hollywood. If you're in LA on vacation, I recommend planning something else fun to do in the area, as this is certainly not a main attraction! It is cool to see the various star's names though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curious1991
30,Hollywood Boulevard,"Although having visited Disneyland on a number of occasions over the years our recent visit with some of our grandchildren was the first time we took the opportunity to stay in Los Angeles itself rather than going straight to Anaheim.Whilst the LA stay was ideal in order to travel to Universal Studios via the metro and a short bus ride out to the La Braia Tarpits, Hollywood Boulevard itself would have to be described as a ' dive"". Its full of buskers/hustlers all trying to push stuff into your hands.Its none too clean and the city has a real homeless problem with people sleeping/laying about just about everywhere. I think you would really have to think that looking at a star on the footpath ,or visiting the theatre where the Academy Awards are held, is a really big deal to make it worthwhile if you go for this purpose only.LA really needs to look at the image of this location and take some steps to clean it up and improve its family appeal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianb922

10,Rundown and overcrowded,The Walk of Fame is dirty and full of people dressed in low grade character costumes looking for money in exchange for a photo opportunity. The pink stars aren't as bright or as big as they seem in professional photos or in illustrations of the Walk of Fame. When I first got there I didn't think I had arrived at the right destination because I had been walking along this crowded street full of distractions without noticing the stars beneath my feet.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionao315
40,A must do in Hollywood!,The walk of fame is located along Hollywood Boulevard. It's fun to see all the stars on the walk of fame. There are hundreds to spot. Outside the Capitol Music building are the Beatles. There are plenty of Shops and Bars along the walk. There are also quite a lot of homeless people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Interailtraveller
50,Loved it,Had to make sure I visit the stars while in LA. There was A LOT of stars lol. It’s good to see them but at the same time there’re hundreds of people walking around over them and getting in the way of you pictures. They also don’t tell you where certain people star is located so u have to find them on your own. There are also numerous of stores for gifts and attractions. Definitely recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_Travel2487

30,Location,I really enjoyed getting to see the stars along the walk of fame. I wasn't looking for any particular person's star which I think made it a little easier. It's also worth noting that the walk of fame is on a busy street in a big city so lots of pedestrian traffic and lots of people handing out flyers or trying to talk to you. This can be a bit of a problem if you are trying to look and the stars and find a particular one because you do have to be aware of your surroundings more than many places.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lingeringmagic

20,Distinctly average,"There are some stars on the floor. Cool.Not a particularly nice area. Yes there are some cool buildings/theatres etc around, like Capitol Records and the like, but honestly wish I'd spent my time elsewhere exploring than this very boring walk up a hill.Overrated for sure. Only saw it because it's 'famous'. Think I went later in the evening so wasn't harassed as I see some of the other tourists were, but just generally not a nice feel of the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eloisem390

30,It was alright.,"It was cool seing all the stars on the walk, but be careful for people trying to give you their cd mix tape or the actor impersonators getting you to take pics with them, they will try and get you to pay them a whole Lotta money for something small, which is crazy. It was really crowded, as per usual, there were a lot of people stopping in the middle of the sidewalk, which was annoying. It was cool seeing all the buildings you see in movies and such, such as the Chinese theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98maghanb
20,Overrated and not as safe as expected.,"The famed strip was not up to expectations and not as well maintained. The street is also lined with too many touters selling trips and maps. There are also people in various costumes trying to scam tourists for photographs for donations.It doesnt feel safe to walking on the street and one have to be careful of their belongings.Shops are also pretty ""scammy"", probably a better place to shop is in the Highland Hollywood mall.The only reason to come here is to check off your list to visit and see the Hollywood sign, other than that, I do not recommend this place at all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kiddyduck
20,Waste of time,This is nothing special i had it as this beactiful place where the stars had their signs on the ground and it was well taken care of but no there is homeless people every where it smells some of the stars pavers are broken it wasnt that great,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcus157
30,Wow,"From a small town to Hollywood, soooo many people, lots of homeless people littarly laying across the sidewalks. A bit overwhelming, but can now mark it off my list. Been there done that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/243diedrac
10,"Dirty, Smelly area full of homeless",Dont know what all the hype is about. If i was was a star i certainly would would not want my star on a street where homeless lay passed out on it in the middle of the day. One guy had peed himself and it was running down the street. How los Angeles can let one of its major tourist points sink to this. Like all the rest of LA except the rich suburbs plave is generally dirty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emelian
50,Bucket list ticked!,"Love Love loved our Hollywood walk of fame trip Totally a must do! Enjoyed seeing all the people dressed up. If you want to take photos, then you must tip them. Also, people try to sell you their cds. Just be polite and say no thanks, if you aren’t interested. Very entertainingTip: pop up to the mall where Victoria secrets is for a good view of the HOLLYWOOD sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissChe
50,Fun place,"Love all the silly things that’s going on. People dressed up in costumes as if it’s Halloween everyday. Batman, Michael Jackson, Spiderman, and so many more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silljunk
40,Take care of thieves,"Very funny street, but have homeless and theievesYou can waking and take pictures shopping and eating foodFor single time, you have to see it for you can say “I want to Hollywood”",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amirda88
10,Avoid at all costs!,"Hollywood Blvd is terrible. Seeing the stars on the sidewalk may be one of the biggest wastes of time. Your fan club wants to pay enough money - you get a star. This is such a tourist trap and you will be surrounded by people, walking slowly, stopping every 2 feet to take a photo - so good luck trying to actually get somewhere.There are a bunch of random vendors that will aggressively try to engage with you and the $5 guys telling you there is a special only today - LIES! Everything is $5 ALL THE TIME. My biggest gripe is them telling me to smile. I think I have a right to let my face look however it wants to without them yelling at me to portray happiness to appease them.Also - there are a lot of crazy people in Hollywood. I've been assaulted twice there by crazy people. One guy who didn't care at all for anybody. And another lady who actively wanted to engage with me while I was trying to get lunch at a food truck - yelling about Lucifer and bumping into me. When I asked her to stop touching me, she swung. Also - there have been a ton of break-ins in that area. I think a rapper got shot at the Loews hotel a couple weeks ago.There are so many better places to see in LA - don't waste your time with this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaylaB874
30,A bit tacky,"We found it a bit of a disappointment, really but I suppose you should see it. The Chinese theatre frontage is more interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FliesM20P
30,Not all it's cracked up to be,I wasn't very impressed with the walk of fame. It's filled with sketchy people and tourists. The area doesn't seem like the greatest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amariew12
50,Stars,"The first day we got to LA we couldn’t wait to go have a look at the Hollywood Walk of Fame , it wasn’t as clean as I thought they would be but I guess thousands of people a day walking on them doesn’t help . It goes for kms some you could walk up and down all day .dont take any cds from guys on the street ... they want money and so do the people dressed in really bad costumes/characters we u get a pic taken with them . All in all it is a must do thing when in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Agnus10
50,Mesmerizing - A Walk in History,"I had the incredible experience of being able to take a picture by Hugh Hefner's Hollywood Star with a memorial! This was of course just after his death. However to experience the stars of all my hollywood, music and entertainer favorites was truly exciting. I could have walked all the stars, it was exciting and worth the time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dagoboi
30,It's not what it was..,"The Blvd.has changed.. dirty.. used to hang out here in the 70s, and never really noticed how dirty it was... Hollywood and Highland is packed with tourists, homeless, etc., not what it should be...Of course, maybe it was always that way...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KUMtngal
30,Cool. And not so cool.,"Sure, it's cool walking along and seeing the names of famous people from the various entertainment industries. Not so cool seeing all of the litter and spilled drinks (or whatever it might be) on the star of one of your favorite icons. I'm not sure who is in charge of sidewalk cleaning and litter control in this area, but they really need to step it up a big notch. Take some notes from whomever is in charge of that sort of thing on the strip in Vegas, which is also thick with pedestrian traffic, but much cleaner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliesK2901TH
20,Seedy,"Although it is seen a must do on the tourist route, I would not spend more than an hour here. It was seedy, with people dressed in Disney costumes starting conversations with my 6 year-old and then offering to have a photo. When we declined, ""Spiderman's"" demeanour changed. Many were caught out by having a photo taken and then realising it wasn't for free. We had a much nicer time hiking up Hollywood Hill Griffith Observatory. We met lovely people along the way and saw a great view of the city. Note: you can drive and park at the summit for a small fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/658trishh
40,Awesome!,Nice to see your favorite actor/actress on the sidewalk. Many shops to purchase souvenirs. cheap price,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/romalone2859
10,Stars on a Nasty Street,I’m not sure what I expected but what I got was stars on the sidewalk in front of porn shops and other nasty businesses along with street beggers. I know it is an icon and you have to go but the street needs to be cleaned up. It’s not for me!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cypins
30,Is that all,Everybody wants to see this walk of fame. We found it not special and do not understand all the fuss. After one block we had the picture and went elsewhere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/570414586
50,LA bus tour stop,So fun to walk through the stars and pick out the ones you know. At the time we went Hugh Heffner (playboy) had just passed the day or so before so there were flowers and cards over his star. Dun history to see in person. Loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/714kalier
30,Not as exciting as we thought,"My wife and I came here hoping to find loads of familiar names, but instead we only found a handful of recognisable names and streets full of homeless and other dodgy characters.Would go back there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelReviewer1983
40,"Touristy, but it is what it is","Busy area, lots of people doing what you expect, taking photos and looking around.Interesting to see the stars names on the footpath and to remember them in your favourite shows or records.Plenty of souvenir shops, a few bars and food places.If you’re in LA you probably need to have a look.We were staying at Venice Beach so we got a cab to drop us there after Universal Studios because it was on the way home.If you do that ask the cabbie to take you to see the Hollywood sign near Hollywood Lake on the way from Universal to Hollywood. That’s worth a photo if you’re in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrisBarry
40,It's the Hollywood Walk of Fame! It's crazy!,"You can tell my my title..it's sidewalks with the stars names and movies embedded into the sidewalk. It is the history and glamour of Hollywood beneath your feet. Sometimes they are dirty because someone spilled a drink on the star. Sometimes you have to wait in order to take a photo with your favorite star. BUT, it is there for us to see and touch and it is hollywood history. My first visit there was 50 years ago and it is the same today which is wonderful to say! ENJOY!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/87pamelah
30,Cool ... for the first few stars,"The walk of fame extends for quite awhile, on two parallel sidewalks. It's neat for the first little bit, looking down and seeing different stars names. However, there are a lot of people that we didn't recognize. We later found out that stars can pay $40,000 for a star on the walk (but they need to be approved, sorry Kim K!).The sidewalks are very dirty and some stars are cracking so you have to be careful not to trip.Overall, it's something to see/do once in your life - but I don't feel the need to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kari1001
40,A fun walk,Saw a bunch of names that we weren't aware were there. Was great to look up some of the lesser known and learn about them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJ24R2
30,Just Because,"It's okay place to sightsee for out of town guests.However I guess by me being a Los Angeles resident it just doesn't appeal to me as much anymore. The teenagers in the Family seem to like going though. It's just a lil too busy for me down there and, too many weirdos!!🤔 Praying for the weirdos in JESUS NAME...Amen🙏",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/santrises
30,A must see but overrated,"It is a must see- no doubt. However, the neighborhood is so ugly and dirty... it smells just bad and sometimes it is even dangerous with all the homeless people around. Still, closer to the crowd it is fine and a great one time experience. Nothing like wow we expect before going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/99nadiah
30,A must see but not as incredible as I thought,"We visited Los Angeles and our hotel was only 20 minutes away so visited it guite a lot looks rather disappointing Chinese theatre looks great , footprints were interesting and the walk of fame is as long as 15 blocks so didn't see all of them even so it's a must see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S3425DSdavem
20,Tacky but still a must - see,It's very crowded with lots of dressed up characters and cheap stalls.This area of Hollywood is pretty tacky but of course it's somewhere you HAVE to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janno58
20,Dirty streets......,I was expecting this attraction to be a 'wow' factor on my trip -- however it is was not. The area is surprisingly dirty and the stars are apparently not cared for very well. Such a disappointment. LA should clean up here -,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kitkatSouthJersey
10,Scruffy and intimidating,"A gathering point for every nut case and wino in LA. The ""stars"" are underwhelming and any the a listers would be mortified if they knew their star was outside a crappy souvenir shop. The area around Dolby Theatre is particularly bad. Many homeless sleep on the streets off Hollywood Boulevard. There is a permanent smell of dope in the air. Best seen from the top of an open topped bus to avoid the chaos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevehD644YA
20,Beyond tacky!!,"Yes, you probably have to go and see this, just to say 'I've been there' - but it is tacky, crowded, filled with people dressed up and looking to have pictures with you, it cost a fortune to get us there in a taxi from one of the airport hotels, and similarly to return us to our hotel. It was an expensive excursion, that we could have done without.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusannaW799
40,Fun!,"Busy and fun place. You gotta visit at least once in your life. Go and find your favourite celebrities's star lol was fun to see.

10,Just a load of stars on the pavement,"The pavement is covered in stars of famous people. People are stopping to take photos. The place is crowed.The area offers very little other than shops selling souvenirs and eateries.The Chinese theatre looked interesting, but unfortunately we didn't have time to do this and it wasn't part of our coach tour.If you want to see the Hollywood sign, you need to go in to the shopping mall, up to the top walk along the walkway that joins the 2 buildings and you can see the sign in the distance.That's your lot. In my opinion really not worth bothering",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraceyT162
10,you'll want to come here but only last an hour,"Everyone who visits here says ""take me to the walk of fame"" and I warn them how crowded and crazy it is and we go anyway... no one I know can last longer than an hour there. So keep in mind, this is a huge city. Every tourist wants to be at this exact same location and you can barely take a pic before 30 people start bumping into you and elbowing your camera out of your hands. Lots of homeless people and lots of long lines. Bathrooms are hard to grab as well. Realistically plan for an hour here, before wanting to get out and do something more fun. Good luck!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LCexplorerTX
30,Good to Say We've Seen It,"Stayed at a hotel on the Walk.Interesting seeing all the famous names and one to tick off your bucket list.Streets not kept clean, not quite what you would expect given the notoriety of the landmark.Quite a lot of street sleepers and beggars along the way.Felt safe during the day but not so much at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dalufa

If you are at LA definitely you will be visiting this area then you can have a look on the streets. If you have name then search for it.

40,Can get dirty and you may get hassled,"Was so excited to see the walk of fame. It is sad that some areas were quite dirty and that street performers keep annoying you. But it is a must, as they say when in Rome...... We loved looking at the hand prints in front of the Chinese theatre the best. The best bit was seeing the stars for all our favourite actors. People respect you when taking photos which is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neds0

50,A tribute to 'Entertainment Fraternity',"There are so many souls, who have sacrificed their personal comforts to #Entertain# the entire human race... This 'Hollywood walk of fame' is definitely a standing tribute to those personalities like actors, musicians, directors, producers, musical and theatrical groups, fictional characters, and others. Today (2017) there are more than 2500 stars... It takes more than 3 hours to just scam thro'... Good to click snaps with your #Favorite Stars# Don't forgot to graze thro' the hand & foot prints @ Chinese theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cshastry2
50,Excellent place,This place has a charm and you will feel it while being there.Streets are filled with tourists and locals and there are many street performances and colourful characters.Spend some time looking for your favourite Hollywood stars.

40,An experience of a lifetime,"I highly recommend getting to the stars during daytime hours, too many vendors covering up many of the stars. You also need to get to Grauman's Chinese Theatre early as they close it up when night falls. Here you'll see famous hand and feet imprints.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TaylorTXtf

20,Don't bother,"Unless you are a die hard fan and have to see your favorite actor or whoever's star, this is horrible. Hollywood is not all glitz and fame as in the old days. Homeless people, dregs of society roam the streets not to mention poorly organized panhandlers dressed as super heroes. Spare me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854glennr
50,Dream come true,"All my life i have wanted to visit this place and it was everything that i hoped it would be. As i stayed at the Roosevelt i was able to walk up and down at 5 am to view all the stars with no crowds. I took hundreds of photos of my favourite movie stars simply brilliant. Also if you can afford it go to Madame Tussauds, the chinese theatre the dolby theatre and the Hollywood museum all equally amazing and you can do all this on the city card a real bargain enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tutuleena
30,Anticlimactic,"Cool to see all the stars and the Chinese theatre but the actual street/area leaves a lot to be desired. I wouldn't like to walk the street alone, certainly not at night. Lots of undesirables hanging around the street. Sometimes difficult to see the stars due to people sitting on them selling tat. Free activity though and a bit of a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/823melt
50,Best fun! So surreal!,"I absolutely loved walking around and checking out all the stars. Popped in and out of a few stores, the whole street vibe is contagious and exhilarating.

50,Travel through time at the Walk of Fame!,"For a fun afternoon, stroll down the Hollywood Walk of Fame and let your mind wander to some of the movies you have seen in the past starring the famous people shown. While there are stars for many fields in media, I find the most fun in looking at those of actors long gone, and remembering their achievements. There are many places nearby for lunch, and the people watching is fantastic, especially the many lookalikes who wander the street!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seacreature1
50,Tourist,We took the Train from Union Station and got off at the Predidio to which we went to Angels Flight. A wonderful scenic view. Back on tje train to Hollywood to see street entertainment and the Mann theater. So much to see and do we ran out of time during the day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ejanier
30,Fun but a bit tacky,"Walking the walk of fame is one of the things you must do in LA, but unfortunately the sidewalks are not well-maintained with people spitting on some of the stars and with young children plying for trade. Take good care of your belongings and don't talk to strangers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/467rachelz
30,Great people watching!!!,The Hollywood walk of fame is one of the most famous sites in Hollywood. It is a very Touristy thing to do and there are hordes of tourists walking around all the time from around the world.The entertainers names on the walk is interesting but the most fun is watching the people walk by.Its one of the best people watching palaces period. You see a great cross section of America from Midwest conservative to freaky wild. Its the best!! Its in a low clas area so be aware of your surroundings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rockdoc7
40,A famous walk,I have heard about it before but not seen it until now. I sure had lot of names that bring up a lot of memories. The walk is many blocks long. Some names yo will see more than once. Like with Bob Hope for instance. There are many empty stars. There was one guy by an empty one with a pile of matching letters. He will build your name with them so you can get your picture taken on the walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnYa5
20,Walk of Shame!,"What could be a really interesting walk to see the Hollywood stars and hand prints is now simply spoiled by hoards of people and street venders, as well as those really annoying characters and snake handlers.

Unfortunately, you will see many homeless people in the area as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scoop35311
30,Ok experience,"It's good to see the stars but unfortunately the area is very grimy, has too many loud, smelly cars and is crowded with people. Many are trying to sell something and many parts of the street felt unsafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ros_Mel2014
30,A must see but so tacky!,"I've been here three times since 1992 and visited again, for a fourth time, today as part of a city tour. It was absolutely rammed with people, street artists plying for photos for money, young men handing out ""free CD's"" and just general tackiness. It's such a shame because it is an iconic part of Hollywood. You have to go to see it but be prepared!I think the local commerce dept should provide the tour operators with maps showing where each star is, given there are two miles of stars and definitely need to clean the place up a bit, they may have got rid of the street ladies since the iconic Pretty Woman movie but it is depreciating into a sleezy area once again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mistyb1302
50,See names of famous entertainers,"By walking around on Hollywood Boulevard, and glancing down on the sidewalks, you will notice stars on the sidewalk with a name under each of the stars. Some were actors on TV, others were film stars. Still others were singers and band leaders.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/484karlc
40,Funny and crazy,Very funny and It just demonstrated and confirmed that Hollywood is nothing but a bag of hot air. A lot of tourists trying to catch this glimpse of illusion by photographing all those dressed up superheroes. Very entertaining in a sort of way but also very confusing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikkiDenmark
40,Quick visit - watchout for hustlers,"Drop by here with a Rent-A-Car we borrowed. Taking advice from a recent trip advisor comment we went to Hollywood and Boulevard for cheap parking. That works out well, we went to a lunch and got out tickets validated.On street level watch out for people CDs or superheroes dressed up in costumes. They are there to hustle and make money off you so don't except anything don't make eye contact don't take photos of them or have them take photos for you they will turn around and demand money.I was wise to have words with the kids or anything about these and they are strangers who you are not genuine. As they will try to bait the kids in having a photo conversation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eloelopeee
50,Sightseeing on Vacation,"Plenty of shopping available. A lot of restaurants available . I only was able to do part of Hollywood and Highland . I saw all the stars on the Hollywood and Vine end. Took plenty of pictures and it's free!! I do suggest comfortable walking shoes, because there is a lot of walking! And eats easily accessible via the metro if you're vacationing and not staying nearby. Triplets believe it or not, two different wax museums as well as tours everywhere. Lastly, there are plenty of stars to look at. A great place overall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelao943
20,Dirty Tourist Trap,"While it was fun to find famous celebrities names and take pics of their stars, it is sad to see how dirty the sidewalks are because of lack of proper care.

40,Many more stars than I expected,"We really didn't know what to expect, from just seeing it on TV when someone would get their ""star"" on the Walk of Fame. There were many, many more stars than we expected and because of a time constraint, we didn't get to see them all. The ones we did see brought back memories... realizing how many stars are no longer alive was somewhat bittersweet. We visited on a Sunday morning, so we didn't have to contend with a lot of people and were able to take pictures of the ""stars"" we wanted, and that was nice. I guess Friday and Saturday nights would be a very different experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LasVegasKaren
40,Walk of Fame,"You can take Metrolink - red line & get off at the Highland station.If you drive there, the easiest way is park your car at the Tolby Theater.

We walked up one side of Hollywood Blvd at Hollywood and Highland, crossed the street and walked down the other side.My kids were so overwhelmed with the amount of people on the street, we had to leave pretty quickly. The mistique of the Chinese Theatre and the Walk of Fame wasn't there for my kids. They are 10 and 13. It just wasn't for them.We did see the actress who played Meredith on The Office on the street. My daughter thought that was cool.We parked at the Dolby Theatre and paid $3 to park for about an hour and a half or so. There are places that will validate for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/321christab

40,Fun for the first time visitors to famous Hollywood,"Hollywood Walk of Fame, famous stars handprints, and nearby (Grumman's Chinese Theater), etc, etc, are all worth a one-time visit. Fun to see - doesn't take too long. Attended by a wide variety of locals and tourists during the day and early evening. Some panhandling and homeless. A wide variety of nearby restaurants and cafes, from all price ranges, within a walk, and public parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chi-Girl999
20,Very touristy and commercial (but has to be done),As you'd expect the street is absolutely packed with tourists (which did get a bit much after 10 minutes) we had to visit of course but spent all of 30 minutes walking up and down each side of the walkway and then we were done!Be prepared for it to be very busy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniellejbut
50,Intersting place.,"It was very busy, loads of shops, and things to see on this very jam packed road, always something going on, from the walk of fame to the street buskers, this place was humming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DamienB690
10,Just another tourist trap,"Not really much to see here, it's a street with a bunch of stars paved into the sidewalk. It's crowded, it's noisy and it's full of people trying to get a hold of your hard earned cash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredrikedvardsen
50,Must see in LA!,So I booked this hike last minute and I am so glad I did ! Let me start by saying how AWESOME our guide was. DW knew everything about those Hollywood hills! I learned so much history and so many cool facts about Griffith park and had no idea that I would enjoy it so much! We had a nice small group from several parts of the world so it was super awesome to interact with everyone. The hike was about 3 hours but certainly didn't feel like it! The views are breathtaking and so picturesque! Thanks for the awesome experience DW! all the fun facts about Griffith park and what' surrounds it is really a different side of the busy downtown LA! Definite must do!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415crystall
40,You Kinda Have to See It,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame--you kind HAVE to do it if you're in LA. I know, it sounds trite. But really. Do it. You're sure to regret it if you don't. I thought it'd be silly, but there really is something deeply moving to see the names of old Hollywood greats on the sidewalk--Marilyn Monroe, Patti Page, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers. It's a piece of history that endures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ELinsky2015
20,"Very busy, not really our thing",We went to tick this off the list of things to do in LA. It was ok but obviously very busy and surprisingly a lot of homeless people around. We actually witnessed a fight broken up by the police which was a bit crazy!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FioHu
30,Great but needs some TLC,Great for the celebrity buff who wants to track down there hero of stage or song but a good few are starting to show their age with cracks and damage a plenty.To see the Hollywood walk of fame start from Hollywood Vinestreet station and follow the stars. They finish close to Hollywood Highland Station and all the good shops etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/728paulg
30,"Must do , I guess","All kinds of artist represented some more popular then other, some u wonder why they are there. Must see when in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LorenaMontreal
20,"Dirty, full of homeless and drugged people.","A completely broke-down, dirty part of the city. Full of homeless people. Entertainment is weak and nothing spectacular, bars and clubs don`t look anything nice. Not a nice place to walk at night. Not even during the day. Very disappointing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuditE85
50,Mental,"Seeing world famous sights in real life was fantastic, Chinese Theatre, Walk of Fame, Hollywood sign and even got a wave from Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) when we went into the hills. LA is big, like really big BUT around Hollywood you can see the Chinese Theater, the walk of fame and the Hollywood sign (from a distance). It's a busy area like really mental. It's full on. Uber worked really well to get to and from here and is fairly cheap. There's a lot of homeless people, people shout and curse in the street for no reason, there's also also a lot of nice friendly Angelenos only too ready to help. Did I like expect to like it?...no not really. did I ? Oh yes!!! Been here for 3 days, and was only using it as a 'get over jet lag' stop, wished we could stay longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theboffs
40,Time spending,"A lot of people is here. You can go shoping or just watch into street dancers. All of them wanna attract your attention. If you wanna do photo with popular ""star"" you need luck, because many people wanna do same :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jasinka
50,Just a visit,Interesting place with atleast a day to see properly. I went at night for dinner and a drink. Enjoyed the walk and looking at the names on stars. Will go again allowing more time to write about it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vettyvelur
50,Bday trip,"Awesome! Must be prepared to walk, lots of vendors on the streets and people selling tours... overall, it's a must if you go to CALIFORNIA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lanilei_61_
30,Good to see but that's all.,"It's good to see but that's all. Once you've done it the novelty will very quickly disappear. The chaotic super busy street filled with people trying to make a quick buck, and utter con artists will make you glad to move on. This is sad as this whole area offers so much in the way of hollywoods history that, people trying con you and make money from you just spoil it. Surly they should be trying to crack down on this as it's just way over the top, I'm all for people trying to make an honest wage but get rid of the absolute con artists and leave the genuine street venders and the place would be much better and less a tacky place to be avoided after 1 very quick visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glos690
10,Disgusting.,The area is so run down. People sticking stuff in your face to buy. Sidewalk with stars is filthy. So rundown. Oh. But there is s Louis Vuitton store near the parking garage. With homeless sleeping outside. Just gross. Don't eve bother to go. Just keep the fun visual you have of glamorous Hollywood in your mind instead.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommajoColumbus_Ohio
30,Stars,It's kinda hard to look at every star on the ground because their are people constantly walking and taking pictures and selling things on the street. It's pretty much almost impossible to see it and most of the stars I looked at I didn't see main stars that should be there like Denzel Washington and other famous stars like Jackie chan and others.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_basementboy
40,the must,The best to go in the very morning (every day they clean the walk). Take a free map guide with the list of all stars and their's location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexaKPL
30,See it so you can say you saw it - but that's it,"You heard about it. You've seen all the glitzy pictures of stars getting their pictures taken there, but the area of town is less than desirable. Sure there is a nice small mall there and you have the Chinese Theater, but the rest of the area is tourist trap and filled with vagrants begging for money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USMEagleFan
30,Do it but don't expect much,"This is an obvious thing to do in Hollywood, but doesn't offer much other than looking at a dirty sidewalk.You will be harassed by people selling their cds and poor dressed up characters wanting money for photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Uberstar28
30,It won't take more than 3 hours,As people always say it is a must see in Los Angeles but if you missed it then u didn't miss a lot .it is a nice street with the famous stars on the floor . There is a Chinese theater there which is always busy and crowded .madame Tussaud is a must see really and the best thing there. Take care of the people wearing customers as they will keep asking you to take photo with them then will ask you for money .There is a luxury shopping mall there too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wafaan2016
40,Busy but good fun all the same,"This is a must do activity and we all really enjoyed spotting the famous names on the ground, we were told to get dropped off by the taxi at Chinese theatre as that is the area where the famous names are and it was great advice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToniF32
30,Chaotic and Busy,"We started at the Chinese Theatre, but quickly became overwhelmed with our young children. There were many side vendors, people dressed as characters, artists pushing their music and generally we found it really hard to stop and look at the stars without being pushed to the side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MedusasRiot
40,Fun but crowed and full of con artists,"Lots of tourists but it's fun to see. You will run into SEVERAL people claiming get to have been on AGT or the Jimmy Kimmel show and handing out CD's which they autograph and THEN they claim to be collecting money for a ""charity"", please please please don't fall for these con artists. And protect you wallet and purse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockyMntnGirlFrom216
10,Beware of con artist,"Make sure you don't take photo with people with costumes. Not much to experience, i wouldn't spend too long here. Quick photo here and there is enough, considering so many tourist traps",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Myviace
30,Busy must see,"Yes so everyone will talk about going to Hollywood and checking everything out along the boulevard. Just keep in mind that even as a local growing up here, I think I've been here a million times. It's definitely a must see and you will see no stars here except for the ones in the concrete sidewalk. LOL yeah it is fun to see the stars on the ground and the names that are present. It really is something you cannot miss no matter what. Make sure you come with your belongings close to your body as there is still a lot of pickpocketing present and a lot of people coming through. Don't worry , it's safe, just be smart about it ;-).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cocos1776

20,Disappointed,When we saw the walk of fame we were slightly disappointed it's not what we expected at all! Would recommend doing a tour cause they leave you off at the best part of it otherwise be strategic because it's around two miles long and goes through some dingy areas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rubyyyyyyyy
10,Nope. Nope. Nope.,"Just simply Nope..only tourist shops and people harassing you to buy their souvenirs or do their tours.Be wise, don't go there.. the starts on the sidewalk are not even worth it. Waste of time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BramN_12
40,Fantastic photo op!,"Lots of memories. Movie and TV stars from childhood, all the way to the present. See if you can find all FIVE Gene Autry stars. He is the only person to have a star in each category.If you want an incredible photo, go to the West end of Hollywood Blvd just as the Sun is coming up and the first direct rays reflect off the stars. The exact time will (obviously) depend upon the season.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnb9291
40,Walking the historic street,"We took the metro train and exit at Hollywood Vine station. When out of the escalator, we walked to the left of station exit. Then started to follow the star on the street, happy to spot some familiar ones. We walked for about 25 minutes then saw the TCL Chinese Theatre and the Mdm Tussauds ( Wax Museum )to our left. We realize that by dropping off at the Hollywood Highlands station will bring us nearer to TCL Chinese theatre. Around there we took some photos, drop into Hard Rock Cafe for lunch.After lunch walked back to the TCL Chinese theatre, then continue to walk the star on the street back to Hollywood Vine Metro station.My observations -The star further away from the TCL Theatre is not maintained and can be quite dirty as people walk over them.Along the street , there were people inviting us to join tour, give CDs (?) , in costumes trying to invite us for photo taking. We just say "" no , thanks "" and keep walking.I think is good to visit this place to catch the Hollywood star fame .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TANMK
50,You gotta do it,"My family and I were staying in the Loews Hollywood just a block off Hollywood Blvd. I'll start with that famous 80's song The Freaks come out at Night, yeah there are a few interesting people who dress up as characters/superheroes for photo opportunities, just be aware they are after your money not just there for looks. If you are like me and are more interested in the actual stars on the boulevard go early, and I mean the earlier the better. We were traveling with our dog, so he and I took morning strolls and got to see a lot of stars. During the night especially Friday and Saturday the crowds were so thick, stars were the least of your worries. On Saturday we ventured a little further down to see more of the stars and learned that the 2 biggest stars were at the beginning of the walk of fame - on the side of the street that the Disney Ghirardelli shop is on but past the Hard Rock Cafe and La La Land Souvenir shop just keep walking it's about 4 or 5 blocks, that being Elvis and the Beatles. If there is a pattern or order to the arrangement of stars I didn't pick it up, but so glad I got to experience this piece of Hollywood history. When you get back to the corner of Hollywood and Highland take a stroll up Highland, a left just past the subway entrance, and you will get a view of the Hollywood sign. There is a viewing platform just outside California Pizza Kitchen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I3154TKdougc
50,Nice,"If you like watching movies, it is actually very nice to leave your footsteps at the same place where your favorite actors did the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DjuroA2
30,Just a photo op,Different things interest different people. For me they were just star names on a pavement. It keeps you looking down alot. Unsure if there's a map but as i was walking i would see random stars & take a pic if i thought they were ok. It wld make a boring photo but i guess if you were a huge fan it would be a big deal to get a photo with it. If you've never been its worth checking it out. I was a lil worried in that area of looking too much like a tourist. LA seemed to have alot of street people but it was a good experience to see the different environment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BecksPoint
20,Not what was expected,"The place doesn't give any sense of direction (where to start & where to finish), smell of urine everywhere. I can't say it was a pleasant walk... would I go again, no.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annakP1849RZ
20,What Should Be Nice Is Filthy,"We spent the night at a hotel on Hollywood Boulevard, and I wanted to share with my two grandkids about some of the past entertainment industry legends. Some stars were in decent shape, and a few were broken. However, the major disappointment was just how filthy the sidewalks are, with no apparent cleaning.Seriously, Hollywood. Tourists come here from all over the world. What would it take to invest in a couple of cleaning machines that can be used on the sidewalks to remove the grease, and grime, and perhaps some people to pick up the trash. This stuff has been there a long time and it really is disgusting.The material on those sidewalks is very nice, and if cleaned, it would sparkle making this area really stand out. Of course, with this decay is also the run down appearance of so many of the store fronts in the area. Sure, you are inundated with all the cheap souvenirs and tour sales people, and you even have people living on those streets, but it would be nice to see some effort made to properly host the millions who visit, and spend a considerable amount of money there, each year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrampaTim
50,Loved walking the walk!,Our first time to Los Angeles and of course we had to walk the Hollywood Walk of Fame. We loved walking it and didn't realize exactly the length of this. We walked the entire thing and got to see all of the stars that we wanted. Of course Mark Wahlberg was my favorite. We were surprised to see how dirty many of the stars were and how they were not taken care of. It was kind of very sad. But none the less it's exactly what we expected and enjoyed the trip. Both ends have totally different shopping areas so if you can try to walk the entire way or at least drive to both ends. Hopefully one day they will clean up the stars that are really covered with dirt. It's nothing we have to go back and see again but we are very glad we did. You see it on TV all the time and now we can say we were there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momma252
20,It's a bit dodgy,You cant go to LA and not go to Hollywood. Well you can its very dodgy feels unsafe watch it when you see the Oscars much better,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adam79neale
30,Very underwhelming,I don't know what I was expecting here but I was very underwhelmed by it all. It is literally just stars on the floor with names on them. Plus you get harassed by tour operators/guys with CDs the whole time your walking through it which was annoying! Worth a flying visit but wouldn't return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katemY6347UM
10,Nothing Special,"If you are an out-of-town tourist and you like the movie star aspect, you may enjoy it. But it's no big deal. I'm a life-long resident of L.A. and went there for 3rd time this year. Just not a great place. The area is dirty, watch out for street people and scammers. Stay alert to who and what is around you and only go in a group. I think there are better uses of your time. It's not what it used to be !!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QueenOfCastle
30,"Fun to find your favorites, but the neighborhood is sketchy","Everybody loves hollywood, but.... Once you find your favorites it is kinda meh! Be prepared to walk around - the stars run from from Vine to La Brea - 15 Blocks, and down the side of Vine.Be sure to take a few minutes to look at the Gramman's Chinese Theatre and the complex behind it. The elephants in the arch are a reference to DW Griffith's film ""Intolerance"" - the first mega budget film ever made. It flopped commercially, but is an important film in cinema history.The street performers are fun, but they expect to be paid if you take a photo of them. They can be a bit aggressive about this. The neighborhood is dodgy at night - go in a group or during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanjeni2003

10,If You Must,"If you are from out of town you are probably going to go here. It is going to be a let down. Tourist trap if I ever saw one. Not the best part of town, though there are worst ones. Daytime is best. Parking is going to be a hassle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OracleLosAngeles

10,Dirty street,"Unfortunately, walking in the street is unpleasant experience . A lot of bad people all the time in front of you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aalfozan
40,"Don't go out of your way, but do see it.","So everyone knows about the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It really is fun to walk around and find your favorite ""stars"" and take some photos. However, don't make a special trip to do this. Plan on adding it on to other sightseeing in the area. It can be crowded and hot. There are people dressed up as characters along the walk. They want money to take a photo with them. Not my kind of scene. Some are good, some cheesy. And a few can get rude if you snap a photo and don't pay.If you add the Chinese Theater, the Dolby Theater and viewing the Hollywood sign from the shopping area to this trip it is worth it. But remember, it is very busy here all year round so expect crowds. This area is also pricey for souvenirs, food, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannb406
30,It's over-rated unless you're star struck,"Maybe it's because I eat, live and breathe tinsel town, but the Hollywood Walk of Fame, to me is grossly over-rated. It's just a very crowded walkway and ego trip for celebrities. You see names but no faces. And don't think you will spot a living star. Stars don't usually go to Hollywood except for award shows at the Dolby and premiers. Do be careful too, when walking here, there are unscrupulous sorts out to pick pocket and con you. Don't look like a tourist, walk like you own it. If you really dig walking over the stars and names of your favorite celebrities, this is for you and millions of other who flock there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattithedivaP
10,Not a big deal,So there is a star on the street. You have to dodge street performers wanting you to take photos and give them money. Most disturbing were the two guys with Boa Constrictors - I hate snakes and was unhappy to see them. We paid $25 to park for about 4 hours. Took a tour and had dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaLong88
40,Fun tourist attraction,So while in the area we had to see this. So many names! It was fun when you came across someone you like and fun to have your photo take with the star. Hard to believe you stood where the stars once were! Atmosphere reminded me a lot of Times Square in NYC.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krr1975
50,A must if you like your stars,"Disappointing at the state of it at some places especially where some homeless people call home for the night, run down spot fronts that are used as toilets by the homeless",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MDickie
30,ok,We went just for fun since near where we are staying..crowded.Nothing special.Had a hard time time looking for a nice restaurant for lunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LPY39
20,Nothing to get excited about.,"At best, the stars' names could be educational by spurring one on to read up on them.I love L.A. It is one of my favourite travel destinations anywhere and I travel a LOT , but the walk of fame can hardly be rated an attraction, maybe a curiosity at best, and Hollywood Boulevard is a bit of a tacky, dirty tourist trap in some parts.In L.A. it really pays to dare to go off the beaten tourist path.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/838peterk838
50,Walk Among the Stars!,"It was pretty cool to walk among the stars, it was a lot of WOW look at this and so forth...much longer walk than we expected...it's a must see when in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N4272HVdaveb
10,Don't go!!!,We read negative recension of this walk but by curiosity we went... I would rename it the walk of shame. Believe us nothing to see that will be remind as a positive experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/518xaviert
50,Fun!!,How can you go to LA and not visit.. be careful about taking photos with the characters though... You'll need cash as those pics are not free! But hey! You pose you pay😁 the walk itself is very entertaining! Lots of famous names to see and lots of people to watch.. Lots of entertainers.. Bring cash help some of the upcoming rappers get their name out!! There's plenty of shopping from high end to five dollar stores and plenty of Knick knacks in between!! You can even pay a small fee and get your name on one of the Hollywood stars and take a pic!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sw33t33pi
30,Guess it's a required staple in visiting LA,"Ok...the stars names are on the ground..super....next. there are over 2 miles of stars names. Which I learned the stars pay for there name to go there! Go figure! If you have ever been to times square in nyc, it reminds me of that. Lots 9f ppl , lots of tourists, lots of homeless ppl, lots of performers....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Methodluv
20,You could probably skip,"Getting there is a nightmare. We went on a weekday to avoid crowds at the walk but the traffic in LA is terrible on weekdays. We paid $20 to park, which is ridiculous considering we paid $2 in Beverly Hills for a nicer parking garage. You could see these online and get the same experience. The whole strip is so trashy and dirty and millions of people bug you to take their tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bailiep
30,Could be so good...,"When headed to LA and Hollywood you have to walk down the Hollywood Walk of Fame and why wouldn't you?So we did...There are some truly classic names on this pavement from the early days of cinema right up to modern day stars and it's great trying to see who you know and who you don't.However...As other reviewers have said it really needs a clean up in places, some of the stars are degrading, some parts of the walk smell like a toilet. then there are those trying to remove your money from you with CDs or dressed up as a character for photos... I saw one Chewbacca who looked like it had been through a car wash (sadly didn't smell like it). Then there were all the stalls set up selling fidget spinners etc over the top of some of the names.. really not what you want when trying to find people.Any scratched off the list of places to go.This could be so much better!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christophercL3377CG

30,Bit Of A Let-Down,"We constantly hear that the walk of fame is one of the must-do things in LA.So, we devoted a day of our trip to doing a stars tour, and the walk of fame. Honestly, it's not what we thought it would be; we were left scratching our heads thinking ""is that it?"".Don't get me wrong, it's nice to see all the stars. We took photos of ourselves pointing to our favourite stars, the same as all the other tourists. It is worthwhile doing it at least once, but it's something that I wouldn't do again. It's really just not that exciting (and ours is a family of movie buffs and enthusiasts).It's as though Hollywood has done the best job on marketing itself... during the awards ceremonies, it looks so glamourous (red carpet and all). Admittedly, the block containing the Chinese Theatre is pretty cool. But walk just one block up the hill following the pavement stars, and we literally encountered drunks throwing up into garbage bins.Even outside the Chinese Theatre itself, we were surrounded by people in pretty average costumes (although some were better than others), trying to take their photos with us, and then asking for money. Mixed in with people pushing their home-made music CDs.The souvenir shops are kinda cool, but nothing special.To be honest, after a couple of hours walking trying to find our favourite stars, we were pretty much over it, and on the way back to our motel, we all had the same feeling - let-down.Maybe our expectations were too high. Like I said, if you haven't done it before, then make the effort to visit, but don't expect the glamour that you see during the Oscars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmigoMarlz
10,Not what we expected,"To be honest, it was a bit of a let down. I was expecting something glamorous given that it was in Hollywood but it felt like we were on the golden mile in Blackpool. There were loads of shops selling cheap tat and it wasn't glamorous as all. Still, we've seen it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terryc182
40,Hollywood Walk of Fame,The Hollywood Walk of Fame was interesting and worth the visit and walk (and it was only steps from the Loews Hotel Hollywood where we stayed).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Triever
30,Nice to see and to experience the walk and see the stars on the pavement,"Stars are not placed well. Some main names are hard to find, but that is due to historical reasons probably. It is hard to find parking near that area. It can get crowded when you get near The Chinese Theater. However if you've never seen it it is nice to have that scratched on your bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bojanb532
40,Love the names,"Very touristy but good for a quick visit. Rather fun seeing the names of so many famous people. Best part was behind where famous people had their hands (and feet sometimes) and signatures in concrete. Loved seeing the names of my icons. Fred Astaire,. Gene Kelly, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gillianm567

40,"Ok for Tinseltown, but kind of cheesy.","The Hollywood walk of fame is interesting, but also kind of a cheesy tourist trap for Tinseltown.

Be careful as this is a tourist trap and lots of freak shows and scammers are out, similar to Times Square in New York City.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JNFII
50,nice long walk,"Walking down Hollywood Blvd in interesting to say the least. But when you get to look down at all the ""stars"" it makes it more interesting.

30,Very Unimpressive,"Travelled from The UK to LA, somewhere i've always wanted to go.whilst i found loads of good things to do there this was not one of them.the whole walk of fame area looked and felt unclean and not maintained. doesn't appear like it does on any TV show or film over the years.on top of this there are various people scattered around this area trying to relieve tourists of their money by duping people into buying their own CD's etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/168lewish
40,Iconic,This is a must see when you go to Hollywood. The area around the Chinese Theater is the most congested and exciting part of the Walk. The Blvd becomes less congested as you walk towards Vine. It was interesting to see the names of your favourite stars and click pictures with them.There are a lot of annoying people trying to sell you stuff from a 1$ to 10$ trying to scam you but try avoiding them. A lot of people dressed in costumes like Michael Jackson and Batman whom you can pay to take pictures with.There are a couple of souvenir shops too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sachin_Zarekar
30,Typical tourist trap,Street performers and tour bus people hounding every step of the way but it's something different.Be ready for people trying g to sell you CDs and trying to get you to pay to take pictures with them in their costumes.... Some of them can be really pushy too!If you see a guy dresses like chubacca from star wars.... Watch out... He is very pushy and rude!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philo106
10,Wtf is going on here,"Does anyone in the city of Hollywood own a damn pressure washer. Wash some sidewalk, clean some buildings and restrict panhandlers. It smells like hot urine anywhere you go here. It's a real shame to see a street so beautiful sink so low. Theater is a nice piece of history, it should be kept clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/korz5
40,A walk down memory lane,Great opportunity to walk through history and watch the incredible diversity in Hollywood. Plenty of souvenir shops and photo opportunities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nvylfl
30,OK but not a show stopper,"Overrated but if your interested is such things and the attractions, being bothered by ""characters"" who will sell you their picture with you, go for it. There is a lot of history on the Blvd so google the walk of fame and other tidbits. Watch your purses and wallets as the crowds can be horrendous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobandmargieg
30,One of a kind experience,"To walk and see all the celebrities is nice , but it is almost out of hand covering almost 5 blocks and both sides of the street. More important is the divers group that gathers here from around the world, and around the corner, people flock here day and night. So I would avoid if you are agoraphobic or claustrophobic during the peak hours. Great visit to remember the older generations of hollywood, but not that exciting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InspireMI
20,Overatred,"It was great to get to Hollywood after driving from Vegas. We stayed in an apartment on the walk of fame- Hollywood boulevard- which was great- the actual boulevard where the stars names are was disappointing- very unclean and grotty we found- some of the stars names were just dirty- you would think in the early hours a cleaning machine would go up and down the pavements to clean them, - but I don't think so!but the nearer you headed to Beverly Hills end, the better it was- lots of tour guides touting to take you up to the stars homes, pestered every 25 metres by someone- asking- after our first half hour of it we started saying- been there, done it etc etc. At night lots of police about,felt a little un safe- beware of the people dressed in characters - as they pose for photos then ask for money,- then people hand you a cd, and then ask for money or want them to sign the cd for you- just beware.The places to see are great to- get out of the boulevard- the hop on hop of bus is a great way to se the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R2589LXpeterr
50,Loved it!,"All the stars along Hollywood Blvd! Lots of other attractions, too. Watch out for many homeless on the streets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S981BFsusanc
50,Stars,All the stars on the walk fame are great to see and get photos of. A must see for all film fans. There is always something going on down there no matter what time of day or night,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O947YXrobc
30,"The stars are ok, the rest is not.","Fun to walk down the Hollywood Boulevard and look for your favourite 'stars'.But the area need a real clean up (intrusive sellers of tours/cd, beggars, bad tourist shops etc).The area around Chineese theater and Dolby theater (with its new center) are nice enough.Take a lunch at Trastevere and a late dinner at Musso&Frank Grill, and spend the rest of your time in Los Angeles elsewhere (generally a boring city).If you want to take a vacation in California, San Fransisco is the city to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EuropeanMan
30,Very crowded walkway,The whole walkway was very crowded. But you get to take photos with many superheroes Cosplay Characters.... at a fee....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Francis_LPS
40,Good but not as I expected,"It is basically a boulevard with sidewalks with names of stars. The way they grouped the names is random I think, because 3-4 very famous stars are together with 3-4 not so famous stars. But it is free to walk and interesting thing to do. And if you are lucky, you can stand on your famous stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/berkinb
30,Good for a one time visit,While there were many attractions and its is good eccentric people watching area it also goes through seedy areas that i felt unsafe in...there is a good view of the hollywood sign from the main shopping mall at around the 2nd and 3rd floor walkway..also many tours of LA start from here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zebcarvalho
40,Worthwhile,It's crazy down there but worth a wander up and down looking at the stars. You'll get harassed but it's fun and a must do in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamB1368
40,long and everywhere,"We thought -first time visitors- that the Walk of Fame is a fairly short boulevard kind of street where you immediately find all the celebrities. However, this Walk of Fame is sort of spread over the suburb and also the celebrities are ""mixed"" i.e. ther is no stretch with the older celebrities and a new stretch with the ""actual"" celebrities. We did not find all the ones we were hoping for",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieb382
20,Uninspiring,"Visited a second time because ... you know, it's expected. Won't make the same mistake again. I can't imagine why an actor would want a star on a grubby pavement where people walk. There seems no rhyme or reason as to the location of the stars - is it better to be close or far away? Who knows? Great actors and directors take no precedence over others. Many stars cracked. Hardly an honour in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/241carole
10,Overrated,"I really would not recommend taking time out of your day to walk down the whole of this street. It is so jam-packed you can hardly see the floor anyway and the street stinks.If you happen to find yourself on the street whilst going somewhere else that's fine, but i really wouldn't suggest doing it purposely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophiey944
30,Grotty area,"Whilst it is good to see the stars on the pavement, be under no illusion that this is a very grotty area and we felt a bit uncomfortable walking down the road with our children. Given its prominence I am sure it is pretty safe but we were very disappointed by the area this tourist attraction was in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/41MarkA
30,Something To Do,"Definitely a tourist attraction and a bit crowded. There are some shops along the way, people selling bottles of water and others trying to get you to buy their cd's, which drove me crazy. We didn't need that much time so were lucky to get meter parking and just walked. I guess if it's your first time in LA, you can put it on your to do list. There is a huge souvenir store along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karene594
30,Not overly impressed,"I'm glad that my son and I visited the Hollywood Walk of Fame because we were in Hollywood. It was extremely hot and slightly chaotic trying to look at the different stars. There were a lot of visitors, which was expected but there were also a lot of people trying to sale tours or other items that added to the chaos! Glad we saw it but was underwhelmed, it could have been the crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rodjohn
30,Fun to see but overrated,"My son and I went to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame in August, and while we thought it was fun to recognize so many of the names, after a few minutes, it was time to move on to something else. It's a little overrated but I would still suggest going to see it because there are other things to do in that area of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Satisfied49
50,"Fun day, had to be done",Would have been good to see at least one real celebrity that was not made of wax although we did see mini mouse.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CraigR819
20,Crouded,"We went there by car and got lucky. We got a parking lot just at the beginning of the walk of fame. we paid 1.5$ and could stay 1hour. This was just enough to walk down and up again. apart from the stars on the floor you see many theaters and souvenir shops, not really exciting to be honest...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanJ1670
20,Short visit,"It's a Tourist attraction without the charm and authenticity of LA.You come, look for your favourite stars, shot some photos and drive away.It, super tourist, quite dirty, food quality is quite poor and parking expensive.Been to Barcelona's Les Rambles? More or less the same",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691carlesc
50,Awesome,So many stars to see. Could do with an official map of where the stars are located. Ate at Planet Hollywood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C7980BFmikew
30,Interesting,"It's one of those things that everyone wants to see but be prepared for the wierdos and people trying to peddle tours, etc. as you walk along. It could also do with a good clean as the sidewalks are a little grimy. The homeless people don't add anything to it either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrPurser
50,Great nightlife sightseeing,"We took a great walk after exploring wax museum. The street is super long, fullOf artists stars, took us a whileTo find our favorite ones though, but we definitely had a great time. They play music, sell cool souvenirs, make shows, street is always busy but not super crowded. Enjoyed our night !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauruze
40,Lots of Fun,"It is a lot of fun to read the names of the stars honored on the Boulevard and enjoy some history, architecture, food, and coffee along the way. A little gritty at times, but still fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
30,Walk of Fame,"We found the walk of fame a bit shabby, lots of people trying to shove their cd's in your hand or place a snake around your neck for a photo opp.Lots of top end shops in the mall - which were all probably fine - lots of the same souvenir shops on the strip - but we couldn't wait to get out of there. Took the big bus ride - the first bus tour which has ever taken me on a motorway/freeway - really windy on top deck!Got pictures from the bus of some random stars and that was good enough to say I'd been.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janeyw1234
40,Pass time !,"If you need something to fill up couple hrs .Walk down look at a few stars on sidewalk .Lots of people walking around ,but other then that not much to do & see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525EricP
10,Very dirty the city needs to kick the bummms out,Please keep tourists safe. We got people handing out CD set forth me for the play them cash we got people dressing up in old outdated they coffee and that was involved the celebrities of Hollywood and we got bumped you are harassing for a rest from all over America this is Hollywood Americas they get these bonds and 33 cleaned up people shouldn't be allowed to piss him Hollywood Boulevard the pioneers of the silver screen would be very upset 😭,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Porphyrius
50,Seeing is believing!,"The iconic Hollywood Walk is a must-see. Sure, it's touristy. Yup, it's cheesy. But even the most cynical visitor will get excited to see their favorite movie/tv/recording artist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2017love2travel2017
50,Entertaining,How funny to have to explain to my three boys the stars on the Hollywood walk of fame. We walked all the way along Hollywood Blvd. Looking at the stars names. It really was fun reminiscing about all the old stars I thought I'd forgotten. I spent every day finding someone new to tell my boys about. They found Michael Jackson knew who Charlie Chaplin was but struggled with Shirley Temple and John Wayne!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isobelg540
30,Lost It's Tinsel,"It looks like Tinsel town has lost it's glitter Was disappointed at how dirty, and sleezy this area is now compared to when I was here many years ago. It was still fun looking at the stars and looking for your favorites or getting pics with your favorite movie character. Obviously still a big attraction as the streets were packed. Lots of transients looking for money or to hit you up for ""other favors"" shall we say. Not to mention people trying to sell you a tour, literally almost hounding you to buy a tour package. We literally had a people follow us down the street trying to get us to buy a tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrailBlazers04
40,Good experience,"I visited Walk of Fame/Hollywood Blvd with my family on a very very hot day. I highly enjoyed the vibrant atmosphere and all the entertainment throughout the walkway. The layout of the shops is also really nice and there is even a place to see the Hollywood sign in the distance, and the Chinese Theatre is also close by. A negative to this sight is that there are people handing out their CDs who bait you into taking it and then ask for a 'donation'. Do not fall for this! Besides that, this location is a great way to spend part of you day, as I don't think there's enough to do there to spend the entire day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_mdchong
40,A great big star studded walk!,WOW this street is LONG. With over 2000 stars you are bound to stumble across someone you adore and it's really fun when you get to the chinese theatre where the famous hand prints etc are too. There are loads of lookalikes of Hollywood stars there too. Some genuinely look like the actors.If you love movies you will will enjoy this and it's freeeee!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/case1984
30,There it is!,"Finding the star of your favorite personality never grows old, but crowds don't move just because you want a photo of a certain star. Lots of semi aggressive tour hawking along the way, along with gaggles of folks who just stand and more than a few down on their luck. It's no better, and likely a little worse, than what you expect. Donald J. Trump star has a significant crack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliao506
30,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is interesting to see if you're an old movie and TV buff like me. It has lots of really old time movie and TV stars, if you're old enough to remember them. Current stars, depending on who you're looking for, might be more difficult to find. There are also famous directors, writers, etc. Because there is no criteria as to what is considered a star; i.e., people who won Academy Awards, Emmys, etc. Moreover, some people have two or even three stars for various skills. There are lots of stars of people who I wouldn't consider a star (movie, TV or otherwise); i.e., Donald Trump, etc., but still have stars. I feel this gets in the way of people who were and are really stars.It is worth seeing if you have never seen it. This way, you can say you saw it. Sometimes it can interesting to see exactly where your favorite star is located, if you can find it. If you can't, look on the Internet and it will tell you exactly where it is located.Don't let the street vendors ruin it for you. Just ignore them and enjoy the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcopQ2910OR
30,It does what it says on the tin!,Interesting enough but you don't need to spend too much time walking the walk as you can see all you want to fairly quickly.Go early to avoid the crowds!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ashsaw
30,Meh...,"For my first time in LA, of course I wanted to at least see the Walk of Fame. In reality, the 30 minutes my son and I spent here were more than enough. The excited of walking down it was somewhat spoiled with all the ""street vendors"" hassling you every step you take for money. We had one fake Spider-Man guy basically force my to take a picture of him with my son and then pretty much demand $5 or more. And then a ""aspiring"" rapper or something handed me his CD to help ""get his music out there"" and then when I said thanks and walked away, he CHASED me down and yelled at me and demanded $10 ""at least"" for the CD he handed me. I said NO THANKS. DONT WANT IT. Anyway, not a necessary place for me to ever visit again. I guess I can now say I've seen it though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/531samanthaj
30,Second visit in 10 years,"When I visited here before, I guess I was 10 years younger and it was my first trip to LA, this time I was showing someone around.We visited at night, so it wasn't so crowded, however there seemed to be a lot of unsavoury characters milling about this time, the actual stars seemed to be quite dirty as well from what I can recall.All in all, what magic I recall from the last visit, wasn't here; however the Chinese Theatre lit up was much cooler than when I visited last time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandyring
30,Great placed ruined by street vendors,"A really vibrant street, with iconic theatres, hotels, restaurants and shopping. Perhaps a few too many ""tatt"" souvenir shops and the great collection of stars. The real ruin are the hassling street vendors; often with not a lot to sell, but aggressively perusing your dollars. This really put my children off walking in the area. All the police are cruising by in cars, rather than walking the strip. We ending up doing the same in taxis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonyd437
40,Walk for a Feel of Hollywood!,"The popular Hollywood Walk of Fame is a tad overrated, but is located in a area full of great places to eat and shop. Makes for a good photo spot in the city if you want one of those typical LA tourist shots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/782ritikaj
30,On the Los Angeles visit list....1/2 day is probably more than enough time.,"A visit to the Hollywood Walk of fame was on our LA to do list. We parked @ 'Hollywood & Highland' parking which is on the spot so worth the maximum $15 daily rate imho. We walked along the 'walk of fame' for 5 minutes in each direction looking at the stars and stopped at the TCL Chinese theatre to view the handprints. We decided not to do a theatre tour as this did not appeal to us. There were no movies we wished to see but I would suggest you check listings prior to check if you could tie in a movie with this visit here or at the EL Capitan theatre (Disney movies) across the road. We viewed the 'Hollwood' sign from the Hollywood & Highland centre, shopped and had some lunch before moving on. If your visit does not include a theatre tour / movie then I suggest 1/2 day is more than enough time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whatsitallaboutalfie
30,Interesting,Lots of shops with lots of souvenirs. Lots of bad music from the rappers. Lots of bad dudes and people trying to make a $ from anything. The hardest working guy was the one with the blank star and gold letters who for a price will make your very own star then take photos of you. Great marketing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinm250
40,Just enjoy walking the walk of fame,"You can easily spend half a day just walking on the streets of the Hollywood Blvd. Lots of street entertainers! You will find agents trying to sell you tourist sight seeing packages all along this busy street.But just say 'no', if you don't want it and they won't bother you. Parking is expensive on the side streets. It is $20 if you want to be closer to where the Dolby theater is located. You will find lots of souvenir shops and eateries. Evenings will be awesome when the lights come on and it is pleasant. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/222sridhart
20,Okay,"It's like any other city attraction,If you are too much into Hollywood movies then do visit,very crowded and all I liked was tht I saw the 'Hollywood ' on the mountain from far",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thadeshwar
30,Meh,It's the L.A. version of Times Square. Every damn tourist from all over the world and overblown neon lights from the new Zara.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelGavin
30,Movie Buff,We enjoyed walking the walk of fame. Jerry Lewis had recently passed away so there were still flowers at his star. I found the walk of fame a little nicer earlier in the morning when it was quieter and a few less venders out and about. Quite fun for a movie fan.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thekingofswapmeets
30,Too long,"I was pushing a 92 year old in a wheelchair and just found it long and boring. There are just so many hands and feet you can look at. For me knowing that one of my favourite actors stood in that spot was interesting. However, not on my list of must sees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/600diannaf
50,Seen some great stars!,It's hectic at times w the crowds of ppl walking and your trying to look but at the same time worth fighting off the crowds. The ppl are really nice for the most part when you are trying to take a picture because you are all there for the same reasonings!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlaytimewithMiss_T_e
40,Walk amongst the Stars,Walking along Hollywood Walk of Fame was fun and of course good for those who like the exercise. The sidewalks were clean and people were very courteous when you wanted to take pictures of your favorite stars. Some of the stars are in need of repair. I'm not a star struck person but it is something to put on your to do list while visiting the area. Lots of stores and places to eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6422016
30,Walk of fame - only a walk,Well its most people dream to have a walk on this famous walk of fame- but when u do its actually not much of a experience. Its only the pictorial memento that u have visited but nothing else.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abutaiyab
40,As seen on TV,"Hollywood Walk of Fame is one of the promenades you always see on TV. So, visiting Los Angeles, one visit is to see the stars, one of the icon of Los Angeles.It's a normal street, but more famous than other, so it worth a visit.Usually, as you can imagine, overcrowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PezFish
40,"First time visit, it's got to be done","Extremely busy, you are blown away with the celebrities who have walked the same spot as you. Marilyn Monroe, (icon) to Tom Hanks and some memorable names from the past and present. I have walked the walk, pleased I have but other places will now be a priority. It truly is worth a visit very nostalgic. Just remember the other thousands that have also wanted to walk the walk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debs242015
30,Overrated,I came here hyped up and excited with my family of 4 and I was really disappointed. Nothing special to see . Only names etched in the cement. The blocks were very crowded where you couldn't even move and when it wasn't there were homeless people everywhere. I wasn't sure if they had urine on some of the stars or if they were just that filthy. Would not return but I guess it should be a one time thing just to say you were there. But still very overrated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lous593
10,It's a shame,"It's a shame to all the celebrities having a star on this street. It is very, very dirty, some stars on the boardwalk are full with dirt and piss. Not even in the morning hour it will be cleaned. Really disappointing that a city like LA cannot afford to keep this street clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tooltime35
20,Not what we expected.,"While this is one of the top places to visit, it is actually underwhelming. Most of the tiles are dirty and it is a long and unpleasant walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CatherineH82017
40,can be replicated,"This is one item in my list of ""to do"" of my wife and am glad we took this. According to her- It was more of a curiosity of what this was all about and when we were there, like anybody else we search for our favorite and took picture with the stars. It is more amusing seeing others walking and talking photos, some lie down beside on the sidewalk too. Full of people of all sorts, so just like others a dream. Make sure you have your camera and be ready to be pushed if someone choose to be rude. Its just a matter of waiting for your turn to take the photo",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsbtfdn
30,Ok,Thought this was when i=of the things that you had to do when visiting LA but was actually little underwhelming.The stars go on for ages.Slightly better when you get nearer to the Chinese Theatre but before that are isn't great.Very touristy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mandyw30

There were to manny spectators to enjoy the stars on the ground. if we tried to stop to take a picture we were simply pushed forward or aside by a lot of asocial visitors, so the fun was over very quickly and we went in an Irish pub to drink and to see the crowd passing by",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wergie1

40,Great place to see great peoples name,Hollywood is all about stars and stardom. What an excellent way to remember their names.

30,Nice to See,"It's very interesting to see the stars on the streets, but the crowds are outrageous. I agree with the another posts that say get there early. It has a lot of people trying to sell you stuff, like water for a $1 or people dressed in costumes. We were there around 3 pm and you could hardly see the stars. I am glad I went as you need to see it at least once as it is an LA landmark, but once is enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianO43

I don't understand why people flock here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenmb2015
30,Brief Visit,"Visited relatively early in the day and it was quiet with only a few shops open. It made looking at the stars easy and that was all we were there for. Okay to visit to see once and to ""tick the box"" of things to do in LA. I guess it's a bit disappointing that it was so dirty , but hey it's a footpath so what do you expect although some places look like they haven't seen the business end of a Karcher since the stars were put there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404derrickr
30,Was ok,"Very commercial area of city, was sad to see some of the stars disgraced, one guy made us laugh with money required for a hooker and drugs",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geoffbec
50,Great place,A great place to hang around. The best place to park your car is at the Hollywood & Highland parking ($12 for few hours).The easiest way to park and walk around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visionbyrm
30,So so street,"A street of stars and actors names on both sides of the road on the ground, and a large horde of tourist and tacky souvenirs make up the rest. Where's the buzz and interest ? Unless there is a star out there, the place is a street. Apart from the dress ups of some people as Spiderman and Chewbacca, the hype was overrated. Who would spend more than 10 minutes walking up and down the road?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarilynK804

I quite happily walked around here took photographs and my wife and I were not bothered once. We were not hussled by buskers and not one vagrant actually asked us for change. This is a place that is mixed with chains and fantastic local businesses. This place is coated in modern history and the theatres are breath taking.

10,"Really? Surrounded by beggars, sex shops and drugs?","We visited the walk of shame, oops, I meant fame, on our way to the Griffiths Observatory. What a mistake. Parking was OK, but the walk along to see the stars in the pavement meant dodging beggars, averting the children's eyes from shops selling everything from 'exotic goods' to manikinis, and avoiding the smoke shops from Amsterdam. Throw in the touts for Hollywood tours, and it was just embarrassing for America. Such a pity. Avoid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soutanglie

The Blvd becomes less congested as you walk towards Vine. It was interesting seeing the names of both old and new stars which brought back some fond memories. Some very interesting looking people also.It's more than a walk - When you're on Highland, check out the tours of the Chinese Theater and the Dolby theater where the award shows are held. Also, go inside the multi-level Hollywood and Highland Center for some stunning views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanetHanover

40,Hollywood Blvd. FUN!!--A,The Famous Hollywood Blvd. can be a bit hectic but lots of fun. It stays jammed packed full of people (lots of which are tourists) day or night. The Walk of Fame is fun to see with so many shops to grab the best souvenirs. This is a busy spot and has so much going on. If you visit wear comfortable attire and prepare for the walk if you have small children. Public Restrooms are scattered so plan for that as well. Expect to see movie characters wandering about for great photo opps. This is a great spot to see if you are in LA. My rating--A,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckee77

The photo on this page shows an empty, beautiful looking sidewalk filled with stars ready for viewing. The reality is the sidewalks are packed, you can barely move much less stop and take photos of a star without getting trampled. The strip is dirty and disgusting and stinks of marijuana (which we say at least 2 people smoking). Again, enjoy the iconic nature but be prepared to want to leave as soon as you can",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G_R123456789

Its a depressing place with rundown establishements, stench of urine and homeless people all over. Everyone gets the dispersion of income but if the city cares about this walk, it needs to show. Like someone else said Hollywood is state of mind so just get to the hill signage pix and avoid this place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spisea
40,The Kids LOVED the Walk of Fame,We spent 8 days touring the greater LA area and the kids could not wait for theHollywood Walk of Fame. We enjoyed about an hour there.

50,Fun,"So it's Hollywood Boulevard, it's manic, busy, loud- of course it is.The walk of fame is fantastic with a map available to find who you want. The front outside of the Chinese Theatre has all the handprints and foot prints of the stars and it is equally entertaining. You can literally stand in the same spot as your favourites and it's pretty cool that you can.Lots to see, well worth doing, go early to have more access to everything as it was busy even at 9am on a Sunday when we went.Have a look at the Quentin Tarantino's footprints- he got one over on them there!

50,Loved it,"When we planned our trip to LA I wasn’t too excited to see the walk of fame, but when we got there I loved it. It just takes over you. But I recommend going early in the morning, before it gets crowded. Evenings are the worst. You can’t take any pictures after dark. I recommend you plan which stars you want to see, there are many websites that offer list of all stars and corresponding addresses. There is no free parking available; we parked in an parking house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abeillesgee
30,My hometown,"I grew up in Hollywood and still come visit every now and then. Things have improved but would I recommend it for a visit to all, probably not but then if it's on your list and your visiting LA for the first time you probably need to give it a quick tour. Here are my suggestions:Visit during the day, park your car at the Hollywood and Highland facility. Most of the stores and restaurants there will validate for a discounted parking price. Check out the walk of fame, walk over to the Chinese theater and see the footprints in cement. Soak up a little bit of the craziness of Hollywood and then head out to one of the many other amazing things to be seen in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamaLuu

Go early, it can get crowded !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/knewks

30,We have our walk of fame.,"We travelled all the way from Sydney to meet this iconic place, we find the place roughly how we expect it. Just adding the fact that shows a lot the American put-a-product in everything kinda feel. The iconic place doesn't offer much entertainment. It's mostly a landmark used to sell souvenirs and products. Mostly like every American attraction, overcrowded wow products and money focused. We surprisingly had more fun buying some delicious tacos from a car on the road, btw highly recommended, awesome food and very affordable. The only thing I regret was not buying another one of those delicious tortillas yummy yummy. That's probably the only reason why I would like to go back there :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiemora
30,"I suppose it's a ""must-do"" but it's not that great","People think that the Walk of Fame is a must-do in Los Angeles but the truth is it exists purely for tourists. LA residents would rather drop off their guests than accompany them to this tourist trap.Take a photo with your celebrity's star (they had to pay for that, you know) and then get the hell out of dodge. Be careful of tourist traps, over-priced tours (you can always negotiate) and an overall grimy atmosphere.Bottom line: go, take your pictures, and then no need to go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgerber18
30,"Fun to see stars, but Hollywood could be a lot better","I live a few miles from Hollywood and have to go there occasionally (either for business or showing sites to friends). There's something to be said for coming upon a star of a favorite actor or entertainer and I've enjoyed having my picture taken with one of my favorites. The downside is that Hollywood is pretty much a dump. Especially in front of Highland and Hollywood. Sure that's kind of an upscale venue with overpriced eateries, but the mass of people on the street and all the hustlers trying to hawk something (CDs, photos, religion) is annoying. Walk a couple blocks away and it just looks dingy. There are some hidden gems in the area (museums, theaters), but Hollywood Blvd lost its glitter decades ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Milauskas

40,Walk in the sunshine,Lovely to walk along these iconic images in Hollywood. Found some 'special' ones. Shame to see some defaced but I suppose it's a sign of the times.

40,GOOD BUT LONG,You can park right on the road next to the stars and restaurants are nearby and easy access to a great viewing point if the Hollywood sign brilliant for pictures which you can also get taken in the second bridge high. Both sides of the roads pavements are filled with stars although it is sometimes hard to take pictures considering the amount of people. Great gift shops also surround the walk meaning a good chance to buy presents and souvenirs for you and family and friends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmelieRule
20,Overrated and cheap,The whole place is a bit of a let down as it is scruffy with tacky shops. The walkway is a good idea but the surroundings are a big let down . Only visit if you have time .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shillas
20,Interesting but grubby,"When we arrived in Hollywood we thought the Walk of Fame had to be a must see. It was enjoyable to see the stars names on Hollywood Blvd. and to evoke memories from past and present as we walked up and down both sides of the road.On the downside, Hollywood Blvd is dirty and, in some places, very run down which undermines the significance of a walk of fame.It may get tarted up for the Oscars but in August it is a bit grim.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScotsmanabroadKMB
20,It's worth doing once!,"Maybe it's me but I might be jaded. I've lived in Los Angeles the majority of my life that I can recall. I've walked down these steps a hundred times and drove by a million more. I always thought street performers were great but just not worth stopping by and taking a closer look. Realistically if you are a tourist you have to for the sake of history. But, locals see it as something that could've been better maintained and the unfortunate sight of poverty of those who live there. Downside it smells like urine. Upside you may find a celebrity you might be looking for on stars or just simply trolling. Lol.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psjsong
50,Interesting,"There are thousands of names on the wall of fame from movies, TV, music, sports etc. Very interesting stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexH214
30,Interesting but congested.,"It is a fascinating area however there were so many people it was difficult to really look at the stars. Parking was available, pricey but we were able to get some of it validated. There are many character actors you can take a picture with, for tips. Not my style but lots of people seemed to enjoy it. A movie was previewing in the area so made it more difficult to get around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phavorite
20,Hassled on street,"Parked at the Hollywood mall ( public car park $2) to access the walk and see the Hollywood sign. The mall is nice. Clean, relaxed, safe with good stores. We walked out the front to the walk of fame to see some of the stars set in to the pavement and were immediately hassled by people trying to hand us leaflets/CDs. After only 20yds or so we'd had enough and returned to the calm of the mall where they clearly were not allowed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandab70
50,Interesting... Dirty... Comical,"When you see the Hollywood Walk of Fame on TV, it looks clean and full of nice places for the family to enjoy. When you get there you get a totally different picture. Smells like urine, drug addicts everywhere, drunks everywhere and lots of cops. But, lol... on the other hand, there are some great restaurants, bars and gift shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikki0082
30,Cool collection of Hollywood stars,This is another of the iconic activities for movie buffs. Plenty to see from famous names. Crossing to the other side of the road away from the Chinese theatre is less crowded but still plenty of star names to seeLoved the make your own star on the walk that was temporary with the right style of lettering for a cool picture,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrNic1
30,Overhyped,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a nice place to visit, don't get me wrong. It's just that I couldn't help but feel it was largely overrated. It's very dirty, trash everywhere and there's a constant stream of people coming up to you trying to sell something. Glad I went though, got to cross that off my bucketlist, but I would not visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigate463955
40,Wonderful Walk of Fame,"I've lived in LA for 15 years now and Hollywood is still one of my favorite places. Celebrated with friends as New Edition received their Star in January 2017. It's always fun and each time I hang out there, I notice a new star. I love that it goes on for miles and is always a top tourist spot. The ceremonies are great, short and sweet and gives fans a chance to see their favorite artists up close and personal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lletcher2016
10,Underwhelming,"When in LA you do the tourist things. My impression is that LA does not want to attract tourism and is relying on the fact that people will just turn up regardless.My thoughts were, it's dirty, crowded and full of street 'entertainers' (beggars who dress up, play awful tunes etc and then expect payment for a high five.) It was a real shame to see something that celebrities aspire to gain left in such a filthy state with rubbish, beggars and homeless. Even the Highland Centre next to the walk was complete with drunk locals. On top of that the prices of food etc are just ripping tourists off.I'm sure everyone will still want to do it, which is what LA relies on, but it's just a filthy pavement with tacky crap and unfortunate souls who have no other option than to beg. If it was anywhere else you would avoid it like the plague.Shame it's only tidied up for the Oscars, which apparently takes a month of work. The illusion of Hollywood at its best!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidfN211JF
40,Careful,You have to be cery careful with this tourist trap although it will inspire you of the passion for the film industry. Watch out for possible pickpockets when it gets too crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cranium157
20,A dump!,"We drove just 20 minutes to get see what we all see on tv and get a feel of the walk of fame.... but what a dump of an area.Pro:Easy to park and priced ok.Con:The walk of fame was more a walk of tacky cheap sleazy shops.After pictures at the Chinese theatre and looking at the hand and feet prints in front of the theatre, you're done.There is really nothing else to see..... well apart from the shopping/restaurants walkway's view of the iconic Hollywood sign but that's it.If in the area, yes do see it, you can't really not. But could I recommend going out your way to see it, no.Big disappointment and now know the celebs we see on tv turn up at this dump of an area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CupidStunt1968

40,Fun time,Fun looking for 'our stars'. A bit crowded but what isn't in LA:) The crowds added to the entertainment factor. Street vendors with snakes wrapped around their necks kept us on our toes. People watching was enlightening to say the least. Good view of the Hollywood signfrom the 2nd level of the mall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scm77
30,Weirdos all around,"It's fun to see the stars on the Walk of Fame, it's also fun to see the hands and feet in cement at the Grauman's Chinese Theater, but there's always too many people and vendors almost forcing pamphlets on you as you go by, or offering CDs and the faux characters (Jack Sparrows etc.) wanting money to get their photo taken. If you can go first thing in the morning before the crowd, that would be better",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pajg245

I would not allow my name to be in this dirty sidewalk, I have seen some names being spitted or pissed on!!! Tacky plastic souvenirs, all made in China and solicitors or drug users lying in the street, weed smells on every corner. Fast food only! Go there only if you have nothing better to do, you won't go back probably after this one-time experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcins90
40,A must do for all the family,"Awesome place to visit. Find you favourite stars in the footpath and take your best selfie.Do upstairs in the Dolby Centre and get a great photo of the Hollywood Sign. A must is a stop in at the Roosevelt Hotel across the road, just do it and you shall be impressed I'm sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/894allanw
30,A must do - but probably only once,This is a must do for anyone travelling to LA. I would definitely advise going first thing in the morning as it gets extremely busy later in the day. Some of the stars go into some less pleasant areas and you do get approached by many street entertainers/characters who will have there picture taken with you for a tip. We are glad that we have done it but don't think it's necessary to return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda4471
30,A Short Walk,"As a fan of all things Hollywood this is a bit of a let down. There is little glitz, glamour and all things historic. It's a mall with a walkway of Stars bearing celebrity names. Usually too crowded to enjoy a slow stroll. The place is crawling with costume characters trying to make a buck. The area from Grauman's theater to the corner where Ripley's is located is pretty much all to see. One long city block. The best place to see the Hollywood sign is around back of the Dolby Theater. Other than that this is a bucket list tourist visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincea847
30,It has a buzz,This place has a buzz. There are people everywhere. Watch out for the guys wanting you to take their CD because they are an awesome rapper.

50,OMG! What a great time we had,"Being a movie lover back and front I have enjoyed the ""stars"" very much. Lot of history in one place as you walk on the walk of frame. It was a great idea that on the end- or the front- depends where you start the walk- we could have some lovely photos taken with our own stars. We did that with our little dogs. Life long memories!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/384renatan
40,Worth the Walk,You have to do this - the stars go on for quite a distance but the best area is near the Hard Rock. Gets very busy in this section. The rest is a bit seedy.Worth a quick visit but don't expect too much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Warsie
30,Mixed Feelings,"Let's be straight, the Hollywood Walk of Fame is a functioning Street with tons of foot traffic and gridlocked road traffic. I don't see what's so appealing about taking a photo of a dirty star on a piece of pavement.People will randomly stop dead in front of you to see a star. It's one of the hardest streets to walk on.Don't get me wrong, it is cool to see, but I would probably go really early in the morning or really late at night next time to avoid the queues and wouldn't spend more then 30 minutes there. Hollywood Boulevard is overrated in my opinion.Be aware of taking photos with street performers (they will charge a fortune).I think Sunset Boulevard is much more of a ""Hollywood"" experience than that of the tourist trap which is the Hollywood Walk of Fame (and Hollywood Boulevard in general)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/youngaussietravelle
20,Interesting but over-rated...,"Worth the visit but the neighborhood is a bit cheap... A lot of homeless people, nothing against them but not what you want to see as a tourist with a family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DantehetGooi
30,Great to be there...but...,So glad to have seen this.However choose your times carefully and if possible do not walk around alone.I went for an early morning walk around here today and within seconds a guy smashed a bottle in front of me as another was screaming at people to 'drop dead.'By midday it was a different place completely with many people out and about and I felt much safer.So avoid this place if alone during early morning and after dark. Otherwise fine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyjM5770HK

50,Walk in the early morning,"I recently went to LA for the 1st time and had a great time. If you really want to get good ics of your fav stars, suggest going in the early morning. By the time 11 am hits you cant see the start nonetheless get a pic because its already packed with tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/738shamils
40,Must see and do activity in LA,It's one of the things you need to see and do-wak along the road and see some of the Star's names. Very crowded streets but people are generally polite if you want to take a photo of a particular Star's name,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelabP4541HV
40,Fun one time experience,"This attraction can best be seen as a fun one time experience. You get to take pictures with the names on the stars, and check out the best of Hollywood at the same time. It's not a type of attraction to go back to though, one time is enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seriouss_foodie
30,Okay,"Such a cool place to say that you've been, but the physical walk of fame with all the stars goes on for ages and ages! And it's hard to find certain stars because they're all scattered everywhere. The Donald Trump star is right where everyone is though near the Chinese theatre (I think) if you're looking for it lol.Some very aggressive performers, people dressed in costumes and people trying to get you to buy their mixtape or go on a Hollywood tour. We definitely were over it after being there for an hour or so.We did enjoy the types of people you see there at the same time though. It's definitely an experience. Good place to buy touristy things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristymayk
40,Gets better as you walk along...,"Initially we were a little disappointed. We expected to see more than just some stars on the ground. But as you walk along and head towards the star of Mohammad Ali (which is on the wall by the way, in reverence to his name) the activity begins. There is an open shopping mall, places to sit and have ice cream, street performers and lots of music. Watch out for people trying to sell you things... they use weird tactics like handing you a CD and then demanding a donation. The El Capitan Theatre is there, so if you're lucky you might come across a movie Premier attended by some of the stars. We weren't that lucky 😑It's a must do when you come to LA... but so t set your expectations too high.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbbyUmer

40,"Pretty cool, lots of names you will have forgotten.","The Walk itself is pretty cool, with lots of celebrities names you will have forgotten from your childhood, it will definately make you melancholy. It is mostly one of those things that you just have to do if you're in Hollywood. Easy to get to by train, catch the red line to Hollywood/Highland and it puts you right in the middle of the stars.After reading other reviews, and feeling worried about the level of homelessness, I tried to keep an open mind. Yes, there are alot of homeless people begging, and living on the street (but you will be hard pressed to find anywhere that there are no homeless people in the US), so that does affect the environment. Make sure you DON'T give any money as there are alot of scammers. Street performers expect a few dollars to have your photo taken with them, so factor in $5-$10 if you stop and get one (they really don't like it if you only have a couple dollars to give). Also check out the Dolby theatre and Mann's Chinese theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronchelleb
40,Late afternoon/early evening visit,"Visited one evening. Interesting street entertainment (Michael Jackson impersonator looked like Michael was alive and kicking...literally!) but beware...superheroes want to take a picture with you but then they want some $. People have snakes you can hold and before you know it, you are holding a snake but they are looking for $ also. Nothing is free! Lots of homeless people. One end is definitely the ""happening"" end with wax museum, Chinese theater, gift shops...the other end gets a little seedy.

And it is fun seeing your favorite star's name on the sidewalk. Cons: street was very crowded, had lots of people trying to sell you tours, etc, and is a bit hot and stuffy mid day in August.

30,It's worth seeing - but don't spend a lot of time,"We made a brief stop to hop around on the Hollywood Walk of Fame - just to show our son what it was like, to look for a few favorite stars, and to see the Hollywood sign. We found pay-lot parking fairly close by that we felt comfortable with in the daytime, and we spent (maybe) an hour strolling around the area close to the theater, just looking for various stars and finding a vantage point for taking some pictures of the Hollywood sign - and that's all we needed. The area is jam packed with tourists (yes, we were three of them), and it just seems (and looks) dirty - not a place you want to hang out for too long. We were able to go into the mall area to use restrooms (they were okay) and grab some cold drinks and a pretzel - and then we left. Glad we did it - don't need to go back. You can make it part of a day where you have other things to do and its not out of the way. It is fun to find some of your favorite stars on the sidewalks - and the placement seems fairly random (not sure how that's determined).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackmom1112

Really cool to try and spot your favourite stars - wish I would have done some research first though and found out where some of my favourites were before we went. Very busy around the Chinese theatre so be careful you don't walk into other visitors! Chinese theatre was a nice added bonus. Away from busy areas it was fine and no problems to get photos taken! Glad we saw it - it wouldn't have felt right being in Hollywood and not making the effort. I'm surprised (and glad) they haven't found a way of charging you $ to see it - there's not much in LA that is free to visit!

30,Disappointing,"One of the main attractions to Los Angeles is Hollywood Walk of Fame to see all the stars, spot your favourite take a photo etc and take in the sights. Well the day was very warm, hectic busy, people pushing, shoving past hurrying you out the way to take their photo (even got told to move for their daughters photo)!! Majority of the signs are filthy, not shiny on the main Trip Advisor page, portions of the street smelled of urine and dirt, generally big what I'd expected. The tour/ticket touts get a bit tiresome after the 10th approach down one section. Many sex and smoke shops, hand few tourist shops some quite over priced. Some good, reasonable places to grab a snack. There's opportunity to get your photo taken with lookalikes only saw a couple which were good (Al from hangover, Samuel L Jackson (pulp fiction) & Willy Wonka (johnny depp version). Then you have those who put on a costume and don't really put much more effort than that, e.g. Chewbacca with LA gloves? Filthy Spider-Man (4+ there) you get the idea. Parking cost $20 in a multi storey opposite Madame Tussaudes. Needed to be seen but must admit was disappointing they're not as treasured as you'd think.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/astv76

I stayed close to my group at all times.There was a guy who had snakes on his neck walking around, a man just wearing a towel, plus a lot of people in inapprotie attire.There was hardly any police around. The place needs to be more supervised because of how sketchy it is. I would just drive by and look out the window.

They also work hard to keep in shape & stay relevant ~ it's easy to be a 1-&-done with the fierce competition constantly trying to dethrone them. I have a special admiration for those who have made their mark & been memorialized with a permanent star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChanEvan
30,Fun to find the Star of your favorite Star. Seedy area of Los Angeles though.,"Our grandkids liked to walk up and then down the street looking for their favorite Stars. They liked putting their hands and feet in the cement blocks of the ´stars´. The area is a little seedy though, however with so many tourists it was not directly dangerous. Too bad the unwanted element cannot be removed and this area become nice to be in. There is money to earn here! Wated potential. Plenty of paid parking in parking garages in the area. We also took a side-visit to the Ripeys museum (every KID should go at least once to one of these kinds of places.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyNorwegians
20,A letdown overall,"I was not impressedby the walk of fame. The stars go off in every which-way direction with no clear order in which they are placed. The pavement was pretty dirty too which didn't really add to the 'glamour' of it all. They also don't all face the same direction which is pretty annoying if you are walking along trying to read them, my neck actually started to hurt after about 20 minutes if this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megan_anderson1995
30,Busy but Tawdry,"Our first visit to LA & keen to experience Hollywood's Walk of FameThis area though has become a huge tourist trap, always too busy, lots of 'characters' from music & movies who expected payment for photographs or expect 'donations' for street performanceSome of these street performances in my opinion are poor to average with very occasional reasonable level.Keep an eye on your wallet or purse or valuables.In very busy periods it is often difficult to see the 'Star's Star' due to number of people on the sidewalk.This section of Hollywood Boulevard is tourist central with most of tour buses in the area.The Dolby Theatre is there and you can do a tour, see a movie or go and do shopping, enjoy a meal in the Hollywood & Highgate Centre. This is a good place to avoid the Crowds in one of the Restaurant/Bars on the Upper Deck while people watching or take a picture of the Hollywood sign from viewing platform.It was not really glamorous but it is part of the Hollywood experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewieTraveller
30,"It was ok, was expecting more","Too crowded with too little attraction. Try the VIP Ripleys, wax museum and gusiness world record whilst on route.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U5285IFcraigs
30,Bus Tour,My wife and I took the bus tour from Hollywood to downtown. The tour was interesting and informational. The traffic was bad getting to and from downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dunn45
40,Okay,Doing the walk and looking for your favorite stars for pictures is okay but so hard to photograph due to the number of people walking through and the fact they don't care what you are trying to do,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/51craigg
20,Just so so,"I guess everyone wants to walk down Hollywood Walk of fame, just be prepared. It is dirty and side streets smell like urine. It wouldn't be on my list of places to return to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amn804
10,Dirty and Nasty,Never seen so much garbage on the streets in my life. Homeless everywhere and smells like pee. People constantly trying to sell you stuff and everything is just nasty. Neat to say you have been but don't expect to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henrysm
30,fun but be careful,Is great to see your favorite Hollywood stars along the walk of fame but be care not to take anything from anyone or take a photo with someone unless you are prepared to tip. They are VERY aggressive and point blank steal from people. Enjoy the entertainment but keep your hands on your stuff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifer1216
50,Must see,U got toSee this whilst in Hollywood but accept it willBe busy and dirty and surrounded by homeless people. They don't bother u tho. A must see whilst in Hollywood but won't be back. They do clean the streets I saw themPlenty of times but obv the amount of ppl and homeless I guess it's hard toKeep onTop of it. Loved it all the same. Won't be back tho as we can nowTick the box.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wren76
20,Didn't like it,"We spend half a day to walk around the area but honestly nothing impressed me. Tried to find some famous names on the path but most of them are dirty and even damaged without maintenance.It was crowded, full of vendors trying to sell you souvenirs or costumed characters who touched/scared you for pictures that need to pay.People says you have to do it once. Yes, never again for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/openyoureyes369
30,"A ' must-do ' but, nothing special.","Its something that you probably think and you will do,..but, wonder at the end of the day...that it may not have been THAT special. The hand prints and footprints in the concrete in front of the chinese theatre ...much more interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdrianSly
40,Fun,"So accessible to the hotel and all the great entertainers from the decades are there including Michael Jackson, Lily Pons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/479elisabethk
40,Fun experience!,"My family (wife with two kids aged 10 and 12) visited here in July 2017.The walk of fame is so iconic we felt we couldn't miss it. We arrive around 9:00am on a weekday and it was great - no crowds, no obnoxious vendors, etc. I had already planned out exactly which stars we wanted to see and where they were. It was fun to find our favourites and take our pictures with them - Judge Judy, the Doors, William Shatner, the Olsen twins (not my choice), but the list goes on! :)Unfortunately, the TCL Chinese Theatre was blocked off for an upcoming premiere so all I could see were the R2-DR and C3PO ""foot prints"" out in front near the sidewalk.After a museum visit and theater tour at the El Capitain, the sidewalks were packed with people! Like, hard to move around crowded.We had lunch at Mel's Diner and got out of there.Definitely worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dms666
20,Another must do- but why,"Other than seeing names on stars, there is nothing appealing about this Walk. The crowds are intense. The stores are all about souvenirs, the snakes - yes snakes- being put around tourists heads (with permission) are scary, and there is just nothing redeeming about this iconic walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steves941
30,I guess you have to do it once,If you have never done it before I guess you have to. The day I was there it was very crowded. Everyone is looking down while walking so expect to bump into other people. Being from NY it felt a lot like Times Square and a place where most natives avoid. I did stop at the Dolby Theatre which I enjoyed and took a drive down Sunset Blvd which was cool to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bkmiker
30,Nothing much,"Besides having just stars names written on stars, the location is just busy and unsafe with homeless people dancing and entertaining large crowds. Great place to shop souvenirs tho",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TahirS188
50,fun day looking at the STARS!,"Had a fun day looking for our favorite STARS and taking photos! People watching, checking out restaurants and buying souvenirs made for a good time. If you want to avoid the crowds go early in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SAMAGILL
40,Massive area,I had no idea the walk of fame was spread over such a large area. All different directions as well. Lots of famous stars and some surprises too ( Donald trump Wtf?!),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/305rickg
10,"NOT family friendly,lots of homeless people, Absolutely filthy,super crowded. Over priced junk","If I had a small child or a stroller I would skip right by this one.The sidewalks are so crowded and there was homeless people laying on the sidewalks actually blocking the path to walk. There are nothing but cheap vendors with junk from China hounding you at every store. Was hoping to do some people watching and check out some stars but I felt very unsafe and we left after a short period of time when a vendor physically grabbed my 12 yr old away for a ""picture"" umm no don't touch kids that are not yours..I've been to lots of large cities before(Vegas,NY,etc) and this strip was the all time worse. They need to power wash the sidewalks and buildings to remove the stench of garbage and help the homeless get off the sidewalks...Maybe the cops should enforce the law of panhandling out of bags instead of walking around harassing teens on skateboards...smh.. they are not the problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dazzlingdiamond
30,Surreal experience,"It was great to come and see the Walk of Fame. It's extremely busy on Hollywood boulevard especially near the Chinese Theatre. Watch out for up and coming artists who try to sell you their CDs, they practically place it in your hands without asking and the next thing you know they are asking you for money for it.It's definitely worth seeing while in LA but once is enough. It's way too crowded.The walk of fame goes for ages, we didn't even have a chance to see it all but we're happy with what we saw.I recommend if your staying in LA, stay in West Hollywood. It's less touristy there and not as many homeless people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalievb1988
30,Kind of overrated,"I went on a day that is was very hot, but it was extremely crowed both with traffic and walkers. It's cool seeing the different names but it isn't easy to find parking and isn't the greatest neighborhood. Multiple times people trying to sell weed on the street. Wouldn't be a priority if I visited again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simplythetruth21
40,Overrated street/Oppskrytt gate!⭐️,"Har alltid drømt om å besøke Hollywood! Og har alltid gleda me til å besøke dinna plassen men den va alt for oppskrytt!Bare stjerne me navn på og skitten gate og små shapper med suvinirer, noen klesbutikker og Maddam Tussauds.Ikke noen kjendiser å se! Sikkert fint for noen å oppleve!😊Have always dreamed about standing in Hollywood and visiting the walk of fame. But it was to overrated. 2 streets filled with stars and names. No celebrities to see and only Souvenirs and some clothing shops and Maddam Tussauds.Probably nice for some people to visit!😊 It was a must for me and now i've seen it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneMarteFolstad
10,"Not skateboard friendly, no bike lane.","I probably should have assumed with the tourists it was anti-skateboard (and bicycle). The problem is there’s no bike lane on the road either. If your anything besides feet, you have to weave in and out of traffic and inches from moving vehicles to get down the road. Not safe. Just a bunch of cheap creepy street vendors and some metal stars you look at and walk on. It’s not what I thought it was going to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redneckITengineer
30,"Only Do This Once, But No More Than That!","The Walk of Fame is something you got to do, but only do it once because it's not worth the pain twice. I took my mom and my 2 kids to the walk of fame and Madame Tussaud's wax museum. At some point outside the Mann Chinese theater we saw people in Mickey and Minnie costumes. Minnie asked me if we want to take a picture so I said ""oh okay sure! Thanks!"". We took our little selfie shot with her and my 2 year old said ""thanks Minnie!"" Then Minnie replied to me as we were about to walk away and said "" Hey man, nothing is for free in this town"". Never thought sweet little Minnie Mouse would shame me in front of my own kids. I had no cash so I just walked away not feeling all that great about it. Only in Hollywood can the simple act of taking a selfie with your own phone with a Disney character make you out to be a cheapskate. Not going back there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hakej
30,Crowdy,"A lot of people. I mean.....a lot!!! Its nothing like what tv shows. Its a very busy street. A lot of people that sell stuff, a lot of unexpensive stores, street food that deliver fry smell..... but is mandatory for all of the turists to go and see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkondi
40,City Sights,No one can visit Los Angeles without walking in the footsteps of the stars. Best done as a guided coach trip where all of the famous sights and sounds can be experienced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davegeekie
40,Nice to see for an hour,"I came about 7:30 on a Monday, and the area wasn't crowded at all. I could easily walk down the street and see all the stars. I walked for about 30 minutes before having breakfast. You could easily spend more or less time there looking at the names, but I think 30 minutes was enough. There are shops and restaurants in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbehnke
30,Everyone must see it once,"The stars on the sidewalk is definitely a neat attraction to see once. Don't expect hollywood to be so glamorous as one would think though. Lots of people, not so clean.... but a unique experience to say the least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/162andys
40,Busy but worth it,"We visited on a Saturday afternoon so as expected, it was very busy. However, this is a must see and was fun walking up and down to see which stars you can spot. Be aware of people trying to give you things which they then want money for and people trying to make you hold snakes for a photo (for money)!!! There are some great street entertainers dressed in costumes but yet again they will want you to take a photo but then expect money in return.There is also a great spot to see the Hollywood sign too and some great shops and bars. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chiggins91
30,To crowded,We went because my girlfriend has never been there before. It is worse than Times Square. Lot of homeless people around and religious people telling us how bad we are. Plus 5 Spider-Man's 2 captain americas some really bad batmans 2 transformers and a host of other characters in outfits that have never been washed. Fun to go once and then avoid forever.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/choz06
40,Walk The Stars!,"Hollywood Boulevard is nothing short of touristy. The day we perused the stars was nothing short of crowded. The foot traffic was out of this world and there were sections where I felt myself get a bit overwhelmed.However, the novelty of seeing the Walk of Fame was a nice payoff.That said, I wouldn't want to be hanging around this area at night, not would I suggest hanging about with children for longer than necessary. This is clearly an area where ANYTHING could happen once the sun goes down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthernMama2
50,18th Birthday,This was so fun and so cool. We walked all 15 blocks both ways reading all the names. Took pics with our favorite stars star. Of course Micheal Jacksons star had people surrounding it all the time.Lots of fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReneMartin65
40,Fun to visit,Travelled with 2 teenagers and they enjoyed but with the crowds can be difficult to see the stars on the sidewalk. Lots of street performers to keep you entertained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Littlefire817
30,Is this all???,If you see it on TV it's looking completely different. In reality it is an narrow street with everywhere garbage and thousands of people. And smell! Everywhere thus bad smell! !!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/577jannat
40,Worth a visit,"Stars, shops, cosplayers, street performers... the place has it all. But as you can imagine, it's pretty crowded and kind of low class. I still recommend it, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/770bachirh
40,Iconic wandering,"Staying so close, had to come walk the 'stars' and visit the Chinese theatre. Loads of pictures of our favourite famous people, including the hand prints...and got some shopping in too (go visit Hot Topic - great niche and unique clothing).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillM811
50,Night walk,Do it at night when all the entertainment comes out.you can get a star map from shops if your looking for a particular star or Google it and you can get a close idea.must do is the tcl theatre where there are many stars imprints,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shadur
30,A been there done that stop.,It is one of the iconic stops on the trip to Los Angeles but overall underwhelming. The area in front of the old Chinese Theater is worth a look but otherwise it is fairly crowded and surrounded by souvenir shops. Would treat it like a Walmart on a Saturday. Necessary but get in quick and get out even more quickly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E2054DBjasons
40,Go early,If you actually want to get decent pictures with your stars of choice I recommend going before 10am (closer to 8am is better) You won't get hassled by tour operators and the streets will be quiet! There are a lot of names that are very unrecognisable though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaomiF2901
50,Walk in the Sun,"I got the metro to the end of the walk of fame and then walked both sides, I didn't realise how many their are and it became a really fun game spotting the ones I knew. A great use of time and a must for any arts buff",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeSaCRAE
10,Some excitement but...,...overall i would not come back. Great to see some stars and get some pictures but overall the place is busy and dirty stuck in the past.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aubsn
20,Very seedy element,I was really taken aback by all that is allowed to go on here. Men walking around with giant snakes wrapped around them trying to get a tourist to pay for a picture with it. Many folks including my daughter have a phobia of snakes and the fact that they were all over Hollywood blvd certainly lessened our experience. I would definitely not recommend this area after dark. It's seedy during the day I can only imagine at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D1565KTcarlaf
20,It's a grubby street!!!,Not what I had imagined at all. Some curiosity with the stars but it's certainly not how it looks on the TV. Plan 30 minutes there and spend your time somewhere else!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WolveyGeordie
30,It's crowded and there really isn't much to see/do.,It's crowded and there really isn't much to see/do. There are lots of tour groups and street vendors performing/trying to sell you things.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smithnicole67
30,Mother & adult daughter trip,"Worth visiting, unfortunately due to being part of a tour we were not given enough time to explore the Walk properly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandravW6496AL
50,Loads of fun looking for out favorite stars!!,We had lots of fun walking up and down Hollywood Blvd looking at the famous stars. We toured the Chinese Theater and Dolby theater and then just walked the Blvd looking at the Hollywood Stars. Lots to see and do along Hollywood Blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mother2boys
20,Dirty and Crowded,"While it was interesting seeing all of the stars and trying to find our favorites, I would never go near here again. It was extremely crowded - which is to be expected. It's worse than being in Times Square being accosted by costumed characters everywhere trying to get you to give them your money for a photo op. The sidewalk itself was filthy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreaw593
10,Surprisingly dirty,"Let me start by saying that I'm not a pretentious person, I am also a pretty seasoned traveler. I also rarely write reviews, but for this I felt like I had to. First, it's extremely crowded (as to be expected), and you have to watch where you're going because everyone is looking down at the names and abruptly stopping to take pictures, or sitting down on the ground for pictures. And I'll admit we were guilty of that too. It's what you do. But the worst part is the main drag is dirty, grimy, and full of homeless and aggressive people shoving tour brochures or their CDs in your face and then yelling at your when you decline. There are also people dressed up as characters bugging you for pictures for money. There are people trying to convert your to their religion (right in front of the iconic Chinese theater) and the homeless and ""street vendors"" hang out at big-name stars and get you when you stop to take a picture. There are adult toy stores (not a prude but seemed out of place) and tacky souvenir shops everywhere along with tourist traps like Madame Taussad's and Ripley's. I hate to say all this but it was a huge disappointment. I don't know what I expected, but I certainly didn't expect so much craziness. There was also not a cop in sight. At least in Times Square NYC, there's a police presence, and it's a little cleaner. I realize this is a city, but you would think that prime tourist attraction in LA would be a little more tourist-friendly.If you're in the area, definitely take a tour of the Chinese Theater, the Hollywood Museum, or a TMZ tour. Stay off of the streets if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/251jessf
40,Interesting but crowded,"It is as interesting as a star with a name on it can be but most times of the day it is too crowded to really enjoy it. I suggest early mornings as the best time. Later afternoons as the least favorite as there are usually ""street performers"" there after mid afternoon. The noise and the crowds go way up then.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveS27
30,Some of the side walks could use a cleaning. Neat to see.,"15 blocks of stars on Hollywood Blvd and 3 blocks of stars on Vine street.This is a permanent public monument.Which is a mix of persons, groups, and fictional characters.Including actors, musicians, musical and theatrical groups,Directors, Producers.They estimate 10 million visitors yearly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M8781XMpaular
20,Dirty sidewalk,Very disappointing crowded with tourists and traffic.The Stars walk of fame was in need of a good clean.Even some of the people that were dressed as movie characters looked sloppy and they were wanting tourists to pay to have a picture taken with them.Not a good location.Seemed a bit sleazy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRADELAIDE
30,A pavement with famous names on it.,Again if you are in Hollywood this is one of the so called famous places to go. Beware at the end of the day it only a pavement with names on it on both sides of the road. It is heaving with people that stop right in front of you to have pictures taken. It has people selling you tours and people walking around in character suits for photo opportunities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5696IFstevea
50,Great fun on Walk of Fame,"No first trip to Hollywood is complete without walking on the Walk of Fame and looking for your favorite stars. It is a really long walk and quite crowded, but still fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debrabR8909NE
50,Family Trip,"We visited this at two different times. One early in the morning 8am before we jumped on a city tour bus. The other was when we jumped off in the late in the afternoon. Early there was virtually no one around and we freely walked up and down the street taking pictures and ""star gazing"". When we returned in the afternoon it was a madhouse of people and spotting stars on the sidewalk was much more difficult. We all enjoyed walking up and down looking at and taking pics of the different stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billcC6252BH
50,Birthday present vacations,"loved it!! Always dream about visiting Los Angeles and it,s lots of fun, lots of activities to do, the awesome experience of see in person movie's stars, we had the opportunity to experience a movie premiere live!!, will go again soon, highly recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P8391WSmariam
40,A must see attraction,Any visit to Los Angeles should include a trip to Hollywood and a walk along Hollywood Blvd to see the walk of fame. Its great to see who is there (and who isn't) and there are plenty of photo opportunities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KJG780
40,Interesting,"We did a lot of walking here and saw a lot of stars. It was a sense of actually being there to see the celebrities. The stars are on several streets, it's probably impossible to see them all. The prints are by the Chinese theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike353632
40,Seen and done that,"A must if you are in hollywood and a big but! To much people, to many tourist traps on the road, difficult and expansive to get parking, but still fun to have done",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TWINN66
20,Dumpy Tourist Trap,"With the exception of the 2 blocks around the Dolby Theater, this is a tourist trap with one adult toy store, t-shirt shop, tattoo parlor, homeless person after another and more people trying to hand you flyers than Vegas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/themortgageguru
30,Iconic but not a great location,"Ok you can't come to LA or Hollywood and not see the stars. As lovely as the stars are you spend ages looking down which means you miss what's around you. The whole area attracts tourists and with that sub average restaurants, con men, pick pockets etc. Be warned and keep your hands in your pockets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/razwan33
40,Free attraction and a must do if you're in the area,We walked for a couple of blocks along the Walk of Fame. It's fun and free to just stroll along and see some names. I would use Google for the exact location if you have a particular star you're looking for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1594VQcc
50,If you're feeling touristy...,Then this is great to do. I've never actually walked the walk of fame until now. It's pretty cool all the celebs and musicians stars you see. I found two I really love :).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ocjax
30,Checked off the list?,"One and done. Took a picture of Hollywood sign and did Walk of Fame. Check and check. Mostly dirty and crowded walk with a few ah-ha's down at our feet. Don't go down there just the Walk, but if your nearby take a few minutes to stroll over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dozmond
30,Crowded Tourist trap with nostalgia,"Visiting the Hollywood walk of fame is a glance into the rich and famous. You can walk up and down the street seeing stara names along with famous theaters. However this comes with the cost of hasslers, homeless and litter. It's a shame the walk of fame comes with so much baggage because it has the potential to be much more enjoyable. Nothing comes free in Hollywood along with this trip, parking is $2 at Hollywood and highland with a purchase at the mall, otherwise parking can cost you $10-$30.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakeup226
30,Lovely but crowded,Its fun and iconic to see but be ready for strong crowds of people. Iconic Hollywood and California so a fun thing to see and lots to do nearby with shops and cafes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briannao298
50,Must do when in Hollywood,Great way to spend a few hours wandering around checking out the Stars and characters lining the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Haddie66
50,Quick trip whilst in the area,"Although the visit was done at night it was easy enough to locate. It's crazy how long the walk of fame is with many many names on the sidewalk. I would recommend you try and locate the outer area and work your way through via the Chinese theatre. Lots going on during the evening and lots of street performers parading around for photo opportunities. One word of caution, due to the legalities of smoking cannabis, you can smell it everywhere. Just be aware if you have young kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fitzwanos
30,Had to see it once...,Heard abt the Walk of Fame for many years. Couldn't leave the LA area without seeing it. Took the Starline Tour. 15 blocks of city sidewalk I'll never be curious abt again 🙃,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3cntrygrls
30,Once is Enough.,"While this is a cool concept, and nice that it is free, it's hard to enjoy with the throngs of tourists and endless peddlers of everything from souvenirs to star maps. And this was on a weekday. It was dirty, crowded and there were more than a few people wandering around who were either high or roaring drunk in the early afternoon. I felt a pick-pocket sort of vibe in the air and guarded my belongings closely. Honestly it reminded me a little of Bourbon Street in New Orleans. It's worth seeing once; now that box is checked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappycuriousWanderer
30,Have to see!,"Hollywood Blvd does gets very busy but you have to go see the area while visiting in L.A. The stars go for miles down each sides of the sidewalks. Yes there's is people constantly trying to get you to buy things and go in their shops and this does gets annoying eventually, especially when you just want to talk pictures of the stars and surrounding areas! When visiting here I would go early on to avoid huge crowds. And also look out for that odd celebrity! Just so happens we knocked into 50cent filming outside one of the theatres!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samantharhodes85
30,It's really just OK at best,"Well it's was fairly disappointing seeing the wall of fame it dirty and full of people that make you uncomfortable.To many names of people you have never heard of it seems that everyone gets a star.I would go during the day not the night it would be safer, it's a shame that something so iconic is not better looked after.If you want to see al stars take your walking shoes it goes forever over 2500 stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O491CUjasons
20,Surprised that it is so gross,"We are not a hollywood film or television family (so for others, the stars may hold more meaning) but wanted to check out the walk of fame.When we started the walk, it was interesting to see the first few stars on the sidewalk but after a few blocks, I was ready to turn around. The sidewalks are quite filthy and crowded and the farther you walk, the sketchier it becomes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfp325
50,iSpotOne app has a map of the main celebrities on the Walk of Fame.,A must have app. It's already on the Apple store. They have a website too. iSpotOne.com and I know there's an Android version coming soon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/massoud12345
40,Fun Afternoon,We went to Hollywood Boulevard for an afternoon. After finding a place to park it was an enjoyable afternoon. Many small shops and places to eat. And just watching all of the different people can be fun also. It was a good experience and we took many photos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prof002
40,Good fun.,Free n cheap ! It has tons of souvenir shops next to it .. so it's good fun to walk n shop ! There is even a person who will add in ur name on the walk of fame ..for a price ... so if u fancy that .. do give it a shot !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishla99
20,Not great,"Only thing that made this good was that we decided to do a tour and it got us away from there. Walk itself is smelly and crowded, go early to avoid the crowds. Look for deals at your hotel it's pricey. Off the list but not sure was worth the time, outside the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/16christinav
40,Fun,"Super crowded but enjoyable to see all the stars' names and experience the atmosphere. I have no idea how the stars are arranged as there are old and new, music and movie stars combined but it was fun seeing it all as well as the buskers and artists along the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanneHA
30,Lots of people trying to sell you things you don't want,"Do you want to do a open top bus tour? Go to the Walk of Fame and you'll be spoilt for choice. Don't go for the first person that badgers you as they all offer it at different prices. Make sure you know what you're getting.We were not actually interested in a tour and just wanted to read the stars on the sidewalk. They cover a lot of streets as there's so many but it was great to see.There are also a number of shops, malls and performers along the strip to keep you entertained if you're bored of looking at the floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bexxcx
50,Iconic and Fun,First trip to Tinsel Town. Loved every minute of it! The Walk of Fame was a lot of fun and so much to see and do. The only negative thing I wish they could do something about was the bum population. They are pretty thick. We stayed at an Air BNB a block away from the walk and really enjoyed the easy access. There is a really nice outdoor mall on the walk and you can see the Hollywood sign from the third level. If you're into Hollywood history this trip is for you!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimgreenm2015
20,A Waste of Time,"I wish I could have my time back because in hindsight going to the Hollywood Walk of Fame was in my opinion a complete waste of time. The original concept of the Walk of Fame was proposed by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce as a marketing ploy to maintain the prestige of a community whose name means glamour and excitement all over the world, let me tell you there is nothing glamorous or exciting about the Hollywood Walk of Fame, it is a tawdry, crowded, tourist trap, full of celebrity impersonators standing near ""their star "", it is typical Hollywood all fake. If you must go, take a photo of one of your favourite stars on the pavement and maybe check out the hand and footprints of famous actors at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre and then get of there as soon as possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454tonyn
20,Iconic but underwhelming,"The whole Walk of Fame Experience is for first-timers and families.I remember going as a 15yo with family and being in awe. Going back 22 years later it was just a crowded sidewalk, with thousands of people not watching where they are going and terrible impersonators harassing you on the street.I'd keep your expectations low.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miketinmouth
40,Cool to see,Stars are cool to see . It can get very crowded on Hollywood blvd between Highland and La Brea. If there are certain stars you want to see id suggest making a map of the ones you want to see beforehand. You can find a map online. There are a lot of stars and they are all not close together.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trey991
40,Neat thing to do,Really cool feeling to see all the celebrities names and walk along ...pretty crowded though and quite a walk...but must do in Hollywood :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/munira21
20,Ok so you see the names but that's it,"So the walk is a must see location but it's not a place to spend loads of time. A quick visit and some photos and you are done. The area is a tourist trap with lots of people trying to get your attention for tips. It's also a frequent protest location. Go visit, go down to the Dolby theatre and the Chinese theatre then get out of there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ant-across-the-world
30,"Neat, but can get crowded!","Walking down the streets looking at all the different stars in the Hollywood Walk of Fame was pretty cool! It's a little difficult to do when it's crowded because you're trying to look down at the stars, but up so you don't run into anyone or anything! I also don't believe there is any order to the stars, so you kind of just meander around. It's definitely exciting when you come across one of your personal favorites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/115trishe
40,"Don't expect more than the stars on the sidewalk in a crowd, and you'll be fine","Not sure what some of the reviewers were expecting...it's literally a crowded sidewalk with famous people's names on it. If that's not exciting to you, then it's not going to be worth it. Yes there are street performers dressed up and roaming around, but none of them were aggressive, and unlike the ones in Times Square in NYC, their costumes were clean and they didn't take them off on the street in front of the kids (imagine your little kid watching Mickey Mouse pull his head off).Parking tip: park at the Hollywood and Highland shopping center, and cool off with a cocktail at Cabo Wabo on the 4th floor (there's also a bonus view of the Hollywood sign from that floor). Make sure to get your parking validated (2 hours free with validation).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IMoveALot
10,Complete waste of time,"In my list '10 most disappointing tourist attractions' this would definitely be in 'top 3'. Narrow dirty path, nothing near what they show on TV:/ It's with visiting only if you are a crazy fan of some particular star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tatikglibe
40,CROWDED!,Loved being able to walk up and down the blocks looking at all the stars....but the crowds...wow. Tried taking pictures of some of the stars and it was difficult. People are everywhere and few courtesies exist. Many of the stars were filthy with gum stuck on them and other markings. It's really tough to enjoy the area because it's so crowded. Parking is very expensive so it might be worth doing one of those tour bus groups.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941JudyC
30,Crowded long and disappointing,"A bit disappointing. One part of us was expecting it to be in a beautiful street, like majestic. The street is long and it's quite worth it to walk to discover different people you may know but what surrounds it: shops people... make it loose the magic. We didn't massively enjoy it. We didn't even feel safeNear the Chinese theatre are the most popular ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silurica
50,Walking shoes a must!,"As you plan for fun on Hollywood Blvd, naturally paying attention to the Walk of Fame makes for some good times! Because its on the sidewalk and you're looking down, be aware still of your surroundings and people. People just stop all of a sudden to take pics of their favorite names. And you cant get angry because everyone does it! Thats part of the insanity. But its fun to see names from Bugs Bunny--yes...he has one and so does Winnnie the Pooh, to Michael Jackson. We had the pleasure to witness Magician/Illusionist Criss Angel get his star yesterday so you just never know what you'll see or what stars will come out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GasolineGypsy
50,A must see if in Hollywood!,The iconic walk was worth the walk. All the names of famous stars you can thing of on the sidewalk starts. A lot of shopping stores and live entertainment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonlp
30,Dirty,"We enjoyed looking at the squares, but couldn't understand why it was so dirty. There were two new ones that were just put in the previous week when we were there and they looked like they were there as long as the other ones. Still nice to see some of the older names.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJWallyrock
40,Hollywood defined,"The Walk of Fame is still a must-see, but some of stars are very dirty and some seem faded (obviously aged). Used the website to find particular ones, and were able to map out our personal must-sees. The only true downfall, though, is the street performers who take up the entire sidewalk in some places, and are rude if you try to move through to keep traffic moving. Also, the homeless population is (for me) surprisingly large and they also tend to take up lots of space. Even with those (I am empathetic to their plights and just moved around it), I would recommend seeing the Walk of Fame at least once",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/metsfan2017
50,Gotta go at least once,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is something every out of towner should do at least once. Going to the ""Walk"" also puts you in the vicinity of the Chinese Theater and Mel's Diner. I'm sure there's more stuff to see and do, those are just the things that I saw. Also around TONS of souvenir shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/999nikkih
50,Super fun!,"The life on Hollywood walk of fame is so cool! Tons over shops, clubs, street performers, and food. Definitely recommend this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahjanayy
30,Stop over,Very interesting to see but as expected it's full of people trying to make a buck. To be fair it's a must see while in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y1169CGgarym
30,Dirty!!,"I lived in LA over 30 years ago and it was dirty then, but it is just plain disgusting now. Parking is hard to find and walking the boulevard is a challenge with all the people.I guess if you've never been to LA and this is your 1st visit it's a must see! Just don't have high expectations.....Hollywood is not what it's cracked up to be. Can't even find a star that is clean!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anao804
40,ATL to Hollywood,A little crowded but well worth the walk. Spider man will keep u smiling with superman flicks. All the stars yu can think of from past to present. Great shopping area. From stores on a budget to classy fashion. Sidewalk is a little dirty and smelly with tons od street bums but this is what Los Angelos is saturated with this day and age. Sad but true. Still a grrat experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiffanymM2280TN
20,Very let down!,"The iconic walk of fame was not all it's said to be. The stars all seemed to be very dirty and unkept. I was also saddened to see people's reactions to certain stars... extremely disrespectful in some cases. It's also very crowded and can be a sensory overload. I am glad I got to have this experience, but have no desire to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilyraby
20,Disappointed,"After hearing everyone talk about the Hollywood walk of fame we thought a holiday to America was never the same without seeing what the fuss was all about.Wow was we wrong. Very disappointed- it was full of drunk and drugged up people everywhere you went felt very uneasy didn't really enjoy the area, wouldn't recommend this trip to anyone and wouldDefiantly not be returning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cuttress1234
50,Great and interesting!,"Let me just say upfront, this place is ALWAYS crowded. However, what a great place to go! You totally get your dose of celebrities. Of course there are some very interesting people on the streets performing and such, but it is super entertaining. Totally a must see place in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauramjimenez
50,"Obviously, go at a decent hour","Avoid tourists by not going in the middle of the day - just like anything else.If you are interested in certain stars, go find them!! We had a blast looking for specific stars and checking out Chinese Mans Theatre!!! We love the Walk of Fame!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megnm13
30,Walk along crowded street of hollywood,It was an evening lots of people rooming around the street where the location is hot tourist destination.Lots of branded shops around and most famous movie theaters are along the street.Dolby Theater and Chinese Theater.Good location to have a change.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/573sankah
30,Nice to see,"Kinda like saying that you've been there... not that big of a deal cuz it looks like any other street except for the stars on the sidewalk and I guess the possibility of a red carpet event... Okay, maybe not like just ANY other street. LolWe actually saw the red carpet opening event of the Valerian movie when we were there. If you're into movies and stars and all that glitter I guess this is for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JefeHenk
50,Amazing time in hollywood,"For my first time in LA, California, was so amazed by the walk of fame and how clean it was. I will for sure come back in August and visit more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/215nicholasd
40,It's a must if visiting LA,"Plan on a half day visit to be able to roam the Hollywood area and a full day if you want to shop. I advise going during the day. It is easier to see the stars and all the happenings. You can go at night, but it is definitely a different energy for an older crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gogovinda108
40,The biggest names locations.,"The oldest names started at Hollywood and Vine near the Capitol Records cylindrical landmark building and as you travel west along Hollywood Blvd., toward Highland, the more recent stars appear. With a few exceptions. Leonard Nimoy, for example, is on a corner just east of Musso Franks. There are several online sites that show maps and a key to find specific stars. For example, Frank Sinatra's star is in an obscure location, side street. Of course as long as you are here, you must check out Grauman's Chinese theater and the hand and footprints. So happens my hand exactly fits Humphrey Bogart's!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266PaulR
50,Great!,"Hollywood walk of fame is a must go attraction, I though it could be better, but it's only a walk, its good to take pictures",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jos_arturm2017
30,It's great. At the right times.,"Last week I arrived in LA for the first time and I was very excited for the few days I would spend there. At around 5:30 I went for a walk around my hotel (which is about 3 miles from the Walk of Fame) and it was lovely. The next morning, I went on a run to Hollywood Blvd. and it was fun recognizing all the names on the stars. I might have run into (figuratively) 3 different people my whole run from Hollywood to Vine. It was a great experience. Later that night I went there with my family and I deeply regretted it. There were so many people, and so many crazy people. Please do not bring your small children after 8:00, YOU WILL LOOSE THEM. On top of all the people, there were many stores that were not suitable for young children. If you go, go in the morning and you will have a great time, but I strongly suggest that you don't go after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisp19941
50,Charming and colourful,All the colours and extravaganza that is to Hollywood is here. This is also a good place to get photographed with the Hollywood sign on the hills..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouradiptaG
30,Tourist spot,"Cool place to see, must do if in LA but jammed packed with tourists and people dressed up in costumes wanting to take photos with you and charge you in tips but expensive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittanya257
10,Not worth it.,The place has been taken over by drug addicts and transients. It is way overrated and the place felt unsafe at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnchantedTraveler2
50,Star studded,"Research stars before you go, if not plan on at least 2 hours of walking the 1 mile strip of stars on both sides of Hollywood Blvd. Also double check to see if stars have been relocated. We all loved seeing all the different names. Lots of homeless, beggars line the streets as well. Day time is highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710triciab
50,Celebrity walk,I had fun walking up and down the walk of fame and seeing all of the names. The area around it is very nasty and run down. Very touristy but then so I am. It was fun to do for awhile then off to the next tourist spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/339cathyd
20,Too crowded!,"It was way too crowded. Random people trying to sell you tours to see more over crowded places. Over-priced tourist shops and average restaurants. Just one block from the walk of fame already looked like a slum. Trash, litter and dirt everywhere, chaos and shouting. Never again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998suvin
30,Just an Average Touristic Place,"It is not something I expected since it turns out to be just an average touristic place with a lot of traps here and there. As soon as u walk, a lot of people will approach you in friendly manner just to get money. Some are trying to sell their own CD Album and some people with costume greet you nicely and ask to take a picture with them with a purpose to get money. My husband is a friendly person so he was kinda got trapped in the situation so you better aware with anyone who approach you out of sudden even they just try to talk to you, just keep going unless u are willing to spend money about USD10-20.Overall nothing much to see unless u are a big fan of Hollywood stars and those famous theatres.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23cynthiae87
30,"Neat to see, but so dirty",My husband and I went to see the Hollywood walk of Fame - I guess I was expecting old Hollywood Glamour. That is long gone and no where in sight. Hollywood Blvd is dirty and the stores on the Blvd are very sketchy. I'm glad went went because I always wanted to see the Walk of Fame and the Grumman's Chineese Theater - but a bit of the sparkle and shine is gone,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/106sheryl
50,Great time!,"It was great seeing all the stars with names of famous people, such as Jackie Chan, Martin Scorsese, etc. It is crowded I this area, but it is worth it if you are a movie buff. Also lots of shops where you can buy stuff. I had a lot of fun over here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinao608
50,Interesting,While in Hollywood we visited the Walk of Fame of course. Which is very fun to see. Some stars start to get into a more run down section of Hollywood and some stars are a little difficult to find. But overall worth seeing while you're there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiffanya976
30,It was a good experience.,"I was really looking forward to this experience and seeing the stars. Unfortunately the surroundings and people traffic were a little too much for us. The area had a number of people smoking Marijuana in public, homeless people lying down on the sidewalks and numerous people selling tours and CDs!!Yeh its a bucketlist item, but don't go out of your way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christopheraK4263UZ
20,Too crowded to really see anything,Since we were taking other tours we decided to lady minute see some of the stars but it benign a Sunday in the summer months made it way to crowded. We were unable to read most of the stars as there are street vendors and performers in addition to tourists. Would recommend trying it off season on a week day perhaps.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Familyfun4us2013
50,Walking with stars,"A sure must when you come to LA Hollywood. Lots of fun to find your favourite actor, musicians. Great photo day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidgO4159GL
10,Disgusting...,"We walked Hollywood Blvd. looking at many of these stars. They are dirty, covered in filth and gum. There are so many names you don't even know. When you do find one, there are so many people around you can't stop to look. The Blvd. is a freak show that is constant chaos. I saw it once and will never go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlesT223
30,Watch Out For Angry Chewy,"Loved looking at the stars embedded into the sidewalk...Anthony Hopkins, John Travolta and so many more! Wanted to see Donald Trump's star and when we tried to take a photo, some crazy guy dressed up like Chewbacca from Star Wars cursed at and threatened us. He was obviously disturbed and probably homeless as the costume was scruffy. Beware angry movie characters. Haha!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccabN6585AN
30,Worth the visit but dirty,"The Walk of Fame is worth a one time visit. However, the area is dirty and sketchy. I am surprised that the city does not make a more conscious effort to keep the place respectable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YoAmoMaitencillo
40,Be prepared. V v busy.,Obviously it's one of those things you have to do.....but there is nothing glitzy or glam about it. It is very very busy and you may not get your picture of your favourite star because people are walking on them or taking their own photo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AT1
10,Clean it up so dirty & run down,"OMG clean up Hollywood boulevard please. Dirty, lots of closed down shops, too many souvenir shops selling the same crap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/63michaelh63
40,"A must do ""once"".","I enjoyed the Hollywood Walk of Fame. However, there are just too many people trying to sell you something. It is also too crowded during summer months if you don't go early. I enjoyed seeing the stars but if it is crowded, you can easily miss seeing some of the stars. Be careful of your people asking to take a picture with you because after the picture they will charge you. Also be careful of people who try to push CDs in your hand, they will be looking for money as well. It's good to experience once but try to avoid looking like a tourist and avoid carrying a purse if possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cenalestravel
40,Great place to visit.,"Visited per our teens request. It's a nice walk but really congested. Lots to see along the way, must at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jnjiemtz
40,Nice but crowded,The walk of fame is so much busier now then when I was a child growing up in Hollywood. It's more like being in Vegas or Times Square with vendors on every corner. Movie characters charge $20 per photo. And homeless people scattered here and there. It was great to see new stars with new actors and actresses. Just be prepared for the crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielmT7958TD
50,Nice,You can't come to LA without a visit to this site. The stars are the focus of this walk with lots of giggling and remembering,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NadaHal
30,The action is at Hollywood and High,"My daughter wanted to see the walk of fame so we set aside a couple hours to do it. Now we can check it off the bucket list. We found a parking spot on the east end of Hollywood Blvd, about a block from Vine. It wasn't too crowded here. Walked down Vine to Sunset and back up to Hollywood. Several blocks down at Hollywood and High St is where all the crowds were. Tons of people here in front of the Dolby Theater. This is also where Donald Trumps star is so there was a lot of people around it.My wife commented that the people watching here was better than Times Square. Lots of personalities and tourists. Lots of people trying to sell yours but if you say no they leave you alone. Only took a couple hours and is kinda fun if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1wades
30,Busy but worth a quick visit,"If you have an hour or so to kill, was kind of fun to walk around and see the stars and hand prints in the sidewalk. It was busy, but that didn't deter us. A bit cheesy but fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B0bbieJ
30,Congested,"The younger you are, the more you enjoy this. The Hollywood walk of fame for the first time is worth doing, however becareful of pic pocketing. Also if you take a photo of anyone dressed in costume - it will cost you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bunkaleebee
50,Wanderfful amazing Famous street,"Really it's amazing street, Stars location, perfect location.Some of the Hollywood stars walk of the fame because that they mention their name on the star. like present Trump.

40,Worth seeing,"Very popular and touristy, but worth a visit. I wish I had done more research and was able to map out where particular stars were beforehand. It is a very busy place. There is an iutforr mall there and if you go all the way up to the top floor There is a nice view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/742sharonh
30,We walked the whole thing,"My husband and I ended up walking the entire Walk of Fame (accidentally). Afterward I thought, okay, I've done that, don't need to again. It's really just stars with names on them, and most of the name are unfamiliar to me. It's very crowded in the area where it originally started. It's neat to do once, you can cross Hollywood and Vine and can see the 4 Ladies Statue and the Chinese theater. We spent about 2 hours total there, so if you want to walk the whole thing and plan to stop a lot, I'd give yourself about 3 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D2gauth
20,Dirty and not maintained,"Although it's fun to search for the stars and it is kind of something you ""have to do"" when you're in L.A. and Hollywood... the Boulevard is rather dirty and it's not well maintaind. I wouldn't walk here alone by night.There's a lot of parking available but they are about $15-20, which is expensive if you only stay there for 5 minutes 😊.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luciewafel4

I felt really unsafe and held on tight to my handbag the whole time, couldn't wait to get out of there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shel87
30,"Iconic, Entertaining...Grimy, Dirty and a little creepy. Love it or hate it Just Do it!!!","Movie, Music and entertainment tragics will love it. Hollywood icons aside it's a pretty grubby area with homeless, drug sellers and general crazies....but thats part of the appeal. 1-2 hour loop and the jobs done....go spend some time at the Hollywood museum or Madam Tussauds instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigDaddyShepperz

20,Crowded and tacky,"Nothing special, overrated experience, interesting to see the stars of your favorite actors, singers and so on but anyway the place is overwhelmingly crowded, loud and pretty much tacky. A lot of people shouting, doing god knows what, singing, selling, whatever... Wouldn't waste my time again for this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anaismalli
40,"Very, Very Busy But a Must-See","There isn't anything in California much more iconic than the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Of course, it's an absolute must-see if you're in SoCal, but yeah... the crowds can be atrocious. If you want a photo of some of the more popular stars, like Michael Jackson, you have to be patient. Still, well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PowerTrippersTravel
30,Iconic place - but not more,A must see place in Los Angeles. Then you can feel the glamorous atmosphere. But also many poor people on the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PerLundHansen
40,Get There Early,"We took our grandsons, 14 and 17 to see Madame Tussauds Wax Museum on a Saturday so naturally also spent time on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. We arrived at 9:45 a.m. & parked right behind the Walk. It was even crowded at that early hour--the sidewalks were packed with tourists and impersonators. A variety of foreign languages were heard and people were taking pictures of the stars of famous entertainment people. You have to understand that if you include an impersonator in your pictures, you must pay them a tip. I don't know what the going rate is, so it is prudent to ask before taking a picture with an impersonator in it. Many of the big named stars are included on the sidewalk, but there are also some names we hadn't heard of. We also viewed and took pictures with the hand and footprints in front of the Grauman's Chinese Theater--but I think it has a different name now. The boys liked viewing these prints better than the ones on the sidewalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HLII

Look for a free place to park on an adjacent street, and failing that park in one of the garages off Hollywood blvd. Then walk. Stop at Grauman's Chinese theater to stare at the footprints and handprints of start going back more than fifty years! Eat cheap at nearby fast food restaurants if you're short of funds. Stop at Ripley's believe or Not or one of the wax museums for extra fun. Take pictures with the impersonators that populate the walk and do some great people watching the whole time.

40,Surprising!,"I was aware of that attraction by the bias of TV. It was a strange feeling to walk and read all those names on the street walk.I guess they choose people with few criteria but, there is a mix of strange categories that makes the attraction a bit more interesting.You see Rin Tin Tin??? A dog! Ok! I loved watching the show! And there is Vanna White, I taught they recognized and honored the talent of actors....Go for it, the walk will bring souvenirs back and smiles on your face.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frabrass1
20,Overrated!,I've always imagined the walk of fame being this luxurious super spacious place where all famous people's stars are placed. American movies always show things for what they are not :-(It's a small mile long pavement that smell of wee with dirty stars placed all along it. It's a normal pavement where everyone can walk on it . I thought it was more of a touristy attraction for some reason.. Nothing special at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xmariemx
40,See the stars,I will give this 4* as although it was great to see it is a normal busy street . There are a lot of suspicious looking characters and street sellers hanging about and I did feel slightly uncomfortable. This was outweighed by seeing the stars and names although it is quite long. I would recommend keeping to the busy part as the stars at either end are surrounded by shabby shops. We were lucky enough to have a knowledgable driver which made the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveEatingOut6
20,Boarderline weird or not too good for kids,I stayed at Lowes for about a week and a half and walked the walk of fame every day and every night. 1st I will say it's not a good place for kids after dark because the crowd is so tight. You'll end up Squeezing threw crowds and holding on tight to kids. Also the characters that offer pics are weird creepy and boarderline inappropriate for Children. They'd all kind of people dressed up as characters expecting tips for pics.....None of them said anything inappropriate to my kids but my kids and I seen and heard them saying inappropriate things to adults around us. It's okay to walk the walk of fame during the day with kids because their are less people. But the crowd still makes me want to cuff my purse because of the size of crowd on a small sidewalk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globalbesties
20,Not so fantastic,"Really wanted to walk the hall of fame but sadly the place is dirty, and so full of tour operators peddling their wares you really don't get to enjoy a leisurely walk without getting harassed every few minutes. It's seems such a shame that it is so dirty given what it is supposed to symbolize. I wouldn't ever go back here and don't recommend this as an enjoyable activity. On the plus side you can see the Hollywood sign from the shopping mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Di_Australia1302
30,Not as expected,"Found this hard to review. It is unique and famous so worth seeing, but..... Stars in pavements on an ordinary, rather scruffy sidewalk. Did wonder how they chose who gets what spot.Interesting spotting names as you walk to Metro Vine, which is really worth a look.One to tick off tourist list but not as expected",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twrch
20,Over-rated,"Like many experiences in life, my imagination was better than the real thing! Busy, dirty, lots of homeless and certainly not 'the stuff of dreams'. Maybe this is what Hollywood REALLY is - all gloss and no substance. Disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Readybrek7777
40,Get the app,"The app was so helpful in trying to find where specific stars were. We were there super late, so lots of ""local"" people, but they are no bother. We mainly kept to the area in front of the theater, so I can't review beyond that. A little dirty, I guess in my head they would be clean and shiny, lots of people in the daytime as we were leaving. I didn't care about finding specific stars unless they were within the area we were already, but it is a must see if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickAlixMom
20,Quite disappointing,"We arrived in LA to our hotel on Sunset about 4pm and as it wasn't all that far to walk to Hollywood Blvd and the Walk Of Fame so we thought we'd spend our evening heading there. The whole area smells pretty horribly of urine likely due to how many homeless people are around there. Also smells really strongly of cannabis, but we found that in most places. After walking for some time, it just seemed the like whole area has been run down and overcrowded for so long it's now just really grubby and underwhelming. By the time we reached the main part of Hollywood Blvd I was pretty put off by the amount of street sellers who force themselves on you and the experience was rather bleak. Definitely glad we hadn't planned to spend much time around here as there are much better things to do in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redpaperlanterns
50,Love the city,I recomend it to every one who likes the Hollywood experience. This place of the city is awesome. Love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palswaby
30,Checking out the Hollywood stars,"Worthwhile for a visit while you're in town, you can also see the Hollywood sign, Grauman's Chinese Theatre and home of the Oscars - Dolby Theatre. There usually a few street performers in town, good to see but not somewhere I'd rush back to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sh0wtimeb
20,Overrated in my opinion.,Crowded even during the week & you are CONSTANTLY asked to take a Hollywood tour. They are very persistent. My advice would be to stop at SWEET HOLLYWOOD while you are there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224tiffanyw
50,A must stop,Even if you go on a very hot day you can go back and forth between the air conditioned Dolby theatre and the street.I do think adults will enjoy this better as my 13 year old didn't recognize most of the stars. We went into the wax museum on the way too and she liked that better.Park at the Dolby theatre and get your ticket validated at the store next to the Chinese theatre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tdhaune
30,Super crowded,"Nice to see but not that special, unless you have a specific star you want to see. Its also pretty difficult to take a picture with the stars because it was so crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/736jamals
50,Family vacation,"We went sight seeing and enjoyed looking for our favorite stars star on the Walk of fame. I would recommend to go early in the day, the later you go the busier it gets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gwyn1973
50,"""Ice Cube Star Was A Must See""","My first time visiting the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and I enjoyed myself walking down several blocks to see a lot of my favorite stars from Ice Cube, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, New Edition to Michael Jackson. Before coming to Hollywood, I looked the stars up online to get the address so that I wouldn't forget to visit my favorite stars. Congratulations to Ice Cube on receiving his star last month.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SwaySway16
40,Love and hate,"No doubt this is one of the vital attraction of Hollywood. But it built a love and hate relationship with us. Love to see all famous stars name on the walk way, feel excited touching their hand and foot prints, enjoy the wax museum. But walking with the kids through the smoke of weed, some aggressive homeless, won't let us feel free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soarin2016
30,Meh!,"If you're really hoping to find a particular entertainer's star, know that there are hundreds of stars and there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to their placement. There are costumed people on the sidewalks who offer to take their pic with you and then demand outrageous tips before returning your camera or mobile phone. These people were distracting and annoying. We would have rather spent our time elsewhere had we known. We did enjoy the hand/footprints outside the TLC Chinese Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/88tarat
30,A whole lot of nothing,Names of celebrities on the ground inside of stars. Many of them not noteworthy celebs. It's ridiculously crowded. Seeing it once is more than enough. At least it's free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/148StevenC
10,Walk of Shame,"Hollywood is an idea that lives in imagination. This sad, filthy and sometimes dangerous walk proves that big screen dreams have nothing to do with the physical city.The walk of fame traverses the dirtiest, scummiest and most touristy areas of Los Angeles. It is a mess of a place where homeless, mentally ill, runaways and creepy men dressed as non-legit Spider-Man mingle as your neighborhood community... and it all takes place on the walk of fame, on top of celebrity markers that reflect the stars and celebrities of their times.If you are hellbent on seeing this walk, do so I front of the Chinese Theater - at least there are some security guards and the theater itself gives a glimpse into a time when Hollywood was a place worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRVLtruth
30,"ok, but not worth the hype",There is too much hype created around hollywood and walk of fame but it seemed like the least well managed attraction to me. Lots of stars were vandalized and some were broken. Still its worth visiting once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abhinavbom
20,Save your time,Believe me what you see on Tv or at the movies it is far way from the reality.The side walk is crowded that you prefer to take a risk to walk at the street instead to pass the people in front of you.It is not worth it to spent your time there is a lot of good think in LA to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/antoines87
30,Walk of Fame more like Walk of Homeless..,"I was so excited to go to the Walk of Fame to see all my fav stars along the sidewalk. I did get to see all my fav stars but I also saw a lot of homeless people which made it sad. A lot of them were high on drugs and talking to themselves and I needed to cross the road to avoid them which was not a nice feeling. There are lots of tourist shops around there for all your holiday trinket stuff, just look around as a lot of the places are cheaper than others. Hope this review helped!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheChocolateOne
30,"Worth checking out, but brace yourself!","Hollywood Blvd is chaos! Filled with people on both sides of the road, it has spruikers, characters in costumes looking for money and the homeless abound. Sure, it's worth checking out, but go early to avoid the chaos. Don't forget to go into the shopping mall at Hollywood and Highland to the third floor to see a great view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellerAS80
50,Cool to see in person,I suggest you head out in the morning (before it gets too hot) walking down on one side of Hollywood Blvd and back up the other side. There are way less crowds in the morning and you can take in all the names on the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlenec2013
30,Lots of Stars,We visited early in the morning before all the crowds (and heat of the day) and enjoyed a pleasant walk searching for stars we knew. I was a bit disappointed that certain areas were not kept up and were dirty and difficult to read. Fun way to walk to your next destination.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WunderFulLife
40,Fun for people watching,"We stayed at the BLVD hotel in Hollywood, (which is a great hotel, BTW) and is within easy walking distance of the Walk of Fame and Chinese Theater. We were visiting the walk on a Friday night in July, so it was quite crowded. If you're into watching street performers and people watching, you'll love this! You do have to be prepared for people to try to sell you lots of stuff...a guy practically shoved a homemade music CD into my husband's hand, and before my husband could react, the guy said, ""Five dollars would make my day."" (Guess what? The CD sucks. No shocker...) If you have your heart set on finding a particular star, you might be looking for awhile, but we enjoyed just wandering around. Also, there are a ton of shopping, dining, and entertainment options available. You can really make a day of exploring the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristyg974
30,Stars,"Vacation with family a must see but very crowded. A lot of vendors and people dressed up in characters (Spongebob, Spider-Man etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/721TR
40,Hollywood Walk of Fame - Hollywood Boulevarde,"We stayed at the Hollywood Orchid Suites, rear of Hollywood and Highland shopping centre which is easy walking distance to the Hollywood Walk of Fame.Interesting place, during the day there were a few movie characters in costumes who for a tip allowed you to take photos of them with or without you.At night they were everywhere.The Hollywood Walk of Fame is central to other attractions, The Dolby Theatre, The Chinese Theatre, the wax museum and lots of shops especially the Hollywood and Highland Centre.It is worth a visit if you are staying in Hollywood or Los Angeles.There are lots of stars on the Walk of Fame so allow some time to have a look.The Hop On Hop off bus we caught also started from here, so it must be a stop on the tour if you begin somewhere else.Hollywood Boulevarde is a very busy area around this area of a night, with a very diverse range of people, say a firm No to the CD sellers and keep walking and we were told before we went to keep a tight hold on handbags.We had no trouble and spent quite a bit of time on the Hollywood Boulevarde. Just take normal precautions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suej161

40,"The Hollywood ""Thing to do""","We are on vacation in Los Angeles so the must do is see the walk of fame.Checked off the bucket list, was neat to see the stars along the walk and the amount of people taking photos with specific ones.If you are in the area and haven't don't I, just do t to say you did! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matthew_613
30,Mega crowded,"We went there on Saturday evening, probably wrong timing. The crowds were super huge, sidewalks filled with entertainers, at times difficult to pass. You can find the star if you know where it is exactly. Otherwise, felt like a busy subway station during rush hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ksksksksks
40,Cool,"We've been here many times, the stars in the sidewalk are pretty cool. You can check the star for your favorite artist, if he or she are one of the lucky ones. The walk of fame has been cleaned up, it wasn't very pleasant to walk around a couple of years ago, exspecially at night. But now it's a nice place to visit, and look around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BerryvdM
40,Worth a look,"The walk of fame is worth a look we walked from one end to the other both sides of Hollywood Boulevard.The stars are interesting to see and we were the when Adam West (T V Batman) passed away and his star had a number of floral trbutes,which was a nice touch and always happens when a star dies apparently.Its well worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/835allans
40,A good walk,"It was nice to walk the route and see the names of our favourite famous actors entertainers and the like set in the pavement. Entertainment all around with buskers and impersonators, shops and eateries.a bit of pressure from some sellers (especially the hip hop CD sellers) but all part of the trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaniceL638
50,Fun place to walk around,Fun to see the stars on the walk and spot your fav ones and click pictures. Lots of people but a nice spot to people watch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TabzMarz
20,Quite disappointed,When you see Hollywood walk of fame on TV you will think it is astonishing. Actually it is over stated and not worth the time spent. It is just ticking box and that's all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nidaleo
20,"Cute but a bit shady as a neighborhood to walk in, especially after darl",Expansive neighborhoods of star-studded streets but very Pervy feel to most of the shops and eateries there. Too many sex toy shops and massage parlors etc to leave your teens walking alone. The Hollywood sign is not too close and most views are obstructed by buildings and clutter.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NO963
40,Crowded but fun,"We enjoyed taking pics on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame stars. Only thing is we couldn't find a map as a guide to the location of the stars we really wanted like Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson, Joe Pesci or Marilyn Monroe...to name a few. We found the costumed characters on the streets to be friendly but not too pushy. Although we didn't take any pics with them. We were going to eat at Mel's drive in restaurant after we were done for the day but the wait time was too long on July 4 and we were hungry..so decided to check out Venice Beach and maybe find somewhere to eat in that area. Too bad because the prices were decent and food looked delicious!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rochellem935
50,OH the things you'll see...,"This is such a wonderful and historic activity to do while in LA. it's fun to think that each star has had the actor or actress or whatever they are famous for, AT that star! it's fun to find names you know and the people you will see while on this adventure will entertain you with their unique-ness. LOL",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chadc133
20,Walk of Shame,"Dirty, crowded and disappointing even for an out of town visitor. If you're going make sure to see other things like the Chinese Theater at the same time. There are many movie characters along the boulevard - Batman, Jack Sparrow, etc. - that are good to take pictures with for a price but many of them are poor representations of the movie characters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douglasg451
20,"Packed, touristy and not worth seeing","Unless you want to see a particular star this is just tourist tripe, worth a quick look but that is all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottb869
50,Impressive,Well worth a visit.we went there both during the day and at night which was better.There are some good eating places.We used Jameson's Irish bar which has a half price (Bogof) alcohol policy up to eight at night.We both had the Prime Rib which was just ok.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erskine129
30,Okay-but not overly impressice,If you come to Hollywood just to see the walk of fame best not to waste your time. If you are in the area seeing other stuff and can take them in them okay.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/explorer0333
30,A little disappointed,I took a walk to the Hollywood Walk of Fame it was very interesting to see celebrities and musicians that have their stars. I am from New York but it was difficult seeing the amount of homeless people laying around the streets. And a lot of the areas smelled bad. Store owners need to wash in front of their business everyday so that the smells from the homeless people will not have tourist upset. It was definitely interesting but not on my top 20 to go back to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmN5056PZ
50,Marilyn mon amour,It was like looking st the movie stars themselves. Incredible sight to see as a movie buff. My favorite was Marilyn...unfortunately her STAR is located in front of a chain fast food joint🍔,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Excursion699904
30,Not worthy if time is short,"Maybe it is me but I don't admire or care about celebrities like I do for great chefs, writers, teachers, volunteers, artists, humanitarians and musicians. So, they made millions in memorizing a script and held true to character. Good! But this does not define greatness! Where is star for MLK, Malcolm X, Lincoln, Mother Teresa? I think it is so superficial but then I never bought an expensive purse or pair of uncomfortable shoes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L1836TZlauras
40,Crowded and crazy,"Walk of fame is always neat to see. Definitely crowded as the day goes on but you can catch a street performance if you are walking by at the right time. There are plenty of ppl dressed in characters and celebs willing to take pics for a tip. It's like a tiny, mini version of Times Square. Wear some decent shoes to walk in. It's a must see for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poserk13

Also, understandable but it does make it hard to navigate the sidewalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerrikaw

10,Hollywood,Very busy. Many homeless and extremely dirty. Worth a look but that's all. McDonalds food was disgusting. Did you know to get a star you have to be famous for 5 years.

20,"Meh, it's ok","I wouldn't go out of my way to see it, but if you happen to be in the area, it's kind of interesting to walk down it at least once. The area is super touristy and crowded, so definitely be aware of that before visiting. I'm glad I can say that I've seen it in person, but it's a bit underwhelming, and I probably wouldn't give it a second go around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DP79DC
20,Seedy and grimy,"I was really looking forward to seeing this landmark, but ended up so disappointed. The vast majority of this walk is in a very seedy neighbourhood and it was untidy and dirty. We were constantly harassed to go on trips and were offered drugs on a couple of occasions.There are a couple of highlights - the Capitol Records building was striking and the area adjacent to the Chinese Theatre was ok.It's true the pavement was full of stars, but it was also full of trash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/672WayneS
20,Quite disgusting,"The street is super crowded, there are no real attractions except the starts on the pavement (and some of them are in really bad shape). All the shops and many of the people are shady. Hollywood boulevard these days is definitely not what tourist from out of town expect to find in it...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benkitato
10,Not worth the walk,As everybody says... Its not worth the walk its very dirty and homeless everywhere. The mall was nice and clean that was the only thing. As seen on t.v may look exciting but it does not look safe its good to go with a group because you can watch out for each other due to pocket picking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road705563
30,Dirty and tacky .... absolutely no Hollywood glamour,Don't go expecting Hollywood glamour or you'll be really disappointed. The whole place is full of very cheap souvenir shops and the sidewalk with the start and celebrity hand/footprints is dirty and untidy. The theatre used for the Oscars ceremony is in a scruffy shopping centre ..... not at all what you'd expect. We wouldn't bother with Hollywood Boulevard on any future trips to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeandWendy01

Saw a few musicians but not many on our trip as well as artists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/southerngal2015
30,Way too busy,"Look we were ready for it being a tourist trap, but way too hectic, especially if you have young kids.

It's worth a quick visit but then get out of there asap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayWestYorks

20,Lost It's Glory,"The Hollywood star Walk of Fame does not seem to be that famous anymore. Generally the stars on the walkway are dirty and have things spilled on them. Unless there is a particular star you know where it is located; you can not find what you are looking for because it goes on for miles on different streets in Hollywood. On Hollywood Blvd there are so many people walking and standing on the stars, you have trouble reading them. It is not really the attraction it used to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metrotorrance

Some spots, you can find street performers.It smells like food everywhere you go. It's always interesting, and each time you go, it will be a completely different experience.Yes, the traffic is terrible! You will have to take out a loan just to park. (Kidding, kinda) and the crowds of people can get a bit overwhelming, it's still a must stop attraction. I suggest staying on Hollywood Blvd, and DO NOT veture down the side streets. That is where people get robbed, and lots of the mentally ill homeless people are. Chances are, nothing will happen. But, things do happen, sometimes. And that's where the chance is higher.You will see lot of homeless. It's very sad, and a lot of them are not mentally stable. I usually leave something by the trash can, for them. Sometimes they just want to be left alone. Respect that.The Grauman's Chinese Theatre is fun. There is also things like The Wax Museum, and Ripleys Believe it or not.

We went in the day and also ended up out there at 1am as our hotel was right off the strip (Loews) there are all sorts of other characters out there but we had a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaySerena
30,Just had to be seen.,"We just had see this, and if you see a name more then ones. You are not seeing things. You can have more then one star. What i did not know was that if you do get a star you have to pay for it. If you dont they will remove you. Go figure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/836fredriks
40,Cool to pose with stars names and literally walk all over them,Good to tick off your bucket list. Was cool to take pictures with the stars' names and literally walk all over them,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92owenc
30,Mad street,Visit here before 10am or else the place is total chaos. People selling everything under the sun on this street and it is difficult to easily get down the street!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E5516BKlouiseh
30,Tourist trap,"This street is a tourist trap. Multiple ""characters"" will try to take pictures with you then expect you to pay them well for the picture. The sidewalk is dirty and needs to be maintained better. Traffic is poorly controlled and parking is a nightmare! Just not worth the effort to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/464tyrah
30,Busy,Second time to the walk of fame and the crowds can be quite annoying. Many peddlers and people wanting to take photos of the stars makes for a difficult journey down the street. Many closedown store fronts make for a shady feeling area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EATBFLO
50,Once in a lifetime!,Didn't realise how many names there would be. A few surprises overall very overwhelming! Will come back on the future with the little ones.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/906gemp
30,Didn't love it but was happy to visit,"It's a very long street with all the stars on the floor, it's a long walk for the kids so we didn't finish it all, but my kids loved taking photos with the stars of all Disney related characters. I advise if u want to see a specific star to search where is its location exactly before u go. It is a very crowded street and as I went in July it was a little bit sunny. I think it's a place u just need to visit once but will not visit again.The thing I loved in the street is the souvenir shops specially one called Lalaland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/730mz
20,Is not what you think,"The stars are all over the place on Hollywood Blvd rather than in one spot, so this is really just a much of starts on the sidewalk. A drive by is enough. There are tons of homeless people, the street is dirty and rather scary. Don't take your children here. Hollywood Blvd is a dump.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Urbarn-Explorer
30,Full on,"Walk of fame is pretty full on with people trying to give u music cds, selling tours and trying to get u take photos with them in character outfits. If u are nervous and don't like crowds go during the day. Its sill full on but feels safer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693taniaw

40,Don't miss if you like touristy stuff,"It's crowded and touristy, but like many other tourist destinations, you should at least see it one time.Even for those who are jaded, it is fun to see the sidewalk stars of your favorite celebs and take a picture or leave a memento.Please note however that there are some homeless people and aggressive tour operators who make some people uncomfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/in0r
20,A dirty sidewalk,Didn't really know what to expect it's just a sidewalk with stars names on. Was expecting it to be crowded but it was deserted apart from a few homeless. Pure tourist trap with surroundings to match. Dirty and grimy feel to it. Waste of time not worth bothering with,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123LS
20,Disappointed,We caught the metro to la from long beach which was good. Traffic is horrendous and I mean horrendous. Hollywood area is seedy and dirty and not what we expected. We decided to do bus open tour for 2 hours as we did not feel safe due to homeless people screaming and talking to themselves with obsenatities. People staring at you and harassed by street vendors. Sorry L.A. but not for us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wozzer1969
10,Is this all ???,This street is dirty and crowded with tourists. We tried to park our car but with $16 for 20 minutes I did not think it was it worth.I expected a nice street or alee good looking and atractive. What we saw was not worth the gasoline we used.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertN110
50,A star among stars,Loved that place with all different stars of different celebrities. Took some nice photos there and felt a star😁,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jo_tk255

30,"Crowded, but still fun","This is an Alright attraction if you Google the stars you want to see in advance.Otherwise Its Kinda overcrowded and people will try to sell you all kinds of stuff, including getting you to take pictures with people dressed up as different Hollywood characters and superheroes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mathiasd862
40,Bucket list checked off,I felt like I was on the Vegas strip! Lots to see and do! A must if you're in LA. The kids enjoyed looking for famous people along the walk of fame. Plus Pinks hotdogs restaurant is only a mile away and a must eat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeljO3536JB
10,Very disappointed,"This was one of the dirtiest and sleaziest places I have ever been...probably worse than the strip in Vegas. The area was actually dirty with trash and the smell of urine and pot. The street vendors were way too aggressive.I can't imagine going to LA and not visiting the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but you don't need to spend more than an hour here. It is iconic but it is a not where you want to spend a whole day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I2099SWpatrickw
30,Nice to say you've done it but nothing special,"Bit of a tourist trap but everyone is pretty much aware of this before they arrive. However it is one of those things that you can't help but take a walk along, take a few pictures and behave like a proper tourist. Box ticked, move on to the next thing...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/12robk
30,Just OK.,"We were rather underwhelmed from the walk of fame.Yes, the stars are all there, but the street felt rather neglected with numerous touts along the way.Still, if you set your expectations right, you can actually enjoy finding the star of your favorite movie star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheShis
50,Hollywood walk of fame is a must see,"I would say this is the most popular tourist attraction in LA. Walk around see the stars on the floor, check at the Chinese theatre, the Roosevelt hotel, and the crazy guys dressed up as your favorite actor or musician.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18seana
30,One will never see the Stars with Zero People.,"One will never see the Stars with Zero People. Hollywood is not as ""glamorous"" as the movies make it out to be in the movies. It is an ""experience"" for sure. One seems a microcosm of humanity at it's worse. My advice to anyone visiting the star walk. Be Careful. Pay attention to what is happening around you. Serious pickpockets and thieves abound. Keep your valuables safe. Do not set down a phone or camera or any kind of bag with anything valuable inside. Thieves strike lightening fast. Do not wear expensive watches or jewelry, there is no one you will see to impress. Hollywood is gritty. They try to keep it clean, but with the masses of people it is near impossible. Do NOT stay in cheap motels or hotels in Hollywood!!!! Contact a Professional Travel Consultant and choose better hotels in better locations. In LA travel time is based on the TIME it takes to get somewhere, NOT the distance. There are millions of people going places and doing things and that causes ""traffic"" gridlock. Never go out alone, especially at night. Hollywood is an interesting visit, just be careful. Do not buy anything from anyone on the street. Period! Nothing. The souvenir shops sell mostly cheap stuff made in China. Be very discerning what you purchase. Take lots of photos and edit them when you get home. Most of the ""Characters"" charge for taking their pictures. Adults: never let children out of your sight! Not for a moment. If you take one of the bus tours and are on top, wear a hat, sunglasses, and sunblock like you are at the beach! The sun can be brutal if in it for a few hours. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have about Hollywood and Los Angeles. Google me. JESS Kalinowsky",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jess90069
40,Bigger than i thought!,So many more stars than i thought! If you go to hollywood its a must! Only problem is the lack of police around the area as there was alot of people loitering and this put me off a bit. Alot of homless people around so unsure how safe this would be at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heartbelongsinhawaii
50,Lovely walk,Had a great time walking the Hollywood Walk of Fame. So many stars. Took some interesting pictures for our vacation album.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcikins
30,Hollywood Walk Of Fame,"Exciting to find different artists and take pictures, etc. Very disappointing in that the area is not well maintained, pavements are not well kept despite their significance and quite dirty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmenJ172
50,Nice walk,The walk spans a few blocks and it's worth taking specially if you are Hollywood fan. It's fun to find the stars that you love.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TabraizFeham
40,Give yourself lots of time,"If you're looking for specific Stars, you will have to give yourself a lot of time. We spent 3 hours walking and looking through everyone we recognized, but if you're on a time limit, focus on the 1 or two blocks around the Chinese Theatre. There is a metro stop right under the main area. You can also see the Hollywood sign from the Highland Shopping area. Expect a lot of crowds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunset007
40,"Yep, it's Hollywood",Very nice early evening walking on the sidewalk. It was great seeing the stars and enjoying the weather. Their are people in costume along the way if you want to take pictures with them. There are places to eat and parking wasn't a big deal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ebazinam
50,Stargazing but staring at our feet!,"A great place to spend an afternoon - stroll up and down seeing whose stars you can find! It's a challenge to see them all as there are lots, and you also stumble over other tourists and street sellers standing on interesting names! One of the LA must-do attractions. We enjoyed mooching along the street, iced lemonade in hand :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrMrsSausageChops
50,Famously Fun,I enjoyed walking the many blocks in Hollywood and loved seeing all the stars stars! It gets a little crazy when it starts getting dark so I suggest going during the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannono101
10,"Fine, maybe 60 years ago, but this is The Worst of LA now","This is the most pointless and worthless attraction in LA. Scammers, Hecklers, dirty mouths, panhandlers, persistent jerks who force a CD into your hand, and demand money. I mean, if you want to see Michael Jackson's star, just google it and look at the pic. I couldn't wait to get out of there, and get a shower. I actually think Mexico City is better than this! Go to Venice Beach instead!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/music-professor
40,Free... Why not?!,If you are visiting LA... It's an interesting and free attraction. It's fun looking for the stars of those you were/are a fan of. Lots of interesting people.We came on a Friday afternoon at about 1ish. We were able to find street parking pretty easily.There are people who dress up as certain characters (like super heroes) that will let you take a pix with them for a small fee ($1).You can also find vendors who will make a mock star with your name on it so you can take a pix with it. Looks pretty real.Visit if you haven't been... So you can say... Been there... Done that. Why not... It's free. 😁,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5048XHmariat
30,A must for a tourist in LA,"Had a lovely evening there, just strolled along the paths checking out the stars. Called in a few shops, grabbed dinner there and parking was super easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23shents
30,Have to see it,While on the week long family vacation to LA we had to and one has to see the walk of fame. We went twice to see it all. You will feel like you are in any big town with the panhandling and tourists like us. There is plenty of trinket shopping but you can also find some regular shopping opportunities for clothes and such. There is a nice and short free show at the Chinese Theatre. Parking is difficult and expensive so plan on extra time if you are driving.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottt456
20,A penny in the septic tank,Overdone with too many names in a dirty area filled with homeless people. Miss this. It's better in your imagination.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anagorski
20,Never Again,"This area is so overrun with tourists it's difficult to enjoy . I don't find the area desirable at all . I would suggest going with a larger tour instead of driving down there and having to deal with traffic and parking . Costumed characters will try to take photos with you for money , over priced street vendors and people handing you cds that they expect you to buy . Not a great place to take the family in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culinayart1
30,Iconic yet...,"When you're in LA and you're a movie/TV buff, this is one of those places you just have to pay a visit to. You may take pics till your hearts content but after a while it just becomes trite and wearisome. There's no discernible order as to where each name is located so unless you have a map, you'll be looking around for a while for all your favourites. It goes on for about 2km or 1.3 miles.Also, making the whole experience that little bit more tiresome, there are many pesky people here dressed up as stars or characters trying to get you to take a pic of them but they'll want payment once you do. Add to that those other pesky ppl trying to shove flyers at you and you'll soon want to move on from here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Slim5144
10,Chaos,Nothing to see and too many people for me. Not really worth the time and too many scammers in costumes selling stuff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/super1122
10,Very trashy area,"This area reminded us of New Orleans, but we think New Orleans if actually cleaner. Crowds are not friendly, very dirty, smelly area. Traffic was horrendous in this area. We did not even go into any of the gift/souvenir shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheliaS658
30,dissapointing,"Well, lots of sex and wig shops but if you look close you can see the Hollywood sign.The walk of fame starts to get dirtier and dirtier the further away from the train station you go. Not quite like you see on the TV. Won't be going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saturnstan
40,Friday walk,We had dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe and then walked the sidewalk....hard to see all the names with crowded Hollywood. Our friends from Sweden were surprised to see non humans - Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse with stars....we told them they were entertainment folks. Fun to walk the blocks to see the stars....but don't go on summer evenings.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CheapEats019
20,Awful!,What a huge let down..One of the iconic strips of Los Angeles and it was awful.I have been to Las Vegas and walked that strip and loved it..I hated walking this street. It was dirty and full of annoying pushy people dressed up in costume hoping for a photo and payment. .The stores were full of junk souvenirs and the whole area looked rundown.There was drugged people sitting on steps picking at their sores..Quite frankly i couldnt wait to get back on the tour bus.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janine45
30,A Bit Of A Let Down But It's Still A Must Do,"The stars are spread over quite a large area and are on both sides of the street so there's a bit of walking to do, which involves saying no every 30 seconds to the annoying people handing out Hollywood tour flyers. It's hard not to keep your head down reading the names whilst you walk along but when you do look up you'll realise that the area is a little cheap and tacky and not the Hollywood glitz and glamour you'd expect.If your time is limited there are sites on the internet that will tell you where your favourite celeb's star is",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newspapertaxi
40,"A little overrated, but still kinda a must see","The path is quite long, usually pretty crowded, runs on both sides of Hollywood Blvd. Might not be the best idea for a hot, hot day. Still, definitely s must see. Kinda an iconic spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627justynap
40,Good to walk around,"The Chinese theatre is good with the movie stars hand and foot sign. The only things not good is they are selling fake souvenirs like hats, keychain and shirt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeffrey_Teh_2000
30,It's ok if you know who people are,"It's a strange place... it seems to be going through some regeneration. Lots of homeless people & just generally a bit down trodden, looks like it's is changing though. TBH we didn't know who most the people were as they're mostly Americans. We only went on route to catch the bus. It's ok if you're in to that sort of thing. It's not really my thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amandamonkey

50,Lots of fun!,Was so much fun walking up and down looking at all the stars that align this 15 block walkway. This area in Hollywood is VERY crowded with tourists. If you don't mind the crowds then you will have a great time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jewels200
30,A place to see,"It's one of those LA things! Hard to leave out and exactly as you probably thought it would be. Fun finding stars you know and interesting facts on having a star! $35,000! Guess drop in bucket to stars!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraC4981
10,"Don't go, it's dirty and it stinks","Homeless people around every corner, it stinks very bad. I think it was maybe a side seeing 20 years ago... not any more",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thommyleejohnes
30,Disappointment .,There were a lot of people on the street and it was hard to enjoy it . specially during the hot weather that we had.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2320BJgabrielb
40,Great atmosphere,"Our kids aged 8 and 9 loved the walk. It can be hectic in some areas but that's part of the fun.The characters expect payment in return of any photos being taken of them, so if you're keen, teach your kids to say no before you go. They are like magnets!This is one of those attractions that needs to be ticked off if going to LA for the first time. So just do the atmosphere is great",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kanjv50
50,A Must Do in Hollywood,Super cool to find the star of your favorite celebrity. Be prepared for some real freak watching too! You can check out the foot prints of celebrities in front of the groman Chinese theatre and the souvenir shops are aplenty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlejandroRS1973
50,Cool free stop,Glad we did it. The kids loved finding their favorite and most disliked stars. It was free and fun. They took photos and had good laughs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RochelleF517
30,too crowded,"went here on a weekday and it was still crowded. It was hard fornus to find specific stars because we didn't have a map. in my opinion, not a must-see attraction",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tvo_kid
40,Hectic,"Fun, free activity to walk along spotting different stars - part of the classic LA tourist itinerary. However, you get harassed a lot by street vendors / hustlers / unsavoury characters, so keep your wits about you. Gets a bit tiring after a while. Park in Hollywood and Hyland Parking Garage - good value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wombling_Free_7548

40,Of the most iconic of places.,"It is always entertaining to cross the most iconic of places of your travel bucket list. Although this is not necessary my cup of tea, I was in the neighbourhood and had fun deciding which star to have a picture with. I believe my bit weren’t the greatest of most recent of all, since I did not have a clue who most of them were. The result: the village people of course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whyitripped
20,Needs a clean,"Did the walk but it could do with a clean. I understand the amount of people who visit each day it is bound to get dirty, but even once a week. Areas had a smell of urine. It did make walking the street more interesting as you look for names you recognise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wilsonvic
40,"Too Spread Out, but Fun","Everyone has heard of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. But no one every tells you how spread out it is. If you're looking for a specific star, you should definitely look up the location first. This entire area is super touristy, so it makes a great spot to buy all of your California souvenirs. It's also worth coming by this area to check out Man's Chinese Theater (where the stars put their hands in the cement and sign).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taylorr55
30,Where the tourists go,"The Walk of Fame gives the Hollywood feels, together with the stars on the road with names of actors and actresses. There are a lot of museums, places to shop along the street. The street is basically filled with tourists taking pictures. I can finally tell people that I visited here but I don't really find this place very special. I came here everyday on my trip because I stayed at a hostel right next to Hollywood Blvd, maybe that made the place less special.One thing to be careful of: Don't take pictures with the people who are wearing costumes unless you are willing to pay. Or else remember to negotiate a price before taking a picture with them, Also, don't take any CDs that are being handed to you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cshanneen

50,Movie History and plenty of craziness.,"Hollywood Boulevard is one of the must do's in LA. I am quite a movie buff and take all our visitors there.It can be quite a ""zoo"" but it has so much history.The stars of past and present line the pavement down both sides of the street.There's also the hand and foot prints in the cement at Gruman's Chinese Theatre dating back to the 1920's and 30's and entrance to the Dolby Theatre faces Hollywood Boulevard.Its definately a must see but don't expect anything glamorous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathryn2103
30,Much overrated,It was alright and I'm glad we've done it and can say we've been there. Personally I didn't recognise many of the names on the stars and my wife had to tell me who they were or had been. Expect to be constantly badgered by touts wanting to sell you tours or homeless beggars by the hundreds asking for spare change. Also expect the usual 'street entertainers' and D.J's trying to sell you their c.d. compilations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SergeantRoo
40,worth the look,"This is a crazy busy tourist spot, but well worth tolerating the hustle and bustle. Parking can be a challenge, but go for it. Make some memories",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N9829KWpatricias
30,Interesting walk,"It is interesting to see and remember actors from the 1930's to present, many of whom are no longer with us. The area is a little run down and lots of homeless people are nearby many are harmless but it is distracting. Lots of people and tourists in the area from all across the globe, lots of fast food restaurants in the area many of which are not great, so if you are hungry hold off until you can find a better restaurantParking is an issue but there is a large shopping centre and parking is fairly reasonable there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mulgrew

50,Walk as a Star,"This the most famous street in Los Angeles, can compete only with Beverly Hills.The attraction is free. You can get there by using a public transportation (approx. 1 hour to 1,5 depending on a traffic) or by taxi, I bed it will take you there much faster.I spent a good couple of hours there, just studying every star on the street and visiting museums and entertaining centers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriabR6368IO
50,Crazy,"What an atmosphere at the walk of fame! From street performers to just random dressed up people the place is buzzing ohh and you can see all your favourite actors stars but be warned, there are a lot of hustlers on the walk trying to give you stuff away for ""free"" until you touch, listen or even sniff their product and they hunt you down for money",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottishred74
50,Walk of fame is cool,I like the walk of fame. It's something cool to see at least once. Hadn't been there in few years so it was nice to see some of my fave artists stars. We went so that the kids can see and walk through it now that they are older. My son was happy to take pic by Michael Jackson star!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YSanchezCalifornia
30,Be Careful and Watch your items,"The walk can be a great experience; however, understand the area you are in has lots of homeless and young teens on the move. While walking be careful of the people hanging around on the side as you will stick out as a tourist reading the names as you walk. Keep items close to you and hold on to your bags. It's important that everyone understands the theme of is you ""see something say something"" you may not have to call 911 every time, try telling a local merchant your concerns as they may have experience with the issues you are concerned about and can explain it or assist in calling 911 with the correct location,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterlL1379KK
10,"If you want to check sightseeing boxes, go here. Otherwise save your time on this underwhelming attraction.","Its one of the key places people want to visit in LA. They assume Hollywood is glamorous (more like Beverly Hills or something) and yet these stars on pavement riddled with throngs of tourists and dressed up street performers is not that interesting or remotely glam.

Some of the theaters (e.g. Chinese theater) worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ECWorld

Expected a whole to better than what we got.The place is filthy, a few bums hanging around and several other undesirables. Quite a few souvenir shops all vying for the almighty dollar. The starts are a disappointment, found most of the ones we were looking for but they are fairly bland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/444Marlin
30,Nice for once,"We were visiting Los Angeles for a day so we had to stop at this tourist spot. There were more stars than I expected, I think we saw around 500 stars and there were also some empty stars for future people. It’s cool to see the stars of for example Kevin Spacey, Arnold Schwarzenegger or the Muppets but that’s basically all you will see. It’s a street with shops and restaurants though so you could also do that here. We parked for free on an easy 2 minutes walk next to the soccer field.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronaldo070

Joan Crawford, Doris Day, Gloria Swanson and more...there are some characters on the street and some vendors selling things but look beyond it and enjoy the history!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jobbyjane
30,Hollywood and hollyweird,We walked the walk of fame from the top to the bottom of Hollywood Boulevard and tried to spot the names of people we have heard of. This is an extremely busy road. Traffic and pedestrians make for a very noisy and slow moving stroll.The people dressed in costume expect money when you take their photo - some rather aggressively.A sense of humor and patience is required to enjoy this walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E128XQalexc
30,Hollywood walk of fame,We just walked the side walk. We got constantly harassed by tour companies.There are way to many starts to try seem them all. Try find your favourite on the net before you go searching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolemY1985VL
30,Los Angeles Visit,"Hotels were expensive, we stayed in a run down Quality Inn for $200 a night and the only good thing about it was it was2 blocks from Hollywood Blvd. traffic was horrendous. My 18 yo granddaughter wanted to see California so we went. I traveled throughout California in my business for several years, so I've seen it all. Not interested in returning to the West Coast although the weather was nice. We'll stay in the SE. Did go to Frank Sinatra's favorite restaurant just off Hollywood Blvd., that was nice, good food and ambiance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesrR7865XS
30,Disappointing,"We decided to visit this attraction again as we have always enjoyed the stroll down this famed walk. In the past it was well maintained , clean and very busy, well things have changed.We found that the walks were not pritine like they once were and the street itself was not as clean as you would expect and was totally disappointed in the upkeep of a famous walk.We will not be returning again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petersR1316EX
40,Better than 5 years ago,Returned after a visit in 2012. Area felt much safer than then. Still not the highlight I expected it to be. Lots of trash and crap on the sidewalk. Some of the real stars are way outside the main area. Not that impressive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nina-1561
30,Interesting but not really worth it,"Saw the street as part of our holiday in California.In the cold light of day rather disappointing.Yes nice to say you did saw the stars in the pavement and The Chinese theatre.The street is dirty, noisy, rather tacky and worn out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/87marting
30,Get up early and avoid crowds,"Nothing special about it in my opinion, but if you want to enjoy taking pictures without the wait and then the crowds get up early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andromeda1211
30,"Ticked it off the list for the second time, but won't return.","If you're in LA, you should take a look, but do it once, for the sake of saying you did it.I found it very crowded, tacky and was full of people pushing a product or badly dressed super heros asking for photos.A few scammers around too, such as the supposed 'rappers' giving away free CD's....in return for a tip....the CD is blank of course!Get a picture by the pavement with your favorite star's name on it, then get out, as there is so much more to see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/930stuartl
40,Hollywood walk of fame,"Hollywood walk of fame is what you do when in LA its pretty tacky and the street is dirty with lots of homeless people, hawkers, people dressed up as character's wanting to charge for a pic and souvenir shops. It really shows the distinction between the haves ( Hollywood stars ) and have nots (homeless people). However worth the look",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/395alishas
40,Tourist attraction,When coming to Los Angeles we come to Hollywood and Vine area. We do the tourist thing and recognizing the names on the stars is fun to do. Like I said it's a tourist thing!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8813SClindam
30,Hollywood walk,Really enjoyed the Hollywood walk. There was a lot of names and information I did not know. I don't know if I would make it a point to do it again but iam glad I did it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rsahagian
20,What a let down,"If you go to LA, I suppose it is something you have to see so I would recommend going - but do not expect much and do not waste a ton of time. I found this experience to be a complete let down. Sure, there are the stars on the street and a couple of famous theaters (Chinese theater, Dolby theater, etc.) but I found the street to be dirty, lots of hustlers roaming around, and nothing charming about the experience at all. Just a bunch of souveneir shops and seedy looking people and places. Will never visit again and would not recommend anyone to spend any substantial time here. Go, see a few of the stars, snap a few pictures, and get out ASAP.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kkolodz
10,An embarrassment,"This place needs to be respected!!!It needs someone to come in get rid of all the homeless, the dealers, the music wannabes and close ""Hollywood"" boulevard to traffic so that visitors and tourists can enjoy, admire and spend time remembering the people who made ""Tinseltown"" shine.... it's now looking sad and old",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traceyt981
40,Cool once,"Once you've seen it, that's it. It's cool to go and find stars of celebrities you admire but beware of all the street hawkers; they will pester you. Go early in the morning to avoid the tour buses and remember it's a WALK of fame, so it covers several blocks. If this is your first time in Hollywood, do it. You won't have to do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katier942
30,Holiday,"Went here after going to universal studios. The place itself was really busy, we managed to walk down the whole walk of fame. We played a game of bingo ""we had a list of films/Tv shows and who ever had the actor or director had to drink""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Perrycj
40,Cool experience,"It was neat (and free!) -- blocks of walking the normal streets, staring at the ground and snapping pics of some of the names that strike up nostalgia. I think it's something you should do if you're in the area, if nothing else, just to say you did it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smithsf87
40,Just walk,The place is fully crowded with vendors and tourists.taking pictures is also difficult due to continuous stream of visitors.you can buy mementos from the shops on the street.keep walking checking stars of actors on the floor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnjanManda
30,"Stars as far as you can see, but might not want to","The walk of fame is something to look at, but it gets old fairly quickly. The stars go on for several blocks on both sides of the street and adjacent streets. The stars don't seem to be organized in any way so that makes it a bit cumbersome to find a particular star. And, there are many empty stars that people have written their names on.We saw Adam West's star, which had a small memorial on it and President Trump's star, which was defaced.The area is way too crowded and people aren't very considerate when you're trying to take pictures. Unfortunately, the streets aren't very clean and there are homeless people all over the place. There doesn't appear to be much respect for the area in general, which is sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyl552
30,Make a quick stop - Then get out of there!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame was fun for the 1st 30 min. and then it was time to get out of there. The walk is grimy, everyone around you is rolling blunts and smoking, it does not live up to expectations. The street performers are out during the day on the side of the Chinese Theatre and the wax museum. After you see the stars and some of the performers I would recommend to go see a different part of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATXLonghorn
30,The walk,"Busy street, crowded, and dirty but a classic if you are in LA. You can see lots of interesting characters everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/213elsaj
30,Worth going once,"The walk of fame is pretty dirty. Street vendors/performers all over, some very pushy and will actually try to grab your children so you pay for their services.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessnhopers
50,Have Fun!,"This is a fun area to explore and people watch. Just be aware of the street vendors. They talk fast so just don't get sucked in, roll with it! Just keep walking and keep laughing! ENJOY!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobkA9146CO
30,Lots of stars!,Must do! Great to see as you walk along Hollywood Boulevard. It goes on for a while so I recommend taking time to walk through on both sides of the road.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/657suek
30,Meh,"Had to visit Hollywood, because you know it's Hollywood! Was terribly disappointed. The area is actually a bit of a hole to be honest, apart from the small stretch of road where the theater and hard rock cafe is etc. IT was cool to find the stars you wanted to and do a dodgy celeb home tour. Food in the area was good and there is lots of souvenir shopping, most of it all the same and prices don't vary very much it's all pretty expensive for what it is. Worth it for the trip to say you've been there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julzi91
40,One of the must sees - but crowded,"We only spent a short time on the walk of fame. It is a must see, but it is crowded and you have to do a little work to be able to take a pic of the stars without shadows or people in the picture. Everyone should go if you are touring LA, but it's a one and done for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lollie777
30,Just OK,"I looked forward to this part if our visit and must admit I was a little disappointed. The area is VERY crowded and busy as it is a retail and tourist area. When I realized there are almost 2,800 stars, many I had never heard of, lessened the importance of the award for me. Make sure you look at the website so that you can search out your favorite stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tincognito
20,Not a wondrous spectacle at all,So it's a lot of stars sunk into the sidewalk with past and present celebrities names in. Big deal. Also some movie characters have stars such as Godzilla and Shrek which makes a mockery of the whole idea surely? Not worth making a special trip through congested LA to see but at least you can see the Hollywood sign from the shopping centre nearby,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R7146FTjamese
40,I'm seeing stars,"It is a very busy area but nice to see the stars/names of different celebrities as you walk. Because of the heavy traffic, periodically cleaning the stars would be nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/temecoy
30,Walk in LA,"An overhyped tourist place filled with touts and pickpockets, doesn't deserve the name given to it as every Hollywood character has the sole motive of fleecing the tourists rather than attracting them with no fear of the law. The walk on the boulevard and the surrounding malls and theaters is a good one to be. One should not miss the Marlyn Munro, character who is worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bipsav
40,HollyHood,"I was excited to do the Hollywood walk of fame because it's one of those bucket list places! Yes it's dirty but that was to be expected. We had sushi for lunch, walked up and down, found Michael jacksons star (outside the Chinese theatre)Went to the Hollywood museum and then had some drinks at a bar.It's what you make it! Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kati_pie
10,"Smelly, dirty, dangerous.","The place is full of homeless, aggressive panhandlers, and ""tour guides"". Trash everywhere.It sucked. LA sucks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W2172SPwilliamp
10,Not worth it unless you like to gawk at grotesque things,"I have been here many times, and it has never been a pleasant experience. I don't even like walking down this street when I have to get from a parking structure to a nearby restaurant or store! The most recent visit in March, I was early for a movie at the Chinese Theatre. There were the usual garish people dressed up as movie characters soliciting me as I walked, as well as the usual people advertising cheap wares and trying to hand me CDs as I walked by. But there were also a series of scantily clad women parading around as if they were taking prom photos. It was quite depressing to watch. If that's your thing, have at it, and don't invite me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beccam796
20,Yuck!!!,"Not what I expected at all!!! This area is overrun by homeless people. You have to fight through the crowds of people trying to get you to take a picture in a dirty costume, or nasty snakes at every turn. The starts are un kept and dirty with some having cracks. I'm glad I looked up New edition in advance and that is just where I went. I don't have to go again. Check out Muhammad Ali's star as he is the only 1 not to have his star on the ground. Hold on to everything this area is the area in your hometown your would never visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/618tashah
40,Nostalgic,It was nostalgic to see all the stars of so many celebrities some that have passed on already. The area is very touristy thus very crowded and there are a lot of homeless people in the area. Still we more able to get photos of stars we wanted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATXGirlie
50,It is a piece of history that is constantly evolving,We loved the walk of fame. So many stars we knew and so many we didn't. It is great to see the names of people who have entertained us for generations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanthetripMan
30,Just ok,"Visited on a sunday evening--While it was fun to walk around and take pictures, it was a dissapointing to see half the stars are covered by street vendors and performers.lots of homeless people and garbage everywhere. We went for a walk with our son around 8pm on a weekday and it felt really unsafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drpunja
20,Very overrated,"They are trying hard to clean up this area but it's full of conmen,, homeless,, drug addicts and mentally I'll people and is very scary at night .. and it's only about 2 blocks long and if u r coming on holiday just 2 see this place hoping 2 the movie stars and where the movies are made give it a big miss .. you have zero chance of seeing any .. but if u are into looking at freaks this is heaven",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unclechownza
20,Not what I expected at all...,"It was not what I expected at all. It was dirty, unkept and felt dangerous. Many of the stars were so dirty you have clear it off before taking a photo with it. If they weren't dirty they were broken or both, There were many homeless people which is not dangerous but sad. You smell a lot of marijuana smoke walking along. Everything is more expensive in California so be be prepared to pay a lot to park but fair prices within the stores along the strip. Wow, you live and learn...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sthompson77
50,Crazy but FUN!!,This was one of my favorite places we visited in LA it was very crazy & wild but I was very amused at all we saw there. It is definitely heaven for people that like to people watch. hahaI would recommend to go & go again if I have the chance to go!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wgomez28
50,Vacation fun!,"If you're looking for anyone in particular, make sure to pick up a map. You can also look it up on your iPad/phone as you're walking Hollywood Blvd. Personally, I just enjoyed walking and seeing who I could find! At 63, I knew a lot more than the 30something-year-olds I was with Lol!The shop with the statue of Elvis outside? Awesome! You will find tons of things in there for yourself and trinkets to take home for others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/480cjp
40,Lots to see,Took daughter on this trip for 16th birthday and had a blast. Hollywood walk of fame is always fun with lots to see and the Grauman Theatre. Can't rate this a 5 due to the panhandling and homelessness in the area however.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BReal549
20,Not what I expected,"The street is populated with people trying to make a buck from the tourists, people dressed up (with dodgy outfits) looking for you to take a photograph with them and to pay for the privilege.People with snakes round their necks, people trying to give you CD's .. then asking you for money to sign them.The stars lost its 'experience' due to all this nonsense.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzD2013
50,Feel the fame and search the stars~,"I absolutely love the Hollywood Walk of Fame! You might feel kinda dirty, a little pushy or a lotta lost in the shuffle, but spotting a star you admire will make the whole adventure worth it. I highly recommend doing a little planning first to find the stars you seek and take it from there. The best photos are the ones you prepare for-",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polishedblack
30,Hollywood walk of fame,"just visited, overall a pleasant exciting experience. You have to deal with the ones pushing their mixed tapes, dvd into your hands trying to sell their merchandise and theyre very pushy. One guy( a wannabe comediene) sold me a comedy dvd, i get home and its blank. My son was asked to purchase marijuana,( hes 16). It would be nice to visit without the hassle of rejecting people left and right and their pushiness, they are very aggressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellerS4187UL
10,Really Gross. Avoid,"I'm a Local. Don't go. Trust me. In fact, avoid Hollywood Blvd. at all costs. Sleazy tourist trap. You'll NEVER see a celeb. NEVER. If you must...proceed with caution, and no open sores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LocalLALALocal
50,"Tourist favorite (and sometimes locals, too)","I live in Los Angeles and when I have visitors from out of town, this is one of the places they always want to see. And yes, although a bit dirty and sometimes a bit crowded (especially with all of the characters and musicians busking for your dollar), it's still a must see. I still find it fun to see some of the names on the sidewalks...and then you never know what you'll see when you're here looking at the stars on the sidewalks. We've happened upon movie premiers at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre, or Hollywood Blvd was stopped for the filming of a Dancing with the Stars promo. And it's not JUST about the stars on the sidewalk. It's Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chachairis
40,"Touristic, but a must-see if you are first time in LA","The place is nice, very touristic. But you should go and see it as it's a, you know, must-see... in Hollywood. Watch out you wallet and stuff since it's very crowded... also, if you're there, check out the wax museum ( Madame Tussauds)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/379erant
30,Place is not so family friendly,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is obviously one of the most popular places for visitors in L.A. If you have never been there keep in mind that it will be very crowded specially on weekends, and also if you have young children it might not be the best place for them. On our last visit to the El Capitan theater we witnessed a couple purchasing marijuana down the street. So with that said you can imagine what it's really like, and that was in broad daylight not late at night. If you don't have kids then I guess you're fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianap695
40,Hollywood walk of fame,"After hearing about this for so long, finally did it this month. A nostalgic feeling once you go over the stars of the superstars who you have watched movies. Lot of people clicking their photos with their favourite stars.It's is central place in Hollywood and a happening place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogeshjw
10,So much for glitz and glam...,"First of all, the parking situation is awful. 20$ to park and you still have to walk quite a ways to get there. Definitely doesn't seem like the safest area to be walking in. It'd be nice if the city would make the parking easier so that people actually want to come here... it's just downright filthy. Homeless people sleeping on the streets... definitely not a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kozzzzz
30,nice long walk,The walk of fame is nice to look and walk with to appreciate the famous people we know and find to identify. To see everything is a good 2 hours walk. Stops at the chinese theater and other sights is worth the visit. a nostalgic walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneP788
40,Stars,Fun to see all the stars and the handprints in the cement...El Capitan theatre was beautiful....wish there was more help with the homeless on this street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhanly
20,Waste of time,"We were told before we went that Hollywood Blvd isn't all it's cracked up to be.It's dirty, lots of homeless people and random garbage, religious people protesty and people dressed pretending to be actor/actresses.I guess it's cool to see the stars as you walk?The only thing that made this trip worth it was this amazing Smoothie place-Juice Crafters. We also found an pil based cologne shoppe we've been looking everywhere for.I personally wouldn't recommend it. People make it sound like ""it's something you just have to see"". I disagree and wished we would have spent almost 3 hours elsewhere",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melisx33
50,Must See!,"Seeing a star on the Walk of Fame is legendary. When you find out that a star costs about $30,000, it makes seeing a piece of a sidewalk even most interesting. In the Hollywood History Museum, there is an exhibit about how the stars are made and repaired. It is interesting that some stats have more than 1 Star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ustravelrt66

30,Just Okay,"I was really excited to see the walk of fame, but I clearly didn't know exactly what to expect before getting there. It stretches several blocks, and (to be honest) was a lot more gritty than I expected. It was nice to see the stars of some of my favourite celebs, but it wasn't super special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Apfeiffer54

20,Dirty and needs a good clean up,This was the second time I have visited thee walk of fame. The first being in 2010. The difference is huge. The place is dirty and run down now. The walk needs a damn good clean up. The signs are all dirty. There's homeless people everywhere smoking and drinking illegal substances and the rubbish is piled high in doorways. Very disappointing. Won't be making a third trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ianbb8
50,Another must-have,Go there ! Just go and enjoy lively walk of fame. 24/7 you can just enjoyThis blvd ! Its the best part of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unkienstein
20,Nothing much there,Its a very crowded street with stars on floor.At the beginning - you'll be able to see some of the names/ stars but its impossible once you get closer to the 'main area'very hard to park your car and very touristy shops around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giligulu2016
50,It can be fun,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is what you make of it.Yes, it can be seedy in some areas and filled with street hustlers pushing hip-hop cd's and photo ops with those in cheap party city outfits BUTYou can see all kinds of Hollywood walk stars from radio, tv, theater, movies, and more. Many new and old alike.If your a Trump fan be careful as the liberal community have made an effort to vandalize his star and mock those who visit it (see my pic of it) if you like trump or not it is very disrespectful vandalism In the open public.My kids enjoyed Bugs Bunny's star.It's a treat and you can find walk star maps in hotel lobbies, star guides etc.It's loads of free fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimDeBerry

20,Boo Hollywood,"I told my girls we needed to see it but now I can say I'm done. Agressive Street hawkers were the worst some had snakes around Thier neck so you could get a picture, my wife was terrified I had to walk between the snake handler and her just to get by. And who chooses who gets a star anyhow. Avoid this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/37christopherb
30,The novelty quickly wears off,"I walked the entire walk of the fame, what a shame the walk was. Except outside general Hollywood most of the walk is not maintained or cleaned, it was dirty and in part damanaged. You also walk through some very unpleasant parts with lots of homelessness. This wasn't what I was expecting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanAdventure
20,Mix-Tape,Gotta to see where they filmed Jimmy Kimmel. Mix-Tape. Chinese Theatre looked cool. Mix-Tape. Wasn't a fan of the big Hell in the Cell all the way down the street.Mix-Tape. Understood this was for the Oscars so appreciated the atmosphere. Mix-Tape. A lot of tacky shop which was really unexpected as Ryan Gosling would be crossing the street just a few days later. Mix-Tape. A lot of homeless people. Mix-Tape. Liked the Coke I had in the McDonalds but I had an unfair deal in sharing the chicken nuggets. Mix-Tape.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Re_Journey

10,Smelly and badly maintained,"We went here expecting the best however the whole walk stank of urine and there were homeless people everywhere. It really was awful considering the money that's there, the council should be ASHAMED of themselves for letting it get into the state it's in...! We walked covering our faces as the smell was that bad for 90% of the walk. Some of the stars were smashed and considering the stars pay $40,000 for each one we were disgusted at the state of it...!!!!!!!!! Never again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188leem

20,"Totally ""Meh""","There are stars. On slightly grubby pavements with busy footfall.

40,Got to be done,"This is a must do if you're visiting LA just so you can say you have done it and take a few photos. Unfortunately the stars are dirty, there is a homelessness problem, plenty of people try to sell you goods such as CDs and drugs or try and get you to take photos with them for a few dollars, and the area is generally quite run down. The Hollywood & Highland Centre is worth it for the selection of restaurants and shops and there is also perfect Hollywood Sign photo opportunity in there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachael455
40,Not Bad for a First Timer,Newn heard that it was stinky and full of garbages. But their are some part of the road that are clean. The government should take a look of this actions since it was a tourist attraction. Overall Good 😊,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheuk_Miming

50,Ms.,"AWESOME EXPERIENCE!!! So many attractions!! Everything is snap-worthy!!! Movie Characters, Museums, eateries!!! So many sights and sounds!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trip480293
30,Crazy tourist strip,When in Hollywood - it's a must.Walk the strip and spot the stars at your feet as you avoid the sales stalkers and crazy people of Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/659rachelj
30,I don't get it,Why people want to walk around Hollywood looking down is beyond me. Instead catch a show at El Capitan or Hollywood Bowl or head to the beach instead.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharklin
50,The walk of shame.,"Such a pity that LA doesn't do something about the filth of the streets and move the homeless along. I imagine it could be very inviting. The poor stars are filthy, no care taken on appearance at all. Don't get me wrong, great place to visit, lots of history, never short of someone trying to scam you either. LA could improve this as it's such a tourist pull to Hollywood. Use the metro subway for ease of getting round or lyft.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/45rossite
50,Cover a few blocks with the stars,"Hollywood has certainly changed over the years.There are a lot of beggars and homeless people around the major attractions, obviously trying to get some coin off the visitors.The other thing to watch is the action characters dressed up and want photos taken with you, then hold out their hand for the privilege! Just be aware everyone is out to touch you.Otherwise can spent an hour of so wandering both sides of the street, some well known and some not so well known names.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/well_travelled330
50,Find your favourite,Lots of stars names .... great looking for favourites & imagining your name on the blank ones... even better seeing some stars while we were there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rowsh
50,worth a trip,"obviously a must see attraction, unfortunately the Oscars distributed the walk of fame so most stars was covered, still seen a good amount. Stretches for miles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lh1738
10,Crappy crap hole,This place is such a dive. I always thought Hollywood was this beautiful sparkly place. But no sorry not the case. Full of crazy weirdos and homeless people and dirty streets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megansM2918ZL
50,Checking it out,"I did not really like it, way too many people. So just rent a car, go around the whole area, get off for some pics and then move away.from there to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenajimenez
40,LA visit must include Hollywod,Hollywood blvd is a vibrant area. I would definitely make the visit to the walk of fame but would concentrate in the area closest to the Chinese Theater. There are many souvenir shops to pop into and some good photo opps around the area. Venture in to Dolby shopping center to end your trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayM22
50,A great addition to Hollywood,"If you're a fan of old movies like I am, finding a star with the name of an actor or actress you haven't thought of for years is a real treat. I think the walk of fame is a great idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banerman
40,A must on a visit to Hollywood,Interesting to see all the names. Hey are actually in about 5 different categories.E.g. acting.musician so some have their name more than once.Mohammed Ali is not on the ground but on a wall nearby.A few people have refused to have their name on the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etsu2013
20,Needs a good cleaning.,"My first time back here in years. I know the whole strip is a bit sketchy to begin with but with all that money, can't they clean up and maintain the stars better than that? Some of them look like there is throw up in them. Really bad!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moetpa
30,Go to scratch it off your bucket list...,"But don't expect too much!! This place is crowded with tourists and it's kinda awkward to try and stop and take pictures with your favorite star in the middle of people trying to walk. All the places and restaurants here are ridiculously overpriced and not worth it. There are all kinds of people trying to make a buck off of tourists by dressing as Disney and Marvel characters and demanding pictures. They get up in your face, too. It's quite bizarre. Also, can't forget the peeps just trying to make it and selling their latest debut album. I was over Hollywood within the first minutes. Sunset strip is wayyyyy more fun and offers much better shopping!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rocketqueen91
50,Cool to see the stars if that's your jam,"I loved taking photos with the stars, so it was lots of fun. I was there in the middle of a Friday and so wasn't too busy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/321nataliev
10,Not for the kids,Gross. Lots of those people dressed up as superheroes to take pics with who want money later. Lots of shady people trying to make a buck. Avoid this place if you have kids with you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pli876
50,Iconic Walk Of Fame,The walk fame is wonderful because it's has the names of anyone who is anyone. You get to see the names of your favorite celebrity and for me personally holds a message of you can reach for the stars if you work hard for it and if you get lucky of course. It's very inspiring,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rembertop2017
20,don't waste your time there!,"I went there during weekend time just for curiosity.to me it has been very disappointing, maybe because I had a very high expectation being this place promoted as an amazing boulevard all around the world.very boring experience. just worthy for taking couple of pictures with your preferred actor-star-awarded.if you do not have plenty of time to spend during we in L.A., I strongly suggest to enjoy different things",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ndujatuttalavita
30,Crowded!!,"The stars are fun enough to find as you walk along - but the Hollywood Blvd area is so packed with rappers pushing their CD's, people trying to get you on a bus tour and photo op characters that it is hard to enjoy. This is not the place for a leisurely stroll but a must see for first time visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/827joannac
50,Sweet Time,"Very nice attraction. The place has a huge variety of restaurants, shops and multiple places to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guide237227
40,"Long, touristy walk","While the Walk spans quite a distance, it is still something to be seen. Some of the names are from a bygone era but all people important to Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingRings
40,Cool!!!!,If you have never seen the walk of fame then it neat to see for the first time. Hollywood isn't what it's used to be at all!! People always trying to sell you stuff and hard just to look around. Homeless on every corner begging for money. I took my 16yr daughter and 17yrs son to see it for the first time. They did think it was cool to see and they did take several pic of people they liked. But we kept getting harassed by people trying to put stuff in your hands!! Something need to be done about that!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roberthT3130FP
20,Seedy and sad,Returned this weekend to meet someone and found the area of the walk of stars even seedier and sadder than I recalled. Better to keep the idea of this part of Hollywood in your mind.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelbeeSantaFe_NM
20,Very disappointing,"We visited expecting to see all the stars and the handprints. The only handprints are outside the Chinese theatre, the walk of fame was dirty and the stars needed cleaning. On top of this as it gets busier it attracts the 'crazy' side of LA, I didn't appreciate snakes and tarantula s being allowed on the sidewalk!!! 😱😱",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KRT1966
50,Movie Stars,"You will see most of Hollywood stars' signatures on the road. There are some exhibition around there. Nothing to say more. If you don't want to go there, doesn't matter I think.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/595erenc
30,Famous,"to be honest, I was expecting a bit more from Hollywood and the walk of fame. I dont know why, but I expected it to be more of an experience. The stars are literally just on the pavement, there is nothing special around them - they are just part of the floor! Was good to see them and im glad we went, but I wouldnt make a long trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidF222
40,Like movies- place to go,If you love your movie stars then this is the place to go and find their star and have a picture taken . There are apps to help you find the one you want. Went on a Sunday and it wasn't over busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeEMorris
40,Family vacation,So cool to see the stars but the constant harassing for tours and a lot if homeless people. Many areas smell bad. Something to do just to say you did it but not very clean. I would recommend you do your research ahead of time to locate the stars you want to see or you could be walking for hours and there's nobody willing to help.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M686CSbryans
30,Be Prepared for Anything!,"I enjoyed actually seeing the various stars of the famous singers and actors. Be prepared for heavy crowds on the weekends and the ever-present street performers and posers joining you on the crowed sidewalks! Not the greatest for small children, but the teenagers will love it!Go see the exhibit outside at the Wax Museum and get your picture taken in from of the Chinese Theater.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/581carlv
20,Not worth the trip,"It's just not what you wish it was. I've been here before and knew that, but came to show my in-laws who had never been. It's seedy. Soooo very much a typical tourist trap, and frankly, its sad really. I'm sure back In the ""hey-day"" it was a real place to be seen, but those days are loooong gone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juangC2999JT
40,Visiting LA is not without this walk,"Tell me if you can't find a star you like from the old to the new in the Hollywood walk of fame. I couldn't believe how long the walk was, more than I anticipated with stars everywhere of film, to, radio and theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KdofMelb
20,Graduation PW 2017,Fun but so dirty! People watching was fun...nice place to visit. Used the red line was priced right.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/honeyd876
40,Thousands of stars to look at,"We really liked the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and recognized most of the thousands of stars. I thought PINK would have one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandy_Salsa
10,Have to see it but it's awful,It's one of those must do's when visiting LA but we couldn't wait to get out of there. Seeing the walk of fame was interesting but it is overrun with gazillions of tourists and all number of weird folk dressed up as movie characters trying to pressure you into photographs with them and expecting you to pay for the privilege. I didn't feel safe there and was the worst part of our LA trip. It like I said it's a must do so get in and out as quickly as possible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/289hilarym
20,Dirty and crowded,There should be an updated map (or an app) to find the star of the artist you are fan of. Street vendors are annoying.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/733mariellah
20,Dull,"Do you have an interest in names written on the pavement/sidewalk? If so, this is heaven. For anyone else it's a bit dull, really. Every other name is unknown outside the US, and hundreds of others are blank. It's slightly more fascinating than watching paint dry but you could read the index of a movie star catalogue on the internet in more comfort almost anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joedK87ON
30,The touristy thing to do in Hollywood,"When one visits Los Angeles, it is almost mandatory to do the Hollywood walk of Fame along Hollywood Boulevard. It is mainly geared for tourists and every second store is a souvenir shop. Interesting to browse! We enjoyed the vibe in the street and after doing a slow walk down one side and up the other we ended up in Madame Tussauds - a place to have some fun posing with the wax models, most of which were incredibly life-like! The cement engravings with signatures of celebs were also interesting to see - except that the many folk there covered most of the ""writings"". Great to see the ""stars' "" stars on the pavements! Although I was not as blown-away as I thought I would be, I am certainly pleased to have been there and to have experienced the Hollywood walk of Fame which I found very entertaining!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61RobertaW
40,Busy street,Loved seeing all the stars names. But it was a very busy street with lots of street performers and photo ops with characters so hard to stop and look as much as you like!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer557589
40,Walk of Fame,Nice place to go. Many artist at the sidewalks and many interesting shops along the street. Nice to be there where most famous actors and singers were once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nymetin
40,Crowded but must see!,When we went there for the first time felt it is a bit overrated. Mainly because it's nothing but photo opportunity. Otherwise it's just a pavement with celebrity star signs on it. But it's surely a must see if you're in LA. We went on Memorial Day and it was so crowded,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThilankaA
10,What a dump,It is nothing like the Tv or the movies. It is dirty there are homeless and beggars everywhere. It is just a horrid place. I have walked it but won't be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chopprrrrreid
30,Typical tourist attraction,If you really like star worship then this would be fine place to visit. The area is really designed as a tourist attraction. The stars on the walk are really not that special. The flavor of the place is much like the old time square.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kyle_SD_308
50,Crowded,"It was crowded and so many people try to sell something but I don't blame them. It's fun to go there for a first timer like me, I dreamed of it when I was young and it finally came true.. All in all it was nice experience for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msfilipinatraveler
40,Hmmmm,I was really looking forward to this attraction as this is one of the main things Hollywood is famous for. The only thing I will say is dont go through the day. Most of the stars have that much splattered on them it just looks disgusting. At night you cant really see the splatters. It also goes on for miles so do other things along the way while you are walking like the wax museum or the other museum across the road. I wouldnt go back but glad I done it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/641natalieg
40,Fun,"I really enjoyed the Hollywood walk of fame. We stayed very close by, so we walked through it often. I noticed that the crowds get pretty over the top on the weekends. I found it to be cleaner than I'd expected. Lots of characters wander around hoping to be paid for photos with them, they add lots of colour. Be sure to ignore people offering anything ""free"". Great place for photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionak15
10,Avoid,Seedy and tacky. Area seems to be full of hustlers and pickpockets. Shops are overpriced tourist traps.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davec642
40,You know...,"It's that thing that you can't go to BH without do this walk, I liked it, its what we see on tv. Lots of people but you can walk easily",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rcoimbra
50,Cool!,"Great experience, lots of street actors and things to also see on the strip. Take some pictures.. the experience was great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toniat701
40,Walk of fame no more shame,"The Hollywood walk of fame and Hollywood in general was neglected until a few years ago, some one had the vision to invest and reinvent the whole area and it got back the lost glamour.Now it is a real pleasure to explore the walk of fame with its museums, cafes, restaurants and bars that have something for almost every taste, not to mention its fabulous night life !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luiscK759OZ
50,Good to see,Follow the walk of fame in both directions to see all the famous names.nice walk along the hall of fame to stop and take a picture of famous names.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/david1892
20,Full of strange people,Nice to see but get in and out fast. Not a place for families with strollers. Local wildlife very vocal and intimidating ie. Munster family especially. Shouldn't be allowed to roam freely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1417RKmichelleg
40,Cool!,I always wanted to see the walk of fame. This was cool! I recommend if you have the time. An iconic attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jpolston
30,Not what we expected,"Street performers and touts took away from the experience. Very very busy when we were there. Good to see, but unlikely to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/523traceyk
50,LA Staple,"The area was packed with people, but was a must see when I was in the LA area. It was great to see the famous stars on the sidewalk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilycK5060QF
40,"I enjoyed this, even though some of the stars were a little beaten up","Yes, it's crowded; it's LA. Yes, it's hard to park; it's LA. BUT STILL... it's still a long stretch of sidewalk with stars of our favorite stars! It's cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/femaleboxer
40,"Tacky crowded, and cheesy, yet still a must to visit in LA!","Few places would be so overcrowded, tacky and touristy as the Hollywood Walk of Fame (Rodeo Drive would probably beat it in cheesiness anyway!). Yet, this is one of those iconic places you simply have to see if you happen to be in LA. Don't mind the crazies, the weirdos, or the tourists swarming the place - go at your own place, look at the pavement (do NOT look at anybody around you), and you might (surprise, surprise!) actually have a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelGal_Munich
10,"Dirty, Unimpressive","Visited the walk of fame since it was my first visit to LA. It was not at all what I expected. The area is dirty and filled with homeless people. The stores and restaurants look awful. Even though it's interesting to wander the stars, I would skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redheaddragon
10,Skip it!,"There is not much interesting about seeing the names of famous people etched in concrete. On a recent weekend, was so crowded and loud that it felt unsafe to have children with us. Plus there was nothing to see or do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JSS88
40,Loved this spot,"Goes on forever and ever. Could have spent all day wandering up and down the streets looking at the stars. Only complaint is that the street ""vendors"" selling junk like fidget spinners park said junk/tables/etc atop the stars so sometimes it was hard too see them. This would only be a true problem if they were covering the star you particularly wanted to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventureamy1
30,Okay,The walk of fame was okay. Nothing too fancy. The stretch of the street has a fairly grimy feel to it. It's worth checking out but I wouldn't stay for too long. Don't expect anything special.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spikeminoda
10,Depressing,"We drove onto Hollywood Boulevard anticipating a star-studded leisurely walk down the Hollywood Walk of Fame. But as were looking for a place to park, the dirty streets and open use of drugs quickly changed our minds.I would not recommend ANYONE to take their small children or teenagers for a walk here, unless they're with a ministry team doing outreach. It's a sad place in need of Jesus. I will be praying for The Dream Center and other organizations that are serving the people of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mike_jonker
30,Worth a visit - but don't expect glitz!,"If your expecting glitz and glamour on Hollywood boulevard you'll be disappointed as it's actually a very grungy kinda dirty area. Some restaurants around but more tacky style, totally fine if you're expecting that! Had fun at Hooters and looking at all the names along the hall of fame. You probably need 20mins max to see the walk of fame. There are other nicer areas close by to stop for food - would recommend that for a good feed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfl26
40,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"In the last couple of decades, the city has cleaned up this part of town. There are fun spots to eat and drink and see a Hollywood version of Hollywood. The theaters are fun to visit and the stores can be fun for shoppers. I also recommend taking the subway to Universal City. The ride is only ten minutes and you will not have to pay high fees for parking a car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patricke638
40,More stars than the sky,"It's easy to get to on the subway and it's got iconic status so if you were thinking of making the trip, you will. There are plenty of tourist purchase shops full of key rings, spoon and tea towels to go with the costumed characters who are there for photo ops, they travel in groups and easily take over the foot path, but user friendly. There are a lot of stars so take walking shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benitosays
40,Walk of Fame,"While enjoyed the experience and can now say I have been there, I do think Hollywood Boulevard needs to be cleaned up a bit. A lot of the stars are cracked and dirty and you get harassed by the guys trying to give you a ""free CD"". I am glad I went, I did enjoy looking for my favourite stars. But considering the numbers of people going through every day, I think it could be presented a bit better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/96robyn
30,Blocks Of Stars,It is fun to see all the different stars lining the streets for blocks. The area is full of tacky touristy shops and lots of hucksters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancym616
20,Hollywood Walk of Kitsch,If I were a movie star I would ask LA authorities to remove my name from that place.It's a small zoo surrounded by kitsch.Such a waste of time being there ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R0Traveller
30,Not what I imagined...,Be prepared for the scent of pee in the air. This is where you would find people selling you tours. There is a lot of bars on the strip as well. All types of people selling stuff from grilled sausages to t-shirts. A lot of people in costume as well. It can get very crowded. I envisioned something more glamorous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rociog416
20,"Definition of tourist trap, not fun at all.","If no one has ever told you otherwise you would probably expect this to be an exciting, glamorous journey through the history and relics of the stars of Hollywood. We found otherwise. The entire street is littered with street hustlers, homeless, and irritating tour guides desperately trying to sell you overpriced tours. The streets felt kind of run down and dirty.. I would say thats about 60% of the experience. The rest is a grimey street of commercialized stores and shops setup to capitalize on tourist traffic. Half of them are the same stores you would see in any mall (Victoria's Secret, Starbucks, Nike, etc.), the other half are cheap kitschy souvenir shops selling mostly junk. Shop keepers and staff in the area were very rude and pushy overall. The area also feels a bit unsafe the further you walk from the center of it, and the later in the evening it gets.The highlights were seeing Graumans Chinese Theatre, which was actually pretty impressive up close, and fun to see the star's hands and feet imprinted in the cement. Also Madame Taussauds Wax Museum was a lot more fun than we expected (probably the best part of Hollywood blvd. which isn't saying much). The walk of fame wasn't all that exciting, but it was kind of neat to see all the names in the ground on the way.We were hoping to see something cool around the Jimmy Kimmel Live building (since they sometimes film segments outside), but found that there was absolutely nothing to see there. Not even a gift shop, or lobby area or anything. The building was completely closed off. Very disappointing (we also booked tickets over a month in advance, only to be put on a waiting list with no tickets on the day, oh well..)Honestly, unless you're a celebrity, Hollywood is a fantasy that you see on TV. The real thing is just a loud, commercialized mess in a rough area of town. Would not recommend unless you're a die-hard fan of the stars and absolutely must see Tom Hank's, or Marylin Monroe's hand prints no matter what. If you plan on going do a studio tour, or LA Bus Tour instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chade64
50,Walk of Fame,"I wouldn't bother unless you go REALLY early. Too many people around and you get pushed around in the crowds and hassled by the ""dress up stars"" who ask if you would like a picture taken then ask for money!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pclugston
10,Discusting,"I was told prior to visiting the Hollywood strip to not go with high expectations and I'm glad I was told so. We got there at about 7am and it a good time because the street didn't have a lot of people on it so we could really take our time and look but it was filthy! It was dirty, smelly, disappointing and just ewwww. I felt very unsafe and was glued to my partners hip! Someone had literally taken a dump on one of the stars and people had walked the poo everywhere! Never again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miss-Elizabeth-Anne
20,Do it to say you did it!,"My brother lives in Long Beach and warned me this would be a let-down and he was right. Hollywood is dirty and smelly...it has a cheaper feel than Vegas. We walked the ""Stars"" for about 45 minutes and then grabbed a movie. The movie was more fun and cleaner. I did walked the Walk and am happy I did but I won't go back, even if my travel buddy hasn't done it before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairesT5425RT
20,Totally Tourist Turf,"If you're star struck, walk the walk and take pictures. It's free. But, I just don't understand the attraction. You'll get hustled every step of the way by the tour barkers. In my opinion, they charge too much. You'll never get close to a celebrity's house anyway. The homes are, of course, gated and surrounded by privacy landscape. You can simply Google the celebrity's information for free. You don't need a tour. If you want to experience Hollywood like the locals, stop by Te'kila's for a shot and a happy hour snack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kl417g
50,Always exciting,It's always exciting to walk along the pavement and recognise various stars names and take your photo beside the star( a selfie). It's also good to see some of the stars footprints and handprints and see how small they are compared to your own,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anne255120
30,Not as expected,It's not how you imagine to be honest and characters harass you for pictures but it was the premier of pirates of the Caribbean and that was cool watching them set it up we actually hired a tour guide and went off out to Hollywood and Beverly Hills etc that was well worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlcreviews
40,WALK ON A STAR,"It is great fun waking the hall of fame, and seeing the names many you may have forgot about. That bring back memories. Go into the shops and find some hidden gems well worth doing when you are hear",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/981davej
40,Not what you'd expect,"It's worth a quick stop off during your LA trip - as it's the Hollywood walk of fame... However, you'll be surprised how 'un-Hollywood' it is when you're there. The sidewalk of stars goes on for miles past run down shops through dirty neighbourhoods so it's weird.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philparry1
30,Street Peddlers and Cos-play For Hire,"It really gives off a busy Las Vegas night feel, sans the smut peddlers... but everything else. The walk is kinda dirty and people trying to make money off tourists anyway they can. Try and go on a Weekday, this Saturday night was crazy packed so we left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ButchHogan
40,Mixed feelings,"Must to do when visiting Los Angeles. Lot of tourists ""spotting"" celebrities stars. Pedlers selling their cd's (who have cd player nowdays?) and whatever. Another end you find plenty of homeless and people with another social problems.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmikko
40,History,We enjoyed the Walk of Fame. My only complaint would be that someone needs to attend to the stars on a regular basis. A lot were very dirty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jetset114
40,Anything you Imagined,As long as you learn to ignore the peddlers and other performers. You should be fine. It helps if you Google first where your favorite star is so you can just go right down to it as the walk of fame can go for a few blocks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enriqueg974
40,Feel Light,May is a nice month to take this walk with small children. Super Heros and a few other characters roam the walk. Children can have photos taken for a few dollars with their favourite stars. Mac was having a party and we all had makeup done for free. Much fun with music and dance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/231romanas
30,Bit of a dump,"There was human faeces smeared across one of the stars from some rough sleepers and chunks out of others. You have to do the walk because it's so iconic, but prepare to be disappointed- it is not like the films!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/701harriete
30,Fancy and fun to look under your feet.,"It was weekend so crowded.

40,"Stars, walk of fame","We walked lots of this today. Was great to see, but some shops had chairs over then and lots of people.If your going to see them all, and want to see the shops, best do it a couple times.Is there am app for finding who you want to see ?? There should be.Lots of names i never heard of, but not taking away they have deserved the star, and well done to them. (Just dont know who they were)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul-n-Jodie
20,Disappointing,"I expected the walk of fame be a fantastic experience considering the hype you hear about it but I was really disappointed. The footpath was not well maintained, the area was crowded with characters wanting to have photos with you then demand money and the whole area was not that clean. It reminded me alot of Thailand actually....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tayl0u
40,Need some cleaning,"I was expecting something very different maybe my expectations were to high. This is a must see place anyway, be prepared to pay for parking, not a big deal. Most of the sidewalks are beautiful and clean but some of them are very dirty, you may find all kind of people from vampires that actually walk with bags full of blood, probably fake , and a lot of bums to aspiring stars. The stars are on both side of the street. Really is a must go place so you can see it for yourself but you don't plan to spend a lot of money in a family trip, is not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Futbolking
30,Iconic,"The Walk of Fame is iconic and I'm glad I saw it.If you plan on going to see the hand prints and footprints at the Chinese Theatre, you can get off at Hollywood/Highland Metro station and see both of these things in 30 minutes. This is what I did but it can get very busy and crowded.If you just want to see some of the Walk of Fame but want somewhere quieter, then I'd advise getting off at the Hollywood/Vine Metro stop.If you want to see a specific star, I'd recommend looking it up online and working your way around that. Alternatively you could walk the whole thing but it can get very hot so I'd recommend you bring some water with you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmflynn
30,Not what i expected,"I thought this walk was more glamorous. You can walk for blocks and blocks watching stars dedicated to the most famous Hollywood artists.

30,Wrong group,"Teenagers have little interest in the walk of fame. I was thrilled to measure my hand or foot to the stars impressions. They watched and waited. $15 to park to walk around for thirty minutes. It was a fail for us, because it didn't interest the kids or in fact my husband. I thought it was very cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/knoxvillelaura
30,Overrated,"Not that great, we stayed at the Roosevelt which is right out the front of it and to be honest I was completely unphased by it.

20,"Panhandlers, Pot and Public urination","Not much else to say. I've traveled the world, and walked through some 'sketchy areas', but when I arrived shortly after sunset at the Walk of Fame with my 21 year old daughter, I knew I wasn't staying long. We did a quick walk up and down the main block, then got in our car and left. We came back the next day during daylight hours and it was 'better', but I can promise I wouldn't return with anyone younger than 18. Unfortunately, this area has turned into a 'do whatever makes you feel good' area, with little if any law and order.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrchanute

50,Walk of Shame and Delight,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a ""must see"" stop for first time visitors to Los Angeles. Favorite sights along the way include the magnificent Pantages Theatre and the Chinese Theatre. Along the walk, look for favorite stars' names. Avoid feeling too much shame when you see the stars of people who probably should be removed due to their reprehensible behavior (Trump, Cosby). Other than that, enjoy the walk, give change to the panhandlers and street performers, pick up some Montezuma's revenge from a street taco and enjoy your day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halfordf

It was a sad experience for me knowing I will never get to even see the stars who are still living.Hollywood is a magical place in your mind and heart. As I walked the many blocks I felt a connection with just how special and magical a place this is. We grew up TV. It was so many stars associated with great people. What a remarkable way to honor someone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qualityexaminer
50,This is not the Holly wood that you dream of!,If you really want to go to Holly-weird. Please go with the right mind frame. What this means is please do not leave your street smarts at your room.

40,Iconic walk,"The stars walk is so well known that it seems mandatory when visiting Hollywood. It is crowded with tourists and street hustlers so you have to keep your wits about you, but you'll probably spot a name that brings back a memory or makes you want to take a photo. You can download an app or maps to help you find someone specific, but most people just wander about looking at stars. The walk is pretty long all told so wear comfortable shoes. You'll find plenty of shops and restaurants along the way. You'll need a restaurant if you need a bathroom. There are no public facilities available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindan708

40,Had to be done but not what we expected,"Okay, the Walk of Fame is something that has to be done if you are in the LA area but be prepared that it may not be what you expect. It wasn't that crowded when we visited but there were stretches that were not accessible. If there is a strategy for doing the walk, I don't know what it is - you had to be looking down constantly to happen to catch many of the stars. My 13-year old daughter only knew a fraction of the stars with stars so it wasn't as interesting for her but she insisted we did the entire walk - both sides of Hollywood Blvd, east and west. The most annoying thing was the independent artists trying to hand out CDs and practically chasing you down to give it to you, even when you respectfully decline. I get that they are trying to make it in a tough industry but we could have used a dozen or so less of them while we did the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drd302
30,Beware of scammers.,It's a neat place to see but don't expect to see Hollywood elites. Quite a few people trying to scam you or take advantage of tourists with a picture or something.

But if your schedule is tight, you may skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chris_rock88

There were people everywhere, it was hard to see the stars, it got boring real quick. I think largely to street hawkers who hang around this area looking to make a quick buck. There are people dressed in all sorts of film characters who hustle up and take photos next to you then demand money. There are people with birds that offer to let you hold them then demand money. Basically it's all done with a smile and an attitude like they are helping your experience but it's not that at all.

Dressed in military boots some of these groups would be quite intimidating and some of the things they were saying could be classified as ""hate speech""There were also people holding signs of aborted fetuses etc and screaming their religious beliefs. I found this to be interesting but not in line with what i expected from ""Hollywood"".There were also a lot of people begging for money and people who appeared to be homeless just sitting around the front of various restaurants.Absolutely no ""stars"" or famous people other than unknown ""rappers"" furiously trying to sell us their recordings ad getting aggressive when we refused.Overall i found the place rather intimidating and chaotic.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MagnusCanis

I envisioned it a little bit different, but I guess that's always true when expectations get high. The walk is not kept as clean as I expected, and there are performers and homeless people blocking some of the stars, which is kind of disrespectful in a way.

Be firm in what you will pay if a character takes your interest.The Chinese Theatre is a classic to visit but the street itself leaves a little to be desired. Visit with an open mind & you won't be disappointed. Still worth doing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smeaa
40,Free tourist attraction,Great to walk and see the stars. Fun and freeWalk was easy on flat sidewalk for all ages and abilities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leecin777
30,Nice to look at some stars,"Overall, it's not something I would spend hours doing, but walking a few blocks and seeing some stars was fun. Do keep your eyes open though as you stop to look or take pictures. Lots of people around, mostly seemed fine, but some a bit sketchy. Don't talk to the people dressed up unless you want to overspend for pics with them. Some spiderman looked decent, but some are really not even close to the characters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dudefamrob
40,Nice Saturday,Fun place to visit. Nice restaurants and people watching. A good place to spend a few hours. Lots to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kallie2011
30,Great Atmosphere,Lovely to walk about a little on the cheap side with some look alike looking nothing like felt intimidated at times the long lasting memory the overwhelming smell of cannabis being smoked.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Razor56
30,Very busy,"You know what you are getting into when you go here, it is very impressive but covered in tourists so if there is a way to make money people are doing it here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenSmith21
30,We were there so we looked.,The walk of Fame was literally outside our apartment door so we saw it every time we went outside. Fun to look for favourites - Jim Parsons star was outside my door - but so many unknowns it was a chore to find the truly famous sometimes. Some sections are falling apart and it goes on forever. Enjoyed it cos I was there but I wouldn't seek it out if in a hurry.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markgM7625IR
10,Do it only if you have time to spare and don't mind of disappointments,"This is the worst street in L.A., if you a tourist and you have limited time don't waste it here. You are only going to find homeless, tourists crowds, and stunts of superheroes asking for money. There is nothing iconic to see, except for the Chinese Teather and the hands of stars on the concret floor of the Chiness Theather. I used to live a couple of blocks from there, so I've been there many times to go to the movies or the gym,since there is nothing to do you will endup going to the mall that is, by the way, one of the worsts malls of L.A. Don't waste your money nor time thinking you will have a remarkable experience. If you are into Hollywood stars, then you could go to the Hollywood Wax Museum there. So maybe if your main goal is to go to the museum, and you book a tour into the Chinese Theather, and then after you could go to a movie in the Egyptian Theather just one block from there, that is one of the oldest theaters in L.A. from the1920's, then the trip could be worth it.You will see the two oldest movie theaters in L.A. and see the wax movie stars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdrianaJoh14
10,Not interesting,Not interesting. Nothing to see reallyNot interesting. Nothing to see reallyNot interesting. Nothing to see really,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/337shimis
30,Disappointing!,"We were looking forward to this and perhaps our expectations were too high. It was good to see the stars themselves,but the surroundings were so drab and dirty. There were several dirty empty shops along the first part of the route,which only picked up when it neared the Chinese Theatre. We were amused that a shop named ""Welcome to Los Angeles"" was empty and had brown paper over the windows!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susieb49
30,Not the glitz and glam you expect!,It's a must see when in the city but it's not the glamour you might be expecting! It's pretty dirty and lots of people asking you for money etc. It's worth going but I don't think it lives up to expectations!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gordejczuk90
50,An Eye Opening Experience,We visited the walk of fame with a group of high school students from Pennsylvania who were enjoying their senior trip. The students were awed by the names and different memorabilia that engulfs the area. There was a carnival type atmosphere with the street characters along with a display that was present for the premiere of KONG.The various theaters and shops offered an experience that will be remembered for a lifetime.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmZ1587EI
40,Famous Walk of Fame,"This is why you come to Hollywood. Enjoy the surroundings, look for the stars you love and snap some pictures. The area is extremely crowded, but honestly that should be expected. A must-see stop in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewsC7868UF
50,Only one of its kind,"Very vibrant place,the essence of Hollywood, nice to click pics with stars of our favourite actors and the dolby theatre and all the characters walking around with whom we can click pics,Marshall la la land for souvenirs, very entertaining and nice place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nirmalab2014

50,Fun,This is still one of the best places to go and get the Hollywood experience. I liked looking for my favorite stars or stars that would remind me of people I know. This is one of those attractions that is fun for everyone. A must visit when in Hollywood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franciscomorales
40,This is what Hollywood is all about.,Following the Walk of Fame is a must-see attraction for everyone that comes to Los Angeles. Enjoy the stars and the multitude of restaurants and other attractions along the route.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johndY2387BU
30,Busy Busy Place,"My impression was poor. Plan a short visit or none at all. ""Characters"" in front of Dolby Theatre begging you to take their picture for cash. Lots of pushing and shoving. Had to cross the street to get some peace. Not impressed at all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/992lindad
40,A must see if you are not a native,"I guess this is a wonderful spot for out of staters. I've not gone, because of tourists in mass and so many people. You wont see any starts, but a bunch of fakes in costume wanting your money. There is great history here and many great places to eat. Take it in, this is the real California here, you wont, be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N3059KImichaelf
40,Stars at your feet. Literally.,"They are there. The famous ones. The unknowns. Spike Jones caught my eye. And Dennis Hopper too. Big and small names. Empty ones even. Future stars still in the making. Spread across the boulevard. The eclectic regulars in front of The Chinese Theatre, each bidding for their moment of fame, like the stars beneath them. Some dead, others forgotten. People stepping over stars, going their way irregardless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/134tank
40,Fun,Fun to find your favourite 'star' and have a picture taken. Nothing more to add really except get a map if you are looking for someone in particular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenpX3280MW
40,Must see while in LA,"Of course you HAVE to come see the walk of fame while in LA! It's something everyone should experience...just be prepared that it's not as glamorous as it seems. It goes on for miles, and people are everywhere! You'll miss a lot of what's going on around you because you're focused looking at the ground trying to find a star you have to see. Do yourself a favor and get a map! They have them in a lot of the tourist stands, but the map will tell you exactly where to find the stars you're looking for! This will save a lot of time and allow you to enjoy the sights at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arwilbourn88
50,A bucketlist of mine,So excited to finally be there. Read a lot of the names of course there were lots I never heard of but us was fun to see the ones we specify wanted to see. Fun to find some that you were not expecting to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabykat7
30,Be prepared for a long walk,The walk of fame is spread over many blocks. If you are looking for a particular star of a specific person i suggest you google it before you go if you do not have too much time. The big souvenir shop near Madame Tussauds (Michael Jackson is here) is worth a walk around. If you want to do the whole walk you should allow a couple of hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mickster1967
10,Disappointing,"I totally disliked the place is not clean and full of beggars, there is nothing much to do there except for Madame Tussaud's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/914tarekk
50,Times Square Vibe (from the 50's) in LA,"Easy way to kill an hour or two people watching or doing things tourist do when visiting the Entertainment Capital of the world. Shopping, eating, or taking selfies in Hollywood is without a doubt Fun. Easy to get to, there is a Metro stop in the heart of the district. Lots of sights including the names of all your favorite star(s). No money needed unless you take your picture with Superman or Marilyn Monroe. Sidewalk artist will create an impression of you for a few $. The area is safe, clean, and secure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackE430
50,Nice,We loved it. The kids loved the stars and were excited to take pictures beside favorite stars. It was great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/p0nicec
30,Good but not great,It's something you have to see but it isn't as glamorous as you'd think. We stayed quite close to it and it was something I am happy I can say yes I've been there but I probably wouldn't go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreelyVivacious
20,Big let down,"As someone who loves films and stars etc I was super excited to see this but was really disappointed. It is dirty and full of really pushy people trying to sell you stuff and no matter how many times you say no just keep pushing! A lot of 'street performers' and a lot of the stars are run down. I'm glad I have ticked it off my bucket list but it has been a disappointing trip , not all it's made out to be! I wouldn't bother going if I knew what I know now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/203nicolaa
30,Sad neighbourhood,While it was great to see the names of stars and play 'find the star' we were very dissapointed at how dingy the centre of tinsel town is. choose your photos carefully to avoid showing beggars sleeping homeless and cracked pavements.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris_Haml
50,Characters galore - in and out of costume!,"Our family of six (ages 6 to 60-ish) had to stop as we were in the area. We figured we would just spend a few minutes and knock this off our bucket list, but we actually enjoyed it a lot and wish we would have planned more time here. Yes, it is touristy and a bit tacky. However, if you have anyone in your group that loves imagination and fun, this is a recommended stop.Parking is awful here, so know that up front. However, if you want to spend some time here, look around for the different options. I know I have seen a few different places mentioned if you just plan ahead. We just drove in and hoped for a spot that was not too expensive - not a good game plan.We thought we would hop out, look at the stars on the sidewalk, and hop back in our vehicle. However, we went at the time of day when the lights were just starting to come on and there were tons of people out in costume. I'm not sure if this is more so at night or not, but our boys' eyes just lit up and jumped from person to person along the way in amazement. You need to tip any of the people out in costume for a picture with them, which is fair. They usually only want a dollar or two, so it seemed like a great deal to us to see the smiles on the kids' faces. We did get some dirty looks from these performers when we were taking shots of the scenery and streets here when they thought we were just trying to take their pictures without paying, so be respectful and don't just take random shots. They are out here trying to earn a living too and don't appreciate ""free shots.""I think that if I had to plan a family trip to this area again knowing what I know now, I would have planned more time here. This is the people-watching jackpot for families with kids. We loved it and would highly recommend!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shawni_and_Buck
50,3 miles of famous names,Did not get chance to see all names but just amazing to be standing on Hollywood blvd where all these famous people have trod. A lovely few hours spent walking along the walk of fame not to be missed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonsV1677NU
10,Road trip ... two nights in Hollywood,Simply put... Hollywood is an overpriced DUMP!! Save your money and time and visit somewhere else. The best part of my roadtrip was leaving this nasty place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpg0628
30,Stumbled across it,Cos its iconic it can have sentimental value to some peeps. But really there are better things to see in LA. Sorry to all the fans that wanna take fotos..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiceylulu
50,Great place to see the stars literally!!!,"Ticked this off our bucket list and loved looking at the iconic landmark that is the Hollywood walk of fame.We parked close by and had dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe and it did not disappoint. Only try not to be too late out on Hollywood Boulevard as it can be quite dangerous especially with kids as we had.One tip is don't take photos with the people dressed up in costume. They are not there to have a good time, but are actually working and if you want a photo, it will cost you $$$.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royptravel
30,Was cool to see but was not great.,Streets are dirty and you constantly have people approaching you to sell stuff or to get you on their tours. Streets look a little rundown. This was cool to see but not a must see attraction in my opinion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZaraD117
10,Dump,"Paid $25 to park - left within an hour. Walk of Fame was dirty, trash piled up, homeless sat in groups on the pavement smoking pot, aggressive beggars - all in all just a horrid experience. Can't believe that the authorities haven't got their act together and cleaned this popular attraction up and made it safe for people to visit.Hell only knows how awful it must be when night time comes.....Big disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nosidawn
10,Dirty,Not the best part of LA most of the Stars run down and poorly kept strong smell of urine a really grotty area of this town,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hk252016
40,Stars,It was fun walking up and down the sidewalks. I don't know what happen but it wasn't crowded so we got to see all the stars we wanted to. Down side not very clean and a lot of homeless. We ate at Hard Rock and my food was decent and our waitress first night there and she was great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nascarcar88
50,Loved it,Hollywood holds my heart.I love a good tourist trap and Hollywood doesn't disappoint. Plenty to see and do and the stars make the walk fun and interesting.Will definitely be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tashagower
20,Check off bucket list-then RUN away,"Hollywood Walk of Fame is obviously a tourist destination, and if youve never been to Hollywood of course you will enjoy yourself finding Elvis Presley's star to take a selfie with, buy yourself and Oscar at a gift shop, etc etc etc. But trust me, after 10 minutes youll want to get the hell out of there. Not just because its crowded, but because it smells like piss, there are homeless people everywhere, and you get harassed by people wanting to sell their CDs and people dressed as characters trying to get you to pay for a picture with them. Its a dirty part of town and traffic is the worst.TIP: DO NOT get a hotel in Hollywood. Stay somewhere else, youll thank me later, the whole Hollywood deal gets old after a few hours and you can see everything in one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/schar108
20,Big let down,"The area and walk is so dirty amd poorly maintained , only clean around the theatre area. So many homeless and people trying to scam you. Only stayed in the area 2 hrs was so disappointed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markrR4810NY

50,Family VaCa from Detroit,The Hollywood walk of fame was exciting We caught the TMZ bus at the Hard Rock Cafe in Hollywood and all the stars )on the ground) were just steps away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/483lesm
30,Ten minutes is plenty!,"Not much to see here. The novelty of seeing the stars wears off very quickly! It's cool to see but the crowds and hustlers ""giving out"" cds just take the good away. Say no to the CDs! We saw a few of these people getting very aggressive with people who stopped when they were approached by them but were reluctant to give money that was demanded off them. It's quite cool at night and there are some good bars around. Otherwise, you're not missing much if you don't make it here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoMcD2014
20,A little disappointed,Always wanted to visit that place. I was disappointed. The place is dirty. A lot of stars are covered by homeless. The smell of weed is everywhere. There are some good performances though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minahanna112
40,Must do tourist attraction,"All visitor must visit the Hollywood walk of fame. Albeit a very crowded and not the cleanest of locations, it is right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the city. You can spend quite a time looking at the ground at all the star and names from past and present.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belindam421
20,Dirty,Expectation is a killer. Hollywood is a mixed bag with more cons than pros. Many living on the streets along with undesirables who dress up as various characters encourage photos then pressure for payment. Not unusual in other parts of the world but some just weren't good. DVDs being placed in one's hand was Patong Beach like.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ecilop55
30,Come here to see your favorite star in walk o fame,"Venture of the most famous walk in Hollywood Los Angeles.The shops may be nice, the crowds are plentiful and the streets may be dirty and filled with panhandlers and homeless but don't mind them and find your favorite celebrities and their stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bortonNYC
30,Nothing great,The Hollywood walk of Fame is a 2.5 mile stretch where there are tiles on the floor with the names of celebrities and goes all around the hollywood district. These are only by invite and therefore means you have arrived in the world of Hollywood. There is nothing more about it for common man to see... one shouldnt plan additional time for this walk but rather as they are going through the different buildings of hollywood see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901aayushk
40,It's a must see!,It's Hollywood so I wasn't surprised by all the crowds and strange people. We all enjoyed the walk but it was a long one! Stop by the Chinese theatre while you're there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReneaBk
30,Something you have to do,Fun to look for your favorite actors oe musicians. Very busy place though. There is not much to see there that the Walk of Fame so yeah ... take some pics and that's it !You will find a big shopping area there too where you can buy your L.A. Souvenirs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisedeSuisse
40,The place to see,"It is a nice place to visit. Many different attractions , restaurants and shows. Place is very busy, especially in evening. Lights, music, animators and food. So reccomended to visit if you are in Los Angelles. The city parking will cost you 20$ minimum (fyi).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elsultanov
30,Not on the top of my list,If you have never been to Hollywood before you should check out the WOF but I would not recommend spending much time as it is very trash and scary.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LebanonWarrior
30,A little underwhelming.,You have to go and see the walk of fame when in LA so we dutifully took the underground and got off at what can only be described as the less savoury end of the street. The stars are great to see but the area only became more appealing as we got closer to the Chinese theatre and the more touristy end of the street. Experience it but Hollywood isn't all its cracked up to be.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjfoodlover
30,a bit of history,I was quite impressed with Walk of Fame but found myself walking along looking down and missed shops .Had to retrace my steps to see shops,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisH7312
30,See it and get out quickly,"It is one of the attractions you always want to see in a touristy destination, but know it is going to be crowded, you are going too be chased by vendors, and it is not exactly how you see it on tv. So if you manage your expectations right, you will not be disappointed. We went there taking a metro, and experienced all the above from the first minute. But if you saying a firm no, they stop chasing - works the same everywhere. It was somewhat crowded on a Friday afternoon, but not so crowded like Oxford street in London. We were still able to walk and take some photos of the pavement stars and theatres around. Then we quickly got out of the area as there is nothing else to do there. I guess you can chill out in a shopping mall, but we didn't want to waste time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ikyselova
40,Interesting trip,"Saw plenty of interesting things, celebrity stars, famous buildings, some very strange people. We had a really enjoyable time and plan to return when we have longer to take in the sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcamp13
30,Goes on for miles,"This goes on for a long time in both directions from the Chinese Theater. It is more crowded, with more well known people, towards the theater. Walked about a mile away from it and there were lots of people I had never even heard of. Glad I've seen it, probably won't make any effort to see it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amysF6462VL
40,It's all Hollywood,We did a guided tour of the entire street.. So got to know about the history of the walk of fame as well.. I am. Not quite into it but would recommend for crazy movie buffs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siddhi261
40,Lots of big names. Lots of homeless,"Hollywood is an interesting place. Handprints in front of the chinese theatre. Home of the oscar. Walk of fame. If you can get past the crowds and the costumed people charging for pictures, then all you need is to step over a few homeless people to get a pic with Donald trumps star. Gene Autry has 5 stars in different categories. Its a busy tourist area worth a look during the day. You can set up a tour of the walk or a bus tour of hollywood in this area. But evening isnt the best time to be exploring the outer edges of the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinlA5161PL
40,Must do in Hollywood,"15 minutes of walking between the cinema stars, on the fancy Hollywood Blvd full of stores, souvenir shops, near Chinese Theatre and Dolby Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maria752013
10,It's a sidewalk,"That's literally it. Just a sidewalk. There was no glitz or glamour. Just people going about their day, walking on a sidewalk that happened to have people's names on it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcmemc
50,Quiet in the mornings,"Mornings are very quiet during this time.Today we went after 5pm and was so crowded!Just be aware of people trying to ""give you"" cd as they will try to rip you off!The same with people dressing up to take a picture with them is not Free! You need to pay so don't get surprise as we saw so many tourists getting surprised!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evelynm_12
20,Disappointed,"I had always wanted to visit this place and get clicked in front of my favorite celebrity star. i had expected it to be a very happening street but when i reached there, it turned out to be something different. The street was so dirty and looked like it haven't been cleaned since last many years. Though it was free of cost so we shouldn't expect much but at least people should give some respect to the celebrities whose names have been embedded on stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeepshikhaM7
10,Overrated,"Not worth the time or the effort. Basically a bunch of ""stars"" names on the sidewalk. Not worth my time, although some people seemed fascinated by the possibility of photographing these things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Antonius-Pax
30,Interesing piece of Americana,"If you're in the area, it's a nice walk and fun to see the names of favorite actors, singers, and other performers. Parts of the area are somewhat dirty and the stars extend for miles on several streets. If you're looking for a particular star, recommend looking it up so you know where to find it. I wouldn't recommend being in that part of town at night but it's free and a nice walk if the weather is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_Girrrrrl
30,Disappointment,After seeing this place many times in the movies and in the news and everyone was taking picture in that street I went there with a expectations but I ended up on the street where you can find some stars on the ground caring some names I could not find anything special in that street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abu_Fares_1983
10,Overrated.,"Would definitely say that this street is overrated. A lot of tourists and a lot of wired people, it's very crowded. We drove past it and that was enough for me. But I wasn't interested in taking a photo of a star anyway. It was a lot different than I thought. I thought it would be a little bit more fancy, but in some places it just felt like a freak show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeckaJohansson
50,Best vacation,Family spring break!!! One of the best vacation ever.Lot of fun and we will try go againSometime NX yr.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rinzinwangmo
20,Total let down,"I was expecting a glam, iconic street like on the tv but what I got was a run down, smelly, filthy street that had more homeless people pushing their belongings in shopping carts than I have ever seen anywhere:(. Your shoes actually get sticky, babbling junkies every 10 steps, very scary. I felt so intimidated just couldn't wait to get away from there. We ate at Hard Rock Cafe and visited hooters on Hollywood blvd which we really enjoyed, but while the shops and restaurants were fun and enjoyable, you still knew we had to go back out onto the street to get home and it filled me with dread! I would not be there after dark and would not return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KyloJen
40,It's free,"Nice afternoon walk. Parts are dirty but it was cool to see the stars & check it off the bucket list, and it's free to go walk around & take a picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luv2vacation0
10,So... what is this?,"Stars with names on a street is a ""tourist attraction""? Oh! Look! A star with the name of Michael Jackson! Let's take a picture!Is this a joke?Probably it's interesting to go when a person gets the star but it's a horrible street full of kitsch shops and people dressed up to get a picture.Don't waste your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GWOttawa

40,Fun,"Fun. You could spend all day finding your favorite ""stars"" if u wanted. Bought a couple of rap CDs from local artists for fun. Hilarious. Threw them in the trash, but all part of the experience. Took a few pics with the costumed characters. Logan/wolverine, spider man etc. Tip nicely please. Can take as long or short of a time as you want. Parking will cost you about $15 iirc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pnwtoc

40,fascinating,fascinating especially as the starts seem to stretch much further down the boulevard. Only down side certain starts get very busy with tourists taking photos . This causes somewhat of a traffic jam on the pavement lol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelinepp2013
30,Dont get too excited about this one,"You see and hear about the walk of fame in the media and in movies and imagine it to be a beautiful and amazing places and be star struck when you get here.Nothing could be further from the truth, Disappointing.Half the Stars are damaged, and there is filth, litter, and allsorts of stains all over the place, not the posh L.A. I was imaging,The Stars themselves go on for miles in total, they are everywhere, round all the streets and all over the place, - its true if you want the biggest names then go to the Chinese theatre.There are hundreds of weird names you've never even heard of and then all of a sudden you see a Big name.you end up walk round for ages with your head fixed down reading the names that long you bumped into things and get a soar neck.Go to the stars you want and then leave and as if you recognise 50 million people with a star each then the Magic is gone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Claretwayno
20,Walk of Shame,"Wow this is an almost seedy part of Hollywood Glamour everyone can do without. We made our way from The Grove Shopping Centre to here and the contrast was huge. The dogs being carried in handbags and prams at the Grove were certainly living a better life than the homeless people lined up on the Walk of Fame strip. Don't stay there past 7 at night when the street hustlers and performers come out to play. LA is a huge contradiction. Been there, never going back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucianam189
40,Expected more?,Don't know what I expected but I don't know. You should definitely go and look at those starts but except for that I don't find that there is a whole lot to do there. Still a must see in Hollywood!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdw452
30,Nice but better in daytime for young families,We walked the walk of fame in the evening and I would say there were a lot of panhandlers and people trying to sell you things. I wasn't extremely comfortable. I think that if you visited this site during the daytime it would be much more pleasant for anyone with young children.but overall it's definitely a spot you want to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sciandra33
30,I expected it to be better and more impressive.,A big boulevard with stars on the ground. And shops!It reminds me to Gran Via in Madrid but less beautiful and spectacular.For a one-day visit it's good...But not for staying here if you are not going to be buying stuff and clothes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saltaplayas
40,XMas With The Stars,Very pretty walk. Windows has many ornaments people were in the spirit of the season. A bit chilly but nice. The streets were clean,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alinajn2015
20,Lots of People,Be prepared for a lot of people standing and walking on the star that you want to take a picture of. There are also a bunch of homeless people along the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coryv406
50,This is a walking exhibit--and it is a long one.,"Both sides of the street have stars. And the stars run on for so many blocks. I want to say 10 blocks. It is probably not that many, but it will feel like it.My suggestion is to Google someone's star on the walk of fame if you hope to see a particular star. It is easy to start walking past some.I would also recommend arriving by subway. Parking is tough in this area and will cost a minimum of $5 and probably closer to $10-15. With the subway, you can get off at Hollywood Station and just start walking. The stars continue to La Brea going West. And I believe the stars go a block or two past Vine Street to the East.And finally--don't forget that Philip Marlowe's office in many of the Raymond Chandler stories is right there on Hollywood and Vine. This is a great walk. There are famous places to eat and great stops along the way. This is probably the second best place to buy Los Angeles souvenirs. Venice Beach might be the best T-Shirt place--but the shops on Hollywood have similar pricing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198ericy
30,Good to visit for 30 minutes,"It is a fun place, good to take some pictures with your favorite stars and that is it. I guess you can't go to L.A. and not visit the walk of fame. I would not advise to go and walk around at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310priscillab
50,Cool,Take a walk down the street finding your favorite celebritys hand prints. Take pictures and look around at what there's all to see. Very cool place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/76chelsees
40,A historical experience,"The Walk of Fame is history. Nowadays people just pay money to have a star, but seeing the old timers is memorable. Be very careful if backpacks, wallets, etc. High pickpocket area. Lots to see walking around. Musso and Frank's was one of those ' be seen here's places, among others in the area. These were the type of restaurants that had phones situated around the room so 'busy' people-many famous - could be called when away from the office.My recommendation is to try and arrange on a day that the Hollywood bowl has an event. Bring a jacket. Food to go and enjoy a picnic in a beautiful place. Can also see Mann 's Chinese theater to.Or , enjoy an event at the Pantagraph theater. Or, drinks on roof of W hotel. There is an old hotel across from Manns that is also neat. Or, go to Yamashiro or e en manicure castle.Metro train has 2 stops right there. Watch out for the costumed people on the walk.Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/activeB
30,Walk of Fame???,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame amazes me as people come from all over the world to walk on Terrazzo Fabrications that are described as ""historical"". Each star is located by latitude and longitude and is on (East -West)Hollywood Blvd from Gower to just about La Brea and (North-South) on Vine Street to Sunset. This construct keeps city engineers, inspectors and technicians busy managing silliness ad nauseum. There is nothing there but concrete, terrazzo and brass. I know I've worked there and re-placed the Walk of Fame on the East side of Vine Street. Enjoy, but do mark it off as ""been there, done that"". Nothing more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thealeh
30,Selfie with your favorite celebrity's star,"If you have a celebrity you love, go for a selfie with her/his star. It's worth a visit since you have lots of tourists spots in the area, Chinese Theater, Dolby Theater, Madame Tussauds, Ripleys, etc... on Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellistics
50,Amazing Hollywood,You cannot go back LA without visiting this iconic walk. If there is a particular star you want to take a photo of GOOGLE IT!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TassieGirl2702
30,Not worth the hype...,"all you see is names of celebrities on a floor... whats the big deal??? its not some medieval or modern architecture, neither a natural miracle... so why people are so fanatic about this place is beyond my understanding...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cartick
30,Gross but a must see when in Hollywood,The area was dirty and super touristy. Lots of vendors trying to sell their tours. Stay close to the Chinese theatre as it will be where the bigger stars are. It's a on time thing to see. Wouldn't go back but happy we went to see what it was about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyer655587
40,Has to be seen,"I loved the experience- completely different to what I imagined. Very cool personally seeing stuff that I had seen over the years on T.V.Reading other reviews yes parts of it are a dive- there are homeless, scammers, and characters in costume. Some places smell like urine.I googled the stars before we went so finding their location was easier, (there are over 2600 stars) as we only had 45 mins here on our tour. The guide warned us before leaving the bus we may be approached by ""emerging artists"" offering us cds to listen to their music- which comes at a cost, and once home the cd is usually blank. Also the dressed up characters (superman, chubacka, cat woman etc) also offer photos at a cost. Be warned, they can be persistent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/260raewynr

40,Has to be seen,Traveled from Ohio to see Britney Spears star! Definitely a lot longer of a walk than we thought it would be! We visited on a Thursday and it was crowded but not terribly so. Parking was about $30. Unfortunately when we visited the theater area with handprints was blocked off for some event so we couldn't get in but we will probably come back some day and swing back by to check that out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissKissy05

40,Adventure walk,"The walk of Fame is a long walk. The street is crowded and tough to walk as everyone wants to find their favorite celebrity stars and get themselves clicked. There are plenty of shops , eateries,cinema and a Chinese theater to visit. If one is not in hurry then this walk is great to stop and read all famous celebrity stars and enjoy yourself getting clicked next to them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mansi_Vij
40,A long ride but cool to ser,"I biked about 9 miles each way from downtown LA using a rental metro bike to see the walk. A long haul but cool way to see it, traversing low-income neighborhoods with strip malls, a Lithuanian heritage school and sections where every driveway houses a Mercedes or BMW. Passing Hollywood, Sunset and Santa Monica Boulevards as well as school kids on skateboards made me wonder if they have any clue that they are growing up amidst the stuff of pop culture! The Chinese theater and Hollywood stars were cool to see in person, even if you need to look past the Vegas-like circus of street performer super-heroes and Star Wars characters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philp600
30,Toursit trap but do it anyway,"As our uber driver put it ""get ready to be shaken down for $3 by dirty spider man"". This tourist trap is horrible. Go anyway. We oddly enjoyed it and as long as you anticipate the mixed bag of costume buskers, souvenir shops and tour buses they add to the experience. The walk itself is fun, couple of snaps with the name of your favourite star and move on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattr6284

20,More like Hollywood walk of shame!!,"Hollywood has been a place I have wanted to visit since Childhood, so on a recent trip to Las Vegas I hopped on a 50 min flight to LA.I must say what a disappointment it was not for the walk of fame or the famous Dolby theater or the magnificent view of the Hollywood sign but to the horrible stench of urine going for blocks and blocks absolutely disgusting. Not to mention the amount of homeless people on every corner.Truly a disappointment and this is coming from someone who is from NYC.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bragaman
40,"Good to see, but hard to navigate and area not great","The walk of fame is long and if your looking for a specific person/people definitely research it first as it will make life so much easier. The area is not the best, but I think that's just real Hollywood. Really pleased got to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dazleech
40,Worth seeing,"Overall good experience. You will be offered CDs and to take photos with superheroes like superman etc. These people will ask you for money and pressure you, mayne rightly so because they have offered you a product or service. Just politely and firmly say no thank you and keep walking. They are professional hustlers and will get over you if you're not firm. Take your time to look around amd take photos. Best to do air selfies with your face in the pic of the stars. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrendonF442
30,Walk,Walk was fine. Lots of people looking and a few homeless ones as well (they probably weren't looking at the wall of fame though!!),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoL607
30,Very different from what we had in mind.,On our last day of our SoCal trip lead us to Hollywood Walk of Fame. After parking at the Chinese theater we headed to the main Hollywood blvd. That area seemed pretty cool lots of shops and great spot to take a picture with the famous Hollywood sign. Once you walk away from this street block things become apparent that the homeless are everywhere. Not an issue usually until you see them littering and crowding the sidewalks to the point of causing walking hazard. Overall OK experience. Will not come back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/526gustavor

20,"Dirty, busy and generally unpleasant","The Walk of Fame is a must do in Hollywood but don't expect to enjoy the experience. The stretch of Hollywood Boulevard is lined with sex shops, the street, including the stars are dirty and there were lots of sketchy characters around. It gets slightly less seedy as you get closer to the Chinese Theatre, but then the Scientologists start to try to lure you in, there are countless people telling you you're going to hell and there are people in all kinds of costumes (Superman, Spider-Man etc.) trying to get you to part with your money for having a photo with them. I'm glad I went but I absolutely wouldn't bother returning if I ever go back to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K4719TRjillm

20,Hollywood Walk of Fame,Some things are just better left to the imagination. Its so much better and glamorous on TV and in the Movies than what it is in real life. Don't go out of your way to see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/APowell125
40,A Must See,"It had been a while since I had been to see the Stars on the Walk of Fame. We took our kids to see it. It was very busy. Lots of strange people milling around. Lots of people wanting us to go on tours. Some looked very shady. Our kiddos weren't very impressed with the Stars. They didn't know very many. They did like the Chinese Theater, people watching, and the cameras that were filming and interviewing people for some show. It is fun to see once but you never have to go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1445XEdebbiem
30,Part of the trip,"To be honest, the place is nice and as I mentioned in the title 'part of the trip' what I mean that if you are visiting Hollywood for the first time then it's a must to go there only once... the bad thing was people were annoying me they force you to take pic with them just to suck money out of you specially if they noticed your are a foreigner..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fadhel_Ali
40,Have to do it while here,"Part of our road trip took us through LA for a few days, and being with our friends who haven't been before, we laid on the sights that we had done previously. So this was the first stop! We would advise to go and park in the Highland and Hollywood shopping centre parking, as its only $1 for fifteen minutes, BUT... if you buy something In The shopping centre and get the to validate your car parking ticket, you get it for $2 regardless of how long you are there...Bargain! Anyway, the walk of fame is pretty good all in all, take your time and take the walk up one side and down the other seeing how many stars that you have liked are there. While we were there a star was being unveiled for Chris Pratt so we got to see a real star in the making, pretty kewl",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peppermint

50,Crazy place,Hollywoods walk of fame is a crazy place. Very busy. So many stars to visit. A lot going on so keep an eye on kids and girlfriends. Don't stop for pics with look alike unless you have money for tips. That's what they work for. Just saying.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steveb0029
30,A little overrated,"Once you have seen a few stars, you will quickly get bored.Don't plan to spend a lot of time here.If you happen t be passing by or are coming to the area for some other attractions, its nice enough to look at but it does not deserve to be an attraction in and of itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KosherAndGlutenFree
10,"Possibly the most dissapointing ""Attraction"" I have made the effort to visit.......","I suppose having travelled a fair bit and seen a fair bit one can get a bit snobby when it comes to attractions..... nothing compares to the Great Wall, the Taj and so on. However this stands as being crummy in its own right.We got off the tube (Metro - whatever) earlier than we intended as the announcemen stated one should get off here for the walk of fame. So we did. I'm not sure what we expected - but this was not it. If it was not for the actual stars in the pavement this would be a run down dirty street with no redeeming features. As it is it is a dirty tacky run down street - with potheads and weirdos attracted by the Kudos of the area.The American Military honour their own with a sense of honour and pomp. Holywood honours its own with a patch in the pavement where urine can dribble over between vagrant in a doorway and the drain.If there was ever an attracion and an area living off its reputation this is it.

You see some names that you may not recognize, then you can look them up and often you find out you know them too.There are also recording stars, radio stars, and live theater and performance stars.It's honestly a surreal experience and one that I think everyone should experience at least once. But I bet, like me, you'll realize right away that once is no where near enough.This is part of ""Hollywood"" and a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckG624

30,A Must Do Once,This was a must do to check your it off our list. The Boulevard is dirty and lined with cheap touristy stores. Be prepared to be offered a Hollywood tour every few feet. Parking on side street lots ran us $25. It's worth doing...once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Campbls
30,Hop on hop off tour,"We attended a hop on hop off tour on the red line? for Hollywood. We got off from our hotel pickup at the Chinese theatre. For the length of the walk of fame it was too much to see. There should be a list detailing the where abouts of the stars as did not get chance to see the ones I wanted, as over too many blocks, and my mum due to walking stick could not manage so much walking especially with the heat. It was a good experience to see all the sights, with people dressed up as stars, people touting there music CD's, as well as see all different tourist. I intend to go back and spend more time seeing the sights in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dash2167

Apart from the hustlers and people trying to sell tours to stars' homes, we even got asked to watch a Scientology video (it's only 20 minutes!!) No thanks, I'm on holiday...If you really need to tick it off the list then go, but in my opinion it's underwhelming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mry_33
30,Fascinating but needs a clean,Great fun spotting the names of your favourite stars although you will end up walking a fair distance to find some of them. Lots of characters dressed up as stars for photo opportunities and the expected crush around the Donald's star. I know they're only stars in the pavement but nevertheless its sad to see Fred Astaire's star covered in dirt. Park at the mall on Highland and Hollywood which also has distant views of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5cruffy
30,Walk of fame,So this is a must see if u come to LA. Just cause it's a famous place. There is nothing really to see other than the stars on the floor. You could get souvenirs there. There are lots of shops. But we went late and nite and the crowd was very bad!! There was a bad fight wth ppl on the street stopping traffic and the police had to come brake it up!!

We were looking for it when we realised that maybe we were already standing on them. We thought these were like the minor ones. It was disappointing. Over-rated and the area was very dire and dirty.

30,Fun Walk,We walked the Hollywood walk of fame at night so the pavement was very dirty and it was in your face the smell of marijuana as you walked along the path of stars. There were little camps of homeless people on corners with signage asking for money. The neon lights of the shops was good to see and made the walk a lot more fun.

The shops around the walk of fame were well priced for such a popular site. Came back that night to watch a movie at the TLC and begun to feel a little unsafe on the street my boyfriend told me to relax as it was fine but I still felt uneasy while there.

I only give it three stars because it was as expected and the homeless were pushy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L9622AZrichardr
30,Really busy and fun to do. Try seeing a movie here,The walk of fame is really cool and there are lots of other things to do here. I would recommend trying to see a movie as well when here. Local attractions are fun. Be aware the costumed characters expect to be paid if you get pictures with them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidcW7208ZC
50,Much better than I expected,"The walk of fame is well maintained, lots of attractions around but looking at the stars, the Chinese theater and the Dolby Theater should be good enough. Lots of people selling you stuff but did not feel harassed. Shopping for souvenirs in the area pretty easy and reasonable prices for a touristy spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adramca
50,must do!,This is a must do if you are a star seeker! Intersting to see and a clean walk! Always a few characters about to amuse you,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/75judys
40,"Busy Area, Loved it","We went to the Hollywood Walk of Fame twice...the first time was earlier in the day, around 9am, the sun was shining and it wasn't as busy so there was lots of opportunity to stop and take pictures of the different stars and check out the various businesses along the way. Casual tourist time we called it.The second time we went was late afternoon into early evening on a Saturday..it was definitely a different scene with hoards of people out and everyone trying to get your attention to take pictures with or sell something, protesters...If you like to people watch this was a great time. As it started getting darker the vibe was changing and we decided to call it an evening and get back to our hotel, safety first and this is a huge city with millions of people...we are happy to have enjoyed some of the craziness!! There is no chance of taking pictures of stars at this time or slowing down to read them so if that's what you want to do earlier in the day is better 😊👍",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenHatesWinter
50,Amazing,"This place is simply incredible, it was amazing to see the stars on the sidewalk and it goes on forever. People everywhere, this area was definitely a highlight for us....went back 3 times in our week here...be careful of people dishing out their cds though...you will very quickly lose $10-$20 because you cannot get away from them!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6CindyP
40,Lots of Fun!,We had lots of fun visiting the Walk of Fame! Definitely a must go if you are in LA! Engaging with people on the street was interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/438alizb
40,Amazing!,It is a wonderful place to visit in Hollywood you can experienceA little bit of L.A and you get to see a lot of Stores and MuseumsAnd a lot of people with great talent on the streetAnd I bet you can find some of the greatest and most Famous people's Stars on the walk of fame(street)And dont forget to check out the Chineese theather that is along the street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AriPadilla
10,The armpit of LA,"I worked in NYC Times Square in the 90's & comparably, this place is the pits. Sure you'll get to walk along and see the stars on Hollywood Blvd., most of them you won't recognize, and the Chinese theater is nice to look at. But this place is not worth being constantly accosted by pan handlers, homeless and addicts. It's absolutely no place to walk with your kids. The city really needs to clean this place up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alfbrand
20,Poor,Arrived by the Hollywood Mall and to be honest found it dirty and to be honest quite boring. I thought it would be kept impeccably with a good police presence but instead you had people trying to sell you CD's on the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonfenton
40,Good Place to Go,It was a good place to go. But I didn't find it that much crazy as I thought. It is over hyped. But surely you can go for once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pradeepkumarmm
30,Brace yourself before you go,"Super crowded, filled with creepy people. Plan on a short stop. Very expensive parking. But definitely worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kahan4
50,Really Good Value for What You Get,"The hostel is pretty clean. Very restricted breakfast but still... BREAKFAST! It was not as loud as I expected but that might have been because I was on the back of the hotel. The boys working front desk were really polite. The girl however looked kind of unhappy and bored being there (sorry no names remembered). The girls staying in my room were in bed early so that was a plus haha. They offer a hike to the Hollywood sign and I would have loved to do it if I was staying for longer. Also, there was supposed to be a game night but no people showed. So, I wend to bed too :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megitooo1992
50,Worth the visit,"This an iconic LA spot that is worth the visit given the city's unique relationship with the entertainment industry, movie stars, flashing lights, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herlitzd
40,Crowded but fun,The walk is very croweded but it is fun. Must watch for the street vendors/people as they will try to hand you stuff and suck you into their sales pitch. Just keep walking and say no thanks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/335alisont
40,No Hollywood No LA,No holiday/vacation in LA would be complete if you didn't go to the Hollywood walk of fame it's like a game trying to find celebrities you know in a big pool of celebrity names The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the streets were dirty and there were loads of drug shacks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CallumMcGrane
50,It takes hours and hours of hunting,"If you want to find your idols. Bring a list, or just get surprised of the names you can discover. We whiteness a star ceremony, it was so good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerOana
20,Nothing to write home about,"We visited LA and my wife was excited to see the famous ""walk of fame"" however we spent approx 2 hours trying to locate the famous landmark only to give up and get some dinner and head off to a bar for the evening , the next day we tried again and was amazed to literally stumble across them whilst looking for a Walgreens pharmacy , the stars literally just line random street as well as BH boulevard but loads of little side streets etc, however I have to say that as it is a normal street , there is gum and grime inc food remains etc on numerous ones so it was far from the glitz that we envisaged .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovethehoops67
30,You have seen it on tv,"Do I understand the attraction? Yes, vaguely. It is a list of names on a sidewalk. If you are a fan of celebrities to the point that you gush at seeing theirs names underfoot, you will enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1mtnseeker
50,A Dream Come True,"I absolutely enjoyed my time in Hollywood!!! There was so much to do. It was not necessary to prepay for tours. You could literally stay there all day. You could easily do lunch there. The morning that we visited, they were doing a quick portion of a film, it was so exciting!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kendita
50,Something cool to see,"The walk of fame was very cool to see in real life. Its always something i heard about, but never actually think i would see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kasey265
10,not really cool,"i'm very disappointed about this attraction, it's too crowded and it's not something really beautiful to see... i don't know clearly it's a place to go but just for a walk a few minutes !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/antonellar551
40,Good Walk of Fame,"Safe. The stars are over a couple of blocks. You get to see all the names, but it does need a good cleaning. Overall fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mariakvs
30,Star spotting on the Hollywood walk of fame,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame goes on for miles, however some of the areas the stars are in is pretty rough and you would be shocked at where these are located! it may look rough but you still feel safe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/488annemariec
40,My walk of fame,Until I visited last month I never realised it was so large. It went on so far. Supprised that Donald Trump has a star!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hps343
50,Some things are simply a requirement,"No visit to LA is complete without walking the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It's a trip though American entertainment history. A visit with celebrities we all have seen, heard, or read about. The Stars belong in our memories, made real by standing over the plaques. The famous Chinese theatre, the Hollywood and Highland shopping center, the site of the Oscars, and so much more are right here to enrich your experience of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reiserhof
40,Fun to see,"It was fun to see but don't go out of your way. It's an extremely busy street for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The sidewalk is congested with street performers, makeshift sidewalk vendors, people giving speeches, etc that it's nearly impossible to find a celebrity star you may be looking for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meghanab2003
40,Fun and nostalgic,It was great. Dirty and lots of homeless people spewed among the stars but overall just great because knowing all those artists had probably stood on their star at some point in their life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaniB206
40,Entertaining,I enjoyed my stroll down the Walk Of Fame. So much going on. Great place to people watch. I suggest touring the Chinese Theatre too. It was interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bnice2dogs
10,Family Visit,"This was a total waste of time in my mind!I'm not a star gazing person. If your in to the Hollywood scene then maybe it's for you!My wife and kids enjoyed it however, I would have rather been on a beach somewhere else!Parking was street parking and demanded I return in one hour to feed the meter.There was a police presence in the walk so we felt good about being there!We had a street artist draw a photo of my wife and I.... ha what a waste!Spend your time in LA doing something else!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yogi118
50,"Get a free ""Map of the Stars"" on the walk of fame","I have been to the Walk of Fame many times over the last 20 years: It is crowded and full of street performers near the Chinese Theater. I think that area is a ""must see"" at least once. The Chinese Theater has concrete footprints of famous people like R2-D2. Huge Jackman, The stars of ""Twight"" and older stars. It is worth seeing (always a crowd). Hollywood and Vine is about a mile East and is where the walk of fame started: lots of older stars and not crowded at all. IF you get a brochure that lists ALL the star locations, then you can drive/walk around the non crowded areas and take pictures near your favorite. Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Taylor and Kirk Douglas are all near Hollywood and Vine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmB9481WG
20,Fruit Loops galore,"So my wife wanted to see the Hollywood walk of fame and the Chinese theater. We paid $15.00 to park in a garage at the Kodiak center, not a bad price to pay considering where you are. The area was dirty and crowded full of tourists like us lol. I strongly recommend 1) go during the day time. It's not safe at night lots of homeless people everywhere and just plain nut jobs. 2) try not to look like your average tourist, you can see the wolves scouting people with purses and cameras. 3) guys put your wallet in the front pocket people are bumping into you constantly there and some are professional pick pockets. 4) there are some terrible looking costume people out there. If you take their picture they expect to be paid and will show out if you don't pay or pay them what they want. The hand/foot prints at the theater are worth going to see and i would recommend it if you are a hollywood buff like us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisnhso
30,Not what I expected,"This is just a street with the stars in the ground, neat to see some of the famous names but nothing really worth investing a ton of time on",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Apes44
10,Dirty street in a dirty city,Highly overrated. Overpriced. Did one of the star tours which I surprisingly enjoyed and only because the Hollywood hills are actually quite beautiful. Take a drive in the hills and don't bother with the walk of fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williec2016
40,Gotta do it!,"Looks a lot different in person! Shiny walks with the stars extending for what seems like miles, seedy back drop,with graffiti, homeless and costumed individuals trying to make a buck. Already crowded by 1000 on Sunday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdgipsy
50,Fun place,This is a very fun place. I recommend purchasing the three museum tour package which included Ripley's and Madamme Trousouse's. I am sorry I don't remember the third museum's name but they were all enjoyable. It was great to be able to walk amonth the stars in front of hte Chinese theater. We had a good time visiting this area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sungr8t
30,If you have too!,"This was kinda of a disappointment. Nothing like you see on tv or movies. The streets and sidewalks are not maintained at all. The shops on the streets and gross. We visited here on a Sunday, probably should have gone during he week. Either way, just not impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712JMLeb
20,Not what we expected,"Our kids, my husband and I wanted to do the walk of fame. Little did we know it would be the walk of harassment. Every 50 feet people wanting to sell you their CD's, poorly costumed individuals wanting you to take pictures and get tips. Homeless people everywhere and we had to avoid a fight between 2 guys.Definitely not a place to take the kids. I can only imagine the work that goes into getting the area Oscars ready!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeautyForAshes
30,Too crowded,"It's a lot of fun to see all the ""stars""' but too crowded for my taste. Good if you like to people watch. Hard to take a picture without people bumping into you. I guess it is something to see once, but do it early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuZQ234
30,Cool,Cool to do the walk of fame and follow the stars but if im honest was a little lost on my bf and i we didn't know who most of the stars were. Iconic part of LA so a must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C7982MGsarahh
40,A good stroll,It was fun to walk along and see famous people you knew and famous people that we knew. It was also fun to see names we didn't know and look them up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeG85
30,Just nasty,"Just a nasty place. Hard to find the ""stats"" on thw wall without a map. It's like being on a small Vegas Strip, without the neon lights. Dirtier than the Vegas Strip. It's only a ""must see"" thing because it's iconic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damonw730
20,Not very glamorous,Hollywood is pretty overrated. Very dirty. There's some cool bars in West Hollywood though.If you only have a few days there's probably other spots I'd see first,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Haykno
20,Tourist trap,"On a weekend this place is packed with people, buskers and tourists. It's a long stretch of pavement dotted with stars and celebrity names. The place is also lined with tourist souvenir and gift shops, and many celebrities lookalikes selling poses for photo op.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonsg74
10,sad,"so sad to believe this was the place to be at one pointrundown,filthy, smelly, junkies everywheredon't bother",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/509silverg
30,"Iconic landmark for tourists, famous names in a very busy tourist area","A very busy area of Hollywood served by tourist buses. Traffic manic too. Loads of tourists on the sidewalks. Lots of tourist shops and others. Worth going to see. Lots of star names in the sidewalk too many really, and on both sides of the road",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philipa845
30,It's not all that glamorous,"It's filthy, crowded, sketchy and not as breath taking as you see on TV. Go for the experience and to say you've been there, but I wouldn't go back. It was actually quite boring once the excitement wore off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lifeguardonduty
50,Love the Hollywood Walk,Everytime when we are in te area. We love to stop by and enjoy the evening walk even our boy who was 5-7 years old loves this place.. great place to eat.. enjoy music and meet friends,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noic2015
30,Not what you think,"Congested with tourist, but you would expect that. Peddlers. Parking is a disaster. If you want any kind of picture of someone dressed up as a star, its not free. They call it a ""donation"". Make sure you have plenty one dollar bills if you have kids that want their picture taken. To many people trying to make it big by congesting the walk ways singing, dancing and people wanting you to have a CD. (but it will cost you)I loved seeing the stars. What you see on tv makes it look very big and large. In person its small and overly crowded with wall to wall people. Many places to shop, eat and a place to walk up and see the Hollywood sign from very far away. Prices can be pricey, but its Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonyaa269
40,Interesting street performers,My 17 year old daughter did not care for all the street performers and people trying to give music CD's out. All the different people coming up to her and touching her made her feel uncomfortable. I had to constantly tell the music people no thank you. They are very persistent. Overall it was cool to see the Chinese Theatre and the sidewalk of the stars. We went on the TMZ Bus Tour which was very fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurabD1650WO
30,Dirty and crowded,"I was excited to visit this area & see the stars of my favorite celebrities but the area is so much uglier in person than in pictures. The streets are so dirty and the stars all need some better maintenance. It is also very crowded and just too many tourists! I would recommend to come here just to see it in person and check it off your bucket list, but it's definitely not what I expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yuliyafromohio
20,Walk of fame,Very touristy. Sure you should see this if it is your first time but otherwise stay away. There are lots of weirdos so keep your children in sight at all times and check your pockets it is a bit sketchy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brettploss
30,So busy you'd think the actual stars were present,"Does what it says on the tin. There are numerous stars' names on the pavement to see on this very long road. It gets very busy and you're likely in people's way when you try to take pics. Worse IMHO, there are numerous people trying to sell you a tour, dinner, a CD, which makes the experience quite unpleasant. That said, Hollywood Boulevard is longer than you think and the further you walk the quieter it gets and you can spot some more interesting if less obvious stars (Lassie!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VampyreNance
30,"Cool to see, but hard to see through all the tourists","I visited the Walk of Fame during the summer. Driving into the downtown area, I was expecting to be over come with tall buildings and stardom, but really all I saw was smog. Finding a parking spot was a complete nightmare as is driving in this area. There were hordes of people everywhere, making it nearly impossible to see/find the stars that you actually care about seeing. It's a famous spot, so of course, it was cool to be there. But I would suggest going very early in the day and in the winter when there are not as many people around. We were planning to stay here all day, but because of the crowds, we chose to leave early. Don't be afraid to stand your ground and take your time taking a picture of your favorite celebrities star...people can be very impatient and pushy here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ohb7
30,Underwhelming,We parked for an hour and that was enough. We probably expected too much. It's just a street with lots of tourist shops. Quite fun to spot names on the pavement but that's about it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q9020XHjamesr
40,Great fun,We enjoyed walking around looking for actors and actresses we had heard of and were in our generation. The walk goes on forever and some spots are sketchy and unsafe feeling. The area around the mall is clean and felt safe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dkboyer2000
50,Always worth a visit,"Visited with my wife and family, daughter 13yrs and Son 10yrs. This visit was at my daughters request and as slways the bussel of the the street and the range of stars honoured is amazingAlways worth a visit when in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelS068
30,Part Nostalgia Part Tourist Trap,"We did the Star Walk from Hollywood and Vine station all the way to the end monument and back again. While the sights like Capital Records and The Chinese Theatre where great to see and say ""Yeah, I did that"" the only part of the day the that soured our visit was constantly being asked if we wanted to take a tour and the scam artists handing cd's and dvd's then demanding cash. As we found out, the trick is to give it to you like its free and then quilt you into handing over a donation. Also, the Superman and Minney Mouse impersonators were rude and pushy.Besides that, the whole visit will take you at least a day if you take in other sights on Sunset as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dankelly029
50,Famous passage ...,"There are thousands of famous names on this road where you can find the names of all movie stars. Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Jackie Chan...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelusearth
30,Essential to see - but be warned that the area is very run down,"We saw this as part of a bus tour, and we were glad that we did. The stars are really fun, but the area is, frankly, awful.And what a shame - the Art Deco buildings that line the street are absolutely stunning. It's definitely worth looking up as well as down at the stars.We hope that in the future this area enjoys some regeneration and that the stunning architecture is brought back to its former glory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Munchkin208
50,Sight to see,"Be prepared to see all sorts of characters here 😀 we enjoyed a stroll up & down the boulevard looking at all the stars and seeing the sights, we encountered all sorts of people, there are lots of street entertainers some better than others be mindful of accepting anything, once it's in your hand they want ""tips"" (payment) just politely say no and move on. It's a great experience and not to be missed. We would recommend a visit 5⭐️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5385DAmichellet
50,Must see in Hollywood,Lots of fun finding favorite stars. If you are doing any Hollywood movie touring you must see these.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendyb282
20,Too busy..,Too busy and too touristy. Good luck on seeing the handprints at Grauman's. I had a hard time getting the pictures I wanted and wasn't impressed with all the goings on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/841marthac
20,Not so clean!,"The part of the strip with the walk of fame is not so clean. We did never understand why it is badly maintained.Go to Melrose, Beverly center and Rodeo Drive instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alextretton
30,Disappointed,"The walk itself is dirty, some of the name plates are poorly maintained and the whole place is just so busy you can't take your time to find your favourites. Add this to street performers who set up on top of some ""stars"" and the whole experience was truly underwhelming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lord_Brett_Sinclair
50,Fame and the famous,Great place to go for a stroll see some stars and meet nice people always ready to take pictures and have a laugh.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alexianova
30,Spring break,"Ok to visit once. Not impressed. Went to the Hollywood sign, there was no parking and is not even summer yet, walk of fame is ok. You have to buy a hot dog form the ladies in the street, they were good, make sure they don't charge more then $4 thats expensive as it is, but they are good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A4493PJbend
40,So many stars to see,"It was nice to walk with blvd, and see all of the names on the stars. Unfortunately, they are not well maintained. It is a sidewalk so it is not cleaned up very much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/424lynnr
50,Walk of Fame,"This was the highlight of our vaca, it was alot to see. It looks nice in the day time and very different people at night. Nice to see the stars on the sidewalk and take pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Escape702740
10,Really disappointed,"Visited the Hollywood walk of fame, and was really disappointed. The agents in front of Gruman's Chinese theater told us that they did not have a Lassie or Lucille Ball star. That Lucille Ball star was removed because of some controversy. They really did not know much about the Lassie star.When looking up later on the Internet I found They did have stars we felt we were blown off because all these people were trying to do is sell us something.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627herbe
50,So Much Fun!,This was a great experience! I loved being amongst the crowd and all of the hustle & bustle of tourism. It was so much fun spotting the stars of my favorite celebs. I took tons of pictures and immediately sent them to family & friends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamelah80
30,not bad if you have time,It's nothing spectacular. The area is not the most appealing but hollywood in general feels exciting. Not the first tings I'd recommend to see but if you can go then why not!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanimirc2014
20,Participation trophies,"It's fun to try and find names you recognize. But, in true California fashion, it seems like Hollywood is handing out ""participation trophies"" in the form of stars on the Walk of Fame. Good for those who've EARNED their place in history, but it's hard to imagine how so many thousands of these people are truly famous when most of the names are of people we've never heard of. Famous? Maybe for a short period in time, but does that equate to deserving a star? I think there's a secret social club one must belong to in order to get a star on ""The Walk"" rather than actually attain fame in the true sense of the word.Further, Hollywood is still a filthy part of Los Angeles. The glitz and glam is long gone. Hollywood Blvd. is overcrowded and full of con artists dressed in dirty, ill-fitting costumes (Spiderman, Batman, Darth Vader, Jedi Knights, etc., etc., etc.) trying to get you to take your ""free"" photo with them and then threaten you if you don't pay for the ""privilege"". Many loosely (self) entitled ""street performers"" have been arrested for accosting or assaulting tourists. Unless you know precisely where a star you want to see is located, it's best to view the Walk of Fame from the safety of a car along the tremendously congested streets of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doughH8241HE
20,Dirty and smelly,"Maybe we did expect more fabulousness, but it's just a sidewalk in a US metropolis: dirty and smelly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timgilbert09
40,Walking among the stars!,Taking a walk on this street and looking for the star of your favorite artist is definitely one fun thing to do in Los Angeles. You will also come across some fake Spiderman arguing with each other or Iron Man and Captain America who take coffee at Starbucks because they are on break which happened to us. If you are lucky maybe you'll come across some celebrities close to the Chinese or Dolby Theater or at least in the golden footsteps.Unfortunately there are many homeless people found on the street. It is the contrast between poverty and extreme wealth that will make you think.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelcooking
40,Hollywood,It was unfortate that we took our trip during the Spring break for Los Angeles. There was SO MANY PEOPLE we we're unable to talk pictures of the Stars or enjoy the history associated with The Walk of Fame. In the future I suggest to anyone wanting to that a vacation and to be able to enjoy all the sites of Hollywood to first check to see if you are visiting during any times that would increase the amount of people also there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tebrewer3
40,Interesting for many reasons,"The Walk of Fame is Iconic! One has to visit when in L.A., but be warned the eclectic group of participants in the West Hollywood area make staying close together in your pack an important part of being there. Our kids learned a bit of history on the old days of Hollywood as we went through the names, and were then beside themselves to see Ellen, The Beatles, Michael Jackson and Jennifer Anniston's stars, too. It is of course worth the time (free activity), as Hollywood is famous for this short walking tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CK251
50,Walking Tour!!!,Nice place in Los Angeles to visit. A walking tour with stars of Hollywood actors.Enjoyed a lot but less time to explore more. Evening time is awesome to visit this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanjeevMishra03
20,Sketchy,"The neighborhood is so filled with panhandlers that it is hard to even slow down and take pictures of your favorite ""stars""! There are so many people trying to get you to donate to their ""music career"" or to take a picture with you for money that it feels uncomfortable for families with kids. Still cool to see all the different names and stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bromcd
10,Not worth your time!,"This is literally a dirty several long blocks of street with stars on the ground with a famous person's name, and to make matters worse, we saw shady druggies and homeless all around it. Not worth your time.... and traffic was awful. We drove an hour from the beach, paid $25.00 to park and walked about 10 blocks looking at stars on the sidewalk. Stupid if you ask me! Look up a picture online and call it a day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnkll
40,Great place to walk around and spend time!,"This is happening place with huge list of shopping options about Los Angeles. Great to see all the stars around the walk. This is the prime location on downtown with few other attractions like wax museum, Dolby studio etc, must see place when you are in Los Angeles. I would suggest evening and should have good enough time to experience entire set",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srinipamzn
50,Walking around!!!,"When in LA you have to do the Walk of fame. I love walking here, so much to do and enjoy people watching. Going in and out of all the shops looking for souvenirs. It's beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raintreeflower
50,Walking Tour,Fun to walk around and see which celebrity stars you will find and who is next to each other and even take a picture with your favorites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynnette2014
30,Nice to see but very busy,(All adult family) when planning I originally thought that we would go down there and walk the whole walk and check out the Stars however it didn't work out that way. It is very busy and very packed just lots of areas where you can't see a lot of the Stars in general so we ended up just noticing them as we were in the neighborhood of things you wanted to do anyways I found the handprints and the footprints outside of that TLC theater more enjoyable than the actual Stars on the walk of Fame,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelpage82
30,Meh,"Well, I've finally checked out the Hollywood Walk of Fame and while I'm glad I've seen it in real life, I can say without a doubt that I don't need to again. The cool parts are seeing the Capitol Records building, and the old theaters. This area must have been something back in the day! One cool fact is that I didn't know people could have more then one star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauralo2017
50,Never know who you'll run into,"Hollywood stars, homeless people, the smell of pot & pee, being heckled by tour companies, and Freddy Krueger. These are a few of my favourite things at the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/product-of-canada
30,"Worth a look, just for being iconic","It's worth visiting when in town, it's iconic and what Hollywood (along with other places) is famous for.The Hollywood walk of fame has lots of celebrities names in pink stars set in concrete on Hollywood boulevard. That's it. It's fun. But the street itself is dirty, has nasty and cheap shops and entertainment, and has plenty of crazies too.It's fun, but no need to spend loads of time, can be done in a few minutes.But it's free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nomadlad
30,Do it Once and Be Done With It,"It's really not that exciting. My son and I got up and out early around 7am to beat the crowds. Turns out we could have waited until 9am and still had the streets pretty much to ourselves.I would recommend getting a free brochure from any of the local hotels (Hilton Garden Inn on Highland offered them) that gives you the names and addresses of all the celebrities that have stars. Highlight the ones you're interested in seeing and group them by block addresses.We walked the entire line from the Chinese Theatre to the Capitol Records building and back in about one hour. Had no trouble locating the stars I was looking for. What's sad is that the condition of each star differs wildly. Arnold's star was shiny and bright while Stallone's (just a few feet away) look weathered down and almost unreadable. Once I located the star for Chuck Norris I called it ""mission accomplished"" and moved on to more exciting activities.As other's have mentioned, their are plenty of homeless on the streets but they never bothered us once for change. I was surprised. The condition of the strip differs wildly too. Closer to the Chinese theatre and Capitol Records building and it's rather nice. In between though, there are shuttered and gutted out buildings, strip clubs and tattoo parlors.One thing I did find interesting is the art on some of the security garage doors that are pulled down over the store fronts over night. Walking the strip so early we were treated to some really nice celebrity artwork. More interesting than the stars on the sidewalk. As you get closer to the Capitol Records building, the north side of the street had one of a close up of Indiana Jones. Very impressive work. Another building had Spock and Kirk on individual doors, while the side of the building had a very large painted Enterprise and the rest of the crew. Others had James Dean, Charlie Chaplin and George and Gracie Burns. All the art appeared very life like and professionally drawn, possibly by the same artist.In any case, everyone will want to say they've walked the strip and they should. But once you've done it once, the stars on the ground become boring really quick. I would recommend going early in the morning. I saw crews hosing down the sidewalks and that helped in cleaning off some of the stars before the crowds dirty them up again with their feet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redmonder
40,Hollywood stars at your footstep 😜,Well this place is awesome as we all have seen it at some movie or sitcom or magazine. So if you go there you tend to already relate to it. U keep on looking for your favourite stars and good place to get pictures clicked,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/779sugandhak
20,Grubby area full of grubby scammers,"What a dump! The Chinese Theater apart which can choose what happens on its premises, the whole street is swarming with grubby characters trying to rip off tourists. Thanks to the total lack of police, the scammers no doubt succeed. To tick it off the list you have to go, but talk to nobody, ignore all weirdos trying to give you stuff ""for free"", and head out when you're done to the classy parts of town. Hollywood Blvd is borderline ghetto full of tacky shops, dive bars, and criminals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZokaShiz
50,A must visit place in the early evening,It was a treat to visit this place. I liked it so much that I made it a point to visit it twice in my short trip to LA. The characters dressed as celebs will let your click pictures with them for a $1 fee and will help you with some information of nearby places as generosity. But if you click a picture with them and do not pay the fee then they are your worst nightmare so be careful. It is very busy and crowded street with lot of attraction. You just need to have time in your pocket and it is worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pranilbonagir
50,Walk the boulevard!,Fun facts - really this is why this town is so special! The walk of fame is a blast from the past and tons of fun!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel672478
30,Hollywood Blvd,Not what we where expecting. Lots of homeless people on the strip. Lots of drugs being done on the street. Stores have general crap you see everywhere. Over priced for my liking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hobopiez
50,Seeing stars,"A trip to Hollywood would not be complete without a walk down the walk of fame. Find your favorite stars and check out the hand prints, foot prints and more by the theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arboje
30,Really hot to walk strip,"Took a few pictures of the walk of fame, was really hot during the day, seen some interesting names, and lots of interesting people on the Hollywood strip here. Seen Edward Scissor Hands he was awesome, gave us a make believe haircut, lots of dressed up entertainers here for picture taking 😆",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mickeymousemobile
40,Touristy place but a MUST GO!,How can you come to LA and not visit the Hollywood walk of fame? :)We came here after a long day at the California Science Centre just to soak in the atmosphere. Had fun looking high and low for some of our favourite stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ho-taylorfan-sg
40,get creative with this,"just walking down and saying oooo the stars - gets a bit boring after a while -Make it fun - search for your Heroes/inspirers and then do some cool photos - take some videos, add some music - hey its Hollywood - bring it alive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaunx10
10,Scammer city,"The walk of fame is filthy. It is filled with tons of people trying to make a buck and is overly crowded, I did not feel save carrying a purse around there. Would not recommend, especially if you have children!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alif61
20,Walk of shame,"The Hollywood walk of fame is one of the most disappointing tourist destinations in Los Angeles. Hollywood Blvd is dirty, covered with homeless people and trash, and smells like pee. Tourists lay on the ground to take their photo with the star of their choice. I never understood this need to lay on the dirty, cockroach infested streets of Hollywood. Go to the Hollywood Farmers market on Sunday morning, check out a couple stars, enjoy the fresh flowers and produce at the market, and you won't be disappointed. Going to the walk of fame specifically to see the stars is a recipe for disillusionment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/genevrav
40,Not as exciting as you think,"Visited the walk of fame because when in LA, you stop by the wall of fame. But it's actually not very exciting. The general area is quite dirty. Maybe it's all more exciting when they're actually putting a star in... but walked up and down, took some photos of some of my fav actors and that was about it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Slavik84
40,A walk through entertainment history - in need of some maintenance,"This past weekend we walked on Hollywood Boulevard on the ""walk of fame."" Although we were very impressed with the collection of famous names displayed there, we couldn't help but notice that the area was not well maintained. If Hollywood is so proud of its people and its heritage, it should display a greater commitment to maintaining this attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonaleenA
50,Walk of fame,"So much to do and see, lots of shops from food to entertainment that a full day is needed just to enjoy and see most of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JD1103
10,Wouldn't bother,"Went to see the stars in Hollywood and turned out to be a very scummy dangerous area. There were homeless people everywhere and even saw a fight between two homeless people. Went into two different stores, one was a mini market and the other was to buy gifts for my family back home, turned out both stores had had thefts come in and steal their things. We left after 30mins. Wouldn't waste my time there again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yaz734
50,Fun place to visit,"We take company there whenever we have visitors. Costumed characters are everywhere but be advised if you take a picture with them, you MUST give them money. Watch your children carefully. Fun place to go to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickiwinthrop
30,All that glitters....,"What to say about this, this is one of those sites that is so so well known, you seem to have always known about it since birth. However, much like many of those things that are in the collective consciousness, there is a dark side too, and more than you can possibly know (just like Abba).Firstly there are more than 2600 stars, and they start way down in Hollywood, away from the glitch and glamour. They start in the dirty part of town, the non-tinsel bit if you will. The second and most astonishing thing about the walk is what I’ve lovingly termed the “Dunno, dunno, dunno ooooo Tinkerbell” walk.The walk happens thus, you get off the metro and see your first star, you’re filled with excitement and glee, and a realisation you are in one of those few places on earth that really are globally famous and thus special. You wander up to your first star and you see a name, you take a photo, not really sure who the name is but excited none the less.You see a few more stars and have no clue who they are either. You realise the sidewalk is as bad as it is back home and some of the stars are scratched and broken. You keep walking, falling into a mini despair desperate to find a star to take a photo of and post on insta or Facebook. You continue along, dunno, dunno, dunno…oh, I know that one!!!!Sadly that is the walk of fame away from the centre of Hollywood, lots of broken stars, with names of people you don’t know.It’s when you get closer to the centre that it starts to bring that magic back, and you start to spot not just stars names, but actually superstars, the names that have lived for decades and will forever. The likes of Walt Disney pass under your feet. That’s where the magic happens, and you can for a time believe that this place is still magic.Go, but go straight to the centre, don’t walk the whole walk, it’s long and a bit depressing.While your there, buy yourself an Oscar statue (mine says best me) but note prices vary the further away from the Chinese theatre you get.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tengoldrings
40,Great,Great walk. Make sure to ask for the guide or printout of the location of all the stars. This way you can look for the ones you like. Make sure to find the placement of the star for Muhammad Ali - not on the walkway but on the wall. Very cool!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guest-reviewer2016
40,So many stars,"All the favourites are easily seen as you walk along the walk of fame.Stroll one block or many, up to you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rwe003
50,Busy place,"We came at a very busy time with rallies and protests going on. It's a great place to see one time in your life and then after that, go somewhere to enjoy the state's natural beauty. In addition to the stars, you'll find costumed ""street performers"" who will pose for a tip, an upscale mall, TCL Theater (originally Grauman's), El Capitan Theater (Jimmy Kimmel is filmed there), and a plethora of restaurants and souvenir shops. Smelled a lot of smoke (and it wasn't cigarettes) so use discretion if going with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kloverfield
10,Very small area of speak to the very star-struck,"My visit was part of a day tour. I hadn't realised how small this area is. Best bit was opportunity to take the obligatory photo of the Hollywood sign and to oblige the Falun Gong protester outside Grauman's Chinese theatre, with a photo.Watch out for scammers with CDs; people in character costume- wanting money unpleasantly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/713marilynf

10,Too many people wanting money!,"All it is is people grabbing at you and getting in your face wanting to give you there 'mixed tape- cause they'll be the next big thing', pushing crowds and people asking for money. Sadly- I couldnt wait to get out of the there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayleesmith2774
30,Old Prints the Best,I had never been and was excited to see names and footprints of some old stars. It was raining so not as crowded as it could have been. Would be a much better experience without vendors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel248957
10,It's dirty and very run down,"I was shocked, we went to Hollywood blvd. the stars in the sidewalk were what we expected, but what we did not expect was the area. It is very run down and uncomfortable. Every few paces you are stopped by men trying to sell you something..very intimidating..the shops were rubbish and very sleazy....We visited the world famous Chinese theatre.. again very run down. We did visit the theatre for an IMAX film, that was very good.We were pleased to leave the area....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claasman
50,Here I am,My home away from home! This plave is the most socially extreme place in the world! It has people of all walks of life from the best of the best to the worst of the worst. Definitely a bucket list place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/436stug
30,Fun to see but parts of Hollywood are sketchy,A fun walk for sure but parts of Hollywood are a little seedy and sketchy. Worth it to see it but just be careful if going out too late at night to the more remote areas. We enjoyed it but were a little surprised at how seedy parts were.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittrtan
20,Disappointed,"Although this is a must do on any travellers list, prepare for a let down unfortunately.The many stars lining the walk of fame are dirty and unkept - some covered in trash. Also a popular stop for beggars asking tourists for money.Worth a quick walk around to find your favourite celebrity but not a highlight of my trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjj87
40,Fun despite the weather..,"We paid $10 for the day to park, we walked all of the area, there are allot of good shops to go in and see along the walkway it would be nice maybe to have a map, we took a walking break a Pie Hole a must visit ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/contreras1965

10,Poor location,This location is not what you would have pictured in your mind. It is a run down area in a poor location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coconut_Monkey
20,Disappointment,I was looking forward to seeing the stars but it was dirty and peddlers and homeless people all over this area. We walked a few blocks and decided to be done with it. Recommend looking at website to find specific stars you're hoping to see before you get there. Google maps takes you to a side street too. Not the actual Hollywood blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelleyj812

10,Not a good place,"Seeing the stars themselves was interesting but the streets and walks are filthy. People trying to scam you for money, lots of homeless people. They even try to get your kids involved by dressing up in Mickey Mouse outfits (and other characters) wanting money for a picture. It really is a sad place. Find something else to do in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaylovesthebeach
30,Good for daytime. Avoid after dark,"Cool place to see during the day. However lots of people hustling for tours, change, typical tourist stuff etc. After dark a lot of interesting people come out and not so much of a tourist area after hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/retsekud
50,Must have on your Tourist list,Los Angeles without a visit to the Walk of Fame isn't right. Walking on Hollywood Blvd up and down and taking pictures of or with the Stars on the Walk of Fame should be on your to do list. I would keep away from all the people who want to sell something like CD's or tours to the Hollywood hills. Book those tours in advance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthew0188
40,A tick for LA visit,Any visit to LA should include the walk. It is free & easily consumes a few hours. Planning my trip a visit here was to be one of the highlights. Maybe I knew too much in advance but I did not get WOW factor I thought I would. Regardless fun to look for stars you like & spot names of others that you have heard of.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D9466YLkimm
50,You gotta do this...,"This is mandatory, although I didn't expect it to be so dumpy. You won't want to touch or sit on the ground by any of the stars because the street is so dirty and covered in trash and homeless people or Scientologists will be bothering you on Hollywood Boulevard, but it's all part of the experience. I didn't realize that celebrities pay for their star which kind of takes the fun out of it all for me. Lots of good attractions on the way to this and look at the crosswalks that look like film rolls!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittanyzz
20,Disappointing and tatty,Been here before and continue to find this place underwhelming! stars are interesting but street is full of tatty gift shops and some rough characters hanging about - not the amazing glamourising place that's portrayed on the TV.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoThackray
40,Great place,As we reached Los Angeles at night and the next day we had to travel to San Diago. After checking in in hotel we got out for dinner and to our surprise our hotel was just near near the walk of fame street so we walked on it. There were few people some homeless also in street. We had our dinner with vegetable pizza. Walked on the road and saw names of some of the big giants of Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ISRAR1870
40,Good way to spend an hour,"On a recent trip to LA, my wife and I went to Hollywood and took in the ""Walk Of Fame"".

It is obviously free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159GaryS
20,Disappointing,"My advice see the stars and then leave. We sat on the hop on hop off bus waiting to leave for about 30 mins in this time we saw 3 men and a woman shoving Cd's at people trying to get them to buy them they got a lot of people to pay (yes even children), creepy spider-man following people up the street, 2 homeless men punching each other up over drugs and one man digging in the bin and drinking an old coffee and then spewed it up everywhere. It's a sad place, so many better places to see in LA. Will happily never return to this place... not for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieRJ88
30,Who are these people?,"The stars were plentiful, but we didn't know 75% of the names. There were bums sleeping everywhere which was nasty. Hollywood is not what it used to be...Save yourself a favor and do something else. The Grove was cool and Farmers market just south of CBS studios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timothyt88
20,Have always wanted to see this....kind of disappointing,"I was excited to take my family and look for the Stars. It was neat to see them, but disappointing that vendors set up around the stars and make it impossible to enjoy looking for stars. There are numerous tour services that want you to purchase a tour with them. We got tired of saying no and just ignored many of them. Really got our Hollywood culture on with tour guides trying to sell us, people dressed up in costumes and when you go take a photo with them they want $$ and homeless digging in trash cans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mn_momx3
30,Think Vegas Strip without Casinos or Hotels,"This is fun street to look for your favorite stars on the sidewalk, but it is crowded with local people trying to sell you tours, invite you to their adult bars, or get you to take a photo of them dressed in costumes. It is also unkept and dirty, not to mention the conditions can get worse the further you walk away from the main tourist area. We've been here many times now and it does not seem to improve. We do take our children with us each time, and they make the most of it by looking for famous characters which is the highlight of our visit; watching them hunt around and finding stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnYourMarkTravel
20,Searched and found Chuck Berry's Star,"After seeing star-unveiling events on television news for years, I was disappointed to find a series of long dirty sidewalks full of unknown names imbedded in the sidewalk stars.

50,Hollywood Hit,"I was able to crossed off my bucket list finally on our way to another destination, my wife and I along with another couple friends of ours. I love to people watch and the Hollywood Walf of Fame is one of the best place to be. You see ample of people from all over the world and walks of life. Great spot to be at and check out the Walk of Fame and get to stand ontop of many Hollywood fames.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanplee6
40,interesting,we took a sightseeing tour and stopped here there is a lot of interest ... to see your favorite celebrity honoured by these stars is very interesting i guess it's the walk of fame,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerrym59c13
30,Expect crowds and trash,"It seems that this icon of American culture would be more glamorous. Alas, time has taken its toll & it is run down & over populated with sleepy characters.

10,Disappointing,"I remember when I first moved to LA in 2014, a friend drove past and pointed it out. To say it was disappointing was an understatement- I hate tourist places for starters but this is so underwhelming it's shocking! Don't bother.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ohsophie
40,Interesting,"Lots of cool and interesting people and tons of things to do and places to eat at, but I didn't like seeing the people who were promoting DEVIL WORSHIPPING, but I guess THATS HOLLYWOOD. THANK GOD there was someone on the opposite side of the street preaching THE GOSPEL!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reesees
40,A little cheesy but worth a visit.....,"Surrounded by a sketchy neighborhood, this area has seen better days while still being fascinating if you've got a few years and a memory for films!Getting additional info is easy with a smartphone and it's worth learning about the stars. Afternoon visits have a different vibe than the evening and family's should keep that in mind.Cheesy, but hey, you're in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chicagonative_7
40,Tacky but fun.,"Busy and bustling, wander along looking at the star signs and shops. Manns Chinese theatre is worth a brief visit.You can stroll the walk of fame in around 30 mins.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trevorkmcc2020
40,Spring break trip,"We all loved looking at stars and finding the stars names we knew, looking at the stars hand & foot prints and the people on the streets!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denab899
30,Both Fun & Sad to See,"We were excited to see these ""stars"" in person. Yet disappointed in how dirty they were. It's a busy sidewalk - so it's tough - I get it...just a bummer. Overflowing garbage cans and litter scattered about. A little more care would be nice. We still had fun looking for our favorites and catching a few pictures. We found free street parking a few blocks away. Our less than an hour here would not have been worth the $15 pay lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/825dianep
30,It's was ok not great,Went here as part of a tour. Lots of pan handlers in costume and pretending to sell music. The stars themselves are ok. It was nice to see the Kimmel building and Dolby theatre. Either than that just a typical tourist trap full of aggressive street people.Side note: there were people there that seemed really excited to be there. If you are one of those people don't let this review discourage you from going.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DKeezer
40,One time is enough,Lots of hype and strange characters dressed up. It's fun to see the different sights strolling along the Boulevard and get your picture taken with your favourite star in the sidewalk. Visit the stores and get a souvenir... $5 store is the best for that. Be prepared for lots of people...it's a tourist attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baink1
50,Fun searching you fav star!,It's busy street but I don't care about the people. I keep looking the names of my favorites stars. It's fun doing it. And the good one is it's free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691MaryA691
10,Not worth it,"Although it was nice to see some names, the neighborhood was sketchy and the street crowded. Would not recommend with kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieV673
10,Sketchy!,We tried to visit this at night and during the day. It's absolutely inappropriate for children in my opinion. There were people half naked acting a fool. The stars are filthy with panhandlers set up next to the most popular making it impossible to take pictures without being harassed. I was disappointed by the whole experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Callielyn83
40,Fun to visit,Busy street but lots to see. Beware of street performers asking for money. Cool shops and restaurants. Looking at the walk of fame stars is alot of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnbob77
50,I'll do this again!,"Apart from getting there, this is a no cost thing to do - and it's totally worth doingThere are thousands of stars, just wander and look, or download a map and find your favourites and enjoy the memories they invoke. The famous places previously only seen on a screen are also a great part of the experience.

30,"Do The Whole Walk, Feel The Burn!","The loop is probably 3 miles if you hit every street the stars are on. It's best to do early morning before the tourists and tour hawkers come in full force. Nothing interactive, it's just the stars, your eyes and your feet. Don't buy tours on the side of the road people, c'mon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xScience
40,Fun for the Family!,"Though parking is a pain (we went on a week night), it's worth it to take the time to walk up and down the streets and find your favorite actor/actresses stars. The highlight for both my mom and I were the hand and footprints in front of the TCL Chinese Theatre. If kitschy activities are your thing, there are plenty of them in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizzlebit13

The stars handprints and footprints in front of the Chinese theater were interesting and enjoyable, but the Walk of fame was not...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/461travisd
20,Beware of Hollywood,So the walk of fame is worth seeing but the people around it make it almost something worth passing up. It's not a super safe place honestly so be aware and keep to yourself and you'll be ok. It's a spectacle of young people getting wasted basically.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBrooks2334
20,Avoid - honestly nothing to see,"This entire area is so touristy and nasty. I'm from New York, and I'd rate this worse than Times Square. Half the stars are unnamed, and most of the rest are unrecognizable names and I also noticed there were duplicates. Unless you feel a necessity to take a picture with a certain star, which is something I don't understand, I would steer clear. Go to Santa Monica beach instead, or the Getty Museum. Way better things to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/233mariak
40,enjoyed it,"very very much a tourist place. big souvenir shops near by. street people posing for photos, almost reminded me a little of vegas. Over all it is such an icon that it must be seen in my opinion. great parking nearby in the basement of the mall area. $2.00 after you have your parking validated I thought it was a pretty cool vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amorace

30,Go Early,"This attraction is everything you'd expect, however if you are expecting handprints for each star you'll be disappointed as only a few stars have done it due to the high cost (a star alone is $30,000 and there is a wait-list). Go early to be able to search for your favorite stars as this area gets PACKED throughout the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckkeane411

30,Had to visit,This was surprisingly crowded with stalls and people selling stuff. I would NOT have expected that along this walk. I was disappointed. Sureal to have walked along all the same. The red carpet was being set up for the Acadamy awards and so we were able to walk on that in the Dolby theatre entrance and take photos if we wanted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shirlenep2017
30,Too busy,I always had a great expectation of Hollywood walk of fame. But it was too busy not clean and people are walking to you to sale their stuff. Very pushy. I didn't like it at all and this was not something that I had in mind. It's good to visit once but don't have high expectations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mona123a
30,Such a shame,"I knew before coming as we had been warned about what to expect on this street. But I wasn't prepared for the dirtiness of the Stars. This is an iconic part of Hollywood, just like the sign. But I found some of the stars just dirty, chunks missing and in a really bad state of repair",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ankersandrew
50,Los Angeles Overall,"I chose Los Angeles, or the city of angels, to be the best city in the United States because of a lot of aspect, such as that it’s a very big city, so people can do a lot of different things there, and the weather there is just perfect.Los Angeles is the home of Hollywood and Beverly Hills, two of the most well-known cities in the world, especially for those who love music and movies. Tourists can literally do everything in Los Angeles People are nice, the weather is just perfect, and a lot of beaches are located there. Moreover, there are some theme parks in LA, such as Disney Land, Universal Studios, and six flag. For me Log Angeles is the best city in America. Besides, I think that you can stay 1 month in LA without getting bored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/omarn183
10,Disappointing,"So so disappointing.This is a must do whilst in LA however such an anti climax!The area is dirty, full of nothing else but tattoo parlours and tourist tat shops with no obvious options for decent food and little else to do other than walk with your head down looking for stars you know.My advice, park up your car and choose a section of 10 minutes to walk down and back again then drive some place else!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smarshall487

50,A must visit when in Los Angeles,"What attracts most tourist who visit the area is the Hollywood entertainment scene; that you get here. The starts on the ground are a must visit, iconic part of Hollywood. On the Walk of Fame, you also get to experience the crazy did-not-make-it-in-Hollywood locals, who for the most part are harmless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltrivia
40,Interesting walk,"My teen daughters and I walked the Hollywood Walk of Fame and enjoyed finding names of people we recognized. It's a busy area, but most people were polite and walked around you or stepped out of your way when you stopped to take a photo. Lots of souvenir shops and places to eat on the walk. Fun way to spend some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrispR7790TM

50,Hollywood,We took a walk on the Walk of Fame before our tour of the Hollywood houses of famous celebrities. We went in City Tours. There was a $5.00 store near the Chinese Theatre and we got great bargains there. Some up and coming hip hop artists sold us their cds. Unfortunately when we played them the Fbomb was a frequent lyric.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nova203

20,It's Stars on a sidewalk...,"But seriously, that's really all there is to it. Maybe I'm just not into movies enough but it's kind of annoying to be down there. Too many people trying to sell you things or take pictures with you for extra money. I guess it's one of those things you should do once and never feel the need to go back. All in, took us about 30 minutes to walk up and down the street. Ps- favorite star was Mickey Mouse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edy02
40,Interesting,"We visited from Australia, having been to Thailand and other Asian countries we are used to locals constantly approaching you to sell you stuff.

30,Stars not so bright!,In some spots the stars are a little faded and damaged - obviously quite a lot of stars who you don't know. Still something you have to do in Hollywood though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mystay2
20,Below my expectations,"They could have designed and organized it better. It's a long line of similar stars with the celebrity name, very crowded, in the pavement of a street with a lot of traffic. These stars miss personalization, only the name and a symbol of their art is really not enough. Just to check the box in your list. It's not for kids after 9pm.Much better are the footprints and handprints in front of the Chinese Theatre. Just make sure not to be in a hurry, otherwise you will miss your favorites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csirio
40,Making a Nice Stroll More Interesting,Walking Hollywood Blvd and Vine while reading the stars on the sidewalk is a pleasant experience. Identifying the stars of the past and recalling their iconic performances is a study in cultural and social history that is not to be missed. Some parts of the walk are a little seedy but that is part of the charm. An enjoyable free experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lighthouse2006
10,"Filthy, riddled with vagrants and street peddlers","I suppose you have to see this once in your life, it may be best viewed before the vagrants and paddlers wake up. This is a disgusting stretch of Hollywood. Overpriced garbage stores, homeless vagrants, shifty looking peddlers, all contribute to the ""ambiance"".Avoid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BArtigue
30,Clean this place up!,"Very interesting rto see stars the likes of Dorothy Dandridge and Charlie Chaplin! That being said, some of the stars on the famous walk of fame are so dirty you cannot read the names. Three stars for being iconic, but please - clean this place up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DawnV541
30,Felt Cheap,Really tacky. Streets are full of people desperate to make money or desperate to give money to someone for a photo with someone dressed as someone else. The stars themselves were dirty and are in a really poor area of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iamdanj
20,Harassment,Lots of homeless and people dressed as Super Hero's bugging you for photos. It's quiet a depressing place. If you take a Starlight Bus Tour make sure you ask where you need to pick up the bus from as they seem to change hourly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevetQ1657SE

40,Best at night,"We arrived too early to book in at our hotel, so first stop of holiday was a walk to the Hollywood walk of fame. My husband and I just looked at each other different to what we expected, early in the morning and quite grotty looking and prob starting from not so nice end HOWEVER. We did not let this dishearten us and we we went back later in day and especially night it had come to life and looked Much better as seen on TV, and yes we did start from wrong end. Definitely worth seeing with a lot of characters and things a happening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinep912

20,Nice. But not what we were expecting!,"What a dump! The area that the walk of fame is in is incredibly run down..Considering they'd only just had the oscars here a couple of weeks ago it was surprising. Personally I was really disappointed.Whilst we enjoyed looking at all the stars and finding our favourites, we did not enjoy weaving in and out of the homeless and endless tour guide company's pestering you to take their tour.Some serious money needs to be invested into this tourist attraction a lot of the older stars were damaged, very sad. I would of happily paid to see the stars. (Obviously its a public street so impossible to do but still!)Although this is a must see in LA don't set your expectations too high! Or you'll leave like me feeling incredibly disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSSmith5
20,Not very interesting (unless you like scientology),"It seems a bit like a must-do when you visit LA, but at the same time it very much feels like a waste of time. I went with a few friends, we walked up and down the boulevard, went through the names, but all in all it was completely unmemorable. It is a tourist trap, and there are plenty of more fun things to do in LA.Unless you want to see scientology churches and musea. Than you've hit the jackpot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucasSeuren

40,I finally got to see it!,"I finally got to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame! But I must admit that I'm a little disappointed to hear that as long as you're nominated for one (anyone can nominate you and you can be chosen if you've been in the industry for 3 years and have donated to charity), all you have to do is fork out $30k and your star can be on the sidewalk.No wonder the bigger movie stars refuse to have their names on it! It's also because of the fictional characters on it!!Nevertheless, it was still fun just walking around and trying to find the names of the personalities I knew!!FYI, latest star, star #2601-Adam Levine",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ma-manators

40,Lived in Los Angeles since 1979 and still enjoy this!,"If you're a classic film buff, you need to see this at least once in your life. Best suggestion is to note the other historic classic film venues close by such as the Chinese Theatre and Egyptian Theatre. Very touristy, but so is Disneyland. If you prepare in advance, know that it will be kind of kitchy, realize there may be Hollywood events that block off streets, etc. it's a nice way to ""Have A Hollywood Nice Day.""

We had mapped out the ""stars"" we wanted to see, so that helped find them quickly! My kids were exposed to a little much, between the homeless people (who were harmless!), the marijuana smokers, and even a girl sniffing something up her nose.

Very well located, the strip is also lined with hotels vendors and of course tourists. Great to people watch, take pictures, definitely one of the must see/do of Hollywood & LA. I have lived here, seen the beaches, seen bars restaurants and clubs, and still enjoy the occasional stroll down memory lane which is the walk of fame!

30,"Seedy, worth visiting once","The stars themselves were cool to see but the amount of people attempting to unload cd's ""for tips"" and just in general not a great area made for a place to only go once.

10,Huge let down - wouldn't go again,"There's too much hype around the walk of fame, I felt unsafe, not so much with the homeless but the street acts that probe you for money & people trying to 'give you' cds but then ask for money.

This covers so much area, and most of it not good, that I decided I'll see what I see and not worry about finding anything specific.

40,Different than I Imagined,"I don't know what I was expecting, but I was slightly let down. The majority of the stars are in the main area of the Grauman's Chinese Theater. It literally is just the sidewalk. Maybe I thought it was just a big blocked off area of stars. Anywho, I felt like I was definitely in the way as people who weren't tourist walked and we tried to take pictures. Nonetheless, I was super excited each time I came across a name of one of my favorite entertainers. The stars seem to go on forever, I parked the car at night a few blocks down and looked smack down at Michael Jackson's star when I got out. It's not a bad thing, just more like...oh, ok. There are tons of souvenir shops, people in comic character costumes and guys trying to get their CD in your hand...like NY Times Square.

I took a tour where they said visit to hollywood walk of fame, beverly hills, celebrities house, hollywood bowl, santa monica beach, st. venice beach and the downtown LA. In hollywood walk of fame and st. venice beach their are person who will ask donations by giving some music CD. Be careful with them, its their daily way of earning by forcing you to take the CD. Starline tours are like they will not stop anywhere and wherever stopped was limited amount of time.

10,Deeply Disappointing,"Shabby and scruffy without an iota of glitz or glamour. Very sad and disturbing with the number of people in need and begging.The shops that line the sidewalks are tacky. It reminded me of the Golden Mile in Blackpool but without the redeeming feature of the wonderful promenade, beach and sea",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lavarcham
20,Overrated,"I expected so much more of the ""Hollywood Walk of Fame"" being part of the playground for the rich and famous, how wrong I was. The walk itself is ok but many of the stars are repeated and the amount of rubbish and homelessness in the area is disgusting. Marilyn Monroe's star is outside a McDonalds surrounded by homeless people, making it hard to get a photo of it without the destitute in the background.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenGreen1969
10,Walk of grittiness,"Yes, step around the homeless people and wipe the grime from the names of people you have probably heard of along Hollywood's dirtiest street. Plenty of tourist kitsch to load up on too if that floats your boat. Save yourself some time and skip this ""attraction"" unless you just happen to wander in to that area. And if you do, you should make sure you are a safe distance away by the time the sun sets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisfromRoanokeVA
20,"Maybe go once, but no more","It's okay, for me overrated, the street is with sidewalks and stars in both ways, is 4 streets long and too crowded. At night is full of homeless and drunk people, at some places is dirty and ugly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladelgadop
30,Didn’t expect much,"We had never personally seen the walk of fame & decided to tick it off our bucket list. We really didn’t expect much and, we didn’t get much. Some rather seedy characters loitering about and we were subjected to light harassment by various aggressive vendors attempting to hawk their goods.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denver60
40,Interesting,I was surprised that this is a bit scruffy in sections but nevertheless it is very interesting to have a look at all the names. Some are very well known but some not. How the stars are chosen is also interesting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/365giannad
40,Wear your walking shoes,You see everybody who's somebody out there. I enjoyed walking and seeing new and interesting names from all walks of life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ddeborahkirby
40,Walk of fame with homeless around,"Certainly every LA visitor is about to see this world famous walk, seen many times in movies. It stretches few blocks on Hollywood blvd around the Chinese theater.It's amusing for a while to walk and look down for your favorite movie or rock star, but along the way you notice many strange people, drunks and homeless, so it leaves a bad impression, specially at night.Don't expect any Hollywood glamour here, but instead many souvenir shops as the area is packed with tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B1714D
20,Too Crowded,Not best place to visit with little kidsMany odd characters in area. Dirty and a little crazyThe mall on corner is not bad and you can see the Hollywood sign from top,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1755LYkarens
30,Wednesday walk,"Difficult to view due to the set up of the Oscars on Sunday. When I first saw it I thought it wasn't the actual walk of fame, I thought it would be surrounded by glamour but it's down a busy street with people trying to sell you stuff at every opportunity. Good to get some pictures but wasn't overly impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lolaloritta
20,Careful of people,"This is a must to visit. I know you may have feeling like you will love here. However, don't judge this place by hollywood movies no matter which you just watched.Stars are scattered. It is hassle to find the one you wanna take a photo of.Some promoters are bad at foreigners. One african american promoter shout at me since I did not want to take the flyer.One souvenir store in front of Highland is sucky.The boss looks like an Korean, and he is very sucky.I wanna buy postcards but he demanded only accepted with strong vague accent.I asked again and he reponded, ""So what?"" with ridiculously mean face looking at me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LANCEofTAIWAN
40,A day out,Very nice to walk and see people you know of or have seen their movies. Some thing to remember. It was a beautiful place to visit when the family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F7435ULdavidm
40,Must see/Area not so good,"Walk of fame is a must see when in Hollywood. You can also see the hand and foot prints at the Chinese theater. The theatre where they host the Oscars is right next to it as well. Only let down was the area. Not very clean. Lots of strange people and sadly, many homeless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EddieP152
30,Nice shopping area,Great for shopping and sightseeing. Very crowded though! Would definitely return on a nicer day with sun :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibvnbelize
30,Pretty good,"Long walk, lots of tourists and annoying people trying to sell you things.You see one star, you've seen them all. Still nice to say I've been though :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alynta
50,Looks great in the rain,The rain makes the stars so shiny and clean! It makes for some nice looking pictures. The area is generally lit well enough that you can get pics at night too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BalikpapanRain
20,Overrated!,Its on a busy foot path that runs for a few blocks. Not practical to take photos. Hordes of people. Can be boring for kids. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel696549
30,"Hollywood Icon - Yes, But Don't expect Glamour","Yes, it is an iconic Los Angeles area attraction and it is free, but keep in mind that Hollywood lost its glamour many decades ago. The Hollywood Boulevard Walk of Fame is now basically a photo opportunity strictly for tourists – otherwise disappointing.It is always crowded and full of vendors of Hollywood paraphernalia, tour operators and costumed characters that charge for having their photo taken (with or without you) – keep walking. The Hollywood Boulevard strip on either side of Grauman’s Chinese Theater & Hollywood Highland Mall (between Orange and Highland) is the most commercial and the safest – lots of shops and casual restaurants. Hollywood Boulevard is very urban, dirty and there are lots of transients. If you want to be able to say you have been here, it is preferable to go during the day.If you are driving, the underground parking at the Hollywood/Highland Mall is only $2 for two hours with validation from “participating” shops and restaurants.If you are planning a trip, you may want to first go online to the walk of fame website. The website allows you to search your favorite entertainers and it will give you the address of the star’s location on the walk of fame – it will save you lots of time. You can also see if there are any upcoming Star Ceremonies scheduled. Star ceremonies are free to attend and are announced 7-10 days prior to the event. They begin promptly at 11:30 a.m. and last only 30-45 minutes maximum. You would do well to get there well in advance",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalTravelWorks
40,Great attraction,It was my second time here and I wanted to show the kids this great attraction. This place is a must see if you are in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taarhaug
40,Just go!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is so huge, which bothered me a bit because when I do something, I want to complete it to it's full extent and there was no way to see every single star. It was fun to look at the names as we walked down the street!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VEE1225
30,"Very over-rated and yet I’m glad we stopped here, more to say we’ve been","My son liked looking at the stars and I promised my daughter photos. Watching the street performers was enjoyable but I don’t like how hard they push trying to sell their photos and buy stuff. It made our brief visit unappealing. I was happy to find a store selling touristy stuff I had not been able to find anywhere else in L.A. If I ever get to visit L.A. again, I’d only go to visit a couple of stores. Keep hold of purses and agree on price *before* taking a photo if you want to do that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danib981
30,Bit of fun,It was a bit of fun when exploring Hollywood looking out for the stars of our favourites. Luckily we had a map from the hotel detailing where they were which made it easier. Some we could not see as the outside of the Dolby theatre was fenced off as they were preparing for the Oscars.If you are in the neighbourhood it is worth just looking for a few but not worth a special visit. The hand and footprints outside the Chinese Theatre are a better attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gadabouts95
40,must see in Hollywood,"The place is filled with tourists. You can plan to spend around an hour or 2 at the street or you can also take a Bus tour of Hop on and Hop Off offered by star tours from here. We heard a lot about the place before going and that created the excitment. What we really expected to see, and eventually found, was the stars signatures and footprints in the sidewalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q5137XWryanm
30,Disappointed,"Yes I know it's just a decorated street but it's a famous and iconic Street, so why did it feel seedy, was dirty and not looked after. Yes it's the pavement but the locals clearly don't care about it. The concrete at the Chinese theatre was well looked after. A must see place though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve6244
40,The place where Hollywood stars are immortalized,"See the famous squares where the famous stars were immortalized. Close proximity to the Kodak theatre as well, home of the Oscars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/indrajitg2014
30,Not the true LA!,"Hollywood Walk of Fame is a very touristy spot in LA. It's worth a visit if you're in LA for the first time, but I would not spend more than a couple of hours here. I would also avoid it at nighttime, it could be risky. There are much better places to visit and that can truly give you a true grasp of the LA culture, and Hollywood Walk of Fame is not one of those. The Dolby Theater (where the Oscars are held) is worth a visit as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Francyfre
50,Walking as a Hollywood star,"Great way to remember many famous artists who have a star on the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ex. Michael Jason, Prince. Luis Miguel........",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C1005BBrosam
30,Its a bit Overrated.,"Sure you can see you favorite stars star, take a picture of it or with it, however its a long walk and its not as special as its marketed to you.The walk is also full of either homeless people or street performers soliciting you so its actually an annoyance to walk down.The Chinese theaters front walk has a much better display of stars in a nice and central location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adroso360
30,Hollywood not always the American dream,Whilst this is an iconic visit when in LA as it is so well known be prepared to navigate the dozens of touts for everything known to man that become a little too much after awhile.Hollywood itself is not all that bright and shiny but a must see so you can say been there and done that and have a few photosThere are a few hidden gems just keep looking and you will find,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/441michellef
30,Ok,Good for a look at the stars Hollywood theater madame tausaud and the strip worth avisit and stop for a drink at the Roosevelt hotel graet service and food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3743MTjamese
20,Always amusing,"It's fun to check out all the names on the stars but I find Hollywood repulsive in general. It's pretty dirty and lots of creepy characters but if that's your thing, you will LOVE it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/535robync
40,Enjoyed the stars,I enjoyed looking for the stars of my favorite celebrities. There weresouvenir shops and I bought a lot of $5 souvenirs to take home. There were also people in costumes like spiderman and marilyn monroe. I didn't like them. I saw one of them harassing tourists for tips.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelafeme
30,Lots to see,"Lots of people!!Near the Chinese theater, there are lots of people, street performers.....etcLots to see, just be careful and watch out,Lots of people dressed up as superheroes, they are funny people, give them a tip if you take there pictures, they don't really bug youI walked down the walk of fame to a less popular area,I think it's a must see, you don't have to spend a lot of time here,There's a mall right in the middle nice views from all levelsYou can get coffee, gym shoes or a meal...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ariq819
30,A bit disappointed,"As a family of four we arrived to check out all the Walk of Fame, to be bombarded by touters trying to sell you their music on CD/DVD. Really annoying, and always targeted by husband. It really took the fun out of looking for particular names. By the way you can download an App which will locate a particular star you maybe interested in. We didn't as wanted to get away from the crowds asap. We couldn't view some of the stars as it was being set up for the Oscars so it was cordoned off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TashaTait
20,Disappointed,Although it was great to see all the stars in the pavement and the handprints outside the Chinese theatre the area is very run down. We were constantly hassled by tour operators and weirdos. We couldn't wait to leave. It felt very intimidating- not the kind of place you would want to be alone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMTPINK
50,Walk of Fame,"All along the Hollywood Blvd it is very exciting to find names of actors, singers, directors and bands that have made it to the Walk of Fame. If you have been offered a place on the Walk of Fame you have to pay 30,000/-USD to secure your place in time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherley2211
40,It's a must in the area,Though this is a must do if it's your first time in the area it's not the best place for a walk in the area. There are lots of homeless people. There are lots of people harassing you to take tours. There are lots of annoying people harassing you with religious propaganda. This honestly should be illegal. Freedom of speech and all whatever but I should also have the freedom not to have annoying people up in my face.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chelslynne
30,Must visit for first timer tourist,Nothing special about this whole strip except the celebrities' names on the stars on the pavement. But you have to visit this strip especially if it's your first time in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nyotista
50,Make sure you plan ahead if you're looking for a particular star!,"We were looking for Lucille Ball's star as my wife is a huge fan of the classic tv series ""I Love Lucy"" but unfortunately i didn't do my homework beforehand. But thanks to the marvel of modern technology, i simply searched for it on walkoffame.com and presto we found it on the 6100 block of Hollywood Boulevard between Argyle Ave. and Gower St.!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CKGTribe
30,Amazing Scene on weekend,"my younger friend was determined to spend some time walking this famous Hollywood site and taking photos of Michael Jackson's star in the walk. The crowded weekend, sunny day had everyone out . The people watching, street music and overall scene was something to experience ! It was fun to browse the streets and well known buildings. I thought the admission prices to places like the wax museum & others were far too high.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulAK2011
30,Capital A for Annoying - not what you'd expect,"This attraction brought back memories of trying to shop in the back streets of beautiful Bali. People constantly nagging you and trying to con you. Yes it's a little bit amusing seeing the dressed up characters (but you have to pay to get a photo with them) but the other people handing out 'free' CDs then to try nab your money are disgusting- I saw them take $20 off a poor mother who said she didn't have much while holidaying with her son. It was also very grubby and further up the road were some graffiti filled vacant stores. It had a really unsafe, 'on guard' vibe - not whatYou'd expect after seeing all the photos of celebs with their stars. Come here for the brief experience and make sure you are on guard for your safety. To the local council- you have some work to do to spruce up this area! Letting your city's reputation down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahlC9286HQ
20,Hollywood has gone downhill,"The restored, nicer Hollywood is gone. Storefront are mostly wreaks. Street people and trash really detract. So many stars are chipped. I found the walk scary and will not return.Worst place in Hollywood was street behind Hollywood High. Filth and trash and broken glass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soigneelac
20,Everyone thinks it's a must-see but it really doesn't need to be.,"So I came here as a kid and remembered it being underwhelming and now as a 40 yr old with my own kids it was even worse. It's uncomfortable to trying to walk down the street and watch for scam artists (ppl handing you ""free CD's"", and costumed characters scamming photos). It's really not worth the trip unless you are staying nearby. Really, its full of cheap souvenirs, low-end ""attractions"", and scam artists (oh and some stars on the sidewalk). :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyCCalgary
50,Walking around with family and admiring the city!,"We had a great time!!everything was accesible as far as restaurant,drugstore,souvenirs and it was a lot of fun we took the metro from Hollywood to downtown and didn't drive since we were told traffic was very bad and yes to drive in Los Angeles city is hard as far I can see people was having a hard time finding parking in Hollywood area .so we enjoyed very much",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/169nrr
10,DIRTY AND DISGUSTING,"tons and I mean TONS of people harassing you for $$ if you aren't being harassed every few feet about going on a tour then it is someone shoving their cd in your face demanding $ . DON'T take your picture with the ""celebrity costumes"" UNLESS you plan to pay them. Zorro literally asked me for $20 after basically telling me to take a picture with him... not even kidding then when I gave him a few bucks instead he got pissed and asked if I was serious... yes, If I WAS SERIOUS! The smell of weed and pee is way too strong and I thought my son dropped something bent down to pick it up and it was someone's pills! A must see to experience, it's too bad they have destroyed it for visitors. The parking garages in the shopping area is VERY SKETCHY when we paid to park we are walking through the garage to car doors being open... so LOCK YOUR DOORS ALWAYS!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsbbeckybsb
50,Must see!,Was so much fun to see all the different people honored. I started at the Chinese Theater. Where many famous people have there hands and/or feet pressed in the cement so you can compare yours to theirs. Free delightful walk with palm trees lining the streets. Many shops along the way. Pleasant way to enjoy a few hours and get a walking workout. You can spend more or less time depending on your schedule. A family member dropped me off and I called her when done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferbG646ZQ
20,Seedy part of LA,"Now that weed is legal, you smell weed AND urine everywhere. Always a disappointment when going to this area. This is why they call it ""Hollywierd"" .Living in LA it always is embarrassing when tourists want to rush here to see the stars. It is not reflective of our city but I guess I understand the draw. It definitely is so much cleaner and more modern so that has it going for the area. It's still a freak show and now with pot legalized....oh boy. Watch your wallets a day purses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IllTryAnythingTwice1
40,Well worth a walk,"One of the iconic sights in Los Angeles. This is despite the fact that Hollywood itself is a rather grubby place. But if you care about classic movies and are nostalgic about the times when Hollywood actually knew how to make great movies, you should stroll along the boulevard and look at the stars. And when you come across that truly special star, you can take a photograph and you will have a very special memory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincemc
30,Just an average attraction,"It's an attraction you can't miss, but mostly due to its fame. I don't think it's a marvelous thing, and it neither left me in astonishment or greatly impressed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NelsonPirolo
40,Must see just because it's iconic,"Hollywood Walk of Fame is a really neat place to see names of entertainers and artists who have contributed to modern pop culture.I loved seeing some names that brought me back to my childhood, like ""Reading Rainbow"" Levar Burton; or, Woody Woodpecker. It's also alway nice to see iconic names of those who we loved but have passed, like Joan Rivers.There's a lot of neat little tourist shops along the route, and you can always jump on a sight seeing bus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MDBull
50,So many famous people,"You'll start where you can find a parking spot, but from there you'll just keeping walking and reading the names of famous people, some of which you've probably forgotten, some of which are dear to your heart! You'll be snapping photos! Well worth it-",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cruiserinc
40,For True Nostalgia,"If you avoid the homeless, street peddlers and addicts, it's a walk down memory lane. The historic buildings, the view of the Hollywood sign takes you back to a time when Hollywood was the entertainment capital of the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/661jimn
40,Walk and enjoy the fame!,"I visited walk of Fame in January so it was a bit cold and sometimes rainy. If you are a fan of walking, it is a good place for your joyful walk. Make sure you have a map or something to visit the stars of the people you like to see, otherwise you would be always facing the pavement and would miss the shops or theaters around. You can find fair bit of good street food over there too. Another advise, you can walk your way to Hollywood sign from there too. We did so and on our way we found some cousy coffee shops. Enjoy your walk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CallmeMatthew
20,A must see,Whilst it is a must see it is all a little seedy. Get your taxi to take you through Beverly Hills to take you to the Paul Getty museum. A lot more upmarket than the Walk of Fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swissfarm
20,It has to be seen to be believed but only briefly,"Some people are quite aggressive here. Selling tours, cds and going round in costumes that have seen better days. Lots of drunks as well. My teens were quite surprised, you expect glamour but it's a run down place. There's a good little mall near it that gives respite and lunch. Don't plan to be here long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/353heidib
40,Be a Star!,"always a great choice when visiting LA, get to feel like a movie star albeit briefly. the stars are always increasing, so always fun to see what's been added since the last time I was there. Looking forward to going again this March with my husband and my 11 year old Son. he is so excited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieDubai9
50,A must see but not why you think...,"Here you get to experience both extremes of Hollywood. The stars on the street are of course classic and cool. The Chinese Theater is awesome. You might get interviewed for the Jimmie Kimmel show. Madame Tussaud's is cool too. However the real show is the scammers, thieves, bums, drunks, prostitutes and religion peddlers. The street smells of urine and booze. It's exciting. Watch your wallet and don't let anyone hand you things or take your picture with them. Haha... Trust me... They only want your money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milesvedder
30,Too Crowded,"It was too crowded to stop at the stars you wanted to stop at and see. It was fun to be on the BLVD and look at the famous places like Loews Theater, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Mann's Chinese Theater. I think this would be better without all the street performers asking for tips for photo's. Tip-Go to CPK off Hollywood BLVD and get some scenic photos of the Hollywood Sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3963HUmarka
20,Ho-hum...,"If you're a tourist, fine, go so you can take this place off your (bucket) list. And only if you've got nowhere else to go. This place is a drag, and so filthy. Feels to me like it's getting worse every time I drive tourist friends here. So sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom91522
30,Nice but not what i was expecting,"Had fun trying to find favorites on the walk, but lots of homeless on parts of the walk, was sad.But still had fun finding names",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ledbytheunknown
50,Always a Fascination,"No matter where on Hollywood Blvd you walk you will find and be surprised by the stars' names. It is interesting to see who is honored, some we wish we knew who they were and yet others we wondered why their stars were placed where they were. A fun daytime experience while enjoying the street scene and shops in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoboTravlr
40,Fun and free activity,Star spotting for free. When else can you straddle Harrison Ford without getting a restraining order for your trouble?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/302catherinew
20,Just famous names on the dirty sidewalk lined by mediocre stores and filled with people of all types.,"Interesting to walk among the non so fortunate in life, to realize how fortunate we are.I would recommend to be driven through during day light, so you can turn heads on the out of this world people that are tragically parading in the latest midwest fashion and hair dues. This is a bad circus kind of ""The Court of Miracles"" where the lowest common denominator can find reassurance among his peers. It becomes a freak show when you reach Highland and Sunset. When the sun sets it is more forgiving, and you could be seduced by gleams of neon lights giving a surreal vision of tinseltown like it was conceived by the early movie settlers back in the early 20th Century. Cheesy businesses line the sidewalks such as Bogus Logo T shirt, wigs and rags boutiques, tattoo parlors, smoke shops and the corporate fast food chaines are all represented there. Further East toward Vine it becomes a bit more organized like they do it at attraction parks with hotels and theatre. There is a metro line that can sweep you away to Universal City or to DownTown.For the ""Insiders"" and for the ""Millenium Tourists"" with means that stay in groovy hotels with a competent Concierge you could be led to the newest venues tuck away among the confusion of back streets and disguised doors (Bars, Restaurants and Night Clubs). Everything that is illegal is ready available for a price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VBCJJ
40,A lovely Walk,"A lovely walk where you can spend hours just reading the names on the stars whose names are on the pavement. Was told by tour guide that it now costs $25000 for each star to have their name put on the pavement. Only one star is not on the pavement but on the wall of the museum, that's Muhammad Ali. Area is quite run down now with a lot of rubbish around",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TreccoTaff
40,Really Cool,"It was interesting to get pictures with celebrity stars. I was really happy to get one with Robin Williams, may he rest in peace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/927tashan

30,Interesting place to watch the street characters,Intersting place to see who the stars on the sidewalks are honoring and then enjoy the street characters. My favorite is Edward Scissorhand who engaged everyone in a fun and entertaining way while pretending to cut your hair.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susan90405
40,"Third time, nothing new: beware the Costume fellas","It's my third time at the Walk in 11 years and things seem to be pretty much unchanged. Well, that's not bad, since what's good should remain good. The costume fellas are still out there, preying on gullible tourists for the quick tip. I used he word preying as a few of us witnessed an argument between a couple of tourists who took out their wallet to tip, only to be demanded the bigger bills that can be seen by the costumers from the wallet. My advise is to bring out your tip in advance out of the view of these costumers before you take the shots with them and handbag them the tip without bringing out your wallet in front of them at all. The city manager should govern this matter with the costumers but then, this is America, the land of the free!The Dolby Theatre bridge still offers the view of the Hollywood signage.Hard Rock Cafe serves very good Pork Ribs, good place for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laborday2009
40,Crazy touristy fun,"First off understand that the stars are all over the place - there are literally blocks and blocks and blocks of them. Some people even have multiple stars. This is pure tourist-ness. It's fun to walk around & see them, but it is very crowded & there are lots of hustlers trying to sell you stuff. Still, if it's on your bucket list go down & take a walk around. If crowds are not your thing or you are not particularly interested then skip it - you're not missing much",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shellco

50,Big!,"Boy there are a lot of stars. Tips: 1. The stars are on both sides of the street. 2. Some people have more than 1 star. They give stars for TV, movies, music, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarrenHumphrey
30,Not much to see with a lot of people trying to pull a fast one,"Had been to this place about 2 decades back and it doesn't have the same allure as it did back then. It tends to get crowded but that's manageable. What is troublesome though are the ""aspiring"" singers and artists trying to pass you a ""free"" album and ask for 10-20USD (I only gave 2USD). They can become pesky and downright aggressive especially once you touch the CD so for tourists, please just do not touch anything anyone offers you there unless you want to get ripped off.Other than that big annoyance, the only thing to really see here is the Grauman's and Dolby theater and nothing more. Spend about an hour at most here or you can also give it a miss in favor of the Hollywood Sign and the Griffith Observatory area which has better views and lesser annoyances.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bensonc278
40,a must see in Hollywood,"the street has stars on both side, make sure to get the map to locate your favorite star. We were there on a Saturday afternoon, so it was very busy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HR8283
50,Nice walk,"The place is filled with tourists. This is around a mile long Street with loads of attractions like Ripley's, Madam Tussad, Pubs, Chinese Theatre, Museum of broken relationship, Museum of Death.There are alot of eateries to satisfy your hunger buds.. There are some local Chinese shops which serves some good delicacies like fried rice, noodles, chicken and veggies. ( located near 7/11 - Restaurante Chino Maxim)You can plan to spend around an hour or 2 at the street or you can also take a Bus tour of Hop on and Hop Off offered by star tours from here.There are a lot of shops to buy souvenirs for friends and family.You will find a lot of homeless people all over the streets. While we find them harmless and friendly, but we're always concern about our safety late evening while walking towards end of the street. Take caution when alone in late evening after 8pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rajatc78
50,Interesting experience!,"We heard a lot about the place before going and that created the excitment. Although its a bit of an over rated place, we took some photos and enjoyed the interesting feeling of hollywood experience with tons of shops to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bassem_zamel
20,Run down part of town,"The stars on the footpath are just stars with names, in what is now a rundown area, with the exception of the Dolby Theatre. What we really expected to see, and eventually found, was the stars signatures and footprints in the sidewalk. We eventually stumbled across that at the TCL Chinese Theatre, after nearly giving up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyAisbett
20,Not a place to spend time,Dirty with empty store fronts and homeless asleep on the streets. Wouldn't go there at night. Actually saw a rat run onto the sidewalk from in between buildings. Was there at 10 am Saturday morning and mall stores were closed . Ran into several people on the street smoking weed. There is a Hard Rock Cafe and the wax museum there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccay417
40,Find your own super star there!,A better idea is to be there at 6:15am. So the street lights are still on and sun just rises from the horizon. Also you can avoid huge crowds and enjoy your crazy photo or selfies time along Walk of Fame. Find the super star you love and take a picture in memory. Also you can stand in the middle of street for pose you want. You will be a star too ⋯,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98zhil
30,Overrated must see ...but still a must see ;),Much more worth visiting are the hand and foot imprints than stars itself. If you lived long enough you will find something really satisfying here. Avoid if you dislike crowded places.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skoczmygdzies
40,A must see,It's great just to visit this place. Make sure you see the hand and footprints next to graumanns chinese theatre. Very busy and touristy but still enjoyable. You can park at cvs for an hour free as long as you get your ticket validated. That's all the time we needed to enjoy the atmosphere and see our favourites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliG1620

30,Mixed feelings,"I stopped by last Friday around 5pm to get some souvenirs before heading to an escape room and comedy club and I must say that the place is both amazing and creepy... having been a few times before, I felt like it was getting worse. There were drunk people, others clearly intoxicated in other ways, screaming and crossing the street anywhere. Given that it is very crowded it makes things uncomfortable very quickly. In many ways this place reminds me of Times Square except that there is no police presence (that I could see) to keep things in order. Shops and stores are amazing though, as is the whole experience if you are a first timer. I would definitely recommend it for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisaV3191GG

30,It's okay,It's very much like Time Square but much smaller. Seeing the stars on the side walk is no big deal. Up around the Chinese theatre where the stars have written their names and have their hand prints is cool but very crowded. Lots of smutty shops around. Not family friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/690kime
20,Over rated,"If you want to see something special in Hollywood, take a tour of Grauman's Chinese Theater. The architecture is worth seeing and it's history is worth hearing.

50,Pop culture enthusiasts must see the stars!,"I am a big fan of popular culture and I loved walking along the stars. Seeing the stars of my favorite comedians, musicians, and actors was a special experience for me. It's something I had to see at least once but I would go again with family or friends to appreciate our favorite icons together. The area also offers great shopping, snacks, and bus tours! Don't buy any CD's or DVD's from anyone on the walk of fame area though, they are usually scams.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinkbabyadventure

Just watch the Marilyn Monroe's, Michael Jackson's impersonators and many other famous stars or movie characters. If you want to snap a picture of these impersonators do it quickly and discreetly otherwise, they will charge you money. This is what they do for a living!

At the end of the day, it's something to see once, perhaps when stopping to get some photos at the Chinese theatre, but apart from that, I wouldn't venture too far.I've been to LA a few times, and still don't understand the attraction, perhaps if the area was a bit nicer and there was less people heckling you on the street, it may be a bit more enjoyable.It's free, I guess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E3429QHphilm

30,Kitschy fun,"it's taken a few visits to make it to the walk of fame but it was a fun way to kill some time before dinner at Musso & Frank. The rain kept most of the sketchy characters off the street the evening we visited, so it was easy to focus on hunting for our favorite names",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PvrlGirl
20,More a Walk fo Shame,"It did not portray any of the glamour and pride you should expect when walking down this dirty excuse of a tourist attraction. We got there super early and witnessed the 'cleaning procedure' the city appears to have put in place to make this place 'tourist friendly'( which included chasing homeless people away and cleaning up all the dirt/rubbish every morning. Also, some of the names on those stars take away the 'honouring' notion of the whole idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guggitier
10,Not worth it,"Honestly, I cannot see the appeal of Hollywood or the Walk of Fame. You get to see some famous people's names but you also have to deal with con-artists, annoying tour bus salesmen, and the dress-up artists who will jump in your photo and then expect a tip. It's not worth it. There are so many other, better, ways to spend time in SoCal (Southern California).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaredN728

40,Its Not Hollywood Without It!,"I love wandering the streets of Hollywood looking for the stars of my favourite entertainers. I have even been lucky enough to see several star 'unveilings' while I have been visiting. It definitely makes Hollywood unique.

30,"Colourful, commercial and lots of vagrants","I was staying just 100 meters away, so it seemed the right thing to walk down and see the stars.There are 2500 of them, commemorating the famous individuals of film, tv and music. There is no real order to them, neither alphabetically nor by genre or age.I walked for 30 mins on one side and returned on the other.Unfortunately there are many beggars, holding signs for donations to buy burgers or weed, and homeless folks searching the garbage bins for scraps. Also plenty of touts selling sightseeing tours. It was midday but I was still hanging tightly onto my purse. I wouldn't feel comfortable alone at night, if I had valuables.At the western end you'll find the Chinese cinema, Dolby cinema, the wax museum and Madame Tussaud's. Towards the middle it is less crowded and less interesting. Allow an hour; you probably won't need longer. For you Brits, you'll find it reminiscent of Blackpool front!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spincs
20,Tourist trap,"This is a very very busy street with tons of people trying to sell you mixtapes etc. It's really annoying. The stars are cool to see but it's just some stars in a sidewalk.

30,Great but be aware of surroundings,"It's a must go, however it's worth be aware of your surroundings. Drunk and homeless people literally everywhere. People approaching you asking to buy cds, take picture.. only accept if you are ready to pay. Nothing is free there. I stayed for only an hour close to the TCL and it was more than enough.

Too many people hassling you for tours and wearing bad celebrity costumes, vendors hanging right by the most famous stars eyeballing you, vagrants a plenty and so much rubbish. The stars are sadly not very well maintained, it's just not how you expect the romantic and nostalgic Hollywood to be. There are also duplicate stars as well, not sure why that is.

It is cool seeing the stars and even nicer when you see stars of people you actually like. The actually walk of fame is long so even though I have been to Hollywood twice, I still haven't seen all the stars as it's just too long of a road to see all the stars.It can be pretty busy in Hollywood so I sometimes walked along the stars early in the morning like 8.30/9 as the boulevard is very quiet at that time and easier to take pictures if that's what you want to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharmaynes2016
40,Interesting experience,"It was a fun opportunity to be able to see the Walk of Fame. Not something I will probably choose to do again. If you've seen it once, you're good. I was disappointed in the upkeep of some of the stars. I realize, however, it is difficult to deter, and keep up with, all vandalism. The costumed characters and people peddling their music around the attractions were distasteful and annoying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amaleesto

We took some photos and decides came back next day. It is another place!!! Lot of people, we also saw people smoking weed, but while they're walking...they 're invisible in the day. We took a tour. We visited Beverly Hills, Bel Air (both neighborhood were amazing! Huge houses. I don't know if the houses that show you are really from famous people, but it worth do this tour.)We took photos in Hollywood sign too. After the tour 2.30hrs aprox.)we walked through Hollywood street. We have lunch in Mel's.

20,Disappointing,Considering the stars pay to have a star there pretty disappointing. I don't think I would pay $30k for homeless people to stroll around my star. Lots of homeless people everywhere so for a lady (even though I was with my husband) made the walk a bit uneasy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23tiffanyk
30,Interesting but Hollywood is overrated,"Fulfilling childhood dreams to visit the Hollywood star of your favourite film or television actor will likely clash with the harsh reality of Hollywood. Hollywood Boulevard is filled with cliched stores aimed at getting every dollar they can out of visiting tourists. One can hardly blame them but be prepared for the reality check. That being said, it is interesting to find the Hollywood stars of famous & not-so-famous stars. Recommended...just.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingManOz

We would have loved to have spent more time to maybe see a show and explore a bit more but, having said, that it was a lovely afternoon wondering down the walk of fame.Such a lovely reminder of so many wonderfully talented people that have entertained us (past & present ) over the years.A definite must do when in Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pedrodU2043LM

20,Stars bought by Stars in a rather shabby and disappointing area,"I'm a 47 year old father. Despite being a huge movie fan I had zero interest is seeing the stars, especially after being forewarned by friends that the area was sketchy and disappointing, a million miles from the glitz and glamour of the movie world.However my 16 year old daughter, a big fan of all things Hollywood, was especially keen to visit the area. My kids did enjoy it but were extremely underwhelmed and disappointed that it failed to live up to expectations.Once upon a time having a star set in concrete on this strip of land was an honour and a reflection of ones achievements and status in Hollywood. In recent years though these can effectively be bought for $30,000, a flash presentation to the committee and a promise to attend the presentation. Hence whey some ""less deserving"" folks have stars whilst other 'A' listers are missing: e.g. George Clooney, Al Pacino, Robert Redford, Robert De Niro, Denzel Washington etc. it's certainly less worthy when you find that Absolute Vodka and L'Oreal have a star.There are about 2,500 stars, some though in less than ideal condition. It can take some time to wander around. There are many websites that will tell you where each star is located so if you are looking for a certain person these sites are useful.As others have said...This is not a particularly pleasant areaPlenty of homeless/less desirable characters aroundIt's rough, busy and dirtyAvoid anyone handing out CD's - these are not freeI would also avoid anyone handling snakes - these should not be used for tourism and ridiculous that the authorities do nothing about the use of animalsI would also avoid posing for photos with anyone dressed (badly) as your favourite film or cartoon character. I've never understood the attraction of having a picture with some bloke in a costume - clearly this is not a movie star - and then paying for itMany of the folks in costumes are drug/alcohol affected - we saw several heated arguments and folks losing itGo early to avoid the tourists and many, many, many dodgy charactersTake your pics and get out as quickly as possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Haggis_Supper

20,Big Disappointment,"One would think with the history of Hollywood and Los Angeles so intertwined that a careful restoration to preserve the buildings and the image of the ""golden days of cinema"" would have been a priority, but sadly Hollywood is an unimpressive mixture of once grand old buildings and sleazy wig, lingerie, and smoke shops. We passed more hawkers and beggars on the street than tourists on our visit. It was such a disappointment. I had been there only once over 20 years ago, and I was so hoping that a total restoration had taken place. Unfortunately, it is not much different than I remembered. Sure I know, everyone who goes to LA wants to see Hollywood-so go, just don't expect too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/223suei

There are also lots of shops for all those souvenirs we love to take home to our friends.There is an abundant of dressed up characters to have your photo's with, just beware it is at a cost, just like the people giving away their CD's.Of course visit, it would be ashame not too, just don't visit with high expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cat33R
40,Hollywood walk of fame,Had fun trying to find your Stars star as its a long road so could take you an hour or more. Not as 'amazing' as expected but still a must-do in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FleurJ46
10,Tawdry,"Totally underwhelmed and nothing like expected. To see names like Errol Flynn on the south side of the road, down the Vines end, amid rubbish, vagrants, and dilapidated shops, seemed so much less than a walk of fame, more shame. So many names, almost forgotten such as Groucho Marx, Red Skeleton etc., with their stars fading into oddities and in surroundings of dirty footpaths, horrible dirty shops. The whole lot sad and not worthy of the hype.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2Righty
50,Cool thing to see,"You cant come to california without seeing this, amazing how many stars have been recognised and immortalised in stone",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sparkles4
20,Great fun,"Walking up Hollywood Boulevard at any time of day is a real experience not to be missed! It was such fun spotting the famous names as you walk, there is so much to see around you as well as on the floor! It does get really busy though so we found it better first thing in the morning, we were lucky enough to be staying on the Boulevard itself though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U281BLlees
20,Once is enough,"The whole point in going to Hollywood Blvd is to see the stars on the Walk of Fame, it runs for miles (or kilometers). You will find the Dolby Theatre and Grauman's Chinese Theatre (hand prints/foot prints) with alot of the big name stars located in the block of Hollywood and Highland. Go beyond this block in either direction and the atmosphere changes, it has many rundown or closed up stores. Its almost like you've stepped into a different neighbourhood, not a good one, one where you'd be wise to be aware of your surroundings. Hollywood Blvd is overrun with homeless people and every 2-3 feet there are people pushing bus tours/star homes tours....I must have said 'no thank you' at least 100 times in the 2 days we spent in the area. You would think that this area of the city would be spick and span clean as this is where all the awards shows are held....it is completely different to what you see on tv. Also, be aware, that there are plenty of people dressed up as celebrities ie Michael Jackson etc....they encourage you to take a picture with them.....they do expect payment for this privilege. As I said, once is enough....we have absolutely zero interest in visiting here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wifeofanaussie
20,Disappointed,"Well after years of wanting to visit this street I must say I was disappointed with what a sore, it's dirty and rundown",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7430VPpaulc
20,If you must!?,"This is hard to tell people only if you must. It has to many people pushing, it's dirty unless you go into Hollywood and Highland. You will see the foot prints at the Mann's Chinese Theater. And the theater itself got a reboot a couple of years ago and has an Imax inside along with the new THX Atomos, so your seats move to the movie. But the walk itself is one a done, bad costumes of people dressed up like celebs. There is a great place to buy that up on Hollywood, but I doubt you will return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3yarddogs
10,Dissapointment,"Yes, of course it's nice to see the stars of the long gone stars and the new ones too. But one would expect this boulevard to be sparkling clean. Well, brace yourselves, Hollywood Blvd. is one of the filthiest places in LA. No charm, it's long gone. Just a dirty, crowded, noisy attraction if at all. No thank you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAVict0ria
40,Lots of Stars,Went with my daughters and had a great time walking down the street looking at all the stars. Surprised at some of them and excited about many others. Took lots of photos to prove we really were there. We had a great time. Bought a couple items at the tourist shops. The street had a lot of homeless people and people with a grudge but maybe all cities are like that. We were never scared but we really had a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeangregorywh
30,Disappointing,We were previously here in 2000 and thought the area impressive but on this visit found it to be very tired and grubby looking . Unfortunately would not bother going back here in the future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjsweep
20,Not worth it,"The walk of fame is not worth it in my opinion. Sure, its kind of neat to see all the stars in the sidewalk and to the see the hand prints out in front of the theater, but there are so many other fun things to do in LA, this would not even be in my top ten. The whole time you are wondering around, someone is trying to give you there mixtape or try to sell you there tour or whatever else you can think of. If you want to see this, I'd suggest seeing it from your car or possibly on a guided tour so you could get more out of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7912GPjosephb
20,Not worth the visit,It really has nothing to offer. The walk is ok with a lot of celebrity names. But that' all. The rest is just lousy tourist shops and restaurants. Will not come back amd will discourage people coming there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterkO9573HQ
30,Just like any other street in LA,"I had a completely different expectation from this street but it turned to be an ordinary street with something special i.e. names etched in a star on the walkway. Other than that the street is always with full of people, road side artists, theaters etc., Good to see once and tick yourself that you have covered this place too in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Im_GPS
20,Uncomfortable experience,"My buddy took me to Hollywood Walk of Fame because I wanted to see the stars and check out the Chinese theater. However when I got there, the celebrity impersonators started coming towards me and made me take a photo with them. From this, I didn't know that I had to tip them money after taking the photo. Sadly, I only had $20 bills. So I gave them the $20, so they could split it.It got more worse when these guys were trying to give me their cds and I didn't want it. The guy kept annoying me so I took it just so he could stopped. Then he asked for tip as well and I said I was willing to give him $5, but I only have $20. So he agreed and I got my $15 dollar back in charge. However, his friend just snatch my $10 out of my hand and they left. I felt I didn't have time to process what happened because I was overwhelmed and tired of what just happened. I lost $30 in 10 minutes and overall I was just felt uncomfortable and pissed off there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s0medude123
50,Hollywood Visit,"A trip of a lifetime.A walk done memory lane to see, observe the stars of the past and present who have brought life to the entertainment industry and whose legacy will continue into the future.The are many exquisite Restuarant's along the Blvd. to experience and see the beautiful sites along Hollywood Blvd.There Pantages Theatre, famous Roosevelt Hotel and other Historic landmarks.A must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415genen
40,Fun,If you are in the mood for nostalgia this is a great place to visit. It is fun to reminisce about your favorite movies while taking photos at the stars of the actors in them. It is crowded so go early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dollface23
30,Interesting but overrated,It's mildly entertaining to see your favorite stars' stars but if you keep walking around here looking down you might be shaken down or approached by one of the many characters on the boardwalk looking for some tourists to hustle. Go here once just to see it and for the hollyweird culture but keep your wits about you. Lots of overpriced tourist shops all along the way and also the wax museum. Meh.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GPC2
50,Must do this,Wonderful remembering past and present stars in all fields of entertainment. Extends both sides of Hollywood Boulevard for a few blocks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leahp576
40,Easy Walking Fun,"If you are interested in walking down Hollywood history lane, take an hour or two and walk the sidewalks to see the stars of Hollywood royalty. Easy walking and great people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/83deedeeu
40,Just Like TV,"This place looks exactly like it does in movies and on TV. It was crowded when we went, but still a neat experience. The street performers that I saw were actually really good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicabB6547KU
40,"Crowded, but Must Do","It would be a shame to go all the way to Hollywood and skip the Walk of Fame. The sidewalk is crowded with tourists and everyday people. Almost everyone is patient with stops for pictures. There will be people trying to sell you tours, cds, dvds etc so be aware. While not perfect, it is essential to Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rem4
50,Great for to do list!,The walk of Fame is great for you to do list! Make sure you go my the Chinese theater! Tons to see and tons of history! Full of action!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maillady411
20,For Film Fans,"If one happens to be in the area, this is a curiosity fan site. Otherwise, not worth a destination visit when LA has so much to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/391judithl
20,So Disappointing,"Wow, the crowds here are terrible. This area is full of rude tourists, characters seeking photo $ and thieves. We were traveling in a group and felt very uncomfortable. Even if you get away from the crowds to some other stars it reeks of urine and the homeless people are scary. Would not recommend this if you are alone. Probably better in a large group, and keep your wallet and possessions close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1mohman
30,My trip,It was pretty cool I expected it to be so different .. maybe cleaner a lot of homeless people ...reminds me of New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cuzzie17
30,"A must see, but it was very dirty","When in Hollywood you must see the Walk of Fame. I was just so sad to see so many homeless people. They all seemed very nice and did not bother you, but I saw human feces on more than one occasion literally on the Walk of Fame. Also saw a used condom. Wish it wasn't so dirty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nutellaandbanana
30,Hollywood sign was better,YehWellWas good to tick it off the bucket listWas chaosAn people harassing you like baliWasnt really as good as i thought it was going to be,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J4290WFsteveh
10,Hollywood walk of shame,"Totally over rated.Maybe we went to the wrong end of this street but were we was, was full of tacky shops selling nothing but crap. Also could not believe the amount of homeless people on the street and even thought i am 6ft 4inches, I felt threatened on more than a few occasions. And this was in a packed street.Went into the pig and whistle to get away from the surroundings but found the staff just as weird as what was on the streets. LA really needs to sort out its homeless problems. Not blaming the homeless as they need to go somewhere but seeing tents and tents of homeless people living on the pavements is not a place I would visit again.I am just thankful I never took my wife and children as I was on a business trip. Me and my colleagues literally stayed 45 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ray_Newland
50,walking among the stars,Me and my daughter visited the Hollywood Walk Of Fame. It was very busy and the public crowds walking over the stars made it sometimes difficult to see them. So beware of the large crowds walking over the stars .We managed to get some photos of them. The walk itself along the stars is well worth the visit on sunset boulevard . Part of the Hollywood nostalgia so I would not miss it .Plenty of places to eat along the way.We were lucky to see some actors on the Red Carpet for BFG whilst we were there. Atmosphere great !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvonneduffy
50,It is something you have to do,I took my 9 year old and it was good family fun finding all the names . The place is surrounded by other attractions for young ones so it's worth making a day of it . A highlight is seeing ALI's star on the wall of Dolby theatre ( because he didn't want people walking all over him ) . There is thousands of stars and a few double ups so it can take as long or as quick as you like .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulBelyndaJosh
50,Lots of people. good experience,"I have been to this place twice over. Specially During holidays it gets pretty busy and there are loads of people walking down the street and is pretty packed. To me these are modern historical places and one has to experience it, as these gets shown in many TV shows. Good place to get some pics clicked specially near Dolby theatre etc. these days one has to pay a min of 5 to 10 $ to the mock starts who are standing there if you get your pic clicked with them. also there are many other attractions along the street, so while you are LA you must visit for the experience and memories",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deepak_NewDelhi
30,"OK, but sidewalk where they are is cracked",Visited on a Hollywood tour. Very crowded area with tourists and others. There are some people dressed as cartoon characters. Struggle to walk through on the narrow side walk so don't think you'll spend much time looking for your favourite celeb's names. Some shops and restaurants along this strip and Chinese theatre. Sidewalk needs to be repaired.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariedesjardins
50,A fun walk across generations,"It's fun to go back and forth and zigzag, locating stars and celebrities who are favourites of different generations of the family. It's quite a long stretch and makes for a good evening stroll too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smS4662GV
40,A Walk with Great People,During a tour of Hollywood my wife and I checked out the Walk of Fame. It was great seeing it in person finally. Put this on your bucket list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CurtK815
40,It's changed a bit!!!,"What a visit!!!! It was a good visit, but there are way too many people kinda waiting to pit pocket you. You are always on high alert!!! I guess that's a given. Besides that, it's very nice:). The stars just take you away!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V6089DGmariak
30,Not upto expectations!!!,"We visited this attraction with a lot of expectations,,,, but realized it is only a walk with lot of shops.Reached here by metro rail from our Hotel, Hilton Universal skipping all traffic. Due to shortage of time did not take any tours. This can be the reason for our disappointment, may be we missed something there. Saw the hotel famous from "" Pretty Woman"". There is Madam Tussauds, did not visit.We spend our time searching for the names of our favorite movie stars. The souvenir shop near the Starbucks was good with a lot of options.Travelled back to hotel by metro. Our visit was in the evening around 7 pm. Suggest to visit early and take a tour to explore better and hear stories, which we missed out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maagworld

20,Overated,"So I did this walk alone, maybe its best not to. Had some guy grab me as I was walking down the road in daylight and another group of guys shout stuff at me. The street is literally so dirty, smells of urine and full of homeless people. Not so glamorous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Terri1990
40,crusty,I love hanging out here when I have nothing to do. the only bad thing is that once is starts to get dark it is really unsafe. and it's quite crusty,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aneysij
40,A must see,"It's was my first time to LA so like anyone the Walk of fame is an pretty amazing thing to see with some of the stars / legends dating back to years ago. It stretches across at least 5 blocks with names on either side of the road. It can become very busy very quickly, and a lot of people approach you trying to selling you your guides. Although these can be cheap and tempting I wouldn't recommend using them even if saving a little money just to be on the safe side. There can be a lot of homeless people which can sometimes make you feel a bit uneasy but they rarely bother you and genuinely keep themselves to themselves. This is a must see even if not on your bucket list as there is nowhere in the world like it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shericeb2016
20,Not bad,Its a place that you see but dont need to go speciallyTry to visit it when you visit the street itself or to buy some gift or Madame Tussaud's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moury1989
40,Another Fun Time,We walked around the walk of fame for a few hours and had a great time. There's so many restaurants and entertainment all around that it kept us going all day. A must do while in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRainville99
50,Honored to be there,It was an honor to be at a place that highlights the contribution of Hollywood film family and others. It was so amazing to see the star of Muhammad Ali. simply dream come true.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/e2ecpk

30,A good place to take a walk,"We visited this place a day after the Thanksgiving, so there were not so many people walk around here. We could took pictures and met a lot of ""characters"" like superhero, actor and actress (we can give them some tips) on the street. There are ao many souvenirs shop with affordable price too. I like being there. It was a good place. It also near the Maddame Tussaud Museum, Hard Rock Cafe and the Dolby Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ariestiani

Highlight is absolutely the Chinese theatre, which was incredible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brandons163
30,What we expected,We enjoyed wandering along the street looking at the names on the different stars. Some areas were very busy and we were constantly aware that we needed to keep a tight hold of our personal belongings. We were amused by the crazy Trump supporters campaigning near his star but missed seeing the star itself which was vandalised a few days later...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/453LauraM
40,Walk of fame,It was so much fun looking for the stars of my favourite celebrities and taking pictures. This area is a hive of activity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolannw172
30,Far Too Crowded... Even on a Weekday!,"Of course it is fun to see the stars in the sidewalk of the famous, but the sidewalk was so crowded that literally we could not view one entire star, let alone a length of the street such as it appears in the photograph.As a former native Californian I had visited the walk and Graumann's Chinese Theater and there were small crowds, but ""crowds"" then were defined as a dozen or so people in a 100 s.f. area. Now, there are just about 1 person in every s.f.! Even difficult to walk. We were told by a tour guide to be highly aware as the area has become a haven for pickpocket thieves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricka315

There are several souvenir shops along the road and eateries too.Nice place for spending an evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tvsinha
40,Relax and have fun,"Yes it is corny, yes there are pushy people dressed like characters everywhere, do not fall for the ""let me sell you an autographed cd"" bs and yes there are tons of tourists. If you expect all of this you can have a good time. I'm a celebrity junkie so I found it fun to be in the hustle and bustle of it all. If you are expecting an open sidewalk with no distractions you're going to have a bad time. Otherwise take your sense of humor and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaWCarmel
50,Its stars on a sidewalk,"It was cool to see...... not that into hollywood stars anyway but it was still interesting.......overshadowed by street hustlers ""giving away"" CD'S.........no one gives away anything.

30,Overrated.,"My family and I came here because it's always been on the bucket list. And unfortunately when we came here it wasn't that great. Sure seeing the star's pavement was cool but when you add in the tourists, people who are selling their CD's and tipping the dressed up characters who keep trying to persuade your children in for a photo which, as a parent is really annoying. It wasn't the greatest bucket list item that we have done. But I guess we did it in the end. We know next time we fly to the States to avoid that part of California and focus on the real city things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melesinaf
10,dont bother unless youre desparate,"in the old days of hollywood, it took a real star to get one on the walk of fame. now anyone with 2500 can get one. they are no longer unique, they're everywhere.complete bore, unless youre from a real small town and absolutely have to show your friends youwere here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arlene7729
20,Go early or not at all,"We went to this in late January which we were told by our bus driver is not a busy time. I'd hate to see it at a busy time. You can barely walk down the sidewalk. If you are in LA, this is pretty much a must-do but be prepared for crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hola4876
30,Not impressive,"Sorry, maybe it's just me who doesn't get this fame/fan thing, but I didn't find this part of Hollywood Blvd impressive at all. If visiting LA I'd rather go see Getty center or Getty villa, hang out at the beach, visit Venice canals or Griffith observatory. You need to have a taste for ""walk of fame"" to appreciate it or come during the next star ceremony!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/248marinak
40,Hollyweird Walk of Shame,"A great place to be aggressively panhandled by the mentally ill street people who you will encounter, feel free to ignore their existence and never make eye contact. Also don't whip out your cash on the street, the beggars will flock to you and you might get mugged. Avoid the overpriced tattoo shops, the artists are dicks who won't haggle with you. Do check out the Wax Museum and Ripley's, unfortunately the Museum of Sex is no longer there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V4010RFchrish
10,Steer Clear,"Hollywood is essentially now a dump. I have no idea why anyone goes to see the walk of fame to begin with, but the area in which it resides is now so unpleasant that I can't imagine how it would any longer be a source of enjoyment for anyone other than the most fanatical film enthusiast. Go elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/298brucel
40,Must see,"I hate to be obvious but the walk of fame is a must see. If you want to walk the entire walk of fame it will take you about 3 hours. You won't need a full day here. There is a lot of things on the walk of fame that you can see or do. Madame Tussaud wax museum, Roosevelt hotel, the Chinese theatre, shows, restaurants, star home tours. There are a lot of people dressed up in costumes that if you want to take photos they will want a tip. They are generally harmless. There are also some guys there who will try and hand out their cds. They will also want money if you grab one. Definitely worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98sarahc
40,Exactly what it promised,We were staggered by the sheer number of stars. The area around is full of the tinsel town paraphernalia. Great fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PacoH_11
40,A must do in Hollywood,"A little unexpected as the photo;s you usually see are of jus the stars on the walkway. In fact the walkway is so busy that you have to wait to see them. A brilliant thing to do and I was so glad to have seen them. Outside the Chinese theatre is the oldest stars, where I believe it all began.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gizmocrystal
30,"Nice to see, but overrated experience",I suppose this is the Hollywood thing to do; and it was interesting to see how many stars there are. But I wouldn't say it was a 'top experience'. Hollywood felt like a big tourist trap. We were in and out of Hollywood in just under a half hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pitt2NCTraveler
40,"Fun walk, nest to find the stars of the actors you likr",I am not sure if there's information or a map of the stats that one could search. I did do much research. We were driving from Bakersfield to San Diego so we stopped in LA to see the stars. I wish I started from the beginning and walked the whole thing but it was a bit cold on the first day of the year so we just walked enough to see some of our favorite actors' or singers' stars. It is a best place to visit at least once but try to get a map or start at the beginning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sylvieFS
50,Cool to see,"This is something I've always seen on tv, so it was super cool to witness in person. We were on a tour that only allowed us 45 minutes to visit. It wasn't nearly enough time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Itraveldou
40,The Stars Are Out Day & NIght,"What a fun activity for anyone! We loved reminiscing about all the stars and the movies they were in. It's a very crowded walkway, naturally, so you have to be patient. There's also a lot of street performers wanting your attention and several struggling musicians hawking their cd's. We ignored all that and just enjoyed looking at the stars themselves. There's also a lot of shops, restaurants, etc along the way so you can slip into one of them if you so desire. A must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trave2leverywhere

30,Fun tourist trap,"A little cheesy but there is a lot to see and keep you entertained on Hollywood Blvd. It's a tourist trap, but that is to be expected and a definite must see at least once. I've visited twice.Ive been to both the wax museums. I didn't care for the Hollywood wax museum. I personally couldn't tell who people were. We have also visited the Guinness museum and Ripleys. I would recommend for families.Pros1. A lot to do, and an iconic siteCons1. Very busy and very touristy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferkW5524LZ
20,California Holiday,Lol well the good old Hollywood Walk of fame. Not like it was a few years back when we went. Lots of sketchy people. The smell of drugs everywhere and the garage. One would think that a place like the walk of fame would be a little more glamorous? Or at least the up keep would better. Little disappointed. Parking was ok. The shopping in the outdoor mall was fine. Never mind the Crack Head spider man was fighting with the Drag queens haha was a little entertaining.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kennorthstar1

30,Walk of fame,I expect more from this street it reminded me of Blackpool cheap shops one way and then nice the other way near the Chinese theatre and shopping bit. It was nice to see and read all the hand and foot prints shame there so many homeless people one the streets most of them having a joint,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaramQ4740ZH
50,Stop on our tour,This is a must see when visiting California. Great for tourism and picture taking. Finding the local stars Hall of Fame. Would go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gida64
20,Lost the Magic,"It's fun to read the names on the sidewalk stars, but it's hard to stroll the area because of the crowds and street vendors. The Walk of Fame has lost it's magic because few art deco buildings have been preserved. Instead, the neighborhood around Grauman' s theater is surrounded by a poured concrete mall containing discounters like DSW, Marshall's, Hooter's and totchke shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teacherpam88
30,Chaos on the streets!,"I was lucky enough to recently visit & I stayed on Hollywood Boulevard so was able to see the walk of fame at all hours. In my experience the quiet times to visit are early in the morning before 9am or mid-week later evenings. In peak times it can be hard to get through the crowds & see the stars but it does get quieter the further away you get from TCL and Madame Tussauds. Some stars have more than one plaque & there are info stands & tour companies that can give you a brochure of the stars location if you want to see a particular celebrity. Lots of tour touts in the area, I highly recommend LA City Tours right on the walk of fame!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaseyms
40,"This is a unique place to reminisce about people you liked in theatre back in day, now it good, but means a bit less","I found it festinating and a love tribute to our Hollywood stars, literally, The Stars represent a Life or partnership? Love the idea, but some areas can be busy and dirty. They need to clean the starts, but all and all a great visit for LA LA Land.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherColoradogirl
20,Major disappointment,"When you grow up watching television and imagine seeing this place in person, it's a very different picture to what is painted on your television screen. This place is dirty and not necessarily a place you would expect names of honour to be placed. However, it is Hollywood. It would be nice for this place to consider laws and by laws to help clean the area up and give the stars and place what it truly deserves which is cleanliness and class.!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcrleigh
40,"Crowded, But Fun To Do It Once!","Even growing up in Southern California I had never been to Hollywood and the famous Walk of Fame! We parked in a nearby parking garage and were soon walking down Hollywood Blvd. It was very crowded in the area in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater, but other areas were less crowded and it was easy to stop and take pictures. The street hustlers were very pushy and annoying, but we know how to ignore them! Ghirardelli has an ice cream/chocolate shop in the thick of the Walk of Fame - refreshing after all of the walking! Enjoyed our time in Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKTBE
40,City tour,The Hollywood Walk was part of our day trip! The streets were busy but fun to see Debbie Reynolds & Carrie Fishers stars with flowers on them. Easy area to get around. Fun to see other stars of actors & actresses!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/495marshak
30,Walking!,Walking on Hollywood Blvd is much better these days though you still want to be safe so stay on the main Blvd. there also lots of places to get your souvenir but if you're on a budget I suggest going to Rite Aide they do also sell souvenirs for way cheaper. All in all still a good place to show your friends around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alaindl
40,Live 24/7,"Walk of fame is a must see place in Hollywood LA. Very colorful street will give you feeling like energetic. There are showmen and women waering clothes of famous movie characters like batman, zorro, cindrella, Chalie Chaplin and so on. You can take photos with them with a tip of course. There are stars on the ground named after famous Hollywood stars all around the street. Do not forget to visit Muhammed Ali's star which is not on the ground but on the wall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seyisoglu34
30,Only if you have the time - Just so you can say you were there,"If you have some extra time this is worth the trip, but if you have time constraints there are lots of other things to do first. You can take the subway from virtually anywhere in LA. Even if you have a car, the traffic and parking are terrible so take the subway. Get off and Hollywood/Vine (Red Line) station and you will be right at the start. Most of the stars are north of the the subway station along both sides of Hollywood Blvd. There are stars along Vine for about two blocks in both directions. These will be a lot less crowded than the ones along Hollywood. Take a look at the Pantages and Dolby Theaters. This way you will recognize the area when you are watching one of the many award shows. If you go early in the morning you will have a lot less crowds and you can actually get a few pictures of the stars. If you go in the afternoon the place is usually packed and it becomes very difficult to navigate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikebP7980OK
30,Must see if you are in LA. Don't get along with guys with costume.,"This is the place you see in TV when Award is on. It is fun to see the names and hand print of celebrity. You can walk up to the complex and enjoy the Holywood Sign. If you happened to take picture with guys with costume, don’t forget to tip them, usually $5. To make economical trip to this place is park on the street ( 4 blocks away from center-free) and do not take picture with costume guys.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Never2ver

30,As expected - prepare for crowds,"The walk along Hollywood Boulevard and the Walk of Fame is one of the must do things in LA, but it should be noted that it is ultimately walking along a road looking at stars embedded in the paving stones.It does get crowded and certain stars get more crowds than others, as you would expect. In addition the hand and foot prints outside the Chinese Theatre is fun to think about the history.Note that parking can be expensive and the sidewalks do get very crowded, and once you head to the more distant ends of the boulevard, the neighbourhood feels a little tired and grubby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigstuw

30,A little disappointing,"If you're looking for a fun way to exercise, this walk would be it. Lots of stars but we were disappointed by the number of repeat stars and the fact that so many less than stellar entertainers were selected. Apparently the eligibility standard is quite low. It was nice to see the shrines for Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/509lp
10,Only if you must...,"L.A version of Times Square. It is so jammed and over-crowded, that you can barely walk, let alone see anything. It's just not worth the effort it takes to go. We've had to walk through the area to get to other places, and it's just plain stressful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madartist54
40,An entertaining walk,"So much to do and see along Hollywood Blvd. We went twice, once during the day and also at night, which is great with all the lights.

40,Hollywood WoF,"-The stars were fun to visit and take photos by your favorite celebrities. It was sad, but nice to view Carrie Fisher's star, where fans are keeping her memory alive with all the flowers and Star Wars memorabilia.-All of the stars are within walking distance of each other, however, there are so many on Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street, it could take a while to get through depending on who you are trying to see. Also don't hang out too long on Sunset Blvd. past dark, it becomes a bit seedy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawstat02

40,Crowded and lots of opportunists looking for a buck,"Beware. This is an iconic L.A. spot, and there are loads of people walking around who want your money and will use some creative ways to try and get it. If you're into having your picture made with someone dressed up like a Marvel character, Spiderman, whatever, boy are you in the right place. I was not in the market for it, but it didn't stop every single one of them from trying to grab me and force me to take a selfie. There are musicians who will ask you to take one of their promo cds, and if you politely try and take it, they hold on to it and start the process of trying to talk you into giving them $$ for something THEY are trying to force on you. No thanks buddy.I say all of that as a preface so that you know to just walk with a purpose and avoid making ice contact if your purpose is to see the Stars on the Walk of Fame. There are shops selling tourists trinkets galore everywhere. Unless you uber or are on a tour, you'll have to pay to park. After an unsuccessful attempt at parking in a parking garage, we opted for a lot next to Jimmy Kimmel live ($20 to park the day we were there).Here's a tip. If you need to use the bathroom, go to the Marshall's (or Ross, or some variety of discount retailer) near the Chinese Theater and go to the 2nd floor, back of the store. Most other places require you to buy something to use their facilities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gagirl75

10,Don't visit,"As a resident of Los Angeles I cringe every time a friend or family member visiting asks to see the walk of fame. This is honesty a waste of time and over crowded. If you are a tourist and wanting to do the walk, I highly recommend you skip it. Go to Griffith park and do the Hollywood sign hike. You'll get exercise and have a better time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soapypants
30,Disappointed,Walk of fame is interesting to see but hollywood blvd in general really is out dated and scruffy....lots of surrounding shops are cheap & tacky. A number of stars are graffiti covered and it just doesn't feel like I thought it was going to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Businesstravels1114

30,Too crowded to appreciate the moment.,"Although I live in LA, I rarely go to Hollywood. But when out-of-town guests are visiting, I am willing to brave the crowds and show them the sights. Our most recent venture to Hollywood was the Monday after New Years Day, and the place was a zoo. It was so crowded that we lost our friends and couldn't really spend any time describing the nuances and special details of the place to them. It was far too stressful to be enjoyable. Between the crowds around the street performers and the hawkers selling tours, it was loud and people were pushing too much to really browse the Stars on the sidewalk.I still give it three stars because it really is a unique and special place; however, I would be very careful and selective about when to visit. There are maps on-line about where specific Stars are located, so if you want to see a particular star, I would look it up ahead of time too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q1402AHsarahm
40,"All the names I remembered, but the neighborhood.","We were there on a Sunday, so people traffic was light ( I am guessing). I was personally surprised but just how many names I recognized.Probably a very touristy thing to do.Neighborhood is not very classy.If there is a star or stars you are looking for, I would strongly suggest downloading an app to find them.I did enjoy the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/318bks

40,Star studded walkway,"Fascinating walk along the famed Hollywood boulevard. We walked several blocks up and down the walk of fame, discovering the five pointed terrazzo and brass stars bearing the names of some of the most famous Hollywood stars. It was an attraction not to be missed. We found a convenient parking at the nearby shopping centre so didn't have much problem getting to the spot",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/824deveshd
40,Walked both sides of the street,Visited at 8.30am whilst it was quiet because went back about 4:00pm and it was manic.Walked virtually the whole sidewalk on both sides a good few miles and saw all the camera crews parked next to the Debbie Reynolds star.Its an interesting area full of intersting people. I had heard it can be quite daunting and that part of Holywood can be a bit seedy but we found it to be perfectly safe with just a few odd people and quite alot of tourists.Saw the old chinese theatre with all the casts of hands and feet. Stood in the Mall with the great white elephants and a perfect view of the Holywood sign in the distance.Really enjoyed the experience and took plenty of photos. Definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trebor5417
40,Fun Visit,I had a great time looking at all the names on the walk of fame and was surprised by how many there were. A fun idea would be looking for your favorite celebrity. Definitely recommend you go visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomt71
30,Very crowded with tourists -- not so great.,The walk of fame is really just the sidewalk Hollywood Blvd. It is very crowded with tourists. It is not so much a destination as something you walk over to get to other places.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gothamcitymom
30,Interesting stop,"Crowded and touristy but if you have time, it is fun to see names of celebrities and reminisce since many are no longer here. Great dialogue with my son about who people were. Seeing how tiny or how big hand/foot prints were is also interesting. Wouldn't go out of my way to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbbyers67
30,"Cool to see, but a little run down.",Checked this out when visiting Hollywood. Cool to see the stars of the famous people but some of the stars are in sketchy locations and run down. Still worth checking out. Get there early before the crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ironleague
40,Beautiful and busy street,"Wonderful street and crowded find the famous names and cinema complexes, restaurants and watch live demonstrations Street",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ABUABBAS
40,Worth planning ahead,"We didn't really plan to see much of the walk of fame when we were in LA, but once you get walking around and you see a few names you recognise, it definitely sparks your interest. If you plan on looking for certain stars it's definitely worth finding their exact locations online beforehand. Some are easy to find and are right outside/close to the Chinese Theatre, but some are a bit harder to find (took us ages to find Tom Hanks!) a lot of fun though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrsjnkns
10,Stay away,"Probably Los Angeles most depressing, crowded and pointless spot, this almost feels like it was designed to separate tourists from locals and keep them away from all the good stuff. Really the down-point of my time in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/991nicolasc
40,It's Not Hollywood Until You Visit the Walk of Fame,"I am a So Cal native and I've had my trips to LA and Hollywood over my life but it was the first time visit for my 10 year old. Boy was my kid so excited to walk the entire area. I think this is fun for older kids and not so much toddlers or really young kids. My 10 year old was spotting names out with stars he knows and asking about funny named stars like Red Buttons. For me it was fun because I had not visited in a long time and we had an afternoon to spend in LA.This is a great place to visit if you are a tourist. If you are a local who is reading this, I will say that living in LA we have access to see so much but we never make time to do it or we just take in a few places but vow to come back again but never do. For me, this was the longest amount of time I spent walking the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The timing was great because there was flowers on a couple of the stars and a make shift one. There was plenty of tourists and lots of interesting characters roaming the sidewalk. The busiest part of the sidewalk was in front of the Chinese theater where there were tours and lots of people hustling to take tours of celebrity houses. In the crowded parts, I recommend you keep your kids close since there were swarms of people walking through. Once you walk past the restaurants near the Chinese theater and the adjacent stores, the crowds thin out a bit. We walked from the El Capitan to the Pantages and it took us about 30 minutes to reach that point. There are alot of well known celebrity stars in the courtyard in front of the Metro stop of Hollywood and Vine (across from the Pantages). You can see stars like J. Lo, Ellen Degeneres and Adam Sandler and a few more celebrities I don't remember right in that area.For locals living in LA, you can bring out of town guests and they can spend an afternoon or an entire day walking the entire area. For locals, your kids may enjoy it if they like movies and TV shows. I would visit again but not too near in the distant future. I do recommend coming during the day if you plan to see the entire Walk of Fame because there are some parts where you can see homeless people hanging out. If you come at night, I would suggest coming with a group because the more outlying parts of the Walk of Fame are in some areas that are run down and its dark where there could be some shady people lingering around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onedeesse
20,Disappointing,"Lots of tourist shops, grey buildings, the Walk itself gets a little boring after a while. But the area around the Chinese Theater is nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/972LibertyHill
30,Very touristy,"If fighting crowds and hundreds of tourists appeals to you , then head down to the Hollywood walk of fame . Sadly the area is dirty and the streets where the walk of fame is positioned are lined with street vendors selling rubbish , which cheapens the whole Hollywood experience .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLLetschert

50,Iconic walk of Fame...,A walk I highly recommend for the world to see. Lots of shopping. Great restaurants. This is a point of interest you must see.. you should stay at a hotel on the walk... this is the best spot in Los Angeles who doesn't like it????? No one.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buddhakouri
40,"Interseting, Bustling, Fun",The walk is fun and interesting. It can take time to find all the stars. We were there during the Carrie Fisher/ Debbie Reynolds passings Fans poured out and the tributes were noble. The walk is really a good place to see. You can also find anything to eat from snacks to real food there. Lots of shopping as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lllly2015
40,Not as expected,A trip to LA wouldn't be complete without s visit to the walk of fame. Not much to write home about but it is a must just to say you have done it. Favourite stars line the pavement but do go homeless people which gives it a bad image. Overall worth seeing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7988GTpaulineb
30,Pure tourist attraction. Fun for first-time visit to LA.,This street is very crowded and filled with tourists. This whole area is highly geared for tourism. This is the LA's version of Times Square in NYC. However it is also a must-see for first-timers in LA.And it is very fun and exciting to find the names of celebrities that one adores. It really has names of all the celebrities that existed.I would not want to visit it twice though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickyt373
30,Took a walk with the stars,It's neat because you have to do it when you visit. Not much to the stars themselves surrounding area can range from seedy to must see real quick and both at the same time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nbuerkett1
40,It was neat to see...,Not at all what I expected. Touristy and dumpy...Kind of like Times Square in NYC but not as nice. But glad I can cross it off my bucket list. Wouldn't go back twice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/816ne
40,Worth a walk,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame are the sidewalks of Hollywood Blvd with names of famous people on the plates (include politicians, rich and famous people). It covers about 1.3 miles of each side of Hollywood Blvd and some N and S. about little less than half a mile on Vine street. According to sources from internet, there are nearly 2400 stars with 100 hundred years of history. The walk of fame is one of the main reasons visitors come to visit Hollywood. To get the good feeling of the stars on the footpath, go early morning when tourists are not there yet, especially Hollywood and Highland area, In the afternoon and in the evening, it is near impossible to navigate yourself around the crowd. The stretch from Highland Ave. to Vine street has a lot of nice small restaurants and bar. Take your time to look at the stars and don't forget to stop for drinks on the way. Some visitors may want to concentrate on the heart of the tourist site, that is Hollywood and Highland intersection. The site is also easily accessed by bus and subway system,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrawetJ
20,Off day fun,It's nice to walk here on Hollywood walk of fame with the nice California weather. There are some nice and cheaper souvenir store by the Chinese theatre but the downside are the annoying and very rude CD people who don't understand the meaning of NO THANK YUO. Those cd people are ruining the tourist experience and gives a very bad reputation to Hollywood. Those CD's are empty( at least the one we've got after being followed and annoyed by this African dude.) asking for a donation but minimum $10. Authorities should do something about those people. I recommend not to entertain or talk to those cd people if you go to Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarlonT
30,Hollywood Boulevard Walk on the Stars,"I did arrive on Hollywood Boulevard with great expectations around the Stars on the walkways and finally found them a little underwhelming. Yes, the Stars are all laid out in front of you but you suddenly realise that some of the sheen is worn off with everyone trampling over it and no crowd for even the greatest names. So it boils down to personal regard for the name you are looking for and your picture with it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NinjaHyderabad
40,Just like you see in movies,"Went to LA back in Feb and visited the walk of fame around 8-9pm. There was quite a lot of people there which kind of made it difficult to take pictures with the infamous star plaques. On the bright side, it was amazing to witness and walk down the walk of fame. It's exactly how it's depicted on TV/movies. Would recommend anyone who is visiting the area to check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Losa_T16

Overall the history is cool and it's always exciting to find a star with the name of one of your favorite celebrities! Lots of street artists and hustlers.

50,Not what you think.....,"It's definitely a must do but it's not at all what you think.....we were pre-warned about street performers hustling & just avoided them which was quite easy, it's not glamorous but the history, knowing that movie stars have frequented this spot for years - we missed a new star being presented by a few days - made it something to tick off the bucket list. You get a great view of the Hollywood sign from one of the buildings (our driver gave us directions) & it's just surreal walking down the street & finding your favourite stars names. I would like to have stayed longer but under an hour will give you plenty of time & do t forget to visit La La Land - great for souvenirs! (I could have spent longer in here!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traceymay2016

Overall it is chaotic and dirty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaida17
30,Twice is enough...,"I did the Walk of Fame twice in 5 years and once is already enough but twice is the maximum allowed I could give to it.It's very busy during daytime; slightly less at night. It's usually dirty (mainly because no one respects anything anymore), lots of Stars are in bad shapes - but if you're lucky, armed with a good camera and ready to kneel down to get your picture(s) then go for it and hunt down all those names you're after !If you start early in the morning (8am max - after beware of other tourists like you), you might get a chance to find the boulevard more empty...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elvis27Les
20,"Everyone is hustling and has an angle, a seedy part of town","Well, we had to do it since we were tourists in Hollywood. Safe but seedy, lots of characters and hustles and some begging but respectful. So sad to see the faces and evacuated bodies of some of the likely-addicted young people living in the street.

50,A Hollywood must-see,"If you're in the LA area the Hollywood Walk of Fame is a must-see. It's great to walk along and see all the stars from long ago to recent ones.

30,"If it's your thing, go for it.","It's packed with tourists, filled with people hustling for a dollar, and generally chaotic. But there's something about getting to see a place that's been visited by movie stars for over a century that gets the crowds crazy.

30,You have to see the walk of fame!,"It is what it is. You just have to visit it if you're in LA. We visited here at 9pm so not the best time due to the area not being the best but we seen what we wanted to see. It isn't the best area, its fairly dirty and run down but hey, its fun at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PocketFullOfShell
40,Super touristy but fun for a short amount of time,"If you are in Hollywood, you should certainly see this. There are many street performers and of course the Hollywood stars embedded in the sidewalk. I would give yourself a hour to see this, as the crowds will slow you down. The Chinese theater is also along the walk of fame. You can see the Hollywood sign as you walk along the sidewalk. Fun but not an all day activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcoSeattle_WA
40,Find your favorite star!,"A must see for any tourist visiting Hollywood! Not what we expected--in an older, run down part of town but all members of my family enjoyed walking the walk of fame and searching through the stars. We didn't know there was a Trump star, it is on the same side of the street as the Chinese Theater with the barricades around it. Obviously there is still a problem with vandalism--we watched a protester kick over the barricades and curse while we were there. My child had never seen anything like this before -- a life experience. If you have small children, you might want to steer clear. We also found some of the superheroes in costume up and down the street to be a little creepy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtotravel0330

40,Good to finally do it,"Good visit, overcrowded and maybe overrated, but still a must do experience. The street is long, and you'll be looking downwards to read the signs all the time, frequently bumping into other people doing the same. They have a lot of tours, bars, souvenir shops and restaurants there as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amrkata
30,Interesting piece of history,My daughter had to visit Ushers star on the walk of fame. The area was not exactly what we were expecting but it was a cool stroll to check out. I found some of my favorite artists so it was well worth the journey.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tenisheat2016

30,Overwhelming.,"We visited this today with our kids and it was overwhelming. The amount of people there + the people trying to sell you stuff + the homeless peddling = overwhelming. It was hard to see the stars names through the feet of people let alone take a picture.

20,"Crowded and touristy, just as expected","This was just something we needed to see when we were here, but an hour was long enough. If you love gift shops and street corner evangelists you will love it. It was great to see the stars on the walk, but it was so crowded it was hard to stop and enjoy it. We parked in the parking garage under the mall at the Chinese theater. We bought some cookies at the kiosk in the parking garage to validate our ticket. So it only cost $2. Now we can say we have been there. No need to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/740taras

30,"Worth the visit, but underwhelming.","We saw a movie at the Chinese Theater, and when we came out, around noon, we walked around the Walk of Fame. Even on Christmas Day, by then, it was very crowded. The stars were interesting to see, but the strip itself was nothing special otherwise. A few iconic places. Typical souvenir shops, and people trying to get you to take a bus tour on the streets. Like everyone has said before, people dressed in costumes and trying to hand out CDs for a tip.

About 2500 five pointed terrazzo and brass stars embedded in the side walks are positioned here. Some of the big names are close to the Dolby theatre. Furthermore not only movie stars are located here. Musicians, directors, producers, theatre groups, fictional characters and others have a place as well. Worth a walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robert-Jan1972
30,5 mins feeling of being in Hollywood,"I visited this stretch during a 2-day travel to LA. Had heard about the place as it is famous but was underwhelmed by it. Don't get me wrong, it is an iconic place, but the excitement dies away within minutes of seeing the first few stars Besides, the place is super crowded most of the time (both the roads and the sideways are congested). You do get a lot of shops and plazas around the area, and there are always characters roaming the streets for a photograph. Though all entertainers and artists are there just for the greens. Overall, worth a quick shoot-and-scoot visit before moving on with your LA tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scI-ROCKco

20,Stars need update and facelift,"Been walking on Hollywood Blvd for years. Yesterday we were forced to take the walk when our Lyft driver couldn't speak English (shades of Bladerunner,) and dropped us off a mile from the Pantages. The stars are very much ancient history. They haven't spaced them so modern era stars can be inserted. We watch old movies back to the 50's so would recognize much more than melenials, we had to walk several blocks before we saw anyone recognizable, with the first serious star of the Apollo xi crew and another block to Jenifer Anistat and Reese Witherspoon in front of the W. the sidewalks along the way are also torn up in some areas so the ground is a bit uneven at places.As a history lesson you can use google to look up what era the stars came from and what they were famous for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OC-RaiderFan

40,Something to do,I was a little underwhelmed by the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I only went to find souvenirs but most of the places sell the same things. Meeting Edward Sissorhands on the strip was pretty cool. It's not easy looking for celebrity stars on her sidewalk without bumping into people. Overall experience is that it's just ok.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tib01
40,Hollywood walk,Please go with a friend if your going alone at night but I enjoyed walking by the shops and seeing the stars. I would do this again. Street performers at night were also great to watch just know when you take pictures with look a like celebrities you have to donate money to them for the pic dollar anit that bad for some photos ops with characters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyj950
30,Nothing special,You've always wanted to look at the Hollywood Walk of Fame then great it's cool to check out the Stars on the sidewalk and the Roosevelt Hotel. There's a couple really cool things on the boulevard that we meet like Ripley's Believe It or Not ect... they even have a Scientology store. I made a joke and pretended that I was going in and my husband said he would divorce me if I did LOL I choked and walked inside. At the end of the day it's a time killer and it's fun and keeps you busy. Parking is a bit though we gotta $95 ticket for accidentally parking in a red zone.

30,Culture Shock,This is a great thing to visit but be aware that it is very busy and not just with other tourists. There a people flogging their music cd. Don't fall into that trap. Also lots of people dressed as characters who you can have a photo with for a price. Also lots of bus tours operate from here which is handy if you're interested.

40,Good Times!,"It was an interesting evening on the strip! My advice is to stick around where you recognize the celebrities names, it gets a little sketchy further down the road. When you start to wonder who's names are on the stars cross the street and make your way back, it starts to get sketchy. All your typical places on the boulevard, lots of lights and people trying to scam a buck! Check out Rosevelt Hotel, it's a good time for Happy Hour and a good place to start your boulevard of broken dreams adventure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helooo99
50,History and fun all in one!,It's fun to walk and look on the ground to see all the famous names etched in gold. Some people you know- some you don't but it's fun to see them. Lots of places to buy souvenirs and lots of restaurants to eat at. A fun place for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/511annr
20,Not a thing unto itself,"The pink stars embedded in cement are nice to see, but it's just a fancy sidewalk in the end. Some parts of it are chipped, dirty or in seamy areas. And the placement seems random. Two ways to approach it: I'd find the locations of a few of my favorite stars and visit, maybe with some cleaner and polishing in hand, if you really care. Or just see what stars are on the way to actual places to visit in the area. Muhammad Ali's star is in a good location and is quite special, like the Champ himself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlyMeT0TheMoon

10,Street peddlers,"It was nice to finally get to the walk of fame and take photos. However there were too many peddlers around trying to sell you things.

Still the walk felt unsafe and was not a happy place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vitieddie

40,Avoid weekends and evenings and you might get to take some of it in.,"If you want to see every star .... it's a long walk on both sides of the street on Hollywood Boulevard and impossible to see every name and star in peak times.Lots of pushy hawkers and homeless people, but people watching is something else..

Weekends are extra busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hava2612

10,Over rated hole,Don't bother. Worth place in LA to visit. Our tour guide warned us about what to expect but even with that the place was worse that we expected. We started outside the Chinese Theatre and went a few blocks. Not worth the effort as the pan handlers and con men there have ruined the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryang741
30,Lots of Stars,You can't come to Los Angeles without walking Down Hollywood boulevard. The area is rather tacky but worthy of a visit just to say that you have done the walk. There is a diner called Mel's just off Hollywood Boulevard that's worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1954Elizabeth
40,Great attraction!!,We had fun here! Photos with the stars were fun! We were shocked at the level of homelessness and dirtiness as they don't show that on movies! Which is the only reason it got a 4 instead of a 5. Homeless people hassle you for money the whole way down. However we had a great time and loved seeing the walk of fame!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolekizia

30,Nothing Special just something to say you did,The Walk of Fame is just that.....you walk around and you see the celebrity stars on the ground. You see the hundreds of people dressed up as various characters (I mean how many spiderman for you need to see in a day and not to mention most of them are ran down dirty versions) trying to make money. And if you want to do some shopping there are a variety of stores. But all in all its not worth you paying for parking to get out the car to be on the crowded street with all the chaotic tourist and characters....my best tip is to drive by slowly and enjoy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aliciaf6
50,Beware Of People Selling Items,"Hollywood Boulevard is good place to visits. But beware people selling CD's as they force you to buy it. They will tell you $5 bucks, once you pull out your money they will gang up on you. I almost had i fight as they grab my US$20 bucks out of my hand...very disappointing. Heaps of people smoking weed everywhere.. bust stop, front of restauranrs...just everywhere.So fellow travellers be carefull...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eric681988

20,Was Expecting Much More Franckly Speaking!,"I was expecting much more attention to the clean and the typical american Business Mentality to preserve a typical Business American Attraction.However the street is full of Homeless, people asking money, and strange guys.I'm not willing to make a class differential, however this steet is very famous worldwide and I think they should have handle homeless people in a different way in order to make this particular street more attractive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8Giac6
20,Falling Stars,"It's great to take in the handprints in front of the TCL Theater, imagining the amazing entertainers who at one time place their hands into the concrete. Awesome. But other than that it's more of a let down. It's noisy, dirty and full of hucksters and con men. This is no place to take kids and think they are going to find it enjoyable. So sad to think of how great this run down area used to be back in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicroCleanse
40,Maybe overrated but worth walking it if you are there,"The guys and girls costumed in superhero outfits,charging for the pictures are folkloric,but surroundings are not very clean however the Hollywood sign is nearer so you know you are by the foot of the Hollywood Hills......parking is not easy but there are parking lots....so take the trip there......it's full of tourists though....well it is the film capital of the planet!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CFNordstrom
30,Disappointing,"Overall, the walk was pretty ordinary. It is hyped up and just names on a footpath. If you are a big fan of Hollywood and the ""stars"" it is worth a photo with your favourite actor or musician, but if you aren't too fussed then going to the Chinese theatre will probably be more than enough.I wouldn't do the walk again and spend more time at Santa Monica or Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msta2971
30,Fun to walk,Fun place to walk to see the stars name on the street. Start from la brea to vine...you walk about 2miles is enough .. don't waist your energy ..main attraction is Chinese mann theater to Hollywood and highland..where Oscar and Dolby theater.. and see Hollywood sign... beware character people if you take pictures you need to pay!....also don't ever grab free music cd from so call music artist they want you to give money later for that cd,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samlS8387KP
50,See it at least once,"We were told by a local how tacky it was here but this Aussie family enjoyed it. At 8pm found street parking. Lots of movie characters, locals and tourists wandering around.Bright lights along the boulevard and crowded.Shirley Temple handprints were cute and Stallones were suprisingly small. We star spotted then headed for Sweet. And it had closed. In this city where everything seems to be open very late we hadn't checked the time. It looked good as I stood with my nose at the window like a disappointed child.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandrabO4037VK

30,Nothing special,"This place is a kind of must-see in LA, but we were not impressed at all. It's just these stars under your shoes, but around it is dirty and crowded, very noisy, and it is annoying that it takes so much time to see these stars. If you are not local, be prepared that you won't even know 90% of these celebrities. Not worth spending time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natalie_Msk77

20,Dissapointing,"This is supposed to be a must visit in LA, but personally I thought very less of it while visiting. I suppose it is fun to read all these familiar or famous names on the stars that are located on the pavement, but apart from this, the area is decayed, unable to offer anything more than this to the visitor. We were there in the morning and it seemed to me that during the night it could be even dangerous to stroll around the area. Probably the best thing is to take some photos with background great stars inscriptions, just in front of the chinese theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilGrec0

10,Sick of the scammers,"Hands down the worst part of our LA trip. Got dropped off in an Uber which was great and within 20 feet was hit on by a scammer handing out ""free"" CDs. Cost me 20 bucks to get away from him. 2 minutes later got hit up again near the Chinese Theatre. Escaped to a shop, and got hassled by a 70 year old scammer. So dashed up and down the walk to see the stars, dodging grubby superheroes trying to have a photo with us. All in all the Uber couldn't arrive fast enough to take us away. Suggest if you really want to go you do it as part of a tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HockeyMan2048
30,It's okay,"It's okay and it's best to go early in the morning. We stopped here early in the morning before our tour bus arrived when there were barely any people around. There are tons of homeless people everywhere and extensive amounts of people constantly trying to panhandle you out of money every step of the way. In certain areas it is polluted with trash and you kinda have to move trash away from a star if you want decent pics. A lot of sex shops in the area so be cautious if you are traveling with children and every other block either smells horribly of urine or marijuana.Be careful with the panhandlers though. They are very persistent and can make you feel forced to either give them money or follow them.My sister and I were approached by Scientology followers and were literally followed and pushed into a building where we were almost forced to watch a video before we booked it out of there.Guys will tell you they are giving you a free mixtape but try to charge you for it or swipe your credit card. Just either ignore or say a firm NO. You can walk on the other side of the street to minimize it, but it's impossible to avoid it.There are also Catholic/Christian marchers in the area and will try to sell you bibles and convince you to convert to Christianity. In the recent days there are also ProTrump protest in the area around the TRUMP star, so try your best to walk around it and it shouldn't cause much traffic if you're trying to get through.Best to go early in the day. Panhandlers and protestors aren't out yet. You just have to deal with the trash and the homeless people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriar437
10,So Crowded,"Crowded and a little frightening. So easy to imagine an wallet going missing in this tight crowd. I felt accosted by the ""entertainers"" in the crowd pushing for attention and money. And lots of homeless littered around the neighborhood. Many of the visitors were from other countries, I can only think what a horrible impression this place makes. Poor LA you have a lot of clean up to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LEastsound

30,Not as cool as expected,"There's not a lot of things to do near the actual walk of fame. There are also a lot of homeless people and people trying to get you to buy their cd and what not. Don't get me wrong, it's a cool place to experience. It was just not quite as classy or clean as I was expecting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kennyb82
30,Meh.,"This is 'the thing' to do when in LA for the first time. I wasn't impressed. It was not particularly clean or welcoming. There were LOTS of guides peddling open top tours, cheap souvenir shops, and yes, star shaped plaques embedded in the sidewalk. If there are specific 'stars' you want to see - go nuts.

40,"Must see, but go during the day",Certainly a must see when you are in LA. It's great to walk up and down Hollywood Boulevard and look for your favourite star(s). Be aware that the strip is full of weirdos in the evening. I recommend to go during the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The3000
30,Hollywood Woalk of Fame,"The walk of fame is OK. You will usually walk along it on your way to other Hollywood attractions. It is spread over a large area so it is good if you have an idea where the stars you are most interested in are located. Many of the stars are people most of us have never heard of. Depending on the time of day and if there are any other special events happening it can be difficult to get a picture with a star, early in the morning seemed to be the quietest time. I found it difficult to get to a few of the stars we wanted in the busiest sections because of people trying to sell you something or the characters trying to encourage you to have a photo with them. Be aware that the characters dressed up offering to have a photo with you do expect to get a tip/contribution. If you have young children, I would avoid the busiest areas late at night, not that it was dangerous and we never felt unsafe, but it is hectic and there are a few strange people around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthadY2435VG
10,Overrated,This area has lost its collective mind. The city developed it with new construction but I can't take my kids to see the Mickey Mouse star when there's a guy dressed in drag standing on it and when people are openly smoking pot. Not a safe place for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaronj365

30,A must visit site in LA but be prepared for average,"I was very excited to go to the Hollywood Walk of fame, but... anyway, this is my summary:- Only a couple of blocks are ok, the rest are full of cheap souvenir shops, shady looking restaurants, people handing tons of leaflets, and other not-so-nice attractions.- The Chinese Theater is majestic, including the celebrity hands and feet imprinted in concrete. I really enjoyed reading the dedications and the names of the actors/actresses. My favorite was the one with the cast members of Star Trek!Again, like many attractions that are showcased in movies and TV shows, in person they are not as impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jorgetL7331JR
40,It was fun to visit a majorly famous location,"My family and I visited from Montana and had to hit the walk of fame to see what it was all about. We went to a few of the shops while we checked out all the stars on the walk. We went to the Ghirardelli store and it was Disney themed, which was pretty cool. Saw the Chinese theatre, outside was impresse, but we didn't take the time to go in. A few characters along the walk waiting for photo ops. We saw all we wanted to in a couple hours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hrdlcrw
40,Must see it,"The Hollywood walk of fame is something you must see it's a whole bunch of streets right down town with stars all over them, hand prints of the stars and signatures. It is the best tourist attraction in LA.

30,"A must-do, one time","When in Hollywood, you should definitely go to the Walk of Fame and walk by/over the stars, looking for familiar names. Hey, even take a pic with/of those you like most. This is a must-do, but one time will do.It's not glamorous or clean; it's so crowded, too. But, it's fun to go for an hr or two, though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yayras
30,Ghetto! But fun.,Really really big mix of run down and high end. There is so much Hollywood History but also A LOT of people and a lot of homeless. Smells a bit too.

50,Stars of the Stars,I thought this was quite interesting since the election was just completed and there is a barrier around Donald Trump's star that someone damaged. So sad someone resorted to this behavior like him or not but we know it's reality. The Hollywood walk of fame is so historic and I love to see the world through the lenses of so many. I enjoy seeing celebrities get the recognition they so deserve since they can pay for it but have to be allowed to get the star by others. I enjoyed seeing the many stars of past and present celebs. It is a must see. Loved it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Msfilmore

50,Must come if you visit LA!,"Despite being how busy this area can be, it is not that overly crowded with people. There is parking in the streets for 2hrs. free-- along Orange St. is convenient as it is close by to the Graumann's Theater. If it is important that you see the Hollywood Star of your favorite actor or actress, make sure that you check on-line where the exact location of his/her star is located to avoid a waste of time to walk through the entire Walk of Fame as there are over 2,500 of them.Lots of gift shops that sell Hollywood memorabilia are available all along Hollywood Boulevard-- worth to go in and see all the Oscar Awards available to be sold. Everyone who is a famous actor/actress including Mickey Mouse, Snow White, Donald Duck, and Winnie the Pooh have a Hollywood Star.

We were delayed arriving into LA and it was starting to get dark as we walked into town.The thing that surprised me was the stars start quite far out - I just assumed they would be in the vacinity of the Chinese Theatre. There are so many of them.The combination of it getting dark and the sheer numbers of people on the pavements made it nigh on impossible to get a photo.Expect lots of pushing and shoving as you get carried along in the crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiciaW

30,Nothing special about the Walk of Fame,"Driving and parking in this area is a challenge to be sure. Then, once you do get there and find parking, the actual Walk of Fame is nothing special.

40,So many stars...,This was interesting - on the one hand everywhere you looked there was a famous name and star to look at - on the other it was in the middle of what is a fairly rundown area where you wouldn't necessarily want to visit otherwise. If the place was tidied up it would be much better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PDHarry
40,Always fun to do (during day light hours)!,"This walk is pretty fun to do with the family, especially finding celebrities you know. To be clear, this is really just a couple miles of sidewalk on either side of Hollywood Boulevard with numerous star plaques cemented into the sidewalk. There is no charge to walk around and see all the stars and the walk will take you past numerous tourist attractions, street performers, etc. It is a good exercise and way to see fun parts of Hollywood.That said, this is a dodgy part of town with a fair amount of homeless, panhandlers, tourist attraction hucksters, etc. As such, you need to be aware of your surroundings and your possessions. The police work the main areas of Hollywood Boulevard pretty well but like any tourist spot, you need to pay attention, be aware, watch your property and take the appropriate precautions.Our biggest thrill on the walk was the Donald Trump Star. Since it was destroyed by an idiot who videoed himself destroying the star, a board now covers where the star was. It is then surrounded by road barriers and police tape. This has lead to many many people posing for pictures and further defacing the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbartoletti

40,Is It The Walk or Walking in the Midst of Live Theater!,"It's always fun to take this walk of Fame but it's not just about ""the stars"", it's also about the population of tourists and locals that inhabit the street. Live theater. Part of the treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rshna
50,Stars of the past and present,On most lists of attractions to see when in and around the L.A. area just don't set unreasonable expectations. There are many many stars that only my wife and I recognized so I think we enjoyed it more than the youngsters. (who hasn't heard of Bob Hope or Bing Crosby?) Be aware of crowds that begin around 9:00 - 9:30am so if you want to avoid get there before this time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmetcalf54

50,Entertaining,Our family has been living in San Diego for over 36 years which is only 1.5 hrs away from Hollywood. We're always at Universal Studios at least 7 times a year but never visited Hollywood Walk of Fame. It's a major tourist attraction so expect the crowd. Whenever you find the star you like just stop take pictures expecting photo bombers around. Also there's the hand & foot prints of the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhacruz94
20,"We came, we saw, we didn't linger.",Seedy. Crowded. Dirty. I've marked it off my bucket list. I don't need to go back.

50,"A must see, better in the morning ;-)","Walk of fame is of course one of the ""must see"" in LA. I recommend to go there in the morning hours, just around 9:00AM, to have a breakfast there and walk slowly from one star to another. If you come around noon and later, place is so crowded that you do not have a pleasure of walking anymore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HateAllLogins
10,A huge let down.,Not at all what we expected. Drove around for a few minutes but didn't dare to get out a car. Honestly the place was dirty with homeless people camping at each block. Trash scattered all over. Abandoned buildings. Very uninviting. It felt like the third world country. It's hard to believe that the city of this size is not capable to clean up this area and maintain its major attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/820lenkam
40,Some Things Never Change...,"The boulevard is a nice long walk, but can be very crowded. There are lots of people dressed in character (from Mickey Mouse to Spider Man) that will take photos with you for a ""donation"".

Enjoy the walk and remembering some who are no longer with us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ttaylor2u2
30,Worth doing but watch out for con artists,"Worth doing to see all the famous stars, but be prepared for a long walk up and down the opposite side of the strip. If you have children (or are an excitable tourist!), watch out for all the people dressed up in costumes who will insist on coming up to you and posing for a picture, then ask for money afterwards.Also be wary of the knock-off bus tours that con artist are selling all the way up the street!If you're looking for the Hollywood sign, you'll be able to see it in the distance from the Walk of Fame too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OopsGoose

40,Very busy,"Very busy, but that comes with the teritory.

Great shops nearby too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NasimaA22
50,Fun !!! Nostalgic !!! Circus !!!!!,"Fun during the day , great people watching , Grumman's Chinese theater has an IMAX with scheduled movie showings. Mel's diner right around the corner.

30,Something of a let down!,"If you imagine Hollywood and the walk of fame to be glamorous think again! The Walk of Fame runs for many blocks and appears gradually out of the grime! It's quite good fun to spot the names you know and love and the walk leads to Graumans where there are a number of hand / foot prints and signatures of the stars in the concrete which is again interesting but hard to enjoy between the bustling crowds, the endless vendors of sightseeing trips and gaudy tat and the constant traffic noise.

20,Not Like the Movies!,"The entire experience of the Walk of Fame can be skipped, in my honest opinion.The area is a tourist trap, it's overly dirty, and it's so busy with people that it's hard to enjoy. My friends and I decided to come back when it was less busy at night which helped with the volume of people. Large rats could be seen scurrying across the street at night, yikes!I suppose it's a 'must' in terms of a first visit to Los Angeles but it's not what you'd expect. I would say walk past it but don't go out of your way on your 'to-do' list when visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianJ2956

10,Don't fall for the free CD scam!!!,"The media had me believe the Walk of Fame to be some sort of glamorous place to be. We were sorely disappointed with what it had to offer. It really was just names on concrete for a number of blocks.That's not the worst of it. As you walk down the street everyone tries to sell you something. Tours being one, some vendors get quite aggressive. Buskers in costumes trying to get you take pictures with them, etc.Then the worst of them, the free CD scammers, which I unfortunately fell victim of. They approach unsuspecting tourists to give out free CDs. I assumed them to be aspiring artists waiting for their big break, so I stopped to listen to what they have to say. They give you the 'free' CDs, then personalize the CDs (sign them), then forces a gratuity from you.This, subtracting from the already mediocre experience, ensuring I'm never returning to place ever again.0/10 would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F7456WOrichardt

But there's also lots of people that will hassle you like Scientologist they were really pushy and it just wasn't appropriate with two young children.We saw the Hollywood sign and got our super imposed pic with it, that was fun.We looked in a few shops and the children played by the water fountain.There's parking for quite cheap surrounding it, we enjoyed our few hours down there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaveli
30,Not as expected,"When you hear ""Walk of Fame"" it brings to mind glamour and awe, which is anything but what this actually is in reality. DO NOT get sucked into paying for a tour of this as all you need to do is walk up Hollywood Blvd starting from Gower St. all the way to La Brea (2.1 km) and encompasses over 2,500 stars on both sides of the street. Check out Wikipedia's site for an exact address location of the ones you actually want to see, but the history behind the stars and what it takes for a celebrity to get one really takes the glamour out of it. What is more interesting is the historey of the Egyptian Theatre, The Chinese Theatre and especially the Dolby Theatre, but after myself having paid for the Walking tour edition of this, I would have much preferred buying a book and doing it on my own. Hollywood Blvd looks much like the busy downtown of any major city and was quite the downer when I realized there is no sparkle and pizzazz that USED to be ""old"" Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/846samanthaf

Some areas were crowded, like in front of the Chinese Theater and the wax museum, but we had no problems finding the stars we were interested in. Some of the tour operators were PUSHY, but most accepted a no, but you were asked many many times during the walk down the street. Many places to see and many places to eat nearby.

30,"Something you need to do, but probably only once","Visiting the Walk of Fame is on everyone's bucket list, so you should definitely go, but it's not somewhere you'll want to keep returning to. Seeing the stars is really cool, especially hunting out the ones for the different stars that you like, but by the time you've walked up and down the road, you're good to head off again. The most unpleasant thing about the experience is the number of people trying to sell you tours and gifts as you walk up and down the street - if they just left you alone to enjoy yourself, it would be a whole lot nicer!All that said, definitely go and visit - just don't expect it to change your life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdamRowlinson

50,Ticked all the boxes,"Saw all the freaks, everyone's trying to hand you something, it's loud, crowded and just what you'd imagine!Saw Trumps new star with graffiti all over it! Saw a red carpet getting set up, a film crew filming a show or movie. Even saw some black guys getting arrested.Hollywood done, all boxes ticked!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MVP_Tiling
50,Wasn't expecting much,"I couldn't knock any stars as I knew what I was in for... lots of walking looking at stars with famous names in a neighborhood that can be a little intimidating at times. I visited/stumbled across the walk three times. Early afternoon, early night, ridiculously late at night. All enjoyable, but was glad the final visit I had my boyfriend with me to make me feel a little more comfortable. Loved seeing so many familiar names... even taking a few pics here in there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarileesTravels
30,Good for a short visit,"While it's a ""must-do"" when you're there, it falls short of being overly impressive. Try to find a spot with cheaper parking, at least for the first two hours, then plan to spend one to two hours max. It's cool to walk around and check it out, but if you've been to Times Square, this is a surprisingly seedier version of a similar tourist trap. You just feel like any second you could get pick pocketed or harassed into taking a pic with a costumed character. Adults who are cautious can walk around fine, but bringing kids, especially preteens or teens doesn't leave a great impression, as they can be intimidated by these seedy characters and their pushy ways...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJLuv2Travel13
20,"Not nice. Watch out for Spider Man guy in holey, filthy costume.","Not impressed. The stars are cool, but when you have to keep watch to make sure that some jackwagon in a filthy, stained costume isn't trying to grab up your kids for a picture, it detracts from the ambience. The whole area is edgy and nasty. I'd avoid it. Or walk quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BriSanVan
30,You pretty much have to,"I mean, don't you? Coming here and not doing this would be like visiting NYC and not walking down Broadway... you could do it, but your friends would treat you oddly afterward.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielj23
30,It's not much to write home about,The area is a bit run down and could do with some refurbishment. While it is cool to say you have seen it there is nothing major to do there. The novelty of the starts run off after a while. We only spent so long there as I wanted to find the star that has the same name as I! Go see it if you are in LA but don't expect to be blown away!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/227gracek
20,What a disappointment,"The highlight of the LA trip was supposed to be the Walk of Fame. Walk of Shame more accurate. I understand it is a city with city ""problems"", but they can at least make an effort to remove the trash bins! Three days they were overflowing onto the sidewalk and into the street. The place is derelict and worn down, infested with vagrants and people who you would rather not want to see in a dark alley. Beggars, bums and every type of ""salesman"" on earth. Did not even dare to take my camera out for risk of it getting ""lost"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/245henrym
20,Revolting tacky,Dirty footpaths and unkept..very dissapointed. Lots of very dodgy people on footpaths handing out cards and cds and pamphlets trying to get people to buy stuff etc. Alot of homeless and beggars on footpaths too..america needs to clean up its streets and sort out these people,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buglesChchNewZealand
40,Fairly decent,"Overall it is just a long street with hundreds of stars on the floor. It's something quite unique and I don't think there's anywhere else in the world like it. For that reason I'd say worth going to see, even if you get the metro just nip off for one stop and walk around. Also around there lots of street performers mostly 'actors' from films. We saw Darth Vader, iron man, jack sparrow etc etc. Also head to the capital records building as more artists rather than actors around there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanoldinho
50,Hollywood Walk Of Fame,"Hollywood Walk Of Fame is an historical walk among around 2500 stars in Hollywood. The walk of fame is a walk around 1,3 miles, at Hollywood Boulevard from Gower Street to La Brea Avenue, and a few blocks at Vine Street",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterbN7198JF
50,Stars Galore!,"Enjoyed seeing the walk of stars, finding old favorites as well as new. Many interesting places along the way such as the hand and footprints at Mann's Chinese Theater, Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, and lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe. The street characters are entertaining but can also be a nuisance - they'll pose for photos with you but expect a few dollars in return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6422JKsusang
30,Nothing special,"I have to admit we weren't really interested in going there in the first place and it was as boring as we imagined. It's a walk, with stars embedded in the floor. We were there on a weekday morning, so it wasn't that crowded yet. So my advice is to go early, take your selfie (like everyone else) and leave before the masses arrive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paisam
40,Nice chill out walk,"It's interesting to walk along the walk of fame and see hand and foot prints of past and present celebrities. There are many people impersonating iron man , wonder women, Star Wars characters and etc. interesting walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annie0608
30,Interesting but nothing special.,"After seeing this on TV so many times I guess I assumed that there would be something ""special"" about this. There isn't! Yes, it's kinda fun to read all the names (not all true ""stars"" in my book) but the ""walk"" is just like any other busy city street. The street is dirty, sidewalks cracked and many homeless people everywhere. Overall, just OK.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M3427FIwilliams
40,Fun to do,This could take awhile if you wanted to look at all 4000. We found a few favorites. Be sure to see Muhammad Ali as his is the only one not on the ground. Fun to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scott8147
50,Trump star still covered up with wood board,"Our hotel is right behind Hollywood Boulevard. So we come out of the Highland shopping centre to the Hollywood Walk of Fame everyday to get to the metro.Lots going on in that area, including Trump supporters rallies.We walked the stretch down to see all the stars at Hollywood/Vine. Fun to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hellobayo
50,Don't go to LA without stopping here,"A trip to LA is not complete unless you see the walk of fame. It's such an exciting place. Located beside the first high school in Hollywood, the Dolby theatre, the TCL chineeese theatre and many more attractions not far from it. Lots of shops and restaurants that are more affordable than Rodeo Drive. There's more to see in this area than names of celebrities in a printed star on the sidewalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beckywtgh
40,Looks better on photos,"A must see in LA but looks better on photos :)Plenty of bars and souvenirs shops around and of course main attraction - stars :)We grab couple of pictures and couple of beers and go back to our hotel. It was worthy to be here, but probably no more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kolczan
40,Family & friends,"I thought New York City was crazy but Hollywood walk of fame is nuts, Please be aware that if you decide to take a pic with someone who is dressed in a costume, some of them will charge you for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatriciaD102013
40,Holiday on the Walk of Fame,"I stayed in a hostel on the walk of fame. The walk of fame strip is always busy however there is loads of ghings to see and do. Take photos of the stars names you walk over, take photos with people dressed up as movie characters, listen to some street artists or watch them draw. There are also heaps of souvenir shops",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keelia_1221
40,Awsome!!,Finally got to walkdown the world famous Walk Of Fame!! Its a fair amount long than expected! Lol Pretty cooltoget to see itin person,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shagg2016
30,Interesting,Fun to do while out and about in Hollywood. Stars are along both sides of the road. Outside the Chinese theatre you will find comments and hand/footprints from actors going back to the 40's.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cbernard66
40,Good fun -- lots of people watching,"We walked several blocks of the Hollywood Walk of Fame while in LA recently. We really enjoyed the stroll down memory lane as we came across the names of folks we had enjoyed as children. It was also a great place to people watch. President-elect Trump had just been elected and the hubbub surrounding his star was interesting. It had been damaged before we arrived, and some self-proclaimed ""Trumpeteers"" had covered and surrounded it so protect it. There was lots of screaming and carrying on, lots of emotions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WednesdayNightGirl
50,You need some time if you want to see it all,"We only had three hours to shop, look at the walk of fame and eat. We needed more time. I did not get to find all of the names that I wanted to find. It was neat to be there, but it was crowded. However, there is nothing you can really do about that because it is a famous tourist attraction. If you are in Hollywood, you need to see this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyl523
30,It's a walk along Hollywood boulevard,"It's iconic but it's not anything crazy. Lots of cool stores and museums nearby though, so great if you get bored. There are a lot of names - only recognized a handful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chauminhp
10,Run down and dirty - don't go out of your way to visit,Run down and dirty area. A big let down. I would not go out of your way to visit especially. We were very underwhelmed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7121YTrachela
30,So crowded,Street was packed with people and religious fanatics. We even saw one guy getting in the face of LAPD screaming at them but they were extremely well trained on how to handle that type of disruption.we didn't stay long was too packed and overwhelming but you got to go if you are nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryBM53
30,Seemed like a sketchy area,"We drove down the street to say we did it and that was enough for us. We didn't think we were there and then we looked closer and we were right in the middle. It is definitely a more run down area then what we had thought. It was still cool to drive down. If you're in the area, go for a walk or drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/klein3
30,You should go see,"Thankfully, on the day went it was fairly quite.. well sort of. Its good to see and search out the names you want to see as per you likes, preferences or fanship. Not sure I'd rush to do it, but def take it in while in the area. There are fairly reasonable car parks behind the walk of fame, so should be easy to park then go for your walk about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tartant2016
30,You don't need to walk the entire Walk of Fame,A lot of walking.You definitely don't need to walk the entire thing. I'd suggest staying at the top closer to the Roosevelt Hotel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachaelm183
30,Not a mucher,"The walk of fame is simply stars in the pavement on a stretch of road a couple of miles long. A lot of it particularly tacky with dubious shops, shady people and an area that does not feel particularly safe... the main drag is great though as you can tie it in with El Capitan, Roosevelt Hotel and Gaumans theatre. Great people watching trip to if you enjoy watching all sorts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliesH1095VY
40,"It's nice to see, but not all parts of the walk are worth it",We started at the end since there was place to park which to be honest was not a great choice since the neighbourhood was so so.When you walk more to the centre where more famous names are it gets a lot better.It's nice to go for one or two hours and just spot famous names you recognize.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdgarAdelmund2014
20,"Crowded, Dirty and Full of Homeless People","The stars go for quite a long way up and down the sidewalks. There are so many people that its hard to even see them. Homeless people all over the place. Nothing great here, just an overpriced area and tourist trap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTheRoadAgain1056
50,Really cool!,We didn't expect that many stars when we first got there. But trust me... the walk is long and filled with them so don't worry if you miss a few.We loved it because that place is filled with both history and fame.It's a must see for sure!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/576catalinan
30,Average visit with lots of touting,"Interesting to walk down this famous street to go through the names and also take in the sights. But as mentioned by many, there are just too many ""stars"" and musician touting for photo opportunities or ""free"" CDs that it can get quite unpleasant at times. Remember to visit the Hollywood & Highland center where there is a good lookout point for the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wolfverine
20,LOL,"Now it should be noted that I am from NYC. So things in other cities to me is always seeming somewhat smaller. Ok with that being said the Hollywood blvd strip is like a 4 block version of 42nd st Time Square. But its seriously watered down. Yes the Stars on the floor are there. It can be slightly crowded. But its basically an over priced tourist sight. Kinda dirty. Homeless ppl at the far ends. No where to park. You will have to pay for parking unless you find a meter, Which is rare. They have a few stores but its nothing to write home about. If you go it will be to take a few pics and leave. The Grove is a cool spot to hangout. Or Universal City Walk. Those 2 places are way better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mister219
50,Hollywood star walk....,Whether you walk on your own or go on a guided tour it is well worth the trip. We did both and made a day of it. Our open top bus tour was reasonably priced and made ample time to stop for photos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaH1771
10,A waste of time,"If you like over priced tacky tourist crap, and being hassled by down and outs ,people trying to sell you celebrity tours even following you up the road and not taking no for your answer ,then Hollywood is the place for you . It was not a great place to go with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silvercar68
40,Walk of fame,"My daughter went to Vegas and then drove to LA, there are a lot of homeless people. Not so clean as I thought it would be, lot of people begging for money. Took a tour ride through Beverly Hills and holly woods.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pisces63
30,Looking at the stars during lunch,"Visited the famed Hollywood walk of fame and there is actually not much too see. We strolled back and forth while looking down at the stars. If you have the budget take time to enter and enjoy the Hollywood wax museum , Ripley's or Madame Tussauds.There are characters running around for a picture nearby so if you have a spare buck, get a selfie or take a photo with them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spike94epi
30,Walking under the sun!,"The experience durin our walk was ok, however I have to say that is a very touristic place with lot of people expecting to get easy money from tourists. Picture with ""famous"" actors/characters are expected to be 20$... and there are lot of emerging musicians giving for ""free"" CD's for promotion but as you can imagine a gratuity is expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/804cristiang
20,Blah,"It's dirty. It's packed with people. It's dirty. There's a bunch of ""characters"" on the streets who want to take pictures only if you pay them. It's dirty. Every other person is trying to sell you a tour. And did I mention it's dirty? If you must go to cross this off your bucket list, then go ahead and do it - but don't expect anything glamorous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sptaz33
20,Really disappointed,"I was really disappointed with Hollywood Boulevard and the sunset strip area. Hollywood in general is dirty and not a very nice place to stay, I WOULD NOT recommend staying in the area as you're only close to a few attractions in LA anyway, much nicer to stay somewhere like santa monica. The walk of fame itself is not the nicest place, half the stores down the Boulevard are sex shops or pipe shops and there are some not so desirable people around, I wouldn't be so keen to take children there as its not a nice scene. Kind of disappointing that one of LA's most famous attractions is not so well kept.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/followherstomachkiwi
10,Eh,"Dirty, not well kept, most of the stars have crud all over them. Very crowded, so most of the stars you can't see anyway. If you walk further down the crowd disappears but you probably won't know any names on the stars. You should see it, but don't plan to spend your entire day there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaitlin8899
30,Glad we did it,"A must see to tick off the bucket list but a lot of hawkers hassling you to buy/look/donate. A very disturbing amount of homeless, beggars and religious fanatics chanting through loudspeakers. Not very clean and very busy.No regrets going though, was fun to see some Hollywood history.Safe on the main strip of Hollywood BLVD, but the streets surrounding are no go zones after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessjess84
30,A little bit of a let down,"It is fun to walk up and down the street and read all the names of the stars on the Walk of Fame. It was surprising to me (and even my kids actually) how dirty the area is. I thought it would be swept and maintained. There's cigarette butts and trash thrown all over. That was really disappointing. Also, depending on when you go it can be quite crowded. It seems you almost get harassed by ""actors"" in costumes like a dirty Elmo or SpongeBob. Musicians also press you hard to buy their CD's. It can be a little overwhelming, especially with kids in tow. Proceed with caution.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsW93
30,Not very comfortable visiting at night,Yes we did see all the stars on the walk of fame. However we were there with our 3 children and don't believe that this area is very well suited to children at night. Many strange people wandering around and didn't feel completely safe. My husband felt the same. We did it but not all it's cracked up to be...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kvsc
30,Watch where you walk,I would not bother just to see peoples names in the sidewalk. But if your in the neighborhood you might as well look. At least half of the names were unknown to me. The characters on the street can be very amusing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carribbeanmic
30,Walk of fame,"This is definitely something to see! However, I would say the area is not necessarily the best! It is something that I would go and see but not stay too long! It is a fun experience, although it was not what I was expecting considering ""Hollywood"" was not as nice of an area as I thought it would be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goabroad12
20,Wow! Really?,"Living on the other side of the world, one of the attractions we've always seen is...the Hollywood walk of fame.We arrived at our gorgeous hotel situated just a block away and could hardly contain our excitement! We knew it went for miles, so we decided to walk as far as Neil Armstrong. After our initial excitement, we were, with every step and every dirty star, and every other shop being an 'adult' shop, being harassed by people trying to sell us tours, people trying to sell us cds and dvds, very disappointed. Considering it's a major attraction the state that it's kept in, is really quite sad.Yes I'd like to go back as I'm really hoping that we just caught it on a bad day, and I'd like to give it another chance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P4655QPsallyh
30,OK,Nice walk down the street! Buy a souvenir from one of the shops; many people dressed like superheros will ask you if you would like to take a picture with them; take a pic next to your favourite actor/actress star for free; 1 hour or so should be enough :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afonsog2018
50,"Your in LA, this is a MUST DO","If you are making a visit to the Los Angeles area, I suggest seeing the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Celebrity stars highlight the walking paths up and down the boulevard. There are so many souvenir shops, cheap eats, shopping - and the best people watching place I know! Take a photo with the transformers, a super hero in the middle of a crowd. Nobody cares. It's just the thing to do. I am not too picky about what I grab to eat there....Just grab a nice cheap pizza - then go to get a sundae Ghiridelli, next to the El Capitan theater. I always have a great time here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micheleo612
40,Fun to Touch a Piece of Hollywood History,My family and I were attending a show on Hollywood Boulevard recently and paused to enjoy the Walk of Fame. It's kind of fun to actually know that you are standing on the exact same spot that some of our favorite Hollywood stars once stood!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summervacationeer
30,Not what we expected,"It really is a must see in LA, however be prepared to get harassed by everyone from Spiderman to people promoting their work while trying to get ur attention on the street. We were two girls and felt a bit uncomfortable really. Also we couldn't really enjoy the stars names as every time you stopped someone came up to you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reneeresh
10,Get in and then get out!,"This is one thing about Los Angeles that was 100% overrated.Yes the stars are there, yes there are famous signatures in cement but those are the only things that will be as 'Hollywood' describes.The streets are dirty, rubbish everywhere, people trying to grab you or shove 'free' cd's at you.Annoying people dressed in terrible costumes who seem to think that just throwing a cape on means that you'll want to take a photo with them and then tip them because they're 'Batman'.Several men dressed as Spider-Man - one of whom actually attacked a friend of mine.In a nutshell the entire experience is overrated.Get in - get the photos you want - and then get out before you get scammed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/513amys
40,nice crowded walk,"we walked down the street, had some ice-cream, nice crowded place, lots of tourists, lots of souvenirs shops",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Merounz
50,Finally saw it inperson,Took us a couple of hours to get there but it was worth the trip. Street was quite crowded but we got a chance to see it all including the Latin Music Awards ceremony set-up. My wife found that to be very interesting. Got to see the stars of some of my all time favorites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A5677PAdavidw
20,Every day there hustling,What a joke. You try to check out the stars on the street or the historical Chinese theatre and guys in costumes are constantly hitting you up for money. And every young guy is a up and coming artist with his $1.00 burned cd. Wanting 10.00 -$20.00 for it. Watch out for pick pockets also. Could not take the time to enjoy. Just constantly looking around for jackers and con artists. Don't bring your kids. Not what it used to be. Like Fremont street in Las Vegas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidbrianf2015
40,Must do experience,Awesome to say you've done it. Good walking and character impersonators. Always lots of people. Lots of theatres to seeWe didn't like the people forcing their products on us like CDs and it was a little sad to see so many homeless people,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyjane2015
20,Overated,We stayed in hotel round the corner from here but wouldnt reccomend to come out of your way. Area bit rundown and why anyone would come out of their way to see grubby stars with names on is beyond me. Some good pubs though near hollywood and vine. You might as well just draw some famous names on your drive if thats what you like to look at,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cssoperator
30,"Hollywood, where dreams die hard.","When you go to Hollywood Boulevard, if you think about it, you get exactly what you should expect. Many go to Hollywood with big dreams, we saw the red carpet Premiere of Dr Strange (we weren't invited to the Premiere, we were gawkers) and walked up and down and saw the stars on the street. The street is also dirty and smelly, people spit on Donald Trump's star, which is just really tacky whether you like him or not, you see people hustling and you see people who have given up as well as a bunch of homeless people. The service is generally indifferent, it seems like most of the waiters are aspiring actors, I don't know if that's actually true or not, or just my perception. It also seems like when we did the celebrity tour, that famous people have homes there, but few actually live there or are working on location most of the time. I love the Roosevelt Hotel and the Library Bar, met travelers from Sweden and England and chatted. The drinks are pricey but unique, they have no drink menu, you just tell the bartender what you feel like and they mix something together. I've visited twice now and enjoy it for a couple of days, it's people watching, sometimes famous people and lots of normal people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterT1634
30,See the stars among the Hollywood scene,"We walked a good bit of the section with the stars. Some we really wanted to see were right in fornt of the theater where an awards show was about to begin, blocking out view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180carlj
30,Interesting Crowded Walk,Pretty interesting to walk along and see the various stars. Just be sure to be respectful of those taking pictures and watch where you are walking. Very touristy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmacwi
40,Cool,Worth seeing. We enjoyed our walk along the walk of fame. We were there on for an event and we walked around to get a feel for the place and it was amazing. Lots of people in character and street performers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/230jacobr
30,Pretty sleazy,I was expecting the Walk of Fame to be a celebration of stars. What I found was a street full of tourists dodging impersonators trying to earn a buck and other people trying to give you 'free' stuff. You almost have to dodge many people and watch your back to get a glimpse of the stars.It is worth seeing if you are heading to the Dolby Theatre or Chinese Theatre but it's not the greatest place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WineTravelandSong
40,quick stop but a must see,we had a 30 min stop here on our tour and that is enough really to see the stars on floor and the hand prints in the cement. very busy and noisy here but worth a stop. there are people dressed up in costumes but they all charge if you want a photo with them. go to the shopping centre a few years along and go up the stairs to get a pic of the Hollywood sign in the back ground.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davey2828

30,Touristy Fun,"Not living in California, and never having seen it before, this was a fun activity to do once. Don't worry about getting the perfect picture, its a busy street with lots of traffic. Yes, they are just names in the ground, but entertainment makes this particular town go 'round. Beware the people in costumes, those giving away CDs and disgruntled tour operators when you turn them down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fergll
30,Fun to do once,I wanted to visit the stars and see a few I like. I found it to be dirty and felt harassed by the people pushing tours and homeless panhandling. It is one of the places I'll visit once and never go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chellebysea
30,Disappointing,"If you are in California with time to spend, then yes just walk through this ""Walk of Fame"" - we were not impressed as the surrounding area is not very attractive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422reginal
30,very short walk,Went there with my family (husband and kids). We took a grand tour from our hotel that took us all around LA including this walk of fame. It was just OK. Its a simple street walk with stars on the ground. Most of the names I have not even heard of. Was nice to see in any case but there was nothing outstanding.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EleonoraDeFelice
50,Fun,Fun to see all of the celebrity's Stars on the Hollywood walk of fame. Nice to take pictures of your favorite celebrity too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSW101

40,Not as glitzy as I imagined but a great Hollywood experience nonetheless,"Although the strip was crowded with all sorts of people - tourists, locals, street performers etc I thorougly enjoyed the visit.The whole strip is buzzing with activity and is littered with bars, pubs and diners so it's quite easy to stop over for a drink or munch if you're tired from the walk and then continue. Wouldn't mind visiting again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tainataleim
40,Very good,It was enjoyable to walk along and spot some of the most famous names in Hollywood. We really enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478phild
40,Donald Trump's Star,"Enjoyed walking around seeing the different stars. Donald Trump's vandalized star was what we were searching for. Sad that people will go to such lengths to prove a point. Was cool to see, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissar317
40,Too many stars to count!,"We tried to count the stars, but there were too many. Then we tried to count the ones we were familiar with, but there were too many of those, too. Could be because we are in our senior years, but it could be that the fame of those years seemed to last longer and be more glamorous than it is now. We went in the day time and it was very easy to view the stars. Guess it gets busier as the night falls. Unfortunately there are a number of homeless people in the area. They seemed harmless enough, but distracting. It was fun to be part of this Hollywood era when names and the artists they belonged to were real stars whose careers were not just a flash in the pan, but part of an era.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CyndyandByron
30,"A must see, but actually not as glittering as I thought it would be","It was fun at first, but tiring trying to find my favourite Hollywood Starr.I imagined it to be something more...p.s.: Where is Julia Roberts' Starr? ;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/421ulat
50,Good trip,"a good experience if it's your first time in Los Angeles California is part of the history of the city that often it is dirty but has very nice parties and whether or want to go, I recommend the Kodak theater where the delivery is made Academy awards presentations awards and many great artists, you can go to bus or take a taxi",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oscarp118
30,Overcrowded,"Too much people, and we were lucky the day we visited the avenue was close to traffic!All kind of people asking for money and all kind of tourist taking pictures of celebrity stars. Some of them were taking pics of every star... I can proudly say just took one pic of one star.But...you cannot leave LA without visiting this of course. So...just be patient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kinop2015
50,Interesting but not a glitzy as I imagined,Was great to see it but I was told not to expect any glamour and that was true. It was a bit of rough area. The stars were great to see as part of Hollywood though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikkistravelmap
20,Not that much to see or do!,We arrived in the evening and not a lot was happening. Lots of strange people hanging around and it didn't feel safe. We took some photos and got on the bus.Didn't see any security or police.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HATT202
30,"Been there, saw it, walked on the stars!",It was pretty busy when we were on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The stars in the sidewalk were in need of cleaning and the names were hard to read. Lots of tourists standing over them or the hand and foot prints. We found several that we knew who the actors were but so many unknowns. Many homeless around here and questionable characters. It was interesting to see but once is enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Usia2014
30,Kind of cool,"It is fun to see some of your favorite stars' stars on this walk. Definitely nothing special, but fun nonetheless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megan-woodruff
40,Interesting...,"Born and raised in CA and we'd never been to the Walk of Fame! Decided to check it out on our recent trip ""home"". It was interesting and great people watching!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LarRanTravels
40,It's Worth It,"Picture Time's Square before it was cleaned up...tons of people, folks hawking crap on the street, etc. But them, you see your favorite stars and it is so worth it! I spent about a half hour wandering through and am very glad I did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatthewR563
30,Now what was anticipated...,"The walk was a bit more dirty and unkempt than I anticipated. There was a lot of foot traffic, but more important, in many locations along the route were dirty. Not what I anticipated and I can't recommend this walk until you have a serious desire to see the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Netwalker2k15
30,Great to See and say you've been there,"Good to 'spot the stars' but there is so much more going on - all weird and wonderful, especially at night. Outside of the Chinese Theatre was also good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sals1701
50,Great,"Walking the side walk seeing all the stars names was of interest but seeing the hand,footprints and signatures was the highlight of the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rpound
10,What a Disappointment,"Having just returned from Los Angeles, we are still in disbelief at how worn, dirty, and the lack of care the sidewalk with the stars really is. Your picture of Walk of Fame is nothing like it really is. There's no shinny sidewalks and the lack of pride is evident. It definitely won't be a place to recommend to anyone visiting Los Angeles. Streets are pitted, lack any kind of maintenance. A true disappointment!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/852suzannes
40,Great place full of interesting people,"We only had a limited amount of time here during our visit which was a shame as there was so much to see. We went once at night and once during the day. Night time was a great experience to see everything lit up - but the Hollywood sign was not lit up at night so we couldn't see it. Day time you could see the sign from a little shopping plaza if you went up a few stairs. The walk of fame is fun to see, you have all the shops in the area from normal shopping to lots of souvenier shops. Several places to visit such as Hollywood museum, wax works, madam tussaurd's. Lots of random weird and wonderful people up and down the walk dressed as famous people - has to be seen. I didn't like the couple of guys with snakes round their necks approaching you for photo's - got a phobia of snakes. The area wasn't what we thought but we did enjoy it - some parts look a little seedy. Also lots of homeless and people either drunk/drugs/ill - you wouldn't really know which; sad to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orlando2010
30,Did not know some,Very busy. Trying to look while walking is a little difficult. Did see Donald trump star before it was vandalised. A lot of the stars I did not recognise and some are duplicated due to multi work.I have been and seen it but don't think I will return,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jewels18
40,Interesting,There are a bunch of characters on this street! Lots of street preformers! It was neat seeing all the stars and the original concrete that the stars put there hands and feet!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/197sunshinecass
40,Get lost on the walk,This is a good place to find your favorite celebrity's star. I like to get lost walking around this area. Great for pictures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/715autumnm
20,Didn't live up to expectations,"As a movie buff I was dead excited to visit the walk of fame - sadly it did not live up to my expectation. We visited at night and didn't feel safe, with lots of drunks and homeless. The stars are OK but very little efforts gone into maintaining them. Area felt very grotty.Such a shame as, with a bit of effort, this could be turned into a really nice place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonh425
30,"Not Glitzy, Stylish or Special. We never expected that!","Who's not heard about the Hollywood Walk of Fame?We arrived after parking in the Holywood and Highland centre (see my review) and stepped out on to.... OK, yes, loads of stars but the overall experience didn't match our expectations. LOADS of people, of course, but it simply didn't seem to have the class and style we'd imagined.Then we realised why! Everytime we've seen this Walk of Fame, it's been when some HUGE filmstar or noteable has been receiving the accolade so everything's apeared to be glitzy, stylish and special.When we arrived, there were no stars receiving the acolade. We're special, but not THAT special so no-one made any fuss of us (!) and it all felt just a tad too touristy, busy - and anyway we didn't actually recognise many of the names!Worth noting that we arrived just as the 2016 Presidential election was drawing to it's rather bad-tempered end and loads (not all, though) of people were walking over the Donald Trump star and behaving rather rudely!If you've found this report helpful, please leave a coment. Thanks",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pontefract

Can spend hours looking at the plaques on the sidewalk in the walk of fameLove the hand and footprints at Grauman's Chinese theatreEasy access to Hollywood and Highland Center shops and restaurants,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jktravel7
20,Not what expected,"In TV it looks more famous, in real life it isn't so special at all. Was a bit disappointed. So if you think that you have to see that, then I understand, just don't expect to much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimeaG6
30,dirty but a must see,"The biggest surprise about the Hollywood Walk of fame was how dirty everything is. Not just the streets, but the walk itself, the stores, the view. I was also surprised at how many stars there were. The highlight for us--lunch at the Hard Rock and the view of The Hollywood sign from the shopping center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelblond
20,"Overrated, lots of tourists, expensive parking...","I was here on a hot summer day, the place is overrated, the parking was expensive, and there really is not much to see... (unless you're into looking for your favorite star on the sidewalk and taking selfies... its just not for me. There is really not much to do...This amazing city has a lot more to offer, use your time wisely!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnW885
30,Only worth a one time trip,"Cool to see, but filled with homeless people all over the streets asking for money, kind of dirty. Loved seeing the stars I wanted to see and the Chinese Theatre was cool. Definitely something I can cross off the bucket list, feel no need to go back though,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationcatcher
50,Nice stars,One of the main landmark of LA. A very crowded place people from all over the world taking photos of their famous actors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlHashimi
30,No what I wait all my life,"This place is not what im thinking all my life, is a regular place with the stars, Im just asking life what happen when all the stars comes to this street and stay in the floor and is a regular street with nothing gorgeous scenography... but is fine...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joseacevedotp
30,Has to be done,"Similar to many attractions there are souvenir shops, “Characters” touting for tips and beggars. The Chinese Theatre is there and there is a good view of the “Hollywood” sign from the 4th and 5th floor walkways of the shopping centre. We walked and saw the stars as we walked, but soon lost interest. Has to be done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mingle888
30,Unsafe,Not what we expected- we visited the walk of fame after seven pm and the full street was full of beggars and men trying to sell CDs / who has a CD player these days - when you don't buy them it can turn unpleasant. At every street corner you get hassled to purchase something and I would definitely not take children after dark . This was a let down and spoiled the experience. On the upside the gift shops are very cheap.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T8859WGcraigl

10,You can skeepit,"I thought that this place is really inspiring by Hollywood , unfortunately find it very cheap place with hundreds of tourists whom don't know what are they looking for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/93gadib
50,Well worn tourist trap but still a must-see!,You have to visit. You may not even want to but it's so Hollywood that you just have to! In my opinion once is enough (although I've been several times) but it's so unique that it's great to see it with your own eyes. Night time is best and avoid weekends if you can. Park in Adjacent shopping mall for cheap parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markybritt
10,If you like the smell of weed and urine...,... considering this is meant to be a landmark for tourists there has been no attempt to keep this part of the city maintained.As you walk down the street you go from homeless people to drug addicts to people in tacky fancy dress. All the time you are hounded with flyers and cds and beggars asking for change. You can't really enjoy the walk of fame and see all the stars that you would want to see.Such a pity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280fallonb
40,As American as a piece of Apple Pie that has been named after someone famous!!,"It may be easy to be cynical about this attraction and some will complain about the ""star selection process"" but this is a part of America. To make the visit special check the Walk of Fame website in advance to see if there will be any new stars added during the time when you will be visiting. It can be extra fun if you are a fanboy/fangirl of an honoree. There are rules that segregate the honorees from the fans, but you still may have a chance to hear the person introduced and accept the honor. Be aware that in addition to friends and fans, there are some autograph vultures that are also drawn to the event. The autograph vultures can be rude, smelly and may even hate the ""star"" The vultures are only there to badger the guests and try and get things autographed so they can sell the items on Ebay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryanbZ3939PG
20,What a disappointment.,"We were so disappointed, the location was dirty and full of homeless and beggars.The walk of fame itself isn't even cleaned from one day to the next. There certainly isn't any glitz or glamour at this location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxMs83
30,I see staaaaaaars,"Also a street you will regonize, but when you are there it is not an experience you will never forget. You can view the Hollywood sign. A lot of posibilities to have a sight seeing bus tour. So just a street with stars on the pavement. A Hooters restaurant, Madame T. and that is all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robv605
20,Been there seen it,Been there and seen it and left as soon as possible! Hollywood is possibly the least glamorous place I have ever been - full of people trying to push things on you to buy and begging vagrants as well as being a really scruffy and run down area - it looks and feels like skid row.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G_O_C479
30,These boots are not made for walking,"It is a mission to find your favorite celebrity but it's worth it when you do. It can get tiring and packed as well so bear with it. The few that I found, I took pics with and had fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mpho3105
20,Disappointing,"We visited as it's one of the first things you think of when visiting LA. Unfortunately the walk wasn't as grand as we were expected. The area was quite dirty, many of the star floor tiles were dirty and scuffed and the whole area was full of people hassling you to buy tacky souvenirs or go on Hollywood star tours. I guess it's something you do once so you can say you've been but I wouldn't go back now I've visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/750chantellel

30,Just okay,"I am guilty of not understanding why people would want to take s picture of someone's name on a star. It is neat to be reminded of all the fabulous people who have been famous in Hollywood, but I don't know understand why people lie on the ground to get their picture with the star and name. I try to understand but I just don't get it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/netdood
10,Disappointing,I'm sorry friends this was a horrific waste of time. As you walked down the street It just feels like depression. It makes you think that this place was the place to be 20 years ago. Yes there are some interesting things to see and yes there are some cool well-maintained attractions along the walk. Unfortunately a lot of it looks like abandoned buildings. Unless you're looking for a particular star there's nothing to see here move along.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E9358FFjustinm
50,Awesome sights,"Loved seeing the walk of fame, Hollywood sign, Chinese Theater and other famous sights you read about. Neat to see people dressed as famous people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandy19579
10,Disappointed,"Was really looking forward to seeing the handprints and walk of fame but was really disappointed. The hand prints are in a very small busy area and are purely a few prints in concrete nothing special at all.Walking down the street reading the names was nice for a few mins but the area lets it down, it's is just like any town high street (full of chain stores).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/i_buckley

50,Most enjoyable!,What better way to spend a day in Hollywood than walking along the walk of fame finding all your favourite stars! We had loads of fun trying to find particular stars and in our hunt found some previously forgotten and unexpected gems! Well worth the walk and very enjoyable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jo-MollyBennett
40,One of those things you have to do!,It was great seeing all the stars. It was a lot dirtier than I expected and there are a lot of homeless people and people begging. Also be wary of all the lookalikes and people dressed up. You can get your picture taken with them but they will expect money. We saw a lot of people falling into doing this without thinking!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/16kays
50,Walk with the Stars,"We really enjoyed the Walk of Fame, found stars like John Wayne, Jamie Foxx, Steven Spielberg, Celine Dion and Daniel Radcliffe. The street was very busy with people trying to sell you cds and annoying you, but it didn't take away the excitement for us. It is right near the train station, and opposite the Jimmy Kimmel Theatre, and you can see the Hollywood sign in the distance from the building above.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R1326DCpatriciaw

Also, people dressed up as characters asking for good amounts of money. Ive never seen such aggrestive people in my life. Never take anything handed to you on this street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hothunny
10,Surpised,"I expected that the Hollywood Walk of Fame would be in a nice section of LA. To our surprise, it was dirty, seedy and reminded me of Broadway or 42nd street in NY in the 70's. not worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marinad498
30,Long walk,Never expected that this was so long have to walk to find a speficic person. No rhyme or reason to location of stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pensgir
40,After long years.....,Got to see this all the time on TV and movies but finally after long years got to see walk of fame in real. Very crowded area full of tourist. Worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reviewer1216
30,Pretty good but a lot of dregs,"Expected the area to be more devoid of begging and pushy people trying to sell their wares.Whilst the chinese was really worth a look to see the stars names and foot or hand prints, the walk of fame was a little disappointing. Really felt uncomfortable walking the street after 11pm. Not so bad during the day. Wast sure whether to laugh at or feel sorry for the many people dressed up as characters trying to earn a buck from tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveanna24
30,Dirty,Omg hollywood is so dirty full of tacky stores and homeless people. The walk of fame is literally filthy not like on the television. Didnt feel a safe or nice area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirstyb42

20,Spend 2 minutes and leave,If you really must see this then spend a couple minutes and make haste out of there. The City of Los Angeles really needs to clean this place up. The only interesting thing was seeing the sizes of the different hand and foot prints.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JereF1
40,Vacation,"The walk of fame goes for about 18 blocks and has about 2500 stars on it. Very neat to see some of them. It's a crazy place to walk and see all the wanna be stars out on the street. For me, it's like Vegas on Steroids. Loved it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Putterking
30,Very very touristy,"Another place for you spend some time if you are in LA want to tick off an item from your list. Always crowded with tourists walking around and vendors, hawkers, people in fancy dresses, etc. to make a living. Try and visit when the sun is not up (since California sun is harsher than any other place and can burn your skin). Its fun to walk along the stars with their names on it. Also the mall where academy award function happens. There are name of the best movies along with their names on either side of the stairs when you enter the Dolby theatre, which has space to add up-to 2069! Also, you can see the Hollywood sign from the walkway connecting different sections of the mall. All in all, a fun place to spend a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaassh

30,Just take a quick stroll and a few pics,"First impression, not as glamorous as I had anticipated. Just take an hour or so to walk around and then move on. The area by the Dolby Theater and Jimmy Kimmel seemed ok in the night time, but other areas were a bit sketchy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeep_girl_00
30,Worth a visit,Worth a visit just to say you have been. Busy and lots of people pushing all sorts as you walk along. Worth an hour or two but it's tourist prices and everything that goes with that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyw496
30,Stars are cool to look at & interesting things to see,"Chinese Theatre, the Walk of Fame, Dolby Theatre -all are cool to see. But Hollywood Blvd is cramped with people begging for money, requesting ""donations"" for their free CDs or pictures taken with them in a costume. So to them-Just get outta my way and let me enjoy the damn sights!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kameronl
40,For those who love celebrities.,"This area is right around where the Oscars takes place and all the celebrity culture. If you are into celebrities and all that it is worth a visit. Otherwise, it's like being in Times Square aka a nightmare. It was supercrowded, people are stopping to get pictures of the stars, locals are trying to hand you flyers every 5 seconds and people dressed up are trying to get a picture. The lights are long so when you get to a cross walk and wait, its a while so there's always a mass of people waiting with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marield1990
20,"Dirty, poorly maintained.",Given the stature of this tourist attraction I expected a lot more.The pavement (sidewalk to Americans) itself is poorly maintained and full of holes. A lot of the stars are very dirty (Walt Disney for instance is covered in bird poop).Beware of the people outside the Dolby theatre/Chinese theatre area. Forcing themselves on you trying to sell you their crap. I found it an oppressive place to be.Not a nice experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjfinch
30,Busy,"Went as part of cycle tour , to busy for our liking, for me don't get what's so great about seeing people's names on the pavement . Not really into all that Hollywood stuff.

40,Worth visiting,Very cool to see the stars on Hollywood streets. Check out a Jimmy Fallon show. Hard Rock is cool. Some cool bars and shops.Go during the day. After dark it gets a little sketchy.

The first time, eight years ago, the sidewalks were cleaner and there weren't homelesses asking for money. But that didn't bother me. I like to see the stars on the sidewalks and look for my favorites, although i know that having your name there envolves politics and sponsors. I like the stores around, the shirts, the sight of hollywood sign, etc. We saw a movie on kodak theatre... It was great. During the week is not crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VivianeMuller
30,Afternoon on the town,"I was so disappointed in the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was not crowded on a Wednesday afternoon, but the area is so unkept, tacky, trashy and in front of many foreign tourist trap type stores. I walked down the street looking at all the stars and did not feel safe at all. There were lots of homeless people on the street begging for money during my afternoon walk. It cost $30.00 to park my car; lots of liter in the street gutters, and trash liter on the side walks. I ended up paying lots of money for parking but did not stay long in this area. However I did get back in my car and drove through the miracle mile area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Apopka1564
50,A Must See.,"This place is crowded and was so hot during the summer. But it's just something that's so cool to see! Walking the whole thing would take forever, but finding your celebrities and taking a picture next to their star is pretty cool. It is definitely a cool experience to have. I would go back in a heartbeat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763randit
40,Because you have to,When a tourist you need to go here. It was fun checking out all the stars and remembering your favourites from times gone by and now.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lj4l
30,Did it just to say we had done it once,"We had never made it to Hollywood on previous visits to the LA area, so we decided to go check it out. We were here on a Saturday, so I am not sure if it is normally as crowded, but it was extremely crowded. We drove around for a bit and ended up paying $30 to park adjacent to Hollywood Blvd. It was kind of fun to look at the stars on the Walk of Fame and we stopped to take some pictures with the various impersonators roaming the streets (for a tip of course), but it was so crowded that it was hard to enjoy any of it. The area was kind of run down and a little seedy. We were glad we went just to say we had experienced it once, but it would have been more enjoyable with less crowded conditions (but am not sure if that exists).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelrvo
30,So there are stars in the pavement...,"We visited Hollywood because we were in LA and saw the famous pavements. I'm afraid they're a bit underwhelming. Some of the names won't mean much to anyone under 50 who isn't American. Why some people get a star and others don't is not easily explained - I didn't see any Beatles or Rolling Stones mentioned, but Queen were, for example. What is more concerning about the Walk of Fame is that it is in a pretty grotty area and it will take more than some fancy paving to change that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJE55
20,Tour from Las Vegas,Not what we thought it would be. Not like you see on TV. A ton of people walking looking at the stars but also homeless and druggies all around. One guy was cooking a spoon of H right on the street corner.tour was get off bus and walk around for 2 hours but we were ready to go after less than hour. And that included a stop for a beer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harvw142
40,"It's a daft bit of fun - if it's your thing, you will enjoy it...","Obviously depends on your time schedule and priorities, and if this is up there, then it won't disappoint. You wouldn't make a point of going to see this if you weren't interested. Simply by being in the area seeing other things you will encounter these stars. We walked for a few minutes, and for some curious reason, it did make us smile every now and again when you come across a name that resonates with you. Recommend, no, not really. Enjoy it, yes, strangely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harrison-F-Carter
20,"Dirty, crowded hassle","We decided to check out the Walk of Fame along Hollywood Boulevard on a Sunday afternoon beginning of October. We were shocked at how disgusting it is. The street stinks like a urinal. There are homeless people laying around everywhere which issad. Touts all along trying to sell you celebrity tours and others in character costumes, with animals, or handing out balloons etc to your kids and wanting money for it. You have to be firm with a No. Its a real tourist trap. It was crowded and just a tacky strip of endless souvenir shops. We had thought about taking the kids to Ridleys but by the time we walked a few blocks we couldnt get out of there quick enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/63janetp
30,Is there anytime this place isn't crowded?,"Interesting to see the stars of ""stars"" but the crowds make leasurely enjoyment difficult. I'm sure there's a way to know where stars one wants to see are without paying for a guide but I didn't care that much. Was enlightening to see the wide variety of people who are represented from all spectrums of the entertainment industry. Once is enough for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bikingfarmer
50,ALL PART OF THE HOLLYWOOD TRAIL! SEARCH OUT YOUR FAVOURITE!,"All along the pathway, you'll come across these Stars (which, by the way have to be purchased by the owner! The only one who refused is Barbra Streisand!). Twenty five years after my first visit, Tom Selleck's star is still here and I had no embarrassment sitting beside it for a photo! - Mind you, it took a bit longer this time to get up! My hands fit Judy Garland's prints perfectly (situated in front of the Chinese Theatre). Be prepared to bump into others looking for their favourite! A fun half hour spent searching! Enjoy the ambiance of the Walk of Fame!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christy_Luv2
50,Fun on Hollywood Blvd.,"First time to visit. So glad we made the trip. Traffic a little hectic to get there (but probably just typical driving in LA) but plenty of parking. Enjoyed seeing all the stars and the hand prints, etc. Took a few pics. A fun place to visit. Be careful after dark- could get a little scary when walking off Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872wallacec
50,Always enjoyable,This is my third time on the Walk of Fame. Always cool to see all the stars and even cartoon characters on your walk. Really enjoyed seeing so many names that you haven't thought about in years. Good way to spend some time walking around but don't walk into others. Lol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108riderp
50,It's a must see but you can 'do it' in a very short order,"I don't quite understand the charm of all those footprints but i guess it's historical and people have to say they went there when they came to Hollywood. I hope you're not disappointed.There are a lot of people there on the Blvd, from tourists to people who are posing as 'icons' who want ou to pay themif yu are photographed with them. YOU do NOT have to pay.there are a couple of actors who are quite good int he impersonation department but i'd just as soon go across the street to the MacDonalds or eat pretzels at Wetzels or visit starbucks or the coffee bean. BUT this is a must so you canshow people you were there and take a photo with the handprints of your favorite star..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKZ90027
30,Too crowded!!,We could not enjoy it because there are so many tourists and people selling us tours- could not see anything,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/776brigitten
30,"A ""Must Do"" in Hollywood","Although this is a ""must do"" it is definitely not as I expected. Some areas of the walk are nice, most are dirty and run down. We visited in May, which must have been a good time as it was pretty quiet. Mostly street vendors were to be found and very few tourists. It is fun to find your favorite actors/actresses stars and best of all - free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O1331CVkareng
50,Its what you expect,Walking around is cool just to see these names but honestly the area does not have a lot to offer. It is a tourist trap,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I3272RSjamesn

50,Have to go here but a but trashy and sleazy,We went here to look at the Walk of Fame stars and look at the Grauman Theatre and Dolby Theatre. We had people giving us CD's and Superheroes (not!) wanting photos for tips. Great to see the foot and handprints but don't hang around too long as it can get a much with all the hawkers etc,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Insearch0fadventure
30,Just another street,"Expected more, but it was just another LA street with stars embedded in the pavement plus lots of wanabe Michael Jacksons, etc. Also a number of beggars dotted around the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robs659
40,Take it for what it is,"What is it? It is a street with stars on the sidewalk, that is it.Why go there? To find your favourite people's stars, I found kind of fun to have a look at them and to find some well-known people.You can also get the exact location of a specific star on internet, which can be helpful since it is really long.Do not have high expectations, it will be as fun as the people you go there with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AgeoG
30,"Not good for kids, and not that cool","I would not go here if you have kids. Now, if you want to scar your kids for life, then go right ahead and bring them here. There are many people here, so too crowded, and you see many different things that you don't normally see in Chicago, for example. It is very interesting, and not that fun. You barely know half of the people that you are walking past. (I'm talking about the stars)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taylorj348
40,Start to Finish...,Never found where this actually started but it was cool to see the names of the stars down the street. Its a tourist thing so some may like some may not but was nice to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNChic615

30,Was it all?,"Once again I was expecting more. The walk of fame was just a normal street with all sort of names, some of them unknown. Only for events it seems that the tiles get polished. Nice, something to see but not a wow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalavajeGo
50,Site seeing 😎the best!,"We stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel which was near everything you may want to see including the Red Carpet event, movies being shot on Hollywood BLVD., TMZ van on the BLVD. with plenty of shopping while reading the Famous walk of Stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolenL9792YI
40,"It's a ""must do"" but definitely not glamorous!","We've been many times because we like to people watch but...Hollywood is dirty and stinky...know that! Pretty much 90% of the area smells like urine and marijuana! After an hour and a half walking and shopping, I literally felt grimy! But it is interesting and there is always something going on 24/7! Unless you are paying big money, most of the motels near Hollywood Blvd. are DISGUSTING! We always stay at the Motel 6, it's clean and near the action!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunnyJoy
20,Nothing interesting,Nothing interesting or impressive. Majority of the stars are not famous enough. The most valuable thing are cheap souvenir shops and even souvenir supermarkets on the both sides of the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coopriyanoff
20,Worse then times square,Too many tourist trying to take pictures of the floor while vendors and street people try to sell you stuff from food to tours. And a lot of homeless people asking for handouts. Not my idea of fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mannyfreshman
50,Immerse in Hollywood all for FREE,"- Free attraction as one walk pasts Plaques cemented on floor of famous personalities from Md Ali to Michael Jackson to Donald Trump to entire who's who of bollywood- Dolby Theatre: Home of Oscars, with list of all Oscar winning best Movies since inception- Take a 99$ ride in a Ferrari or Lamborgini to famous ""Hollywood"" signage up the hill & drive it too. Awesome experience if you have not driven a Ferrari before (like me)- Lots of Soveniors shopping- Head off to ""Hooters"" for amazing drinks with some amazing chicksPerfect day trip on a Sunny day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/308sidg
40,An observation into Hollywood of yesterday!,"The stars along the sidewalks are neat to look at. Hollywood seems dirty and run down to me, other than certain spots along way. We visited on a Thursday and the sidewalks were EXTREMELY crowded with tourists who were doing the same thing that we were. There are many people handing out flyers and pamphlets for this and that (which are annoying after a while). The people on the streets were not ""over-friendly"" and bumped into us non-stop! You can rent a Lamborghini for $89.00 if that's your thing - good luck with the traffic and being able to enjoy driving it though)! There is an Asian gentleman that sits close to the Grauman Theatre that does face sculpting out of clay and he is just amazing. We had one made of our 14 year old Daughter and it looks just like her. That is the nicest souvenir we could have possibly brought back from our visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cdin10ac
30,Got to visit. But met some not nice people,"I wanted to see the stars, something you see on tv all the time. Full of tourists, which also means full of locals, selling, hustling or preaching.We walked down one end of the street then back up the other side. In the hour we spent there we encountered a huge group of religious people with huge banners preaching about going to hell....that wasn't bad was interesting to see, kinda what you expect.We also saw two men fighting, I was terrified. Maybe I have watched too much tv but I thought they were going to pull guns out.Then last but not least DO NOT speak to guys who are handing out CDs. We made that mistake. They give you a CD that they have recorded themselves, they are musicians trying to make it big... So you accept, have a little chat, seem nice. THEN they will pull out a big wad of cash asking for a donation... So mistake realised, we give him $5 and go. 2steps later ANOTHER one comes up to us, this one wasn't as friendly. My husband politely said ""no thanks, I already have one"" they guy explained it was different. While all this is happening I'm trying to get my husband to take a photo of me next to the Michael Jackson star. The guy kept pestering my husband who again said he wasn't interested and was trying to take a photo of me.... That's when it turned nasty. The guy got really aggressive and said ""you can't speak to people like that round here"" at this point I stopped caring about my photo and grabbed my husband to go. My husband is a big guy, loads of tattoos, so actually looked quite similar to the guy who was aggressive to us, but I know my husbands a nice guy, on first glances some people might judge him by the way he looks, so I don't judge people by the way they look, but I felt threatened by this guy and just wanted to leave. Put a bit of a downer on the experience.If you want to go its worth it, just don't engage in conversation with anyone hanging about. Hopefully we just had a few unlucky encounters!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoJoLizard
30,Must do but not for long,This is a must see stop just for the fact you are in la. However after a while it get boring. Good for pictures but not much else.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davideG6065HC
30,Not very informative and really long,you have to know this place but very quick because LA have much more interesting things to do. go where more people are,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eduardo284
10,Govan wine ally with heat...,"This has to be the biggest disappointment of my trip, I could not see any film star going within a mile of this it was dirty smelly ridden with poor unfortunate people begging, the stars on the actual street where mostly dirty broken trodden paving stones, the picture shown above bear no resemblance to the actual street, I am sure this was special at one time but sadly i feel time and lack of care and attention has simply made this icon street a run down piss and excrement filled embarrassment to the people its meant to honour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ericskine
40,Must See in LA,"I am not a huge celebrity follower, but this is auch an iconic location, it is a must see when in LA. The atmosphere is great, especially at night, but hang on to your purse as in any big city. Plenty of smoke shops, cheap t-shirt shops and bar style restaurants line the street. Some of the street performers are pretty amazing, but remember to tip if you watch the shows or take photos with the costumed characters. This is how they make a living.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MollyME17
40,Great Visit,We had fund walking around the area with great weather .Restaurants and shops can be found as well in the area .You will witness pretty much all the stars name on the way .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/277ericd
30,Cool...,"Ok so this was one thing I wanted to see when we got to Hollywood.You can literally walk up and down the pavement trying to find your favourite actor/actress.Got to admit though, once you've seen it that's it. Just stars on the sidewalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kikadez
30,Neat to see once.,Cool to see but over rated. Very dirty. Save time and plot out the stars you want to see prior to going so you know exactly where to go! Parking fees are extremely high so be prepared also hard to navigate the area roads by car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pup101
40,Find your favorite star,This was a fun place to visit. So much to see..so much to do. Soooo many people!! You need to take your time here so you can enjoy the sights.I would also recommend taking a double decker tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjr832
50,Been meaning to do this since 1969,This was an interesting experience as part of our Star Line LA tour. the Chinese Theatre was worth seeing as well. LA LA LAND souvenir shop was a great place to buy interesting gifts to take home. The only thing that spoiled the experience were the scruffy people dressed as famous characters conning money out of you to have your photo taken with them. Some of them ( the 2 Star Wars guys ) looked as if they had come from a homeless shelter. You did feel intimidated by them as you tried to walk along the footpath. Another thing ticked off my bucket list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL860
30,Underwhelming,"It's really not a big deal, just a pretty gritty road. Only the tourists seem remotely excited trying to scout out stars of their favourites. Definitely keep your expectations low.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paloma_Rao
40,A bit tacky but good to see.,"Visited the Hollywood walk of fame today and despite getting pestered by every one and their Auntie trying to sell us stuff, plus all the ""down and outs"" on the streets in the locality, it was good to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markeverett
50,It is something you just need to do.,"It is a historic curiosity that you should see once. It isn't the most beautiful site but it is very interesting and gets you talking about ""who is who"" in Hollywood through out its short history. So enjoy your walk and don't forget the Chinese Theatre. Lunch at the Grill at Hollywood and Highland is excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gizmo013_13

30,Ideal visit is from the Hop On Hop Off Bus!!!,"As many reviewers point out, there are lots of potential ambushes to your walk along the Walk of Fame. Having been advised by close friends that it is not all that it is made out to be, we chose to visit the Walk from our double-decker tour bus. This was PERFECT! The bus was going extremely slow and we got to take in all the stars along the many blocks it covers. We were even able to snap a few good shots too! Well worth the Hop On Hop Off!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jufrafay
20,Interesting walk if you are already there do not go out of your way,The sidewalk for the most part is dirty. The walk of fame is long so have a plan as to who you want to see. Nothing really special to see though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micheleaP2556FJ
40,Great - but way too busy!!!,Pretty amazing site if you can block out the hawkers & other tourists. Fun to see - need a guide to detail who some of the stars are though!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OurEscapes
20,"Horrible area, too many people, lots of rip-of artists","I just thought this was a terrible area, probably the most unnerving place in the whole of LA that we visited on our trip. Lots of street sellers who wanted to rip people of, thieves and just the dregs of society wanting to have a go at tourists. The walk of fame is nice to see, that's if you can actually see the spears on the pavement.The local police, council and authorities have got to do something about the con-artists and homeless people, the area is being spoilt by beggars and people who are frightening the paying tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScampinIzzy
40,Enjoy walking outside,"First of all, it's a free attracting. You can enjoy a sunny day in Los Ángeles and walk around Hollywood. It's full of tourists but it's really fun to search for celebrities or bump into unknowns with your name on them (didn't happen to me, tho)You can take pictures of the stars or with the people in costumes that usually hang around the walk of fame. There is a mall near by, Hollywood Highlands where you can get something to eat or shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viacely
50,Great Free activity,This was a awesome experience to see so many celebrities on the walk of fame. Even learned about some statrs i didn't know. Definitely a experience you have to do in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livelifeh2014
40,Enjoyable but....,This was enjoyable but the beggars and residents were bugging you constantly for some kind of money or help. I understand the needs in this area now.Triple Forks Hunting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripleforkshunting
50,Enjoyable day and exercise to boot.,"Spent the afternoon walking around visiting all of the stars. Up and down Hollywood Blvd and Vine Street. There are a lot of amazing stars to see.The walkways are busy, but most of the time it is pretty easy to get pictures of those Hollywood Stars that you went to see.My only issue was that I pictured the stars to be cleaned regularly by someone. It seemed as though some of them haven't been cleaned for years but with all the traffic, maybe there just isn't time, I am not sure.You definitely need to be able to walk a few miles if you want to see them all, but if you have never been, it is free to do (other than finding somewhere to park) and definitely worth seeing.I recommend booking the Loew's hotel for their all day parking pass which is $20 and be done with it. They will valet it for you too and made it a no hassle, no stress kind of day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timsK9162LG
30,Rip off,"We arrived at Hollywood and found parking in a shopping mall which was cheap, then walked out on the street where there were people everywhere. The tours that go around to the celebrity houses was good but they try charging $50 per person, try to haggle the price down. We paid $25 but then they expected a tip of at least $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jason_young_85

10,It's just not my thing,"If you are a movie buff this might interest you. Obviously Grauman's Chinese Theatre is iconic but I didn't find anything about this place very interesting.Famous people's names are written on the pavement. That's it. Really.The street is constantly a buzz with street performers, preachers and hustlers (the famous cd sellers). Worst of all are the characters who don't look much like their onscreen counterparts.Everyone will try to hustle you so beware of that before you hold a snake or snap a pic with bargain bin spiderman.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W3255DDkeithh

I honestly never really paid it any attention because it's in a crappy area of town, the walk goes on for quite a while in areas I would prefer to avoid. And they're just tiles on the ground. I guess if you're really into film history it might be cool. If you're just visiting LA chances are you'll end up here because it's Hollywood.

30,Great experience,"It was a great experience to be able to walk at the Hollywood walk of fame. Only thing is if you wanted to find the star of your idol or idols, you would really have to search for it while the place is really busy as tou don't only encounter tourists but locals as well who walk the on the sidewalks. You also get to encounter people who impersonate famous actors and actresses.

Just make sure you ignore the Supermen and the Catwomen on the street who will all try to get a picture taken with you and charge you for it if you're not serious about doing that.Can get extremely crowded in the weekends, especially in front of the Chinese Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyaucknz
50,see only one time,"We walked and read all names. We loved the path, there are so many people but they are respectful to tourists who wants to take a picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/191semiha
20,nothing special,"Too crowded place, you cannot even see names properly. Nothing special I would say. Took me one hour to look around. If you have limited time, I wouldn't recommend to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d_kanan
50,Cool to see,"My wife and I just got back from LA, the walk of fame is pretty cool to see, could take a couple of hours to see them all. I recommend you bring some water as its really hot :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFLeB325
20,Not so spectacular,"Worth to see but not to spend a lot of time. This place is crowded, everyone want to sell you something. You can't enjoy your walk without being stopped all the time. That was not what I expected from most popular street in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kas_elwira
40,Amazed!,My first time here and I was completely amazed with the people around. Here you can see lots of good and bad impersonators if actors and actresses. This place is good for tourist.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlojakeo
50,The walk of life - in LA,"Many places have mandatory attraction for tourists. You can't skip the Colosseum in Rome, the Eiffel Tour in Paris, Christ the Redeemer in Rio nor Empire State Building in New York. And you'll most likely be overcharged and corralled like cattle - at the last two, I can guarantee it.In LA, the mandatory attraction is here - a tour on Dolby Theater, Chinese Theater and the Walk of Fame. It is indeed crowded and packed with bizarre street performers, some very good - such as the Tom Cruise lookalike - and some very underbudgeted, like Disney characters that look like came straight out of a Walking Dead episode.But it's great, if you're a movie fan. All those stars and footprints, it's very cool. I recommend to come by day - after 9pm it starts to be empty and less than glamourous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vimatasi
10,Not worth stopping off at,Drove down boulevard with plan to drop off family however loads of vagrants on sidewalk so kept going. Certainly not worth the hassle unless you are actually staying in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I9317IBsteved
40,Cool place,We took my cousin and his family who are from New York. We had a wonderful time walking looking at the name of famous people in the walk of fame. We stop by Planet Hollywood for appetizers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melinchietana07
20,Famous non-event,"There are so many things to see and experience in Hollywood. The Walk of Fame is probably a must see, but one of those where you just want to get in and out as soon as possible. Far too many tourists and really not that big a deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jorgen_fra_Horgen
40,Must see in Hollywood,"When staying in Hollywood this is one of the famous places one should visit. On a sunny afternoon Hollywood blvd is very nice to stroll along all the restaurants, bars, shops, theaters, etc. . Lot's of activity, crowdy, but still amusing to do. It all looks a bit darker and less inviting towards the evening, but we never felt unsafe at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmielMel
20,"Avoid, pushy villains.","I was undecided as to whether our family should visit this Hollywood landmark. It is nothing remarkable but if you wish to see the handprints of your famous and beloved star then do not miss it.Otherwise let the fable of the Hollywood glamour remain as something on the screen. It's for the sentimental.We were taken by a local friend who even suggested perhaps do something else. ""Are you sure you want to go there ?"".We went and were confronted by some very aggressive costumed showmen who demanded money after a photograph - some not happy with our first offer demanded a much higher price. Some demanded three times the amount because we were a group of five and took double photos.I feel sorry for many of these characters as it is quite likely they are the under paid body double (some of them are excellent and convincing) or the untalented who missed the big role...and fame.The one area in Hollywood that I did not feel safe. Also some very unsavoury costumes for young children to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Babycakes2014
40,Nostalgia,Loved walking along and seeing the names of stars past and present. The section at the Chinese Theatre was my favourite - hands and feet of greats from the 20s-60s!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigbear2042
50,Must check your fav actors name,"Something to get busy looking for your favorite Hollywood actors hand foot prints, take a snapLots of people hereIt's good to visit during daylight 👍🏻",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/685jene
30,Meh,"Daughter wanted to see walk of fame, stars were somewhat interesting but it seemed very seedy, wouldn't recommend females to go alone at night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/818liamk
40,Must see but pretty grubby,It's a must see in Hollywood but I was surprised at how dirty and grubby the place was. Lots of hawkers and homeless people about but the sights are worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/477JamesD477
50,What a walk,"During my visit to los angeles, i always return to the walk of fame and ride the metro to the hotel from Hollywood metro station... you will see some crazy and hilarious stuff in that walk... we had fun looking around for stars on the walk ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HD76HD76
30,It was OK,"The Hollywood walk of fame was OK. It sounds a lot cooler than it actually is. It's ALWAYS so crowded with people that you can hardly even see the stars that you actually want to see. I couldn't get over the smell of urine. There are tons of things to do around there though, like Madame Tussauds, the wax museum, Ripleys believe it or not, the Chinese theater, and others. There are tons of little souvenir shops and little places to eat. It's not an awful place by any means. But it's definitely just a touristy one time thing to do, I guess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/352ivettec
50,Very nice walk,"I'd recommend you walking during the daytime, at night there's alot more homeless people. it does get a little bit crowded. all gift shops are exactly the same and same prices i know cause i went to them all. there's a lot of people dressed up in costumes on the street however please leave them tip if you do take a picture with them. very nice and safe. walk don't drive and enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariovU1536HV
40,Crowded but Cool,"Go early because this place gets really crowded, but it is cool to see all the different stars on the walk. Take a look, grab some pics and then leave before you start to hate humanity. And to the woman who walked out of her way to step on Cate Blanchett's star as I was taking a picture of it-- Cate deserves better! We all deserve better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Magellan1492
40,Interesting Place to Visit.....Once,"Well I found this place hard to rate.When you eat at a restaurant you can compare it to other restaurants and then rate it. Same with hotels, museums, etc etc But there is only one Hollywood Walk of Fame. So being there is only one do you rate it 5 stars? I decided to rate it compared to other tourist attractions.I suppose if you like crowds of people and highly congested areas as well as being harassed by all manner of humanity you'll love this place.If you like peace and quiet and the ability to really enjoy the attraction you've traveled to see then just check this place off your must do list now.As for parking I couldn't tell you where. I used Uber to get here myself. I'd recommend you do the same.All this being said, I did rather enjoy the experience. I don't think I'd ever comeback again. But after all it is Hollywood. So I guess you expect it to be weird, strange and crowded.So check it out and enjoy yourself because if you're like me you probably won't be visiting again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4264SYmarkb
40,First LA Vacation,"It was pleasant, safe, and Fun to walk, eat, drink, and take photos of the stars! We used Uber to get there and back, very convenient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johntH5803KL
10,Over rated and awful,"What a complete let down.It was nothing like we had imagined or seen on TVThe majority of the stars where dirty and had chewing gum on themThe street stuck of urine and canabisPick pockets where everywhere brushing up against youPeople followed us at night timeTo many street traders and abusive if you didnt buy there produceDont waste your money, in fact dont bother with LA its not a nice place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jon_crane
40,Amazing stuff,"There is so much stuff happening here related to Hollywood that you will be amazed. If you want to see your favorite actor/actress name on the walk, then this is the place to be at.Have some museums around as well if you fancy a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/393mohits
30,Goes for blocks,Hollywood and Vine street sidewalks filled with squares of stars both past and present. After a while it's just name after name. But for a while it was fun as there were several names that we would say- you remember so-and-so? The neighborhood is someplace you would not want to be after Dark. That was quite a surprise. I mean it's Hollywood right? It's a seedy part of town. When we were finished walking we went to Hard Rock Cafe for lunch. (Recommend) Which was the most decent looking place around although there were lots of Dives and it's possible there good diners that we passed by. If this place is on your bucket list and time is a factor you can skip it and not have missed anything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catsplay6
50,wow,The walk of fame was a nice walk about and I took lots of photos of lots of stars. This is only fun on a nice day. It gave us something to do for an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W1060UClynnc
40,Come see the stars,"I enjoyed myself being able to walk around and try to find my favorite stars on the ground from entertainment, it was also great for people watching, people from all over the world and from different walks of life. Also there were many street performers everywhere you went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gumballa1
20,I expected more,"There wasnt much to this place. I thought it would be nicer, it wasn't as impressive as everyone make it out to be. Tourists are definitely taken advantage of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mari_enicolem2016
50,A must when in LA,Must see when in LA as well as the Dolby Theater. Walk into the Roosevelt hotel and check out either the Library Bar or the Spare Room (bar) or both.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexmE2212MB
40,You cant miss this,"In LA, this is one place you cant afford to miss. Walk around and pose along with your fav star. And you will see lots of activities going around. Its just a side walk with stars with celebrities names embossed .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lion_chd
30,Loved the stars,As a family we visited the Hollywood walk of fame. It was fun trying to find names and also whose star hands and feet we fit. The only downside was all the number of people thrusting CDs our way and then trying to charge us for the privilege. It placed a real downer on the time we spent there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstNic
30,LA's Time Square,"This is a must-do in LA just like Times Square is often a must-do for people who visit NY. Like most New Yorkers, I don't enjoy Times Square - and I felt similarly about the Walk of Fame. It was cool to look for the stars of celebrities we were interested in seeing, but the pleasure wore off quickly with the swarms of people dressed in costumes trying to get you to pay for pictures and the dozens of musicians trying to get you to buy their CD. We walked towards the end of the Walk of Fame, which was less crowded but also less clean. I suggest looking up the location of stars you want to see beforehand, as trying to find random stars would probably be challenging when you take all of the people walking around into account.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SnappleSpice
30,This place is ok,"Over rates place , but there is. Nice place to see and eat .Not something you must visit in L.A.Only if you have free spare time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/389nirs
40,"Busy and dirty, but a must see","We visited the Hollywood Walk of Fame and were surprised at how long it was. If you are looking for a particular star ensure you look for a address before going. The walk is very busy, filled with homeless, and dirty. It is a must see but it's not how you see it on the movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tripinator146
50,A must see,This is a must visit. So many people day and night. It is lovely to see all the stars of those living and deceased. Was there when a mexican singer had passed away. His fans had surounded his star with flowers and had a prayer service. It was lovely to see the respect they had for him and the people around them. Be prepared for a lot of walking and bumbing into other people,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shirleykearney
10,Disappointing,Area is more like a carnival area with cheap souvenir stores. The stars on the sidewalks are beat up and the area feels shady.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisove
40,Expected!,"It is as you would expect when you see it on TV. The Stars have the names of actors. The interesting part is when you research and find out the process and procedure for getting one's name on the Walk of Fame. We past on a Saturday night and it was too crowded to try and park, but I could see the Stars from the car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayWalk7
30,Walking to see the Stars on Hollywood Boulevard,Me and my wife Lori walked on the Star sidewalk and it was fun. I took a picture with Wonder Woman because she was hot. This walk was long but fun. I suggest that everyone does this at least once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geneh883
40,Lots of people,Was there on a girls trip. It surprised me at how long the stars went down the sidewalk.If you go be prepared to be bombarded by folks selling tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HopeZ_13
30,Crowded,"It was very crowded. To get a picture was really hard. The weird people dressed up to get a picture with them costs $10. The ""poor"" fortune teller walking around in new clothes, caryring bags of new purchases, and a Starbucks drink was annoying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/31chastityd
30,Overrated,"We looked forward to seeing the stars and history of the area. It basically involved walking, a LOT, and looking at names on stars. There was no rhyme or reason to where they were. Many areas reeked of urine from the transients living there. Many stars were unreadable from the dirt. There were too many vendors for tours and not enough attention to maintaining the quality of the area. Every person or character has a star. Our thought was they originally started with stars to recognize those that had been recognized for excellence but then became a place to put a star for every Tom, Dick and Harry. PeeWee Herman? Big Bird? Get real.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woody5048
40,A one time Visit,Yes! Its kinda cool and definately worth one time visit.Be prepared for a lotttttt of people just like you snapping pictures and posing everywhere.Be sure to pick up a couple of souvenirs from here if u want.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sikhasingh
40,Beautiful!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a wonderful place to visit in Hollywood. It is a definite must if you are in the local area. It’s a great place to learn about history of the film industry and find your favorite actors/actresses star on the walk. There are many tours available on the walk of fame if you wish to take one. You do not even need to make reservations – as there are so many. It is possible to just walk up on one or more and go. There were a few impersonators out and about when we went which is always entertaining. The Chinese Theater is on the walk, the Broken Relationship Museum, and many various restaurants - something for everyone. You could spend a whole day here and not see everything. It's a wonderful place to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ragiansanti34
30,Disappointing,"Its just a dirty street with star tiles on the sidwalk. I thought the hand and footprints were within the stars but they aren't. They are outside a museum (I think) and as there are so many tourists you barely see them.Watch out for the street acts who pose with you for photographs and ask for tips afterwards.Read the parking signs.If its your first visit, then its a must, but I wouldn't do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/864sur
20,Not worth it,So crowded with tourists and pan handlers that we couldn't really see the sidewalk. It was also not clean. Look at the online pics and go some place else,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E3648LZdavidb
40,It's a must-do....,"If this is your first time in L.A., like was ours, you have to go there. My husband and I went there on a Wednesday afternoon and it was not busy. Actually it was really good to walk around there. BUT there is nothing else to do around there besides walk there. It's dirty and stinks because of the homeless people that live there but you gotta visit there. You can walk for about 5-6 block and see the stars with the celebrities names.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FabianeB288
50,Quick stop,"We were dropped of by car for a short visit to the Walk Of Fame.Well worth it to soak up the atmosphere, and see all the famous names.We did not know that Mohammed Ali is the only person to have his marble Plaque on a wall!Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanleyjs
30,Has to be done....,"Teeming with people but has to be seen on the LA tour. We were (correctly) warned about the people dressed up as superheroes etc who stop for photos then charge tourists for doing so & the men who try & give you CD's before charging you for them, they're often blank or of poor quality.There were also men with snakes/parrots trying to get tourists for photos etc so beware! The other downside is pick pocketing so keep all valuables safe. Apart form that, it's a good star celeb spotter as you walk along the starred pavement & the Dolby/Chinese theatres make good photo opportunities - you certainly see all forms of life as you walk along - it's all a bit bonkers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/923clarey
40,On the lookout,Our kids were really keen to find their favourite stars.... Which meant we walked and walked.Was great to actually have some people dressed up and for a small payments we got some photos.A nice way to see a little bit of Hollywood!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/307JodieS
30,Floor stars. That's it,Names of celebs on the floor in stars that's it. Nothing more nothing less. Expect many up and coming rappers to offer you their CD. I either told them I didn't have a CD player and asked if they had it on memory stick or pretended to be deaf.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M3883SJdaveh
40,Walking among stars,"Went to Hollywood walk of fame on a Friday night so a heaps of people all over the place.the place was packed with tourist, performers, locals etc. I woul recommend to go at night it can be very hot during the day anyway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988juanjavierc
50,HA HA HA HA HOLLYWOOD!!!,"Hollywood Walk of Fame is of course ICONIC! You cannot, I repeat, cannot live or visit LA without making it a point to walk down the HWOF!While Hollywood Blvd is always bustling you will appreciate looking down at the stars (LOL)! Names you will recognize, some you won't but guess what? Look them up on your phone and do your own little Star Tour!The Walk of Fame is a few (short) blocks long and on both sides of Hollywood Blvd. The souvenir shops are everywhere and of course walk right to the Graumans ChineseTheatre either to catch a movie or check out the other Iconic hand and foot prints of legendary stars! Someof their footprints are smaller than I can ever imagine!You'll see super hero characters likeBatman and Superman walking around and some pretty interesting local characters (it's Hollywood)...and if you can do the Star bus tours...they're pretty fun (you can kind of negotiate a rate of you have more than a few in your group). They even bring you to Beverly Hills for a 15 minute walk around! See where the superstars live (or used to when they were alive)...and just be prepared to have fun!!!!Don't walk RUN to Hollywood Boulevards WALK OF FAME!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4joannea
30,When in LA!,Got to be done when visiting LA you can't leave and not do it. However it's long if your a Brit some names you won't even know but grab a few pics.. We didn't really like the area but others may do..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laura0609b
50,Goes forever,So many stars. So many tourists stopping to take pictures. You could walk forever and not see all of the stars on the walk. Great to walk and see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goaliemother
20,Not much point going!,This was a big disappointment to be honest. The Hollywood Blvd area is full of tacky shops and tattoo parlours and homeless people. And the stars? Just a name in the pavement really. Sorry!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AR-Greenwich
30,"Tourist Trap, Tacky, & Underwhelming","The Hollywood Walk of Fame is probably one of the first things that you would think to visit when in Los Angeles. I've been to it multiple times, primarily because of the In N Out on Sunset directly below it. The Walk of Fame really is not that impressive. A lot of places feel dark, grimy, and full of shady people. The people that wear costumes make it feel even more tacky, and beware that if you take a photo with them, they will hassle you to pay them, so just don't. It's really cheesy anyways. The Hollywood-Highland Mall is really nice, and I go to it for American Eagle occasionally, but other than that, there's really just so much more to Los Angeles that is worth seeing beyond this. Touristy places such as Santa Monica are amazing, and then less popular places such as Glendale and North Hollywood are really trendy and fun to go to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParkerGreen
30,Very touristy,So nany people. So many peddlers trying to see you ticjets to shows and tours. Lots of street perfomers trying to get you to post for photos. Be careful as thet expect ti be pay. Best to negotiate before taking the photos. The star walk was fun. Lots of souvenirs shops. Not cheap. Expect tourist prices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/830amiec
40,Find your favorite star!,"This is an obligatory walk here along Hollywood blvd and depite the crowds and wanna be stars and street performers that plague yhe area it's still fun to walk it. Most people like to find and photograph their favorite stars and others like myself like to see how many I know and especially some of the stars from the silent film era and Hollywood's Golden Age of movies.Everyone should do this walk once,at least if you don't find your own star you'll be able to dream of having one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARodriguezP
40,Celebrity spotting!,"Though I wished to see some celebrities cruising by Hollywood Boulevard, I opted to take pictures and touch the stars names on the Walk of Fame. As you go near the Chinese theater, you can pass by street performers, some sing, some dance and some don costumes of famous characters such as Batman. You can also buy your souvenirs of Hollywood and LA from numerous shops. A famous buy is the Oscar statuette. Who knows, yu could be the next best actor. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/francisjulian
40,Dodge the hawkers!,"The walk of fame stars are iconic and deserve a cleaner safer environment. I was persistently badgered by hawkers trying to sell me bus tours and cd's while I tried to study the name son the stars. I bought a map of the stars so I could find the one I most wanted to see, Stevie Wonder. An interesting fact I learned about the open top bus tours is that there are moves to ban them on safety grounds. Would suggest you don't wear any expensive watches or jewellery and keep an eye on wallets, bags, cameras and iPhones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrackingJohn

40,Highly Written About,We had heard about this but seeing made all the difference. A whole street and its extension is covered. You will find the stars of all well known Hollywood personalities but may have to walk a lot to locate your favourite star - the street extends and extends. But you have to go there if you go to Hollywood !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Surendra143
40,"Neat, but crowded","Great place to people watch, but hard to really read the names and take pics at stars on sidewalk, as it was very crowded. Many people in costume-beware, they charge for photos. If you have time, chat with them, give them a few bucks, but if you don't have time, keep on walking. I had to rescue my husband from a musician who 'gave' him a CD, but then insisted on signing it and charging for his autograph. I gave him the $1.50 I had handy and his CD back (he wanted $5). Probably a place you could spend a lot of time, but we didn't have long and were a bit overwhelmed by the crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliathegr82

50,Awesome,"My husband was born in San Diego. I always wanted to visit California. My husband took me on a vacation to San Diego in August of 2015. I only saw the walk of fame on tv. It was great to actually see it in person. I was hoping we would run into someone famous but we didn't. It was a great visit. I was finally able to check the walk of fame off of my bucket list. Can't wait to visit again. Next visit we will try to get a view of the Hollywood sign. I visited in August of 2015, but chose August 2016 since August 2015 wasn't an option",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/739aprild
20,Dirty and a bit seedy...,"Stopped at the walk of fame as part of a Los Angeles tour we took. We were really excited to see the stars on the walk of fame as well as all the handprints and signatures. It was a bit of a shock to see ""the real Hollywood"" it certainly wasn't glitz and glamour! Firstly there was a lot of homeless folk begging on the streets, some sleeping, some awake. The street stunk of urine and I just felt like the sidewalk needed cleaning with a high pressure hose and a scrubbing brush! The actual stars are not maintained that well and some randoms have put their own names in marker pen on some of the vacant stars!. I think the worst part of the experience was a few of the star impersonators who have been down to target and bought a $15 superhero outfit and now try and pose with people in expectation of a tip for ""their services"" the costumes look as though they had been worn everyday for a year and never washed . I heard one of them become abusive when someone refused their advances (our bus driver warned us this was common) I'm sure there are some talented impersonators there making a living who deserve a tip for their services- I just didn't see them on my trip. There was also a couple of guys handing out what I assume a their demo CD's, these dudes are aggressive and get annoyed when you say no. All in all I think Hollywood need to take a look at how things are and give the place a tidy up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V2610WDtracyl
40,"Crazy place, crazy people!","The Hollywood Walk of Fame is everything one imagines! Crazy, busy, touristy, seedy, exciting, iconic! The amount of stars on the pavement is unbelievable, so many!

30,Not what I expected,"Hollywood is a bit dirty and with the guys pusing their "" free CDS"" on you and the characters wanting money for pictures and the 50 or so guys selling tours it is not the glamorous place I expected. The Chinese theater is cool to see and the ocean is only a short drive away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christianofer
30,Jam Packed,"Maybe if you come early morning it's ok, but we were here at lunchtime and the crowds were heaving. It is interesting to see the rather random selection of stars on view. My favourite was the Trump star, complete with a homeless guy pointing a cardboard sign at it with an expletive on it written in several different languages, just to make his point!

50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"It is to be experienced! Everyone has a favorite star and hundreds of people stop each day and take photo ops. Our favorite was Q.Tarantino but so many people were at Michael Jackson's and Christina Aguliera's it was a great experience. The Hollywood Sign is way cool and you don't have to hike up to enjoy it. There is a huge Esplanade by the Walk of Fame with good eateries and shops and you can take a photo op there. Don't forget to try California Pizza Restaurant and go to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum. Also, remember Hollywood has its share of homeless and dirt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/267kar
30,fun afternoon for searching,Great time to look for some famous names. The search was lost on the kids who didn't recognize many names from the past. I had fun but after about half an hour the family wanted to move on to better things to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4420XLeileenc

40,Hollywood Fun Even on a Hot Day!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame, just over a mile long, runs east to west on Hollywood Boulevard from Gower Street to La Brea Avenue (there are also stars on Marshfield Way that runs diagonally between Hollywood and La Brea; and 0.4 miles (0.7 km) north to south on Vine Street between Yucca Street and Sunset Boulevard).""The Walk"" has over 2,500 stars, the stars are pink, black and brass in color with an emblem that symbolizes one of five categories within the entertainment industry: Classic film camera representing motion pictures, TV receiver representing broadcast television, Phonograph record representing audio recording or music, Radio microphone representing broadcast radio and in 1984 they added the Comedy/tragedy masks representing theatre/live performance.Credit goes to E.M. Stuart and Harry Sugarcane came up with and fleshed out the idea of the between 1953 -1955. By 1956 a committee met at the famous Brown Derby and had some very famous names selected; Cecil B. DeMille, Samuel Goldwyn, Jesse L. Lasky, Walt Disney, Hal Roach, Mack Sennett, and Walter Lantz. A lot of folks think Joanne Woodward was the first to receive a star, however, she was not, but she was the first to pose with her star for photographers.Now-a-days, the walk is filled with those that never made it, dirty stars and dare I say it, broken dreams. Still go and see the star of your favorite star and maybe there will be a ""tip only"" made up Michael Jackson to take a photo with? Or a Ginger Rogers?Have fun! Be Part of History and Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollyK263
30,Extremely long walk of Fame,"Good to see, but does get a bit samey after a while. Easily found Stars requested by our daughter to take pictures. Surprisingly long walk of fame, goes on both sides of the road and along junctions too. Can also get very busy, especially on the popular pars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolineo888
10,Stinky! Busy! Crazy!,"The entire blvd smells on urine and weed. It felt to me that it's become a try hard version of Times Square.

50,Memorable occasion,"A great place to visit once and move on...busy as hell.Cheesy with a lot of impersonators,that can be agressive and not so forthcoming if you take pictures.A strange way of life and a definite feeling...one wants to live a dream on this walk. One may compare this area ,as the good old British beach town with a bit more glitz! ! Hey ..its Hollywood and that is the trade mark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tedpm
50,Good to do once,For someone who has never lived here the Walk of Fame is everything you want it to beYou see the stars you your favorite hollywood star. It is a good idea to get an app that tells you were they are so you dont miss it walking by. Good to do once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnaR6132KR
30,A top 3 place to see in Hollywood!,"It has to be one of your stops in your trip to L.A. and Hollywood. A must-see for sure. It runs for around 5 to 6 blocks and make sure you check both sidewalks. It's better if you check this during the day since most of the stars are really hard to photograph at night. Also consider the people once you try to pay a tribute to your favorite band/actor, it is a crowded place and there is people ""performing"" around so you might get in trouble to find a star or to take a picture.It's an great experience and the place is super crazy so you should have a blast there.Some of the stars are a little bit dirty so you may be disappointed and ""watch out"" for the ""soon-to-be stars"" promoting their work they could be annoying after a while!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChoxU
30,Has to be done. Make it a short stop,Walk up and down a street. Find some stars on the floor. No more than half hours fun. Go early (pre 10am) and it is pretty empty which is good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stokel008
40,Pit stop,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is the sidewalk of Hollywood Blvd. There are people walking everywhere and some dressed as star look-a-likes. Most people are looking down and taking pictures, so be mindful to get a picture that you don't run into someone.There are people all around, so be patient. There are souvenir shops and restaurants everywhere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lecterit
40,If you are a tourist,"Yes, very good for tourists, it's iconic and famous the world over, and it's free. Most of it also smells like pee...As a one off - and free - it's pretty cool. Check out the internet first if you are looking for specific stars. After your first time, no big deal and you probably won't even look down after that. Also, with the internet and all, and given it's no longer the 'golden age', and most movies are no longer filmed here nor is this the 'entertainment capital' any longer, it's becoming irrelevant. Hollywood...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ydnar
30,Hollywood Walk Of Fame,"I enjoyed seeing the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was truly an amazing experience. Only issue I had were there massive crowds of people, and the fact that better upkeep is needed to the grounds. I get that people are constantly walking on these, but some of them were so dirty it was hard to get decent pictures of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/767anitral
40,A Hollywood must-see,You cannot possibly come to Hollywood and that walk down the Hollywood Hall of Fame. The Hollywood Hall of Fame is actually about six blocks long and on both sides the street. It's an easy walk and in the middle of it is the Chinese theater so you can see the handprints of various stars as well.Bring your camera and post next your favorite star.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ResQDoc
40,1st trip to California,We saw some of it but there was a crowd around one section of it because of someone famous there earlier and they still had it roped off. Its neat. Lots of tourists taking pictures of their favorites so very crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBLOVER2014
50,Twinkle twinkle little star,"Who doesn't like to see your favorite stars star. Again bring your blocker, so you can snap your pictures. You'll find more stars thenThose on the ground. Plenty of stars impersonating fun but be prepared to pay for the picture. You know you're getting old when you know who almost all the stars are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jewels48162

30,Nice stroll,"We walked forever and still had not seen all. Would wish there is on (online) guide to where each star was, but so it was a nice surprise walk. Further down the street there were no tourists, that was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HexiH

20,Disapointing,Actually this is just a normal street with a bunch of stars not looked after for. You get bothered a lot for selling guided tours. There is enough parking space but if you walked there for 5min you have seen everything,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569koenv
50,Impressive,"It was impressive to see the dimension of Walk of Fame, in TV it doesn't demonstrate the amplitude of it. We recommend the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/47tiagot
50,A Highlight of my Visit to Hollywood,"One interesting thing about these stars in the sidewalk is that the people on the stars were at one time famous enough to qualify, and yet many of the names on the stars are unknown to us today. Maybe 1 out of 4 are recognizable names today ... the rest's contributions to art are fleeting enough to have disappeared from our popular culture. Check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mshapiro99
20,Been There done that...,"We walked from our hotel to the Hollywood walk of Fame. We were out There around 9.30 in the morning. At that time of Day it Was easy to walk and see all the Stars, but you could also see How dirty the surroundings are. Lot of homeless People. I Was also surpriced How Many Stars I didn't know. But funny enough to take photos of the ones you know. In the afternoon There Was a lot more People, and a lot more people trying to sell you something. The Day we went There Usher Was going to be ""put Down"" we Saw the preparation for it, but didn't want to wait two hours to see him show up.I Think it is a place you must see, but i don't Think we Will ever go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bastianmis

30,Dirty... need to jet wash the street,You cannot come to LA and not see the Walk of fame. It's OK but it's the atmosphere that makes it worth coming for.Street is dirty but that doesn't stop people getting down and close for a picture. OK shops to get Nike macks from.I won't be back for at least another decade or 2.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A_Great_Mum
50,It's Fun here,"I personal like it here. The engery is positive and the location it's self if funI tip the actors playing the roles of our favorite stars, this is their living and they aren't doing it for free, regardless how much they look like they are having fun. Give them 5$ at the beginning of your photo opt and you WILL walk away with some fantastic pictures. I can almost guarantee it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisalove127
30,Take the Walk of the Stars!,"It is exactly what it says, a side walk w/ Stars designated to a Movie Star, Radio Star, Film Maker etc. They are fun to see and of course everyone has their favorite. While I was there inAugust Michael Jackson's Star was the most crowded. It goes on for several blocks on both sides of the street. A tip, the street is closed off on Saturdays so that pedestrians can walk the street and not fear tour buses and cars. If you are inHollywood, you have to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelnmom3
30,Hmmm,A bit disappointed with this.. the surrounding areas are so dirty. Doesn't show you all the dollar stores and homeless in the background on TV. The smell of urine is extremely strong all over the street.. buy good fun comparing shoe and hand prints with the stars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F525NDjulieb
20,Depressing,"The number of homeless and obviously mentally ill people is overwhelming. The aggressive selling tactics of some of the vendors was alarming, I actually saw people being grabbed who were trying to get by. I understand that these people are just trying to make a living, but this area is just wrong. For such a hot tourist spot you'd think the authorities would spruce it up. May I say we were never once hassled by anyone who was obviously living on the streets. The homeless situation is really disturbing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/893janicem
30,See celebrity's stars on the Walk of Fame,"If you want to see celebrity's stats, you can go to the walk of fame. Midst people don't realized that the Walk of Fame is more than just Hollywood and Highland. Celebrity stars are all throughout a several block area in Hollywood. So if you're looking for a particular star, you should have a map so you know on which street or area the person's star is located.Hollywood Boulevard has become very crowded and is inundated with characters that want to charge you to take a picture with them.Families should note that it is very crowded and it is fun to see all the characters and potentially see a movie star or two however it's safest to attend during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724lauriew
30,"Fun to see, creepy area.","We were there on business and wanted to walk around and see the 'stars' as the ones on the sidewalk.When looking down, careful to look up as it's not on the best area of town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pcg123
40,Starz!!!!!,"Be prepared to walk walk walk and walk some more. Then you have the bus tour guides In every other spot or corner trying to get you to take a Hollywood tour of star homes. That was a little irritating, At some point i would say we did one already. Lots of people like Time Square on a hot summer day. Not only stars are on the main street they are also on the side streets also. So what I did was google what star i wanted to see ( Michael Jackson ) right next to the Chinese theater. Overall its a cool experience. But once was enough for me",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leeleemarie81
30,"Seedy, but worth the experience","I didn't expect The Hollywood Walk of Fame to be in such a depressed area with all I've read, seen in movies & on television. But it is what it is---old, neglected & run down. Parking is scarce & expensive. Beware of scams & hustlers trying to sell you stuff on the street as you walk. Couldn't find any working or available bathrooms that street people didn't have tied up. Even StarBucks bathroom was closed. So go before you take your tour. Some of the stars are in front of storefronts that should be boarded up & condemned. The shops & vintage shopping offer great prices, especially for soveneirs, old vintage glam clothing & shoes. I bought a genuine, heavy,recycled Army jacket that I swear was new for less than $40. The subway or train station is right there & offers some good Hollywood landmark photo opportunities especially in the boarding area, aside from some homeless people sitting/sleeping throughout the station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monica12yearsinVegas
10,Not very special or clean,"Hollywood walk of fame is prob a must see just to say you saw it, but the area is not clean or special. You would think they would make it nice but they don't. Becerlet hills is much the same. There is one or two streets that are special and look like on tv , but most is not week kept and weird people living in high fences and gate cocoons, no people who live there ever outside, no children",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/koolcat13
50,YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THIS!,We went to LA and of course had to visit the Walk of Fame. The stars of course are the primary attraction but it is the atmosphere and unique individuals who make up this attraction. The impersonators work really hard to imitate their celebrities and do an amazing job. The reason I mention them is because they are all over and for a photo expect a little money. There are many people begging on the streets but there are some actual buskers (people displaying their talents for cash). I have a lot of respect for them. They at least offer something in return for a small fee. If you are adventurous and want to see some cool stuff and people then this is the place you must visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristinetracy
40,Nice to see all the stars of famous people,"It's nice to see all the stars of famous people and I saw my favourite stars such as Steven Spielberg and Ellen Degeneres. However, I did find that many stars were dirty and damaged. I would have thought a tourist attraction like this would have been kept clean.It gets very busy on the boulevard during the day and I would recommend you visit first thing in the morning to get pictures of your favourite stars before it gets busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bendonson1
50,Dreams come true,It #1 on my list to do and exceeded my expectations. Unforgettable moments seeing my favourite stars on foot path . Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ohauiti

10,Only If You Can't Leave Town Without It,"This is a disappointing trip at best. It's like a dirty, grimy skid row ""Disney Land"". Peddlers, scammers, gaudy and really low rent street performers, many of whom are nothing but little hustlers rule the boulevard.It's so loud you can't talk, aggressive crazed drivers in four lanes of endless traffic divide two sides of Hollywood Blvd which is nothing but confused sunburnt Minnesotans shuffling in a daze gripping maps and cameras and their kids sticky hands while blaring competing bad portable sound systems spewi rap, pop and rock juxtaposed with a troop of kitted out Asian evangelists who shout from electronically amplified megaphones that we're in hell and Jesus saves. It all inspire me while slugging down this brass-star studded cattle parade to agree on the first part. I don't think there is any saving possible for this tourist rip-off.Stay away. Unless you can't leave town without it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SerenaScholl
30,Hollywood and Vine,"So- kids wanted to see Hollywood. We ended up staying at the W - don't suggest unless you're over 21. There were stars all over the walkway while trying to find a tour of Mulholland Drive. The best are by the Mann Chinese Theater and a better area as well. Tour guide said Marilyn Monroe's star was in front of the McDonald's, we didn't stop.Find a good tour that stops at La Brea Tar Pits, farmers market Etc. Count on the day. If pressed for time there are tours that they have at discounted prices up and down the streets near the W. We got 25$ driving tour and normal price was 40$ per adult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bellabunny007
40,Hollywood Must See,"Hollywood Boulevard is an eclectic mix of souvenir shops, mini-marts, tattoo parlours, smoke shops selling cannabis related accessories, theatres, bars (the waitresses are beautiful!) and wax work museums, tour touts and people begging. The Walk of Fame is very funny, intentionally so, I think, where the names of the famous in music and film (many of whom I’ve never heard of) are contained in pink, gold lined stars which are embedded in the pavement, to be ignominiously and eternally trodden on by passers-by; a reminder of the intransience of fame, fortune and ambition. The star of Clarke Gable, just outside the entrance to a Trader Joe’s supermarket, amidst the strong smell of urine and cannabis made me laugh out loud. Humphrey Bogart is outside a vintage clothes shop, Charlton Heston is facing a Wells Fargo office building. There are also some interesting juxtapositions; Sylvester Stallone is next to Yehudi Menuhin, Errol Flynn next to The Go Go’s and Jamie Lee Curtis is two down from The Rugrats (Yes, The Rugrats!). Whoever says Americans don’t get irony is completely wrong! There is even one to Swindon’s own Diana Doors. I was surprised not to see stars for Phil Spector and Bill Cosby, but perhaps I missed them?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geographypsycho
50,Nice,Very nice option to go with familyEveryone wants to take pictures with the stars of the idolsThe actors singers and music players make the walk more interesting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/egqa123
30,Not what I expected!,The Hollywood walk of fame wasn't what I was expecting at all. It literally is just the pavement and is quite dirty in places. That is until you get to the Dolby Theatre where it's all very clean and tidy.It's not amazing but it is one of those things you have to do while you're there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amycH3387PO
20,Ok,A little over rated very dirty a lot of homless people an drinks are expensive good to see all the star names an there are a few shops to see but that's about it wouldn't stay longer than 2/3 days,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/68neridab
40,Home of the stars,"This is the home for movies and music fans all over the world, but don't expect to see many stars walking around or you will be disappointed. Don't let your guard down either. There's been any crimes committed on this sidewalk every month. Don't walk alone at night! There are a lot of police presence throughout the day, so it's much safer.Many great places to eat. Food prices are cheap given all things considered. You can get a good meal from $8-$15!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b0gardc
10,"Seedy, dirty and tacky","I went with my boyfriend. Very disappointed. It was dirty and seedy. We got harassed by people selling CDs and people dressed up in horrible costumes. One person dressed in drag came up to my boyfriend and actually grabbed his nipple. I saw another tourist being grabbed at as well. It was a super creepy place. I also saw someone eating from the trash bin in front of the Chinese theatre. We did not feel save here. It's a shame because there is a lot of history. However, it is not the glamorous Hollywood you would expect. I won't go back. If you do go don't plan on spending a lot of time. See the Chinese theatre and the Roosevelt hotel is also very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/612callied

10,Not what I expected,"This place is crazy. The streets are full of homeless people, nutters and annoying people at every other shop trying to sell you a tour.

50,Free Fun,Great fun and free. It's a bit annoying getting pestered for going on tour buses every 20 minutes. But just say no and they leave you be. I was surprised as it isn't just one Road in a couple places the stars spur down other roads. If you're looking for particular stars just Google their location.It's a great time though especially when it's free. I'd advise parking in Hollywood and Highland centre it's just 2 dollars for 2 hours and 15 dollars for the day. Plus it's right in the middle of the Blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakhello147
40,Historical Landmark,"The process to get one of these stars may be controversial to some, but nonetheless, the ""stars"" enjoy the recognition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saxy15
30,Interesting!!,I guess I thought Hollywood means glamorous but this was kind of in the ghetto. Streets were very dirty with Very colorful people walking around. Worth visiting to say you've been there but maybe just a drive thru ????,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathyS583
30,Needs a facelift,"I was soooooo excited to visit LA and se the Hollywood Walk of Fame but was very disappointed in the area. For such an attraction, you would think the city would clean the sidewalks better.We were accosted by people asking for money, the streets were dirty, and there were different activities going on along the sidewalk which blocked a lot of the stars, especially in front of the Chinese Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justeatdammit
30,Not so special,"I would recommend for one-time visit but definitely it is not what everyone thinks about it. I was thinking of a big place with lots of great things, funs and activities but it is just a simple short walkway. Stores are mostly closed before midnight.Signs is good to take a picture for memories. Be prepared to pay approx. 20 dollars for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/payamf1
30,fun walk,Great walk although it gets very crowded on the weekends. It was fun to look at the stars. You can do as much or as little as you want. As you get close to the Chinese Theater it gets very crowded,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M2He
20,Walk of Fame - too bad wasn't so filthy,"It is really a shame - here are the stars, so many wonderful actors, actresses, singers - the city of Los Angeles should clean up the place - it stinks of urine and there are so many people trying to solicit. There is no reason for this when the city can work to clean this act up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E5584IZpaulc
50,Walk of Stars,This was very interesting and I was surprised and all the names I recognized. People watching is also very fun. This was a great adventure everyone enjoyed. Parking was very close easy and reasonable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stonecoral
30,Tacky but a must see,"I didn't expect anything better, tacky and overrated. However, this is what commercial Hollywood is after all. We had fun in our own way and I think is a must see if you visit Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aida68
30,Worth a visit,Remember the great stars of screen and TV. Nice to see the names. Have a look at was Manns Chinese theatre. Avoid the people dressed in bad costumes. Tonight just the three Spider-Man trying to part you with hard earned $.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlt21
20,"Sticky, stinky sidewalk","Reading the names of your favorite bands, singers and stars of the silver screen is fun yet you have to navigate the traffic, accept the obvious signs of poverty and hopelessness as well as the stench of weed. A street of broken dreams.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianem725
40,Great place,"It is great place for a walk early in the morning, so you can avoid the crowds and look out for stars; gets a bit busy in the day. I did not expected it to be so dirty and the street stunk weed all the time, but then you learn it is normal for LA, as mojority of places are like that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arnela6
30,Nothing special and too many people,"I think this is overrated. Hollywood stars are just normal people after all, and something better should be thought of instead of trying to find a name on a pavement that is pounded by hundreds of people so that when you stop to look or take a photo, you get in the way of walkers going by etc. A bit of chewing gum, spilt drink, food and the like, and the star doesn't look so good anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MacDutch
50,Vacation,Loved exploring this area. Very busy. Lots of people. Some not very cooperative with taking pictures of the stars. People dressed up as super heroes for pictures; some were polite and took no for an answer. Spider-Man grabbed us and then demanded $$. Be careful and aware of your surroundings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bates823
20,A massive disappointment,Well if you like cheap and tacky then this is the place for you.Some aspects are ok with various dressed up characters posing for photos (the kids clearly loved this)However apart from that the street is a massive disappointment. There are so many supposed stars names in the pavement I'm surprised I never found mine! The shops on this street are just your standard cheap and nasty shops.No 'feel' that this place is special. In fact there seem to be loads of buildings that have good history but lay there disused or dilapidated.Dolby shopping precinct is the exception. This is really nice and the viewing corridors give excellent views of the Hollywood sign.Otherwise just a tacky experience that won't live up to your expectations.This fits in with my overall view of LA which is a generally run down and uncared for city that displays real signs of how a really rich society has lost its way. The split. Stern the haves and have nots is very stark and very uncomfortable for a Brit. It makes me proud of wherein from he standards we have back home.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/757MartinG757
40,Stars to See,"Went here with company visiting from Germany, they wanted to see the popular spots in LA. It is a must if you are into Hollywood and Famous Movie Stars. Expect lots of people with their heads down looking at the stars. A must see is the footprints and handprints at the Grauman's Chinese Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciaf168
20,Don't waste your time!,"Was very disapppinted in all the hype, at least I can say I've been here but will never come back. To begin with, traffic in this area just sucks period! You do not want to get stuck in this traffic. Then we had to pay $15 to park in a parking garage. There's nothing special about this place, just a very long sidewalk on both sides with the stars and lots of tourists. It was so crowded, you couldn't even stop to take a nice picture in the middle of the sidewalk without getting irritated. There are lots of people who dress up and will come hug you or hold you and pose to take pictures with you, then ask you to ""tip"" them. They're just standing there holding out huge stacks of bills while asking you for $. Avoid them if possible! Unless you don't mind giving them money. About a block or two past the theatre, there is a large shopping area, which is nice. its kind of hidden, but it's nice just to get away from the big crowds on the sidewalk. This was probably the worse thing we did on our trip in LA, don't waste your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saewhat9009
40,Mixed thoughts,"You have to have your wits about you, with so many people wandering around heads down with cameras in hand.So many stars to see so if time is limited, check out the hand prints outside the Chinese Thestre first, then work outwards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/723sallys
40,Sightseeing,Out of town visitors they wanted to see gromans Chinese theater and the walk of stars. It was very dirty and full of people but they were very excited to be there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizziwizzi90
40,Interesting Place to visit,"It is a great Place to visit, but I think the prices for the diferent places are too expensive. If you go with your Family, at least 3-4 persons every place will be a lot of money.We usually go and just walk and see the stars.If you are hungry, make sure to visit the local business and not the big famous food chains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/219angeld
30,"Lots to do, but very dirty","We really wanted to visit the Walk of Fame, and I'm glad we did, but I wouldn't go back. It was cool to see the stars of the celebs but, there were a lot of homeless and certain spots smell like urine. You couldnt even have a drink at a bar without someone walking by and harrassing you. I wouldnt bring my family here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CanadianRebel
50,Must Visit while in LA!,You'll have plenty of fun searching for your favorite celebs star. It's definitely a must visit while in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missceewhite
40,"Iconic, free. Why wouldn't you?","Hop off the underground and you're there. It's nice to wander around looking at all the names and doesn't cost a penny. Yes the upkeep could be better, the streets could be cleaner but hey!Worth a look!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LylieJade
40,Walk of fame,Really cool free activity to do - many stars most people won't recognise but once you get to the touristy end of Hollywood boulevard you can find all the famous stars which is cool! A travesty that Leonardo dicaprio doesn't have one yet though!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieC38
20,Unimpressed,"I normally don't give but reviews but The Hollywood walk of fame is too hyped for what it really is. Me and my family took a day out of our trip to visit the stars and found out it was a waste of time. This was due to the crowds of people getting to places not caring about the stars and getting in the way of you. Also the streets are full of beggars and once you give one money they all expect it, the streets weren't even that clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DcVsMarvel
20,The french couple,I was so disapointed about the walk of fame not so famous you have lots of homeless and the street its so nasty,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prescillat3
30,Classic Tourist Attraction,"Locals take these sidewalks for granted. If you are a movie buff, you will enjoy seeing famous names of stars and entertainers. Many of the stars are old and will not register with the average person under 50. Be careful walking around Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jashas2014
30,Go early,"I'd say go in early in the morning. It's still totally a must when visiting LA, and I did really enjoy it however it's kinda the opposite to glamorous Hollywood. And quite a lot of people were stopping you every two mins which I think would probably get worse when it gets later.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolesaurus
50,Always fun.,"It's not only the stars and their names that you see, but also all the other interesting characters walking along the Boulevard, it's certainly never dull. Not sure why there are so many people dressed up as Spider-Man though, even saw one being arrested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Howletts
40,Honeymoon,Walk of fame was easy to do and simple to access. The walk was easy to do and I'm surprised more people didn't walk into each other while looking at the floor while walking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5unny5miles
50,i was like a child looking for all the celebs,"omg this was so much fun, it was like i was a child again looking for as many celebs as i can find and taking photos with everyone i loved heheso much fun#BubbleGumHijab",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bubblegumhijab
30,So many to spot!,The stars go in every direction and are on both sides of the road...got a bit bored after a while. Some nice bars and restraints along the way and Ripleys Believe It Or Not was worth a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyj273
30,Not as glamorous,The area near ford theater is a bit upscale. Rest of the street is not. There were many homeless people and the street itself was not very vlesn.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyingchariot
50,FAMOUS,"So, the Hollywood Walk of Fame is famous for having names of famous people. If you're here, you HAVE to check it out, right? It's pretty cool and much bigger than you'd expect. The walk of fame covers several blocks on both sides of the street and includes EVERYBODY! Famous people from the earliest times of the entertainment industry through today, covering all mediums - stage, screen, radio, and television. It was fun to see who we knew and remind us of many we've forgotten.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylA330

30,"You must go, but not exciting as in the movie","I was a little bit disappointed at Hollywood. The movies create very high expectations, while the reality is not so glamour and fancy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dancinginthesky
30,Disappointing,"This was far less impressive than we had hoped. The area is very rundown, almost scary. The actual walk was nostalgic, but with the crowds and the difficulty finding a place to park, it was just not all that great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpgrandpa
10,Dirty and meh,Boring and dirty but I am sure everyone who has been knows that. We did it because you do when you visit Hollywood for the first time and we are staying nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandraadventure
20,Highly overrated,"Even though I'm a film buff, seeing the stars is pretty tacky. The only reason to visit the area is really to see the people hawking their wares and such to the tourists. One place I would skip on a trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderlust1954
20,Expected more!,Left really disappointed by the hollywood walk of fame... Yes you can see names in stars on the pavement but if it's busy you have no chance of a pic and the area it's in isn't that great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmfhewett
30,An average tourist trap,"It's what you'd expect from a tourist magnet: average shopping and souvenirs out the wazoo. The only redeeming quality would be the Madam Tussauds Wax Museum and the Chinese Theater that are along the walkway. There was an overabundance of homeless people and punks on their skateboards that were quite literally IN THE STREET on their skateboards. They also almost knocked over a couple people on the sidewalk and didn't seem to give a damn about their of obnoxious and reckless behavior. If I never come back to this area, it'd be too soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThatAmericanTourist
30,Iconic but wow,This is obviously a must see if you go to LA but boy what a dump. The area is so run down with shops selling nothing but rubbish. Really needs some money spent on it to make this a better experience. However the walk of fame itself is pretty cool. Highly recommend downloading the official app. You can search for people and it shows you on a map where to find their stars. We used this to find out favourites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92russellw
40,Walk through history,Very neat attraction to see some of the screen and music idols that I grew up withRight on Hollywood Blvd. Easy access from the subway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wildcat1897
20,Trashy and crowded,"Came here as its a must visit place but its just not nice. It brings the image of LA really down especially to those who only stay around here and see this part. Its fairly unclean, way too many beggers and people trying to harass you to buy their junk or tours or other things you dont want and too many would feel unsafe even if it isntYes go and see it to say you have but do not stay here and never come back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatthewL913
40,Cool but a long walk,Was visiting California and decided this was something I wanted to see. Honestly its a long walk along the street to see them and I didn't make it to see them all due to heavy foot traffic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P2905VKjenb
40,Lots to see,We walked and read the stars names. Went to the Dolby Theatre and Ghirardelli chocolate. You can tour it but we didn't.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StoreOwnerTeacher
30,A must see,"If you expect glitz and foam in Hollywood that isn't what you will get. Rather you will get people dressed poorly as characters wanting to take a photo for money. Just avoid them and enjoy the walk of fame, the theaters and the overall experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CeciliaB784
30,Fairly underwhelming,Had my hostel nearby and the walk isn't as glitz and glad as you'd imagine it. It's a long walk but there are definitely interesting people along the strip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L7975SIjamest
40,"A walk of ""discovery"" :)","With over 2,500 stars to see (the 2500th star belonging to Jennifer Lopez was put in place only in 2013) on the sidewalks on both sides along a stretch of like 15 blocks from Gower to La Brea streets (and also along like another three blocks on intersecting Vine St.), this 'walk of fame' is definitely something ""unique"" to do although you might get somewhat of a ""dizzying"" experience constantly looking down and reading the names on the stars for almost two and a half hours like I did (except for about half an hour in two or three gift shops). Be sure to walk all the way to La Brea on the west end where you'll see the star for the walk of fame itself (imprinted on it are the words 'Hollywood Walk Of Fame' & the symbols of the five categories for which the 'stars' got their stars, and yes there's even more than one star for some rare ones like Walt Disney!) and a little pavilion/gazebo supported by four columns in the shapes of female figures (which I guess are kind of symbols of academy awards).As for the places to go in right alongside the Walk (one way to get a break from looking down at the stars), there are TCL Chinese Theater (with IMAX), Madame Tussauds wax museum and a shopping-mall-like building (with one or two big white elephant statues on top) on the north side of the boulevard with also one ""interesting"" gift shop that sells miniatures of academy awards (a big model award too on display) just a little to the west of the Chinese Theater; there's also quite a ""life-like & beautiful"" wax figure of Marilyn Monroe for great photo-ops just a few minutes' walk to the east from Madame Tussauds. And yes, speaking of great photo-ops, the best suggestion I can give is to enter Ivar Ave. intersecting the boulevard from the north side of the boulevard for a distant view of the iconic 'Hollywood' sign on the side of a mountain (a selfie won't do, but you can have someone take a ""fairly good"" pic of you with that iconic sign!).Went there during a seven-and-a-half-hour layover at LAX by taking the Flyaway Hollywood bus which took about 45 minutes from the airport to Hollywood (but the day I went was a holiday, pretty sure it takes longer on a regular week day) and cost $8 each way (no cash payment though, you can only pay with a credit or debit card). The boulevard is just a few minutes' walk from the corner of Selma & Argyle where the Flyaway bus makes the drop-off (the pick-up is also at the same spot about 15 minutes after each hour).And, something that might be a tip for those keen on the stars is many of those of the ""contemporary"" big-names like Russell Crowe, Matt Damon & Kim Basinger are to be found near the Chinese Theater. And yes, I spent only two and a half hours as my layover time permitted, but to do this boulevard AND Hollywood thoroughly will require like a whole day with half of the day for the car tour of the area to check out the celebrity homes and for a close-up view of the Hollywood sign and such (the tours are offered right on the boulevard) and the other half of the day for the Walk here and to go into the Chinese Theater & Madame Tussauds. For just the stars on the Walk, two to three hours like I did is quite sufficient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myom624
30,Long walk if you want to see it all,"We walked for hours attempting to see them all! The walk was great... took us by many oddball stores and restaurants (and people!) That we would have never visited otherwise.Be prepared to deal with some street merchants and random guys dressed as spiderman attempting to get your attention and attempting to find ways to get you to pay the.If you can deal with that and enjoy random people watching and shopping, you are in the right place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/btbolt
10,Terrible!,"Worthless - why did I waste my time at all to visit this street? Furthermore, this part of Hollywood is really terrible, with run-down buildings and people who try to fool you with various commercial traps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/526max
30,Disappointing,"Not sure this worth the hassle of getting here and paying for parking. Pretty grungy with a lot of sketchy looking folks in cosplay, wanting money for a picture with them. Tons of cheap souvenir shops and men selling tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sanman85
50,Summer Fun on the run,It was truly cool to see the Stars names and to just be able to walk the streets of fame It's a lot to see there shops with cheap souvenirs about 60percent cheaper than the beach area shops.You have eating spots TV shows on the strip you'll love everything but the Crowded Streets there's Plenty to do for all ages have fun!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/420tg
30,A classic but dirty,This part of Hollywood is cool to see once but that's it. It's dirty and filled with homeless people and people doing drugs. Definitely something to see if it is your first Visit to California but there are much more desirable areas to hang out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tiffkat2000

40,Cute and fun,"If you go down to LA, then you'll definitely want to see the walk of fame. Even if you dont know who you want to see, most likely you'll end up coming across at least someone you know during your stroll. Especially when you walk by the TCL Theatre (Gruman).. There are always people trying to sell you stuff on the street or persuade you to take a pic. But you should never feel pressured or scared.This is Hollywood after all, and you'll find all kinds of characters here.Just relax, enjoy the walk and take in the ambiance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaverickCSX
40,Good to see your favourites!,"A good place to see your favourite stars - well, see their star. A tourist trap with the usual shops, potential risks and overcharging places - but worth a visit to see this area if you are nearby.It can be quite a long walk if you are intending to do the whole thing - or even a fair bit of it so wear decent shoes and bring a drink/sun cream and patience for the crowds if it is busy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenhU3269BW
30,Hollywood,For family is not the place to go for the over packed and crowded people all over the place what is a couple or young person it would be fun to do party life never sleeps never stops going going going,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F2496HYrandys
50,Fun way to spend the day,"We had a blast searching for our favorite stars. We loved the courtyard of the Chinese Theater and were surprised at how small it was (it seems so much bigger on TV). The shopping center at Hollywood and Highland has a great viewing platform for the Hollywood sign. The area has a feeling similar to Fisherman's Wharf in SF. I was disappointed that they removed the wall around Donald Trump's star. Oh well, there was plenty of hand-written requests on other stars to evict him.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3113PLjulies
20,Watch out for the hustlers!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame was probably the worst attraction to visit in Hollywood. It's more so a ""been there, done that"" sort of a thing. In most cases, find the star you wan't to take snaps with then leave. The area needs a massive restoration and clearly has not been managed or looked after in all these years. Scary and dingy at night, almost feels a little ghetto. The area is filled with street performers and hustlers which aren't particularly friendly so be warned. The ""CD bullies or hustlers"" are everywhere attempting to sell you CD's that you don't particularly want. They pester you into buying the CD even going to lengths of fishing out every last dollar from your wallet. Given these hustlers normally travel in packs, travellers or tourists not familiar with the area are usually that frightened into handing over everything they've got. If there's one advice I can give anyone visiting; do not make eye contact and say no thanks immediately before the pestering starts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IzzyIsmail
40,Get a Map Before You Go,I knew exactly what stars I wanted to see before I went and so I found a map of where to go. It helped a lot for me to start at one area and just walk towards everyone I wanted to see. This is a one time attraction so I wanted to make sure I saw everything I needed to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColetteK683

50,It Never Gets Old,I've lived in LosAngeles for 32 years and many is the time I have walked down Hollywood Blvd. and read the names on the stars. It's kind of impossible to ignore the history at your feet. If you're over 65 you'll be able to be reminded of old friends but if you're younger you may not recognize Rin-Tin-Tin or Gloria Swanson. But you'll still enjoy the walk and there are plenty of younger stars to greet you. If you're going to visit L.A. you really must walk down the Walk of Fame. It's one of the best free attractions in the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bleeson8

50,Holiday trip,We had a great day when we visited Hollywood.We took the underground from downtown LA which was very convenient.Best is to come early as it gets crowdy late morning and in the afternoon ( also hot in the summer months),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gj1964943
40,Good but crowded,"This is one of those places, which everyone visits while in L.A. It is really crowded during day time, and during night you gotta be careful which side of the walk are you at. It is actually a little scary at night unless you are with a local that knows the area.I took pictures with few of the stars. It is a good hour activity there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349anniea
30,area needs to be cleaned up alil,"the walk its self is interesting and you get to see alot. the area tho has dirty spots that need to be cleaned up due to vagrants , street performers etc. Also if u bring children watch them closely in some areas that are further from the main part of the walk. there are lots of shopping in the area and restaurants. Bars for the older kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonygA443LN
50,Oh the sights you see,Just walking up and down the street is an event. Yikes - get table at a sidewalk cafe and just enjoy the sights. Spider-Man who is clearly 40 pounds overweight....Chewbacca who loses clumps of hair as he walks down the sidewalk. Priceless! I have been to LA before and did not go here and I am sorry I didn't.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gvillegatori
40,Cool To See,Everyone has to take the walk to see all the stars. Pretty cool experience and very crowded. We enjoyed seeing all the names and took our pictures with our favorites!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/db16
20,Urchins,"Despite the fact you're walking down Hollywood Blvd, which is awesome, you come across quite a few people who don't even know where they are. They smell funny, ask you for money, try to sell you things that may be inappropriate for children if you know what i mean, play the guitar very well, and some do simple tumbler stunts I could do if I stretched and worked out everyday and magically get you to give them 50 bucks(not me in particular). I love how everything is in walking distance! This city is incredible! But don't be fooled. Hollywood has alot of gum stuck to the bottom of its shoe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/914nathanl
10,Don't expect glamour!,I guess you have to do this when you go to LA but it is a pretty horrible experience.The streets are dirty and a lot of the stars and paving slabs are cracked. You can't see half of them anyway because the place is so crowded.You are constantly hassled by people trying to rope you in to take something for 'free' and then wanting money for it.The whole area is seedy and intimidating. I felt very uncomfortable there. Never again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Milesandmag
40,Glitzy at night BUT lots of street perfomers not all of them family friendly!!!,"The sidewalks can get a bit crowded. Sometimes it is easier to get around during the day rather than at night! Don't forget to walk all the way to the opposite end to see the special star for the Beatles!! Parking can get expensive in the garages but some of the side streets have hourly parking if you don't mind walking! Fun tourist attraction and you can hit the famous Chinese Theater and Madame Tussaud s Wax Museum along the walk!!Also,across from the Chinese theater you can find the El Capitan theater and also the studio where they film Jimmy Kimmel Live.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bzymamacee
40,Has to be done,"I'm giving this a four rating as I think it is a must-see and it is definitely impressive, but at the same time, the area isn't appealing and the actual visit doesn't last long. I was pleased to spot stars for Bruce Willis, Britney Spears and Godzilla (!). By all means visit, but don't have high expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stenvoid
30,"Nice idea, need some attention","There doesn't appear to be any sequence between them, so you get older actors mixed with newer ones.Some of the stars need some attention and the walkway is not very clean which is a shame.Worth a walk if you are in the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimBushell
20,Needs a makeover!,"The Hollywood walk of fame is probably on the itineraries of most tourists to LA. I had been before but my daughter wanted to see it.My view is that it is a rather grubby and at night, seedy and intimidating area. This visit was at 10am as things were just coming to life and is possibly the best time to visit.The side walk is broken and uneven in many areas with some of the stars in poor condition too.It's not very clean and I still had the sense that it was a place I would not go near after dark.By visiting early we were able to park on a side street for 2 hours and $4 which was more than enough. Some car parks are charging $30 a day but this is not necessary so do avoid them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Binman62
40,Busy but great to see,A must when you visit LA. Stand in the foot prints of your favourite stars or see their name on the side walk stars. There were so many more than I thought there were. It does get busy with tourists and characters all dressed up so expect to take your time as you wander down this bustling street.Great fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854DP
30,Just a name.,We went here on a Saturday. It was pretty crowded and not much to do. I would suggest packing your own food.

Visit here if you want to take pictures with your favorite stars!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anisa_flower
50,Walk of Fame,"The Walk of Fame is a 3 mile stretch with over 3000 stars dedicated to various entertainers from the world of movies, music and sports.The star attraction of walk is a star dedicated to the great Muhammad Ali. What sets it apart that it is the only star which is not on the street but on a wall. Apparently, Ali did not want people to walk over his name and hence happens to be the only celeb with a star on a wall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hiten1977
40,Lots to see!,"We visited here today, we were advised by the reception at our hotel to park at the mall near the TLC Chinese Theatre which was brilliant advice. It was easy to park and quite reasonable considering. There are loads of shops and restaurants and some great views! The Walk of Fame is what you would expect; people trying to sell you bus tours etc and people dressed as film characters. We had a great afternoon there and my teenagers loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/676gaynorh
30,Crowded but iconic,On a Saturday afternoon it was to crowded to really read the stars names. However the spot is a must see as a history of Hollywood. Maybe some day they will find a way to manage the crowd. That being said it was pleasant and more empty across the street in front of Jimmy Kimble live. We were their to go to the movies at the multiplex.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T2286ICmaryh

20,Disappointing,Ok I will admit if you haven't seen it you do have to go once but to have your hopes too high. Maybe this was just me but I imagined the walk to be alot more glamorous than it was. The sidewalk was just a plain old sidewalk with a few stars on it. I imagined the tiles to be cleaner and shinier but really it was dirty and could have been a street anywhere. I just found it was very overrated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710niamhk

40,Closed For A Protest Rally,"They had about 10 blocks of Hollywood Blvd closed off for a protest rally that was getting out of hand so we stayed away. The stars are there but not in any sort of order. It was great to see them. If you look up one you like, you can find it. They were dirty and not well kept but interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Verlia
30,got to see it at least once,"While in the area you must see this place once and only once. Very crowded but you get to see a lot of stars and just reflect for a moment.

40,Travelling with our niece from Australia,"Great time to go is in the morning, so not a lot of people. Also, you can park for $10 all day. Another thing is to look up the star's location online so you can map your walk, it's walk of the starts after all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rizwork03
30,Watch out and don't take things from strangers,Nice walk but got charmed into buying a rappers demo cd ..... I know right... Sucked in.The strip is nice but leave after mid night as it gets very messy.Remember nothing is for free on the strip and stay cautious.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyGannon1
20,Good luck...,The Hollywood walk of fame is completely riddled with pan handlers and people trying to make a dollar. The amount of people trying to get your attention and money is ridiculous and is done in such an uncomfortable way you don't want to stop.Hollywood may have always been like this but I do not recommend exposing children to the walk of fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BiancaUTS
20,skip it unkess you are sleeping in the area,"If you are on a tight schedule don't bother to go there. nothing special to see, the street looks really bad - you better go to Beverley Hills...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AsafL_12
40,Ok,Go see it...say you saw it...no need to repeat. Avoid crowds by going before noon. Mall has a nice view of Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pq1111
10,Not a safe place! Please watch out all your belongings! A lot of hassle!,"Don't get any free stuff on the street. They are not free! Recommend not to take any pictures with the movie character people, it could cost you a lot. If you need to buy souvenir, T-chirt...etc, recommend buy them in a shop and not the street vendor outside China theater mall. Many people tried to sell you stuff and passing out 'free stuff' to you as you walk along the walk of fame. Just walk straight and ignore them and not to show any interest in that. I was in trouble when I got a 'free' CD. As soon as I got it, the man who passed out the CD would immediately sign his name on it and said it is not free now since his signature is on it. He wouldn't let me go. I was going to yell. I couldn't believe this happened in a tourist spot and the street was packed with people! As I walked along the Hollywood Blvd, I didn't see any policeman patrolling at all. Spend less than one hour there would be more than enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexemilycrystal
40,A must do,In three days in Hollywood the walk of fame is amazing. It is so famous and you have seen all of the stars and the pictures of Chinese theatre so many times that it makes you just say wow.Make sure you have plenty of sun screen as there is no shade and it was very very hot in August,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greg221968
40,Pretty cool,"Nothing amazing, but at least I did it.Something to mark of my bucket list. It really wasnt as special as I thought it would be... Just us walking down the block and seeing the famous names. Also very crowded!! Almost all my pictures I took of the walk of fame are full of feet because there are soooo many people! But still pretty cool but nothing WOW",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmellyyy
30,See it once and it's done.,The boulevard itself is extremely busy and littered with people trying to sell you something. Typical tourist area I guess. As you move towards the end of the boulevard it gets quite dirty and Blackpool like. A must visit but wouldn't return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Keely0810

50,Interesting!,"Not at all as portrayed in tv or movies! This walk will include many homeless people, many tour solicitors, many sales people. Keep your wits about you- you and everyone else are looking down the whole time, protect your bags/ wallets/purses..etc. We visited several times while in LA, always busy, lots to see, very cool overall! You will understand more than your kids!!!! I'm 40 and didn't get many names ..::",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissawJ5135YW
50,A little of fame,The famous walk of fame. What can we say? You get to see your favorites actors star (if it is there). Lots and lots of gift shops.

Been there - done that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LorraineB348

30,Tacky Tourist Trap But Why Not?,"Yes, we went to this tacky tourist trap because why go to LA and not see Hollywood? For anyone who loves movies and movie stars, you will still get some sort of thrill from seeing their stars on the pavement. Great picture ops too. Why not? There is a lot of funky night action here similar to Times Square in NYC. Beware those fun characters roaming about because there is no free lunch. Take a photo with them and they do expect a tip. Beware anyone too friendly because anyone is out to get some money. But, it's all in good fun. You want to see Superman walking past or a guy with a huge yellow snake on his shoulders? Well, this is the place for you, even if you only take an hour to join the action.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donna224488
40,Pretend You're Christina Aguilera in Burlesque or Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman,"A site one should visit once to walk, see the names, and remember the history and glamour of the movie industry. My last visit has been some time ago when attending a film screening. The theatre is worth a visit, again for the history. Couples, Friends, Solo. If you are in the area and a film buff, it should already be on your agenda.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Art-Fashion-Travel
40,Long walk and so many stars,"I think we covered 60-70% of the stars. But it was a long walk. As a tourist this is a thing to do cos it's what you see on TV or in movies. Head down walking and seeing names of stars you know. Takes your memory back in time. Was a nice feeling.Be careful with head down as there are others walking with a purpose and people coming out of stores etc. If the place is crowded it's cos you at the 1% of stars that that everyone else is at. There's so many more.And we saw the Justin Bieber one night on Hollywood Boulevard walking with his guys near the Jimmy Kimmel studio, being followed by group of gals who kept a distance from him. So be prepared for your own sightings and ypu might get lucky to have a conversation with a celeb. Funny guy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pt2pt3
40,Funtime with party atmosphere,Go to this place if u wanna have a feel of hollywood. I went there a bit late in night and the atmosphere was electric. More interesting were the various costumed guys standing along the whole stretch plus some street shows. Overall a great funtime.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SourabhC84
50,Something everyone should experience at least once,"Lots of photos can be taken here, You can check out all of the celebrities, and it is just an unike experience.

50,Great fun on the walk of fame!,Picked a good time to visit as not too busy - 5pm. We all loved searching for our favourite stars. Great place to people watch and have a mooch through the tacky souvenir shops. Kids desperate to find the Donald Trump star - however it had been cleaned - but a campaigner sitting next to it filled them in on all the stories about it being defaced!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950francesr
40,Hollywood Walk of Fame with family,"My kids really enjoyed walking there and took so many photos there. It was crowded coz we went on a weekend but it was really fun once you see your kids are enjoying every moment of it. The characters there were amazing and they look like the real celebrities features,customs, make up, and even the way they act which impressed my kids. They insisted on taking photos with so many of them after paying from dollar to three dollars. Then we had an amazing yummy chocolate and ice cream in Ghirardelli it was out of this world so if you go there don't miss it . We had a great time there.👍🏼",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/losts23
30,Underwhelming,I thought the area was dirty and looks uncared for. Great if you have no illusions! The mall which is reached up stairs/escalator is worth a visit if only for the views of the Hollywood sign. Not impressed really.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindarO3214KW

30,Not what I expected,The walk of fame which is one of the most iconic locations in Hollywood was disappointing. The street vendors selling hot dogs populate the walking path and the food trucks on the street are no so glamorous. The comedians are fine and were respectful. More order and cleanliness are required to bring this attraction to the level is promoted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ecestafe
20,"It's a myth, but....","When you think about L.A. you think about the Hollywood sign, the beaches and the Walk of Fame. I think that the Walk of Fame is one of the most overrated attraction in the world. It's an anonymous sidewalk in a crowdy, noisy, dirty district.I cannot say ""don't go"" because you must go when you are in L.A. but you will be disappointed for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paolovbossi
40,Something you need to do if you are a movie buff,Walking where famous people have walked is quite a cool experience- a weird area of town full of colourful people - need to be careful of your surroundings as gather there is pickpockets in the area. If you want a photo with one of the aspiring actors dressed as your favourite character- be prepared however to pay for the moment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulmG5044EG

50,One of Hollywood's signature attractions - Not to be missed!,"I have visited this attraction too many times to count, as I live in Los Angeles, and this is one of those sites that ANY visitor who has any attraction to Hollywood movies just HAS TO SEE! SO we always take our guests from all over the world to see it and they are always amazed! You should check this out after you park in the Hollywood & Hyland parking garage... after that you can check out the Walk of Fame, The Chinese Theatre, The DOlby Theatre (formerly the Kodak Theatre - where the Ocars are held each year) as well as the shopping and eating choices in the Hollywood & Hyland mall",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnantaM_12

20,Not what we expected,"Having seen the Walk of Fame many times on TV etc, we were looking forward to our visit. What a disappointment.The whole area is tacky and crammed.Near some of the famous people's stars are cheap imitators offering to pose with you by the star they are supposed to resemble. Then comes the inevitable request for a ""donation"". Begging in disguise.People thrust CDs into your hand asking where are you from? Then ask for money.The people (homeless?) searching the bins for items to recycle for money are more honest in their endeavours.People walk over or stand on the stars, making taking a decent photograph nigh on impossible.Very disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flantheman2334
10,Don't waste your time,"It's a crowded, dirty, and loud street with names on the ground...no big deal. You have to walk along the sidewalk with a ton of pedestrians just to look at other human's names...and a few non-humans. The street doesn't look well taken care of, some stars are even chipped.

40,Walk of Fame,"I don't live in the states, so when I travelled to California, something that was on my bucket list was the 'walk of fame' of course,it was very cool, went on for a long time. As exciting as it was to ""see"" all the stars there were many homeless people so be prepared for that, but all the local shops were the same, they had many cool places to eat. We at at IHop down the road which was amazing. Overall I got a few pictures with the stars and enjoyed it. Worth seeing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/855katelynr
30,Underwhelming,"Seemed like a must do, as a first time visitor to LA. But the area isn't that great--congested and a little sketchy. The hand and footprint imprints of the celebrities are clustered in front of the Chinese Theater, while the Walk of Fame up and down the street are really not much to look at. Because there are so many people walking, it is hard to do much more than glance at the stars, but there really isn't much to see anyway. My 11 year old son was totally bored as he did not recognize most of the names. I am glad I saw this but it really is more of a touristy thing without much substance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabadami

20,Price is right,This attraction is over-rated. This area has seen better days and yet move a few blocks off Hollywood Boulevard and things improve. The few blocks to either side of Mann's Theater are very crowded and is filled with people hawking stuff and/or luring you into photo ops that they want to be paid for.The area is seedy and very dirty.There is good people watching,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janelled328

20,Complete Nightmare,This area is a complete nightmare. It was way too crowded. People working at tour companies were trying to sell us tours literally every minute which was very frustrating trying to walk down the Walk of Fame. I would not take any of their tours if you paid me to. Would not return - ever.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSKSF

40,Typical tourist attraction,"I would not go out of your way to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It's nice to see it once and it does stretch for many blocks on and around Hollywood Boulevard. Basically it's a free attraction that could be seen either early in the morning or late at night before and after the crowds. The real sight and honor on Hollywood Blvd is the hand and foot prints at the Chinese Theater. The walk of fame is nothing more than a side show, in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GJ1015

40,Don't miss,Every visitor to Southern California must see the stars on the walk of fame! Park at the Hollywood and Highland complex and take the elevator to the second floor. Walk down the famous stairs of the Kodak Theater where the Academy Awards ceremony is held every year. Turn right at the sidewalk and walk to Grumman's Chinese Theatre and place your hands and feet in the cement where famous actors have been. Do a little shopping and then head out to the Hollywood Sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tunaday
20,Crowded and dangerous,"I always wanted to see the walk. I am glad I did but suggest you go during the day only. Not a nice area. I felt very unsafe in the area. Our tour guide warned us before we got off the bus to be careful. It is very crowded. Because the area was so ""iffy"" we didn't walk very far. I would never go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbieg1230

40,Crowds and Hype,"It is neat to see the handprints and signatures at the theater, but the rest of the stars tiles take you down streets lined with con artists giving away 'free' music and is an experience like the craziness is Times Square NYC. See the theater and go to the top of the stairs in the mall to see the Hollywood sign and then head home!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/medsalesguy
50,Only to see once,Before seeing this the expectation was high. Some of the stars are in pathetic condition. And its all scattered too much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NisanthPNair
50,Most Wanted,"Great place for sight seeing because around this place offered many options (wax museum, madame tussauds, hard rock cafe, souvenir gift shops, chinese theatre, dolby theatre etc) to visit, quite crowded (of course it is the most wanted place to visit in LA beside the hollywood sign).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrincessCK2015
20,So Crowded You Can't See The Stars...,"I did the Walk of Fame 25 years ago with my mom, but times changed. There were so many tourists and homeless people along the Walk of Fame that it was impossible to see much. It was also really dirty. Given some of the antics of people on the sidewalks, this is not a place for young children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelleBHouston_Texas
30,Underwhelming but do visit in the evening,I'm not sure what I was expecting but the Walk of Fame did not engender the delight I had expected. The area is quite dirty with and run down with many street performers of varying degrees of expertise performing in the hope of some financial gain from the throng of tourists. I would recommend seeing the area at night when it really comes alive and the surrounding dinginess is hidden by the cloak of night. The positive is the colour and sounds in the evening bring a carnival type atmosphere and of course seeing a star with your favourite actors or singers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duncannj
40,Crowded - watch your pockets,"We stopped in on a Friday evening after arriving in town. My children wanted to find the Trump star. He must have paid a premium price for the placement because it was super easy to find. Maybe it was the protesters, but it is right outside the shopping mall at Hollywood and Highland. Regardless, the 'walk of fame' is a very interesting study in human behavior. You'll find all walks of life, ethnic and economic backgrounds as well as political views too. You'll mostly see starstruck fans taking photos of themselves with their favorite Star's star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/663patrickt
40,Its a walk way with stars,Its a walk way with stars. It's one of a kind. Runs beside Chinese theatre. Crowded with all kinds of people - tourist mostly. Everyone should visit ones to take it in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maybelater15

30,Hollywood history!,"It's very interesting to walk Hollywood Blvd and read all the stars names as you walk. It's kind of hard to do it and not bump into people though...especially the closer you get to the Chinese theatre--you can barely see them then because it's so crowded.There are a lot of street performers (and homeless people) along the way, and at times I felt like it was the perfect setting for pick-pockets or something worse. Lots of people, and dirty streets. The stars aren't kept up, the sidewalks are dirty and I'm sure it would be impossible to keep it nice and clean. The biggest names are at the Graumans Chinese theatre. It's pretty cool if you're into Hollywood history, but if not, skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/533erikah
10,Awful,"If you have a wonderful image of the walk of fame in you're mind, keep it there and don't go.The area around the Dolby theatre is very busy but ok- was a 100meters further and it is awful. It's dirty, scruffy and uncared for.The homeless issue in LA is appalling and very sad but to seeing people rooting through bins and living on the streets isn't what I expected here.It's red hot here, if you see any damp in the floor, it's likely to be human",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/230JH230

30,See it once and that's it.,I would say go see it to say you've seen it and get out of dodge as soon as you can. It's way over crowded and smells. Reminded me of the Vegas strip. Visit the Chinese Theatre and then go do other things.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amarat
30,Interesting to see,"We found a lot of famous stars...by chance! Marilyn Munroe, Harrison Ford, Julie Andrews etc. If you are looking for a particular star, it's not worth it.

40,Screen Icons Immortalized,"Some of the thrill lies in the discovery of a favorite, although it would help if there was a map of who's where (at least the most popular ones), as one wouldn't want to find out after calling it a day and coming back home that a favorite was just a block away from where one was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anon00001
20,Stinks of urine - disappointing,"Maybe I was expecting something else but was really disapointed with our adventure to the ""walk of fame"". while the streets are paved with the names of the greats once you stray a block or so from the chinese theatre/madame tsards/hardrock cafe area it seems to be pretty poorly maintained and run down. dozens of homeless on the streets and a strong smell of urine. just did not expect this as we were first time visitors.However i'm glad we have been to tick off the list but would'nt go out your way unless in the area.

30,"You have to see it once, but the glamour is gone.","The glory, glamour days of Hollywood are long gone and have been replaced by tacky shops and dirty streets. Case in point is the Hollywood walk. The stars are a tourist attraction more than a monument to the fame of the stars whose names they bear. Still it is fun to look for your favorite among the hundreds that adorn the walk. The area is grimy and there is definitely an air of desperation with costumed characters (some good and some spectacularly bad) all vying for a buck in exchange for a photo op. Although I didn't encounter any problems other than huge crowds around the Chinese Theatre section, we had been warned against petty crime in the area mainly at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NauticalVoyager

10,Waste of time,"The walk of fame is totally disappointing. It is just a big, unattractive street with tacky shops, tasteless ""horror museums"" and a lot of dropouts hanging around looking for a dime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNH33
30,Is Snow White a star ?,All the stars are there but some are just characters in films. Disney must have paid extra for them. The stars reach right the way around Hollywood Boulevard so there are too many to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X1891TEdavidw
30,Stars on a footpath,"It is another place to say you have been. Took me a while to find a name of someone I knew. Nice to be able to say been there, done that I suppose.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/876susanw
20,Not worth the stop,"Not much to see. Area is run down, parking is tough unless you plan to pay $10 to walk around for 20 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colleenm302
30,Too much foot traffic,Too hard to just stroll and check out stars due to a ton of tourists all the time. Used to be easy to just stroll around. Now you have to jockey for position to even get close and costumed people trying to hustle you for 20 bucks for a photo with them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ballerina501
10,Tour of hollywood walk of fame,"This place is nice very lit up its beautiful my kids was like wow, we did tour of beverly hills we walked looking at the stars for each famous person or character, parking was $20 then we paid $20 for tour. We went to michael jackson house, puff daddy, jennifer Lopez, lady gaga, justin beaver, playboy mansion, and on rydell drive to see where pretty woman was it was nice experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/646aprilc
10,Just a street with starred tiles,"I mean it's just a long street with starred tiles. What do you expect? Not to mention shop after shops selling tacky made in China souvenirs, and 'museums' that will cost you a fortune to visit. The Chinese theatre and Grauman theatre look like cheap knockoffs if they were situated anywhere else in the U.S. A total waste of time in my opinion. Just find the name of the star you like and leave quickly, so you can explore the rest of L. A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eurogram
40,Different!,"This is a unique experience, lively and a huge no of people.Interesting to see all the celebraties on the starsWorth visiting atleast once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Global_Desi123
40,Our visit to Hollywood walk of fame,"It was a part of our tour of LA. We visited the famous Chinese theatre & the hollywood walk of fame. Saw all the stars names including Donald Trump !!!!! It was quite crowded but fun still. We didn't encounter any adversities but were told to watch our handbags, keep them in front not back pockets & not to engage in conversation with strangers. All in all though it was a hot day & crowded it was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rama1004
40,Must see the walk of fame,"Yes it is touristy, but then again you have to see the walk. People you know or have forgotten. A must see for your bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/medkgg
50,Just awesome!,"Internationally renowned, it was just nice to be somewhere that you've only seen in pictures and the movies.My favourite star was the Muhammad Ali one mounted on the wall. Such respect and dignity that awesome man commanded...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LothianArab
40,Walking that Walk of Fame,"As back packers in America, when anything could be seen for free it was amazing! and of course The Walk of Fame is completely free! it was nice to be able to walk the streets of Hollywood trying to find your favorite star however did get quite boring after a while, so if there is anyone in particular you are trying to find, google first to see where their patch is. Just a little tip to try and make things easier for you.Also there is a Starbucks on Hollywood and Vine, its great to go and sit in here and literally watch the world go by (also phone charging units and free wifi!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucy0798
50,Fun walk,"We had a fun time walking around cheacking out the stars. Characters to have photos taken with and found a great little shopping centre in the middle with all your favourites, Victoria's Secret, pink, Sephora, and hot topic to name a few. Had a great time just having a wander soaking up the atmosphere",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happyfamilyx5
30,Fun To Spot Your Favorite,Fun to walk around and spot different names. Not easy taking photos with the density of the crowds walking thru. Good conversation starter with kids who may not recognize the names from yester year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herculesmom
50,Famously Fabulous,"What a fun time, individual are dressed in costume standing around for kids. Some are friendly and some wait until you step in for a picture and then hold our their hand for $20. The walk is fun reading all the names. Good for all ages. But be of those wanting to take a picture with you or start a conversation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4428KatieL
30,A place for everyone,"Find your favorite star's Star, walk on the Academy walk (without the red carpet), step in Clooney's footprint, visit Madame Toussard wax museum, have lunch at Hardrock cafe, dinner at The Grill, stop by the Chinese Theater, grab a milkshake from Ghiradelli Chocolate shop and don't forget to get your tchotchkes from La La Land gift shop! You'll go home with a lighter pocket, aching feet, and lots of pictures...that's exactly what you came for though! A fun long day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/163jenw
40,Hollywood Blvd,"lots of fun to walk along Hollywood Blvd, seeing the walk of Fame/ your favorite artist etc. Iconic building's and attractions that you see on TV all the time. The very famous Dolby Theater host to the yearly Oscars and many more. Jimmy Kimmel studio etc..However, be careful as there are some strange characters walking around. There are homeless people begging for money, and dress up characters like in Times Square NY that want you to take a phone & tip them, These people are very pushy.But there are fun character too, dancing on the streets, people watching is awesome!You can book a sightseeing tour from a variety of vendors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divalife2016
40,Free parking if you get there early,Was so nice to walk around and discover all the old stars that are on here. We parked by Hollywood and vine to see John Wayne's star first. Just parked on the street it was fine. But you want to stay away from Sunset Blvd. lots of homeless people and just not a good street. But other wise we had a fun time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/879brendas
20,That not impressive,Some of the names on the walk were before my time and did not fully get to appreciate the experience but was grateful for the opportunity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maps582139
50,Dinner,"Enjoyed getting to Hollywood Blvd and seeing the stars the place is a hive of activity. Nice night but as I've found out LA too expensive and too noisy for me. I've seen it, been here got the t-shirt as they say, probably won't be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathleen20012014
20,What a dissappointment,"Over the years, scandals, and social media, has really trashed this once worthy tourist attraction.Trash, people writing and defacing certain stars, street vendors in your face, forcing their products on you. Especially the CD's. It has it's moments, but after you kick the trash out of the way to sit down, or sadly to say our homeless looking for a meal or place to stay, I think we need to turn the tables and make this a proud ""walk of Fame""; again. I wouldn't recommend for young couples, Seniors or kids at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OpieT_12
30,"Yeah go see, but be warned if have younger kids or kids period.","I'd just wait period to bring your kids here. I hate to say it but people have lost morals and dignity. We saw 2 people with literally their butt hanging out. Showing it on purpose. Another guy was holding sign saying ×××× ""someone's name here"" and also saying chosing to say it right as I past him with my 7 year old. Needless to say he got a nice mommy talk from me as I asked why he couldn't atleast wait till we passed him to say his garbage. He of course had his face covered up and acted like he never heard me staring. Pathetically coward. Another man was mentally ill yes or on drugs was spitting out food which almost landed on my niece as he almost swat her passing by her yelling out ""blank "" you "" blank"" everyone. To top it off the fake spiderman by the hand print area was taking pics with people. He starts talking to us then grabs my daughters arm and says let's take a pic. He about got punched grabbing my kid for one. Then said he worked off tips and donations. I'm like um ok. Then after my mom takes a pic which he insisted we take. I hand him the literally only 2 bucks I had and he said oh no its 5 dollars. I was not to happy about him setting me up like that. I told him he said he worked off tips and donations so if it's 5 then say 5 plus don't just grab my kid so technically I should be charging him for taking a pic with my kid. He got very defensive saying he didn't do anything wrong. I said do not grab people's kids like that again. He said he needed to make money too and it was no hard feelings. Oh yes there was after that. Soooo wrong. Beware of the guys like him. He ruins it for the rest of them out there that actually aren't like him. Oh and I also saw someone selling /swapping drugs on some corner. Will never go back. Ever. Plus traffic was sooooo horribly bad going there and leaving. Could be so much better, but I'm sure law enforcement is doing all they can already and need more help.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dandrburke
20,Seemed seedy and shabby,Wasn't the glamorous visit we expected. Full of low quality souvenir shops and a lot of homeless. We found santa Monica much more glamorous and only 25 minutes down the road.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaybottonley
30,Bit meh,"We went because you have to when in hollywood. Bit of a let down really. busy, not very well signed so you dont know where to start. Bit grungy and run down. Such a shame totally missing the hollywood glamour i thought it would have. Stayed for about 10 mins.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fayred2
40,Didn't spend much time here,We saw some of it but we're quite annoyed by the people trying to get us to spend money on their music CDs. Very touristy. You can see the Hollywood sign from a spot here but it was pretty hazy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisek857
20,Disappointing,For what is classed as one of the main reasons for visiting Hollywood this is a disappointment. It was dirty and full of very dubious characters. Lots of people dressed up as superheroes trying to get money off you for having a photo taken with them. It was very tacky. I thought it would be a lot more classy (maybe I should have read other reviews first!). I certainly wouldn't visit in an evening with children. Maybe it's better during the day!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseJ1029
50,A once in your life MUST!,"This is such a cool place to visit. There is so much to do and see. I highly recommend taking one of the tours in town. If you can find Garrett as a driver, tell him we said hi. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connies138
50,Makes you smile,"Walked up and down the walk of fame.Is it worth a look ? You bet , it's brilliant. Stats from the past to current have there own bit of space on the walk and fun to find your favourite.A lot of people approach you trying to sell you stuff or asking for money. It's not a problem to say no as they politely smile and my be on to the next tourist.If you ever get the chance do it.This really does take you back to when you where a kid when you see some of the names. Enjoy10/10",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Muzzyman123
40,Just as expected,"My whole life I grew up hearing about the Hollywood Walk of Fame. So after 42 years seeing it for the first time...it was exactly as I expected it to be, just longer and with more stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/583chanif
50,As expected,The walk is just a pavement walk but all the same it was nice. Plenty of empty stars waiting for new celebrities to accommodate. A must in LA but do not expect any magic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcekpl
20,Shabby must see,Ok. You don't visit LA without seeing the walk of fame. But you question whether it's worth it. It's a shabby collection of offerings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U8335PTalexanderm
10,Forget your vision of Hollywood glamor,"If you've ever imagine Hollywood as a magical, glamorous place, a few minutes on the Hollywood walk of fame will disabuse you of all those notions. Hollywood boulevard is gritty, schlocky, and disappointing, filled with sketchy off-brand costumed characters, dive bars, and tacky souvenir shops. Learning that the wake of fame is more about financial contributions than honoring those involved with the entertainment industry was the last straw for me. Not worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanlintelman
50,Busy busy,It was hard to take pictures of stars and theres someone that is trying to hustle you. Like the tourist drop top vans. Anyway the walk of fame seems to go on forever take as many pictures that you can. Also a number of other things to take pictures of. 🍕 place Andres has good pizza so stop by. Parking is about 20 if you want to be close. Hard to find cheap parking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unsatisfied19
50,Salim,This is something which no one has its got all the super star stars on the ground except for Mohammed Ali who's star is on a wall.It's due to respect of the nameGood place to walk around and have fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/659syeds
50,Different place ... must visit,"My daughter, son, wife and I enjoyed 5-6 hours walking and exploring the street and surroundings.... It was amazing experience... you will see a lot of artists doing amazing things.Search for your favorite celebrities stars and take memorable photo.Don't miss Hollywood celebrities homes visit on great mountain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fadim386
50,Fun,"Just walk it! We had a lot of fun! For those of us baby boomers, you can relive your childhood! Be careful of the "" characters"" they prey on foreigners...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bk2theisland
20,Tacky mess,"Makes Oxford st and Piccadilly look classy, go if you have to...especially to see the graumans theatre with the hand prints but basically this is a total tourist trap over run with hustlers and sadly with many homeless and destitute people looking for handouts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peteyzz
40,Better than I thought,Have never been star struck but surprised myself by how impressed I was with the stars. Many I hadn't a clue about though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackieb814
50,FANTASTIC LOCATION!!!,"Fantastic location to stay if you want to be right in the middle of everything Hollywood!!! Train station straight across the road, eateries gallore, and just so much to see and do!! The staff were extremely helpful, the accommodation was very clean and roomy.There are a few stairs at the entrance - be aware if you have bags - but don't let that put you off because it's definately only a minor hiccup.Will definately stay here again if I ever find myself back in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/83shaunab
30,Nice no more,"If it your first time to Los Angeles I guess it is a must.Anyhow, walking along the stars doesn't say anything to those who are not familiar with the names.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shifo13
40,Walking on stars,A simple street can only be market on stars.Stop take a picture and walk again. And stop again. Thats all. Be Carefull you could not run .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yukselt781
20,Not a safe place in night,"If you are planning to visit this place, try to take a walk at dolby side, the stars are everywhere.The shows and theaters are in the same side also. After that you could take a tour in bus to have a full look at the place.The other side is full of homeless and have a bad smell everywhere. You might go there if you have a specific place to visit like the gifts shops.Overall, it's a 2 hours maximum place without counting dolby tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abdulazizaI1936CE
40,Nice attractions,A majority of what you would want to see is near the TLC theatre. Lots of shopping and people on the streets. We parked at the mall and had our parking validated. Just purchase something in the mall to get validation.Michael Jacksons star is right in front of the TLC theatre. Beware of the guys giving their CD's away. They are aggressive and are expecting money if you take their CD. We just kept walking. There are many of them.Overall it is worth the trip and there is plenty for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vivo1970
20,Not at all as I imagine,"It was our first visit to Hollywood and we were waiting for the flare normally seen in the movies and TV shows.Instead, there was this dirty street where besides finding stars with popular character names, there was not much to do.I suppose you have to go there once, but do not plan to spend more than an hour and go somewhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hugosolano
50,Amazing place to visit,"I went here with friends and there so many good places to take pictures, and stores and artists. I reccomend this place for anyone that comes tk LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamPeixoto
40,Must see,"Great experience very busy lots of people, only thing to watch out for is people dressed in character costumes esp. if you have children they hound you to get a photo with the kids then when you say yes all his friends jump in and you have to pay all of them money each.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennRain
50,Such Fun!,This walk is like going back in time and remembering the stars of years and even decades past. Fun to walk with someone and share memories of the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JANB378
40,Vacation,Great landmark and it was good to see in person. Tip litely as all who get photographed require you to give a tip. Watch your wallets and pocketbooks closely and enjoy the show!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/599kristinh
40,Iconic must visit attraction albeit over crowded,"When in LA! The walk of fame on Hollywood Boulevard is a must visit attraction to seek out your favourite star of stage, screen or music for a photo.It's incredibly popular so you can guarantee the complete mix of LA lifestyle from tourists to homeless, street performers, costume characters to the sometimes freaky star hopefuls. For younger kids it can be a bit daunting, even a fake Freddy Kruger looking for tips with photos is scary in daylight to the kids!Better to get up early and beat the crowds down there for a look around as mid morning to evening it is thronged with crowds and not all of them will look out to avoid barging into you or the kids.A must do landmark to visit but time it for the low crowds to get the best out of it especially if you want a photo of you and a star, not you, a star and seven other people crowding the shot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrNefarious
20,Incredibly tacky and only mildly interesting,"I would only recommend going for a limited period of time -half an hour at most. Go see the Chinese Theater (did not go in, but you can take a tour) and maybe the Dolby where the Oscars are given out. There are people dressed up in pretty poor costumes who will take photos with you for a price, homeless walking around and probably pickpockets. It is cool to see the stars and maybe to get a photo or two, but after a while, you feel dirty (it is kind of a dirty street and although it has come up in the past couple of years, watch out) and tired. Take a look at some of the movie theaters and the Ice Cream shop where an actress or two was discovered (maybe Lana Turner?), but don't waste more time and avoid all the offers of tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/southmiamibeachbum
10,"Overrated tourist trap, dirty and hot","Unless you have a burning desire to see a particular star's name in the pavement, avoid it.BTW, a lot of the names are repeated so it's hardly a unique experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/484julianb
10,Multiple Visits Always Bad,"I live in Orange County and we often have visitors from Europe. Everyone wants to see the stars and everyone expects much more. This place is not what you see on TV. It is dirty, stincky (literally), full of drug addicts and homeless. If I was not a in aposition to take family and friends there- I would never come back.On a positive side, there is parking available but everything else is bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/677margaretap
30,Stereotypically tourist,"The walk of fame is in a neat area, so if you're walking around it's worth checking out. If you're trying to find a specific star, figure out where it is before you get there. Of course there is a crowd and lots of ""characters"" taking photos for tips. Just be careful of slow walkers and frequent stoppers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z4128QPmariab
30,Could do with a clean,The walk of fame is one of the things you must see in Hollywood. It was good looking for celebrities stars but there was a lot of people trying to persuade you to go on tours and people dressed in characters trying to get photos with you so you can give them money. The area is quite dirty in places which was disappointing. The local government should really clean the place up a little bit to make it nicer for tourism,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucky1forever
50,Never looked up!,It is extremely busy down here so it may be better to get there early. I spent most of the time looking down so make sure you keep your belongings safe as you are likely to be distracted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoBeck82
40,It's busy. but kind of neat.,"I particularly like waking and looking for obscure stars. It is busy and a tourist trap for most of the day, but I liked going on walks in the early morning (6 am or so). I probably would not recommend that unless you are someone who is unlikely to be messed with as there is a fair amount of homelessness and odds and ends. During the days, it's where you catch the tours. Do one, but negotiate. We were able to get a tour for four for $75 and it was fun and gave you the general overview. You just have to do it when you are in LA, but the fake superheroes and people selling mix tapes are going to be part of the generally crowded scenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BBCard1
40,"Highly overrated, touristy - Go if you love your stars","The place is full of tourists as well as homeless and not so nice looking people. There are people in costumes, people showing tricks and lot of souvenir shops",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ideepakc
30,Guess you should see it once,"I wanted to say I had seen it at least once. It's super crowded, very touristy but you do get to see the stars that line the Boulevard. Definitely look up where to park. Don't be there after dark. It's sketchy enough during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UtahAlice
30,Don't spend too much time here,"I think this is one of those places you go once and you're done. You are basically walking up and down the street looking at the stars on the sidewalk. We didn't see any celebrities, but we did see crazy people dressed up as characters that want to charge you to take your picture with them. The sidewalks are dirty and smelly also. We couldn't wait to get out of there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djbls
30,Overcrowded and dirty,"While it was interesting to see a lot of famous names and a bit of history, it wasn't as expected. Too many people staring at the floor makes for a lot of bumping in to each other. Added to that, some of the stars were barely readable under the dirt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gingerceej
50,First time in LA,"Well its a huge city with so many attractive places such as Disneyland, Universal studios, Santa Monica beach, Wax Museum, and many many things to do. The city was too hot during day and so crowded. But the people were kind and polite. I think it will be better to visit this city during winter season.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22salema
10,Yuk,"Typical tourist trap. People paying dressed up ""superheroes"" to take pictures of them(??!!). Dirty, packed pavements with shops full of overpriced cheaply made souvenirs. I know most people who visit LA will visit but honestly it's not a nice place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BMAC2010
30,Soooo busy,We went on a Saturday evening and it was impossible to see anything around the hundreds of very rude people. Went back again during the day and it was much better,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamsitaly2018
40,What a Crazy Walk,"So many people, so many people that dress up and you can take pictures with. What out of a few, they will separate and you feel obligated to tip both when they should just split the tips.. We enjoyed finding out favorite star's..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scubaldy
30,Disappointed,I was disappointed by the walk of fame- i found it quite dirty when I stayed here. I had completed all I wanted to see within a few hours. There's a good buzz around the area at night time although I personally found it a hard area to get something nice to eat (sit down meal in the evening) as it was all fast food outlets. Lots of people dressed up as superheroes etc although if you want a picture with them you must tip/pay. I stayed in this area for a few days but mostly got the train (easily $1.75) to other areas of the city like Santa Monica/universal studios/Venice beach where I preferred to spend my time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanne1592
30,It's not all it's cracked up to be,I love walking in Hollywood and seeing the stars in the sidewalk but people should know that's what you'll see... Stars on the sidewalk and stores like you see most other places. Hollywood is dirty and has a lot of wierdos walking around that try to get you to pay money to take pictures with you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/848andreaq
50,A day in Hollywood,"Fun place for tourists to go. Make sure to visit Hollywood and Highland. Lots just neat stuff to see, like the Chinese Theatre, Wax Museum, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/955kiraf
30,Somewhat underwhelmed.,"After seeing this place on TV for 30 years I had clearly set my expectation very high. On arriving in the area I was shocked to see how run down the area is. I never expected this part of Hollywood to be so down market. There were some fun things to see but it was all within 1 block. If nothing else, we ticked a box.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/113andym
30,"Must-see craziness, if only once","What would be a visit to Hollywood without a stop at this most famous highlight (well, short of being offered a three-picture deal at Paramount)?! I highly recommend parking at The Dolby Theater complex at Hollywood and Highland and walk a 3-block circuit. It puts you right at the heart of the ridiculousness of Hollywood Blvd., especially in summer where it is jam-packed with indigenous or transient locals, police, tourists, traffic, all in a festive atmosphere a la New York’s Times Square, with all 15 million visitors seemingly on the same day. While it is unlikely you will want to walk the fifteen blocks to see all of the 2,500+ stars, you will nonetheless find many of your favorites to photograph or stomp on. Grauman's Chinese Theatre [later Mann’s and now TCL] is just west of The Dolby; Vine St. is quite a distance east. Often you will find either theater hosting some sort of major red carpet awards event (my photos are from the AFI Lifetime Achievement Awards held in June), so spectators might actually see a celebrity up close. Jimmy Kimmel tapes his show across the street, and has been known to pop outside from time to time. *** Watch your pockets, folks! Thieves are everywhere, and the street performers can be aggressive. Parking: The Dolby will cost you $5-10 without validation, less with. Attemptts to find a metered space or something on the nearby residential streets may prove futile or very expensive---the City of LA Parking Enforcement is relentless and often mean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SmarterBear
20,Hollywood Walk of Shame....,This area in general is iffy at best. Shady characters everywhere. Cheap trinket/ souvenir shops everywhere. We took refuge in one of them when we couldn't shake a homeless man that wasn't quite 'all there.' Such a big hype for a bigger letdown. Perhaps they should move the stars to a better part of town. Snapped a few pics. But didn't linger. Early morning might be a better time to visit?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/417aprilleb
40,A Hollywood icon.,"No trip to Hollywood would be complete without a walk down the Walk of Fame. Stretching for blocks along Hollywood Boulevard, it's fun to stroll and look at all the stars, if you can dodge the crowds. The area around the Chinese Theater is most crowded, but the further you get from it, the more the crowds thin out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ERFSU82

40,Crowded but Not to Be Missed!,"This area is very crowded and can be hard to see the stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. However, there's also a lot of characters and people dressed up in costumes to make up for it. I even saw a man dressed like Jack Sparrow who looked just like Johnny Depp.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saraearle
50,Star struck,I came to find Judy Garland and Walt Disney. It didn't dissapoint. It's long but full of names we all recognise and a great atmosphere with everyone taking pics with their favourite star. A must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonhadley
30,Not what I expected,First time in Hollywood and i expected it to glamorous and exciting but the relaity was quite differnt. The walk of fame was very dirty and in front of old shops and even had homeless people asleep on some of it. The road was also getting ready from a premiere that night of Alice Through the Looking Glass. Wouldnt go back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Finn_Freya
30,Disappointing but had to tick it off the list,"Very crowded, smelling of urine, rundown area.Could do with some kind of guide as to where all the stars are located otherwise you end up wandering aimlessly. A fair amount of the stars are duplicated which takes the feeling of visiting your favourite actor/actresses star away from being special.Head to California Pizza Kitchen for something to eat and a great view of the Hollywood sign from the outside seating area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daz1975
30,Tick the box and move on,"Yes, there are the stars on the pavement, and the imprints in front of the Chinese Theatre. But there is also an abundance of cheap shops selling all sorts of tourists' low quality souvenirs and T-Shirts...and you will be offered a tour every 20 meters...if you want to take one, you should negotiate the price. We were offered more than 50% discount as we started to walk away. You'll want to see as it is so famous, but not worth spending too much time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Francesca_in_London
30,People stop and take pictures. Just know it.,"We went to Hollywood to see the wax museum. We spent a little time looking at the walk, however there were so many people you could not really see the names. The street characters were funny. I stayed away from them. We were easily bored and moved along. My advice is to go on off season, perhaps really early, if you want to actually see the sidewalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere

20,Not worth a look,"Unless you have stars in your eyes, don't waste your time. The only point of interest was somebody had built a mini wall around Donald Trump's star",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussellH796
20,Crowded,Very crazy area. Couldn't really see the stars on the walk because there were so many people. looked like NYC freak show. People were dressed up trying to get money to take pictures with them. Not impressed.. Don't care to see it again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zutti
10,A waste of time,"There are too many people walking along here so you will have a hard time seeing the stars in the pavement. Watch out for ""up-and-coming"" artists that will hand you a CD, sign it, and then charge you $20 for it. Same goes for Mickey Mouse, Superman or whomever famous ""personality"" that will grab you for a photograph and charge you for it. Add to that, the ""performance artists"" are not any good and you'll have the walk of fame in a nut shell.Best time to visit is past 11 pm. Most people have gone home by then.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61_yvindt
40,A happy pedometer,"If you are a die hard fan of a particular celebrity, then you can spend a lot of time here - looking for a star sign on the path that bears the celebrities' names. It is crowded and the energy is overwhelming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/966amritar
10,Disappointing,"Maybe we walked the wrong section. It was night. Expected cool lighting & flowers or something to set an atmosphere. Maybe I was expecting something Hollywood worthy. Streets were littered & dirty, bums laying around right on the sidewalks, felt unsafe & out of place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyhope
50,Perfect,"The Hollywood walk of fame is a complete success when it comes to entertainment for adults, children, friends, couples, gays, straight people. It's the must have getaway from the regular day to day routine to enjoy a full day of fun. On the plus side, if you're lucky you get to see shows live and also get a glimpse into the lifestyle of a few celebrities by joining a tour. There is also the Hollywood wax museum and movie theatre and other attractions to explore. There is shopping for sure and other exciting things to see. You just need to check out this star filled magical place for yourself and you'll understand what a complete day of fun is. You will not regret it.

50,Must visit - fun for the whole family and it's free!,"My wife and I visited the Hollywood walk of Fame and it is great way to spend few hours in Hollywood, the tourist flock to Hollywood and there are so much to do and see in Hollywood. There are restaurants/cafe/bars and hotels and the Dolby Theatre where the Oscars are held. You can also see the Hollywood sign from here.It's a great day our, depending where you are staying you can take a bus to Hollywood walk of fame, we stayed in Beverly Hills and we took a bus ride and it was only USD2.50 each for us and the bus stop in right in the street where Hollywodd walk of fame is and the Dolby Theatre, also there is the Chinese Theatre in the same street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravsta2015
50,Great street characters. Without them it would be just stars in concrete,"Captain Jack Sparrow, Queen Elsa, Batman, Ironman & Marilyn Monroe all have amazing costumes & are lovely gentle people. The Hollywood chamber of commerce needs to clean uo the riff raff dressed in Spiderman, sexy cop & other cheap costume party outfits & keep the genuine characters who bring joy to the Boulevard",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EuropeFamilytrip
30,"Must do, but commercial, busy and not that clean!","When in LA, Hollywood Walk of Fame is an absolute must, but be prepared it's so commercial and touristy!! It's really busy and taking photos isn't easy as there are people everywhere! Also the street isn't that clean so the stars are quite dirty and there is litter. There are also loads of people dressed up trying to get you to have your photograph taken with them and they're not that good! Then there are people trying to get you to take a tour, and then there are the crowds! It really is busy. Considering that a load of money has been spent on the Hollywood and Highland Centre where you can park for $2 providing you buy something, and see the Hollywood sign, a bit more should of been spent on cleaning up the area that is bringing the tourists in. So, it's a must do, but just spend the two hours there, that really is enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S1890WMsusanw
30,Highlight,Went there on a tour and had about an hour to look around. We were able to check out grummans chinese and get a picture of the hollywood sign which is perfectly framed by the galleria there. The amount of stars in the walk of fame was overwhelming in the amount of time we had but it was enjoyable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/249chipb
50,A Must See for a Tourist,"For a first time visit to LA the Walk of Fame should definitely be on your list. We didn't walk it from beginning to end, it's over a mile long and it was 100 degrees in LA. We hung out in the area around the Chinese theater and Dolby theater. As expected, it's very crowded. Lots of characters and CD sellers (just like the Vegas Strip). Kind of hard to stop and take a picture with your favorite star.If you're offended by homeless people and cd sellers, then this isn't the place for you. But if you haven't lived a sheltered life and you're aware that America has homeless people and hustlers, then visit the Walk of Fame. Once is good enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159christianp
50,Must See,"The energy on the strip is awesome. Music, shopping, food, fun and laughs. As with any area you run into the area crazies but just keep walking....lol....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/277moniqueg
10,"Very disappointing, apart from the vintage cloths store","Very disappointed by the walk of fame. It's in a pretty run down area and the shops around it were tacky tourist focused shops. The pavement did have stars and handprints, but unfortunately you can't really see them for the crowds of people trying to sell you the tourist trips round the Hollywood Hills. Parking was 20 dollars, a waste given we couldn't wait to get out. Restaurants around the street were poor and dirty.The only consolation was the vintage cloths shop",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianHReview
40,Wow!,The Hollywood walk of fame was all that I expected. It runs along way if you want to see all the stars. My suggestion would be to go early in the morning if you really want to be able to read the stars and take some pictures. Afternoons it is crazy busy and you really can't enjoy it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoyalsFans
30,Tacky must - see,Despite claims it's been cleaned up this still a gloriously tacky must-see. There are so many names there now I fully expected to see my own name crop up!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Proudag
30,Lots of famous heros,"Enjoyable walk, super heros will take pictures with you for tips, lots of tourists and Asians who dont know what they're doing. Usually cameras taking video of people for some soft of tv or movie. Nice place but nothing special",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/knighttimedragon
20,Skip it,"The walk of fame is kind of lame. It's dirty and crowded and half the time you can't even see what's on the ground. There are sketchy people dressed up like animals or characters, Mr. Muscles harasses women, the $10 store is always 50%...If you want to go see a premiere or an event, it's organized and decent. Catching a movie at TCL or El Capitan is cool. But the stars aren't really that impressive themselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kateoS8832HT
40,Great,"First time we actually walked the strip and took photos. Worth the visit although there were some names in the stars where you have to wonder ""how that happened "" . Can be a little crowded if your trying to take photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jodie6106

10,Big mistake!,"My two granddaughters wanted to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame. We parked at a meter on a side street; parking is expensive and hard to find. On the way to the Boulevard, we actually walked through a drug deal: seller on one side, buyer on the other. My first hint that I had made a bad choice. Hollywood Blvd east of the old Grauman's Chinese Theater is dirty, smelly and dangerous. Every third person is hawking something, the girls didn't recognize most of the names in the sidewalk or couldn't read them through the grime. Not appropriate for small children or elderly. It was 2 in the afternoon and we didn't feel safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestcoasterLa
30,Interesting!!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame was interesting.. My father and I were a little disappointed because their was so many people and not having a map of the 'Stars' it was hard to find celebrities that we knew.. I was pleased that our Bars and Stars tour guide,Yousef, directed us to popular ones especially Muhammad Ali as we probably wouldn't have found him on our own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mandii119
40,Crowded but must do!,A must when you're in LA! It gets very packed so go early morning if you can. Walk around and see the stars of you favorite Hollywood actors and musicians. Make sure you see famous Dolby theater and the China theater as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KayWAmsterdam
40,One and done,"This is the kinda place where you go once and your good. Once you walk the walk of fame from beginning to end there's no real other reason to visit. Muhammad Ali's star is on the wall of the Dolby Theater in a corner. Michael Jackson's star is in front of the Chinese theater. This area was a bit dirty, they should probably hire some street cleaners or someone to pressure wash the side walks. There are tons of tours available, I did take a 2hr tour that brought us through the Hollywood Hills and we visiting some famous locations such as Eddie Murphys house, Bruno Mars house, which is now up for sale, the house from Iron Man/Charlie's Angels which I didn't notice was the same house, Al Pacino's house and had just missed him leaving (possibly) we stopped at a scenic view in which we were able to see the Hollywood sign from a distance and the city. I believe the company was called Prime Time Hollywood tours based on the charge on my credit card. We did also drive through Rodeo Dr, seen the store from pretty woman, great overall but only need to do it one time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maine3k2
30,Pity it was grotty,Pity it was grotty! Sad really lots of the stars were covered with gum and quite grotty! Whilst I appreciate it is a very busy area it could do with some sort of scrubber dryer machine a couple of times a day maybe!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twistedlemons
40,Horribly busy,"Obviously this is a must see, but it is also really crowded and therefore uncomfortable. I would check it out at Hollywood/Vine rather than Hollywood/Highland as it is difficult to read names or take photos unless you want to see someone specific, i.e Robin Williams, Michael Jackson....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jubilee-jo
10,Just to say you have been.,"The dirtiest place I have ever seen. It's cool to be able to say ""I've been there"" but to be honest there are homeless people everywhere; people offering you ( well we got asked at least 2) drugs. Get a bit much at night the freaks really do come out.I was disappointed to be honest to be such a tourist attraction and be unkept as it is! I wouldn't go back. It's like tick: done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DreamJetsetter
50,Fun fun fun,A must do when in Hollywood. Packed with people everywhere. Be careful as a lot of cons there. Characters get you take a photo of them then charge you.

30,You could walk for miles,"There are so many Hollywood stars to see you could walk around for hours, but the sidewalks are packed so you wont see them all.

40,Busy,The walk is very good but everyone is looking down to try and find the stars they know. It gets very busy around the main area. It is hard to see these stars.

40,A must see attraction but very crowded,"This is a must see attraction in LA but be aware that the sidewalks are very crowded both sides and that it runs for about 3 miles all in.

It is something you should do if you feel the need, but it is not that interesting.It is always very busy.

30,A must do but....,"This is always on the list when going to LA but it is a serious disappointment, it's longer than you expect but much much busier _ almost impossible to find the stars that you want, lots of ""look a likes"" standing trying to get you to take photos of the party and them for a fee.Still I have done it will not be back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarryB194

30,Cool place to take some pictures,"I recommend that you don't go at night (we went at night), because it is super crowded and hard to take pictures. However, its more beautiful with the neon signs if you choose to go at night anyway. It's an easy destination, it's one big, long street that you walk back and forth. Sometimes, its hard to take pictures of the stars, because of the crowd (you're basically blocking sidewalk traffic). You walk up to the Chinese Theater where you can see hand-prints of Hollywood Stars on cement. They also had different characters on the street where you can take pictures with them (ex : Elsa, Minions, Batman, Superman, Michael Jackson, etc.).It's a nice attraction and one of the must-see in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexfoodi

50,Day visit,I visited the walk of fame on a day trip from Vegas and it was great to see a tourist attraction that I have seen on TV many a time. It's great to see all the different names and genres that are on the walk. The only down side is that it is so busy and it makes it difficult to get photographs. It is a sight to take in if you are in the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ferryfo
50,Really Fun,"best during the daytime lots to see and alot of attractions, restuarants, shops to go to. we really enjoyed the chinese theater and took a lot of pictures with all the characters we go to see harley quinn, elsa from frozen, and batman which our kids loved!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I8972GGmelissam

Think about it.A list of names of mostly multi-millionaires stuck on the ground by the local Chamber of Commerce to attract mostly non-millionaires to come spend a few dollars more than they can afford....while at the same time having the Teamsters homeless unit make you feel bad about the few dollars you do spend on tat looking at the millionaire names who already made their money when you last saw their movie...phew!Thank goodness we just went to tick the box!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJC_On_Road

20,Average at best,"Just down the walk of fame today, I guess it's one of those things to tick of your list. Like others say it's not the cleanest, shops are tatty and you get hassled a lot. If you don't expect to much it's worth a look",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/245eddd

30,Hollywood area and the walk of fame,"Just having a weekend to visit LA I had to make the most of my time. So the walk of fame was on my list. Try going there either early morning or later in the afternoon when it is not conjested especially if you want to see your favourite STAR's star! I was hunting to find mine when I discovered that there is a Hollywood walk of fame of who's who's star listed by street address, which is great! Save time and look for it!There is plenty to do and see in the area. It is probably the most visited landmark on Hollywood. Don't forget to give a buck or two to those poor souls who dress up in character costumes all day in the heat waiting to take pictures with you or your family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Worldtravelinfo
40,"One Day, Couple Hour Stop","Certainly, couldn't visit LA without walking the street. Not what it's cracked up to be, but neat experience nonetheless.

20,The Stars Are Lost In Filth,"I have walked this area many times but this time brought some friends from NZ with us. We parked down the back street somewhere as parking is always so difficult or expensive around here. It is a bit dodgy getting to Sunset but no issues really. Just had to go around a few sleeping homeless lying on the sidewalk. I was surprised at how filthy the sidewalk was. It hasn't rained in ages but surely there is some water (despite the restrictions) and a machine to give the sidewalk a bit of a scrub now and again. Some of the names were partially hidden under filth. The tourist stores are grimy also. I was also surprised at the amount of homeless around compared to a year or so ago. The impersonators are everywhere which is a bit entertaining. It is very busy and crowded around the areas that are more restricted in space like Chinese Theatre. We all couldn't wait to leave especially after we had needed a bathroom and the only thing we could find was McDonalds and oh my goodness- the toilets were filthy as they are used by every man and their dog!! If you haven't seen it before it is a must, but once is probably enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AucklandWiz
30,Yeah Just did it but nothing special,"I guess you have to do if in Hollywood , but nothing special. Plenty of hawkers trying to sell day tours etc , quite annoying after a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DWgoldengrove
20,Just a real let down,"The city should do something to clean this place up. It has so much potential.

30,So busy it was hard to see the stars!,"It was so crowded on a Friday afternoon you could hardly see the stars let alone take any pictures. The walk of fame apparently goes for 18 blocks (and I don't think it's straight, believing it goes around corners too) so figuring out where to go is really hard. We saw a few stars that appealed to us but it would have taken ages to try and see them all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisan670

40,Great experience,Went in August and always a good experience to spot the stars. However the stars towards the capital records building are in need of a good clean as looking very dirty,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulH80
30,Just go to say you've been once so you don't have to go again.,So this is one of the things that everyone is supposed to do when they go to LA. So I guess you do have to do it. Along with 10 million other people. It is really neat to see some of your favorite stars' stars. Very touristy area with a lot of other touristy attractions. But you gotta do it.

30,Tourist thing to do,"Went with low expectations and it actually wasn't that bad. I don't really care about celebrities and their stars, but it was the tourist thing to do so went with the family.Took a picture at Muhammad Ali's star at the Kodak theater. Ate some gelato at the shop right next to it.Lots of poorly dressed characters around that will take pictures with you for tips. Most of them looked terrible and shady. Lots of people selling tours.

40,All of life is here.....,"The walk is between Hollywood Vine and Hollywood Highland on the red line of the Metro. Easy to get off at one end and get back on at the other. It's interesting to see the names but most of them were unknown to me.What was more interesting were the people dressed as super heroes, the dancers, the people wanting to charge you for a photo or any other way/scam of getting your money. The lights in the evening for the clubs, shoes and shops add to the atmosphere.However, alongside all of this glitz are the homeless people and beggars, an uncomfortable reminder of a marginal society.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/367jackiem

50,Don't get overwhelmed,"My family of 4 stayed at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel for a week so we got to visit the walk of fame many times. Do not get overwhelmed. It reminded me a lot of Time Square but on the West Coast. A lot of people hustling for money. Lots of characters taking pictures for tips. If anyone puts a CD in your hand they are expecting money back. Don't accept it unless you like music and you want to support local talent. If you happen to give money to one person everyone will swarm you like sharks in water. Just my experience. Do not be afraid to say no. Everyone on Hollywood Walk of fame is Hustling something. We did enjoy The Chinese Theatre, Dolby Theater and enjoyed people watching. Have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brenth455
30,Watch out for street people,I was shocked at the amount of street people begging for money. Be careful if you go out after dark!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/246kandy
40,Oh the humanity of it all,People people everywhere and once again it's a summer time experience. I feel like that old colonial flag that read don't tread on me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeytd
50,Beautiful and Stunning Visuals!!!,What a place! Got to see many well known faces!!! An awesome experience. The oscars theatre and madame tussaud Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nishitbassist
50,amazing place,It was very nice place . crowded and there were several restaurants and stores and music DJ was nice . the stores closed at 12:00 amI feel as I were in times sequare NYI wish come back to city walk again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nooraamm

40,Great Picture oppurtunities,Fun place with plenty of chances to take photos. Watch out for the people selling CD's. They will want to give you a CD and tell you it's free. Once you take it they hound you for a donation. Just steer clear of them all together.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodawgs
50,"Find your star, unquie to Hollywood","Again, this is one of those things about LA that is known so much so that you have to visit. I actually enjoyed see all the stars I could. We stopped at Hollywood and Highland and I took a picture of the Chinese Theater from across the street so I got to see many of the stars. Again, motion pictures is not the only way to get on to the walk. There is music and other genres. If was also interesting to learn they put 12 per year and there is still considerable room to grow. It was very fun seeing stars of today as well as those, long ago. Again, if you are in LA, it is something you have to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
20,Homeless and rubbish,The stars are what you expect. Lots of tourist and you need to see it to say you have I guess. My issue with L.A. In general and here is no exception is that if you venture one minute of the main street you will be met with tramps and tons of rubbish on the streets. L.A. Is a dump. Don't waste time or money there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/r0biati
50,Pic. With the stars.,Excellent place to visit. Enjoy the walk finding out your artists star. If you are visiting the place with the whole family it is really good because everyone gets their exercise on.If you are taking kids it is really entertaining as well because they could either go to the Wax Museum or see the dressed up characters as you walk further.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magisa02
30,"Disappointing, yet curious","The walk start at Le Brea where we proceeded to look at every star and it soon became apparent that many of the stars are meaningless. The stars that are cared for and so feel as though they were deserved are around the Chinese Theatre. I was hoping for something 'special' but Bugs Bunny and Disney World have a star, you begin to doubt. Focus on the Chines Theatre and then look at the others as a curiosity. Also mind who you bump into, as we are all looking down, so not where we were going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/p1ttman
20,Don't need to do it again,"So we went...and can now say we did it. But it similar to being on the Vegas strip or in Times Square. It was crazy busy, with poorly depicted characters who yelled at you or shined a flashlight in your eyes if you tried to take a pic of them without paying them. There were peddlers / beggars. Shop carts were in the way of many of the squares. The street and sidewalk were filthy and trash everywhere. It was more ""stars"" than actual hand/footprint squares. We definitely liked the squares better than the shiny stars, but there weren't very many squares. If you must do it, trust me when I say you only need 30 min TOPS. Not much fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Floridafunsun
30,Just for fun,"You can not walk the walk of fame without looking at all the names in the stars at the pavement. Our daughters saw many names they did not know but we ""oldies"" saw many ""stars"". You must at least have seen it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1535T

30,Meh,"There were a lot of people on the street by 10am on the Tuesday we were there. The stars in the pavement were more interesting to we 50-something parents than to our teenage daughters. Nevertheless, we can now say that we've been to the Walk of Fame. Suggestion: Park at a meter. We went to a Public Parking garage and had to fork over $20 cash money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatM402
20,Kind of disappointing to all but die hard movie fans.,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is for the die hard movie fans. I am such a fan but found the whole thing actually kind of disappointing and, well, a major waste of time. There are sooooo many other far cooler things to do in LA than walk down a street looking at your feet for your ""favorite"" movie star(s).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanValJeanNAZ
50,"The ""touristy"" thing to do","What can you say? All the stars, and a lot that aren't really. Didn't spend a lot of time looking for names, but got a photo of Humphrey Bogart's and Robin Williams's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeithH281
50,"Cool place to see your favorite actor, actress, cartoon, singer, etc...","This is a neat thing to see. Your favorite actor, actress, singer, cartoon, any celebrity. It does stretch a good long ways on both sides of the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wonggary23
30,A must do ... a little dirty,"I was looking forward to going to the Hollywood walk of fame when we were planning our little trip, ""I've got to get a picture with Robin Williams' star"". I couldn't wait.When we got there it was crazy busy! Which I was expecting it was July (2016) I knew it wasn't going to be quiet but blimey there were so many people. There were tourists and then there were people dressed up as different characters/celebrities and then buskers which clogged up the street. This was frustrating because it made it very difficult to find the stars you want to see. Once you find the once you want to see they're not greatly taken care of, I had an image in my mind of them really standing out but some were covered in gum and some were cracked. Which is a shame because people come a long way to look at these stars! However I was still over the moon when I found Robin Williams' star!The Chinese theatre is definitely a must see, outside you will see the hand prints of people like dick van Dyke. Good photo opportunities!We went and had food in the Hard Rock there, food was lovely and cocktails were great! Got myself a souvenir cup! However it was quite pricey, so if you're watching the pennies I would definitely avoid!I must recommended UBER taxi service, if you haven't heard of this definitely download the app whilst you're over there. It's a cheap taxi service that is all done via an APP and you can pay for on there to. Got us to and from places quickly and cheap! Really handy to have in a busy city centre rather than jumping in a cab and not knowing how much it is going to cost!Hope this helps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claireryanne
50,Cool experience and lots of fun,"Hollywood stars are legendary. I always take out-of town guests to see them. We usually start our walk around Hollywood/Highland because there is plenty parking and on our way back, we have some food at the complex. Walk down and start at the Chinese Theater and walk on both sides of Hollywood Boulevard. The deal is, everyone looks down and calls out the famous names. This is also a great family activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LenaBalt
30,Just ok,"I really wanted to like the Hollywood Walk of Fame but unfortunately for me it really feels a bit overrated.If you have an absolute favourite star then just go straight to it but it's pretty crowded, some stars are in dodgy parts of Hollywood so some may not find it too safe. Having said that we only walked part of it so others may get a different experience. It's a box ticker really and there are better places to visit instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Impa88
30,Fun to do,"Ofcourse you have to visit the Walk of Fame if you're in LA.It's fun to find your favorite stars.Tip: invest in a map of where which star is on the boulevard (you can buy them for 2 dollars) your kids will love itAnd there is so much to do on the boulevard itself: shops, streetartists, waxmuseum, Ripley's, watching people from all over the world etc. etc.You can easily spend an afternoon.Q: Do I think it's the most wonderfull thing to do in LA?A: No (go to the Getty!)Q: is it fun?A: Yes!Q: Should you skip it?A: Most certainly not!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NL-Rachel
50,Great!,It has been 14 years in between Hollywood visits for me. I was so impressed how much the city has cleaned up the Walk of Fame area. The new shopping malls are clean and state of the art. It is a perfect mix of old Hollywood nostalgia and tourism shops. It's definitely a place worth visiting at least once and get a picture with your favorite sidewalk star or wax museum figure!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaronj365
30,Once you've seen it - you're done!,"It was so busy, streets were crammed with people, people trying to shuv home made CD's in your hand, people trying to sell you trips on every street corner and people dressed up trying to get money for you having a picture with them! I feel sorry for people with children walking down here as yes they look fab but they talk to the kids and ask if they want a photo! Of course they do but really - poor parents either paying all the time or having a sad child when they have to say no?!Apart from that it was on our must do list! So we've done it! Walked down both sides, grabbed some lunch - and got out of there!Those that want advice on parking - we suggest Hollywood and Highland shopping mall - easy and central to the strip if you like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaffaChapman
30,Been there. Done that.,"Some parts of the boulevard seems kind of sketchy and really run down. Fun to see the stars, but then again they are just stars in the pavement. When you are not looking down to read the names, you are trying to avoid the hoards of other tourists and vendors, who want you to go on tours of Hollywood. Kind of a must see but not really that special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnjeF_13
20,Not what I expected,Yes the stars are there but I expected them to be well maintained and not covered in filth. In some places there are so many people busking for a buck you would be trampled by the crowd if you stopped for a happy snap. The local goverment should be ashamed of themselves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U5593ERdaves
40,Happy Kids,"I knew it would be a zoo, but my kids (and wife) would have been very disappointed if we didn't go!So yes it was a Zoo, but everyone got to take a picture next to their favorite stars; Michael Jackson for my son, Shirley Temple for the little one and of course since it's a zoo the pictures with the Disney characters the snakes on your neck (you get the idea)Helpful tip if you drive and park there, grab a coffee or a snack before leaving and validate your parking ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nbussenius
10,Scary. Place not for really for kids,This place was not what I was expecting at all. There were people as soon as you get on the walk to con you out of money. Avoid the place if you can. There are other fun things to do in California than this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabeth72450
40,Iconic and free! What's not to like.,"When you visit Hollywood you can't really miss this. The iconic stars on the ground, the constant animation on the streets, the beautiful Chinese Mann Theatre. Just watch out for the many cosplaying people who will expect a tip when you take a picture with them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GerryD90
20,Skip it,"We unfortunately arrived mid afternoon. The place was overrun with tourists and souvenir barkers. Dirty and crowded. If you are trying to find a particular celebrity star or handprints/footprints at the Chinese theatre, make it your first stop in the day and make it a quick one.It is not what the travel books paint it to be.Disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/386greerm
20,Terribly crowded in July,"We hit the walk of Fame on a Sunday afternoon in July, which was a huge mistake. There were thousands of people jostling around in between belligerent hawkers, pan handlers and surly street performers. I am sure in the evening in the off season it would be fun but it was not when we went. It was fun to look for your favourite actor's star but if you stopped you would be trampled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gbawpg
30,Keep passing me by,"Lots to see here, it's like Vegas all over again.. Take pictures by your favorite famous character and there both print and living. Most tour buses and rides depart from here check out the famous Chinese theater, Dolby theater and we enjoyed our visit at the Madame Tussauds wax museum. Watch out of the sketchy characters specially at night they do expect you to pay them for any picture or encounter. Must see if you plan to get the full LA experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Techanlada
30,How to see the Hollywood sign and Walk of Fame in 2 hours for $2,"Best place to park is Hollywood and Highland shopping centre. If you are driving, the entrance to the parking is to the left of the Loews hotel. Parking itself is pretty straight-forward but it's a vast underground carpark, poorly sign-posted for pedestrians and cars alike.From the shopping centre's outdoor walkways you can see the HOLLYWOOD sign and there is a nice area that has been created to enable you to take photos with the sign in the background.From the shopping centre you walk down one level on to the street and on to the Walk of Fame. Plenty of photo opportunity and an interesting street for a stroll.If you have your parking ticket endorsed by one of the shops in the centre the rate is just $2 for 2 hours.We easily did the viewing of the sign and the walk of fame + a Starbucks in the 2 hours.Job done, attractions ticket off!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelbug8344
30,Lots of people,This is a very crowded slice of Hollywood. It is very hard to get pictures without feet or shopping bags.There are a few people in costumes standing around if you want a picture with them. And little side stores you can wonder in and out of.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monkebones
10,Over rated dirty and pest,"Spent a day walking around and take you in the stars and the sites. It is a very overrated place, and would not return again. A lot of people are begging for money asking for money for pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiltonMan308
30,Nothing special,"Honestly, nothing special. I expected the way more. Area is pretty unsafe, dont go outside this street. Ok, it should be seen, bit not more than 10-15 minutes to spend there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/871vukm
40,"A must, but don't expect it to be glamourous.","As many have already said, Hollywood Boulevard and the Walk of Fame isn't quite what you expect. Parts if it are a bit sketchy and its funny because some of the most recent stars are placed in these parts of the road so it isn't at all as glamorous as it seems when they do the unveiling.However the street does eventually get a bit nicer around the area of the egyptian and chinese theatre, and returns to being sketchy like 2 steps after... But it's experiences like these that remind you that this is a living breathing city where it's not just glamour and fame, that's only one side of it. I personally loved this reveal as it made the city feel more real.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Atraveler111
20,"It was worth a look, but not much more","My wife and I thought we would take a walk on Hollywood BLVD and see the stars! It was cool going through and seeing all the tiles on the floor but there are so many to see! Quite overwhelming so if you are going for your first time, don't try to make it a point to see every single one! A couple of other pieces of advice, there are a lot of people there and it can get very hot in the afternoon! So an early morning or late afternoon is probably best to do this. If you do go in the afternoon, bring a few extra dollars to slurp after drink or grab after snack along the BLVD, go into a couple of stores to cool down if you need. Lastly, the more notable names are closer to the front of the Chinese Theatre, across the street directly in front and a couple of big names in front of the statue on the corner of Hollywood BLVD and La Brea. Hope you enjoy it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thefilmmakersociety
50,How do you walk by this....take notice and roll with it,"Any tourist thing to do is walk along Hollywood Blvd and check out the names. Find your celebrity and do a selfie. This is Hollywood magic. Before the world of people looking down at their phones, the stars on the sidewalk gave people a reason to look down and walk. Ends up,being fun. Try to ignore the people dressed up looking for money....stay focused and enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22MichaelA22
40,Busy attraction but great fun,Very busy attraction but still great fun to see all the stars. Good fun to see the different imprints etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Littlelucytravels
20,Checked it off the list and that's about it,"Spent some time during the day looking at stars names and passed through in the evening getting off the metro. Would not recommend taking kids during the evening, night hours. If you want to see the stars go during the day and not on a weekend.Steer clear of characters and cd peddlers. Many homeless and shady characters, just has a dirty feel to it. Most shops are junk shops.However, the mall down from the Chinese theater with the view of the Hollywood sign is worthy of walking around.It is a must see because of the symbolism of it, but that's about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mpmba
20,Seedy and overrated,"The place is hectic and full of sketchy characters. A lot of poor quality character impersonators which will ask for a tip if you take a photo of them. We saw a Johnny Depp Willy Wonka impersonator be hit in the face by a homeless person. Street performers were fairly average also. The Stars extend a fair way on both sides of the street, we found we got the best view early in the morning at 7am when we went to get a coffee and no one else was out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clarenmillie
30,Tacky,"Tacky and nothing like I imagined but something ticked off my to do list. Plenty of parking nearby (€30) then went on a tour of Beverly Hills, rodeo drive etc, €20 each. Well worth the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lvegas12

50,GREAT SIGHTSEEING!,We parked in the garage by the Dolby Theatre. The garage has reasonably priced parking and make sure to validate to get the first two hours discounted. I enjoyed my time on the walk of fame. It goes for miles. I did not try to search for anyone in particular because it would take you all day but I ran into some of my favorites. There is so much to do and see on the walk of fame. I was also able to see the Hollywood sign as it was just a little down the ways from the parking garage. The walk of fame is packed and always busy but it was a must do for me at least once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/658valenciac
30,A Crowded Must See,"No trip would be complete. However, the crowds are unbearable and make it impossible to really take it all in. Imagine Times Square condensed to 1 side of the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jpschatz
20,Nothing special,There is nothing special about the walk of fame. It's a cheesy place with lots of tourist traps. At least we only stopped by for some five minutes on our way to the Getty Center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roberto_Lambauer
40,Great Street bit busy,I had a preconception about the walk of fame in that it was one street with all the stars laid out in a single line. This is not correct.The walk of fame is on both sides of the street and also along some of the adjacent streets. It's good to spot your favourites and take pictures although you'll have to be patient if you want to get a decent shot to let others pass by and wait for an opening.The best stars are typically near the Chinese theatre but if you have more obscure favourites then you'll have plenty of walking to do to find them.Also be prepared to see some stars covered by shop fronts or being sat on by the homeless - unfortunately this is just LA for you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NotAnotherTravelBlog

40,A must see sight when visiting LA,"We walked down the Hollywood Walk of Fame about 8pm after dinner on Hollywood Blvd one night. It was a nice walk & felt very iconic. Some of the area is a little run down but there were lots of people about and families checking out the stars on the sidewalk. I can imagine it being very busy on the weekend. I had heard from lots of people that it was disappointing but I don't think you can come to LA without checking out the stars, they're so iconic and we really enjoyed looking out for names we knew. My son, being a huge Star Wars fan, was especially excited to find Harrison Ford's star right outside the restaurant we had eaten in so that topped the visit for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesoley333
30,Tourist spot,It's crowded because it's a tourist spot so going during the week when it's less crowded is better. It's a landmark and it's fun to look for your favorite stars.

40,Walk this Way! Find your Star.,If you are going to TCL Chinese Theatre then Walk of Fame is right there. It is interesting as you walk down the street to see the names of past and present.

40,"While walking on Hollywood Blvd, I ..","tried to recall which ones I knew or my deceased Mother mentioned! But I feel the public is not really respecting them! Some empty stars had names written in permanent marker and most are dirty. The city should have a day where they mop or do something else to save and cleane these pieces of history! I took a short local tour and the local guide told me that there are 5 categories that celebrities may get a star. They are: movies, television, radio, recording, and live theater! That is why there are one of 5 images in the center of the star which are: a movie camera, a TV set with rabbit ears, a microphone, a phonograph record, and a theater mask! Some stars have received more than one star because they excelled in another category. Examples of them are Dinah Shore, Bob Hope, Gene Autrey, and Danny Kaye! However I do not know if these stars have more than one star. Impossible to tell with all the millions of feet that go over them every year...Sure Hollywood Blvd is crowded because tourists from all over the world come here. There are a lot of stores here and some do sell more than just junk. I got a really unusual store in a vintage shop. The impersonators mostly just bother families with kids..!

30,"Walk of Fame is nice but, theres more.","I used to work on Hollywood blvd. so I am quite familiar with the area. I'll break it down simply with what you can find along the boulevard.Walk of Fame. Stars go from La brea to Vine. Nice to see but PLEASE do not lie or touch the stars. Its gross. You dont even want to know what Ive seen go down on that sidewalk. Fun fact: Muhammad Ali's star is actually on the wall leading up to the stairs of the Dolby theater.Chinese Theater. You'll find all the famous footprints and handprints located in front of this historic theater. You can watch a movie or take a tour. Most of all of LA's movie premiers happen here. So dont be surprised if it is blocked off during the week (Mon-Wed mostly during mid summer and winter months) to make way for a premier. Upside? You might see a star.Dolby Theater. This is where the Oscars happen. Snap your pic going up the very same stairs Bey and Jay, Brangelina and every other major star has walked up. Not much else to do after you snap that pic though.Roosevelt Hotel: The very first Oscars was held here and its maintained that Hollywood elegance ever since. Stop by here if you just need to relax from the chaos of the boulevard or want to have a stiff drink before you continue on your trek down the walk of fame.Hollywood and Highland. Yes, there are shops on the street but, theres also a mall! People often pass it by not even noticing it. Other than the standard VS and Gap you can also find restaraunts and an awesome view of the Hollywood sign from here. You just need to go up to the fourth floor and make your way to the bridge walk way.Museums. You'll find the Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum and The Hollywood Museum all within walking distance. My favorite is The Hollywood Museum. Not only because its in the old Max Factor building but the they have a revolving exhibit of movie props and costumes on the top floor mixed with permenant exhibits throughout. Tip: If you eat at Mels Diner next door you can get a discount on the admission.El Capitain. Take the kids to a Disney movie here or try to score entry to Jimmy Kimmel Live! right next door.Although there are a lot of things to do within a three block radius there are also some annoying things you may come across...The Characters. You'll see all kinds of people dressed as characters along the boulevard. Some great, some that look like they've seen better days. If you decide to take a photo with one of these people settle on a fee first. They are not legally allowed to ask for money so you are ""tipping"" or ""donating"" to them. Give them your price and negotiate from there.CD peddlers. Rumor has it some of these cd's are blanks or have one song. They'll try to have you listen via headphones to persuade you to buy. Probably best just to steer clear.Scientology! They tend to disguise themselves along the boulevard i.e. Museum of Psychology, L. Rob Hubbard Museum, bookstores, personality test set ups. In the end its a lure to talk to you about their religion. If you are down for that sort of thing, go for it. If you'd prefer to keep you your beliefs in tact, look out for these hidden agenda pop ups.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaezaJay
30,Just OK,"Staring at the ground trying to read the various names while I walk in the heat isn't my favorite thing to do.There's quite a bit to cover if you want to see them all, and note that it's very busy by the Chinese theater.Fun for about 5 minutes IMO",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobChills
10,Disappointing!,"Very dirty street and over hyped! Do you expect me to go down on my knees and take a picture with a dirty star just because it has somebody's name on it?No, thanks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMS_1194
30,Underwhelming,The hostel I stayed in was just around the corner from the walk of fame so saw a bit of it while walking around and exploring.It is very spread out and hard to find specific stars. I wouldn't go to Hollywood boulevard specifically to see this but it is interesting reading the names as you walk around. I was surprised by how dirty all the stars and the streets in general were. Given its such a touristy spot I thought they would take more care with the appearance of the area.The performers and buskers in the area are worth checking out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brookeo850
50,So many stars!,"We walked the length of the boulevard and were amazed at so many names!!! Most of which we recognized.An easy walk and not too crowded, when we were there between 11am and 13.00. Loads of souvenir shops along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karstobb
30,Worth Seeing Once,"Hollywood Stars have some appeal, but most are not the characters they portend. Entertainment is a great experience and those who play their roles well can and should be admired for their talent, not worshipped. Those who show their true self off stage and have patriotic demeanors are worthy of more recognition. The walk of fame is worth seeing once if only to remember the names of those who have impresses you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/160halk
40,Good for a stroll and seeking out favourite stars..,A must do if you are in LA for a visit. Wander up and done both sides of the road looking for your favourite stars. There are Apps and websites that will help you seek out who you want to see and you need it as there seem to be hundreds of stars!Parking tip:there are plenty of places charging upwards of $10 for a couple of hours but there is a massive underground car park as part of the Hollywood & Highland Shopping centre. You access it from Highland Avenue 100m up from its junction with Hollywood Boulevard. If you validate your parking ticket in the shopping centre (including the small drinks concession on the stairs to the parking) is costs $2 for 2 hours!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulF109
30,Part of A Day in L.A. Tour,It was pretty cool seeing the stars although I would suggest doing it as a solo trip as opposed to part of a tour. It was too congested and too short of time to see all you wanted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelr575
30,Go to say you've been,This is exactly what it claims to be. A bunch of stars on the sidewalk. We went past the area surrounding the Dolby theater and were surrounded mostly with tourist shops and street performers. Go to say you've been there and done that but there's not a ton to hold the interest unless you're planning on shopping in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachaelVW
40,A Long But Unforgettable Walk,"It was great to see the stars of so many famous folks - recording stars/producers, film/tv/stars, etc. It's a long walk if you do it from beginning to end but it's worth the walk. Keep in mind that some areas can be a bit overcrowded and dirty (this is a high trafficked area and some folks don't use garbage cans to throw their trash away) but it is very interesting to walk, remember and take pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanieB0915
20,Wash the stars sometimes!,"We really wanted to show the boys the famous Hollywood Walk Of Fame but it was more like a walk of gum, street kids begging and a lot of tourists that were really excited by all the grime covering every other star.We did get to see some funny arguments between tourists and costumed characters that wanted money for the pics that already been taken. Otherwise not very entertaining but got offered tickets to like a million comedy and game shows but no kids allowed so we couldn't go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GanjaGoddess
40,Some Sidewalk Characters are Ridiculous,"Yea, this place is a must go in Hollywood of course, but I don't recommend having a super high expectation. The stops on sides are fabulous which all kinds of items are available and you will see lots of people dressing up as different movie characters, which is awesome.But some sidewalk characters are not that friendly. So there was this 'Spiderman' amiably approached me and my friend for taking a photo with us, of course we knew that usually tips are required but we really don't have any cash with us except for credit card at the moment, thus I have VERY NICELY declined the cordial offer and still the 'Spiderman' insisted to take the photo with me. I have told him THRICE that I really didn't have any cents with me at that point and well I believed that he was nice enough to entertain tourists purely but after the photo you could figure out what happened, once he realised that there really wasn't any tips, he turned furious and kept cursing at us. I simply don't understand why some performers could be so irrational. Such experience just made me feel like the whole attraction is nothing about hospitality",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattiekum
10,What a dive!!,I had a picture in my head of what the walk of fame would be like. I think I definitely romanticised it. What a dive! Trash everywhere. Prostitutes lining street. Wouldn't go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmaP1985
50,Nice place to walk in the night...,Its very nice in the night and not that crowded. Just dont take photos with the people wearing movies characters they will ask you to pay them between 1p to 20 $..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415ameere
50,Great atmosphere at Hollywood walk of fame,"The walk of fame is fabulous! Lovely walk to see all the stars, great atmosphere and photo opportunities. Not to be missed, plenty to see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C6134NQjos
30,Not was I expected!,Hollywood really is a world of its own and the Walk of Fame can easily be ignored for all the other things one is looking at at the same time. It's cool and it is a must-see when in LA but not worth more than a few blocks worth of walking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atlasshrugs
40,Neat but sleazy,"I've just completed my 5th or 6th visit to the Hollywood Walk of Fame and I'm not impressed. It is neat to see, but the smell of urine surrounds you. Creeps constantly come up to you asking for money and trying to get you to take pictures for money too. Obnoxious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissa1983l
50,Fun Experience,"It was my first time experiencing the Hollywood Walk of Fame with my two girlfriends. There was so much to see and do, it was definitely a fun experience. From the food, shopping, and Hollywood tour, we enjoyed every bit. There was definitely a lot of people. We paid $20 in a parking garage for all day parking. Traffic in the area is definitely congested, as expected with a tourist location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Araceli_559
40,Great walk but kind of scary,"Our family visited walk of fame and we really enjoyed the walk, but kind of scary after 10:00pm. A lot of homeless people around. I recommend this walk before 9:00pm when is crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vrodriguez9
40,Interesting,Its one of those things you must see if your that close to Hollywood a lot of history goes with the stars and their impressions on the walk several good tours with info on it also the Chinese Theater is interesting.Lots to do and see in that area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigsR5910ZP
50,Family visit,So awesome!! You can walk for days reading the stars names on the sidewalk. The only thing is trying to find the star you really want to take a picture by it. Not very crowded at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hopes438
40,Great Place to run into the Stars,"I have visited Hollywood Blvd and Vine on numerous occasions and while some parts are quite shabby it is an interesting place to visit. Be prepared that there will be plenty of people in costume wanting your attention for a quick photo and will expect tips for the privilege, some can be a little offensive if you refuse a picture. Overall though its a fun experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelanieB320
50,When in Rome.....,It's a must and a great free way to pass the day away and you'll always find a shop or site to see along the way! It's always fun to remember the stars of yesterday and to witness the history in the making on a stroll down the Walk of Fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasFood13
30,A must see,Know before you go... It's more than 11 blocks long and the stars are on both sides of the street. It's not shiny and nice looking until you get in front of the Chinese theater. I could be wrong but I believe it is the family of the star holder that is in charge of up keep. It's mostly shops along the way but you do see famous names. And for an added bonus the Betty White star is right outside Starbucks! Smart woman ;o),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J9260DPjamiec
50,Great place to find the stars,"If you are a fan of the Hollywood stars, this is you destination for pilgrim! You can find even the earliest directors' hand prints there, like Hitchcock.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/976natew
30,"Good idea, but difficult to read","It might be a good idea and honor, at some point, to put names of stars on the floor that people walk on their names, but it's so crowded and touristy that it looses it's interest. People are everywhere and you can't even read the signs. Plus, names are written in different directions, which makes it very difficult to read, you always have to twist your head.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliak663
40,Fun but expect crowds,"For fans, this is a blast. Every kind of performer imaginable...from Journey to Dick Enberg to Ray Bolger to Vin Diesel...in other words, something for everyone. Music, TV, sports, golden age movies and current stars. The only issue I had was that people are rude. If you want to stop and get a photo, expect others to walk right through or step on the star as you take the photo. If you can be patient, it's a wonderful walk through entertainment history past and present.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriP920
50,Can't do Hollywood without seeing this!,"The Walk of Fame is very easy to navigate. All you have to do is look up an online index of where each celebrity's star is located. Sometimes the street artist will be blocking the star you want to see which is unfortunate. But for the most part, you can see any and all stars you want! I picked my favorite, Britney Spears, and got a picture by her star, lol.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyk815
30,Busy,Glad that I saw it but don't think that I ever need to see it again. Very busy and crowded. The area feels kind of dirty. Parking was expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tnvol93
40,Good afternoon,Hollywood Blvd. was nice. Loved seeing the different star's stars on the walk. Not likely to see any real stars. It is a nice walk up and down the boulevard. Good exercise. Lots to see. Crossed off the bucket list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinkerslm
40,Walk of fame,You have to take a look at the names as your walking down Hollywood I didn't realise the Stars have to pay to have there names put on,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Colette242
30,Fun,It's exactly that walking in the stars of hollywood famous actors. Nothing out of the ordinary. I don't get the fun part but people love it. Still it's a greatal and entretainig place to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julioc549
50,Just a must do experience.,"Hollywood as a whole is pretty amazing and something I think everyone must see. The walk of fame is everything I expected, lots and lots to look at and take photos of for the important memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amycQ2044MR
30,It's all about the tourist,Don't expect anything special. After you have seen the Chinese theatre and some.of the stones with famous people's hands and feet you have seen it all.Good to go to day I have been there. But once you walked away from the main spot the street became dirty and full of tacky souvenir shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/258patriziag
40,"If you're there, you have to see it","Very crowded in the high tourist areas around Grumman's and the Dolby but fun to walk down Hollywood or Vine and see names you know and others that you say ""who is that?"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPVM13
50,"""The famous Walk of Fame""","This place has been around since I was a small kid... the area has changed and it is now like a zoo. There are people dressed up in costumes (ie. Batman, Wonder woman to Darth Vador and Michael Jackson, etc.). It can be fun, but if you want to take a picture with any of these charactors, you need to give them a nice donation, if not you might not be allowed to take a picture of them or with them! The Walk of Fame is long and a neat attraction for couples or the family - the Chinese Theater is a must when you are visiting and bring your camera. This area and the Walk is FREE to all who visit.Note, you have to be careful and make sure not to get anybody on this Walk of Fame upset (homeless people). A few years ago somebody got stabbed to death close to the Chinese Theater area in front everybody during the day I believe... I heard this on the news.They now have security... police on bikes and walking the area too. All is FREE to visit here... you might have to pay for parking in this area? Bring conforable shoes and some spending money... many resturants and shops to spend all your money here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgonez
40,Did you find your famous?,Everyone walks looking to the ground. The place is nice. There are many options of restaurants and stores. You can see a lot of people dressing heroes fantasies. Lot's of fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eduardopgodoy
50,Fun Time,"If you are doing all of the cheesy tourist stuff, you can't miss the walk of fame. Over the past few years, they seems to be trying to clean up this area. The first time we had came back in 2008 it was a grimey area with the bums dressed as characters and panhandling. Now it is a cleaner area where the bum pressure is not so much.We like to walk to street to find our favorite celebs or new stars. Depending on the tour you talk while in town, some provide a nice narrative that goes along with it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
40,Hollywood history,"Some fascinating stars--old intermingled with new. Now that I learned the famous pay for their own star/unveiling, I feel a bit less impressed. But glad I can say ""been there, done that.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Enigmaman95
30,"A must see, I guess...","It´s really kinda strange walking down the walk of fame looking down on the pavement looking for names you know. The people aren't there, and yet you get a little bit excited when you find a name you know.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valdans
30,Hollywood,"It's a total tourist attraction, but it's quite fun just walking down the road. I heard the actors pay like 30 000$ to get a star today. Back in the history the stars were free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thornrosa
30,Not that interesting,"A crowded and noisy street with lots of theaters on both sides. You will find numbers of the names of movie celebrities on the street. It is interesting when we started to walk. But after 30 minutes' walk on a crowed street in a sunshine burning afternoon, we just quited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanq442
40,A must see!,"If in LA this is a must see, at least once. We went on a Friday night, so it was extremely crowded. Hold your kids hands tight! The street performers were awesome and this is the cheapest place for souvenirs by far. Lots of attractions along the walk also, we recommend Madam Tussauds Wax Museum! Very fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdressel1
30,Over hyped and good for souvenir shopping,We spent an evening at this place. A walk through the street will take you through many stars that are dedicated to the actors and the many street shows and film characters. There were some good ones but nothing extraordinary. We did take a short Hollywood and Beverly Hills trip from this place and returned back to this place. Then had a nice dinner. This place had a good number of places for dining. We then end our day with the souvenir shopping. There was a good collection of souvenirs here. Overall it was a good time spent but we did feel that the place is overhyped and did not find anything extraordinary.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripural
40,Totally for tourists!,"Hollywood = tourists and this area is nothing but tourist traps. Fromm La La Land store and another store ( can't remember what it was selling ) that was advertising $5.00 for every item just for today with a very faded sign to the people dressed as Spider Man , Captain American and Star Wars who will offer to take a picture with you and then want to charge you and then will get very upset if you don't pay them ( per our guide ) this place screams Tourist Trap ! But then when you find that certain favorite old or new star all the negative aspects of this place goes away. It is crowded , it is not so clean , and it is crowed . I wish our guide would have told us that the Beatles and Elvis's stars were at the start of the walk of fame. He so kindly pointed this out as we drove by it on the bus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shermansj

50,Highlight of trip - so much history,"Extensive area of Hollywood with stars in no particularl order but interesting to wander down the street and see the various names, many of whom you might not recognise then suddenly there will be a really famous person. There is no order (industry, chronological, alphabetical) to the arrangement of the stars so the website is very useful if you are looking for a specific celebrity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJG1972

40,An Iconic Walk with Famous Actors and performers Stars,This walk was fun. We saw all the stars and handprints as we walked up and down both sides. It was clean. There were a few street performers and some homeless persons. Seemed pretty safe. We went in the morning. We paid to park a block away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gh427
30,"Well you have to, don't you?","One of the must do's in Hollywood I suppose. We did the walk for around 30 minutes. There is a randomness to the stars, some huge names, others I was surprised to see: 'Woody Woodpecker'!? or 'LL Cool Jay'!? I drive by again in the evening and things were much quieter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lone_man_project
30,Got to do- but not amazing,"So, you have to do it, but it isnt amazing or anything like that. There is a few things to do around the walk- Chinese theater, Madam Tueseaus etc, so there it is worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenHancock
40,Fun Walk in morning or evening,"It's always fun to stroll the Hollywood Walk of Fame to see and take pictures of favorite celebrities. I would avoid the hot afternoon sun, though, and prefer to visit in morning or early evening when there is more shade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynsha
30,Great to see but underwhelming,"It's one of those things that you just really want to see, because it's so famous. And it is without a doubt cool to be there. But I couldn't help but feel a bit underwhelmed once I actually got there and had walked along just a little bit, and it gets very busy in the early afternoon. It ticks a box.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/themikeKsmith
30,"Cool, but Dirty","We went to the Walk of Fame to check out all the stars on the sidewalk. I really liked going to the Chinese Theater and seeing the hand and foot prints in the cement. We parked in a $15 lot, but we found cheaper places that were in the same area after we stopped. There are a ton of souvenir shops and people trying to get you to take their tour. That got a little annoying. The street was dirty and there were several homeless people on the street. We did not do any tours; we just walked up and down the street and went into a few shops. Depending on how far you want to walk, I would recommend about 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLP211
40,A must,You really must see this if you are touring LA. We used a website that gave us the street address of the stars we wanted to see. The best part is down in front of the Chinese Theatre. Lots of Hollywood tour companies trying to push their tour. Our kids had fun just walking and looking for names they recognized.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelfam4045
50,Funny,A walk in this place is very funny. We find the hands sign of many famous people and can have fun with pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Viviangom
40,Always great people watching,"This is the best place any where in the country for people watching. You have the street performers mixed with the tourist mixed with the eclectic flair of the locals. Our grandson and his friend were visiting. His friend had only heard of Hollywood and wanted to visit. So on a Friday night we took them!! The energy is electric, the people watching exceeded expectations and the souvenir shopping was cheap. Our grandson's friend was a bit overwhelmed with everything but wants to go back in his next trip!We discovered a little bakery inside the Dolby theatre entrance. Great food and guys were amazing. They interacted with us and the boys. Not your typical ""hi may I take your order and here's your food"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/925rebeccak

10,So trashy!!,"Wow this place has really gone down! There are way too many people trying to hand you things, pressure you into posing for paid pictures and just in your space. No wonder pickpockets are a problem here- there is zero police presence as well. If you go, go during non-peak times. And put away your valuables.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L734DFamyc
30,Keep aware of your surroundings,My wife and 2 step daughters (21 and 23) went to see the walk of fame. It was neat to see. Just so many people in costumes and trying to sell you their music cd. While we were walking a man unzipped my wife's backpack. So stay alert. But if there is a star you want to see or get a picture with someone dressed like a character. This is worth the trip. There is a store called La La Land that has any kind of souvenir you may want.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rick2071
30,"Interesting, but a bit overrated.","Many people associate Hollywood with the Walk of Fame and the many photos we have seen in the media of celebrities posting in front of their stars. Yes, it is somewhat interesting to see the name of a known, favorite celebrity, but you will probably find that you do not know the majority of the names you see in this street. You may end up walking long distances to find a name you recognize. This is more of a symbolic place to visit (""I need to go here if I am in LA""), but it really is not as amazing as an outsider may perceive through the media.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chaglen
50,It's a long long road!,"Loved walking up and down here and seeing all the stars, but where were Daryl Hall and John Oates?Two of the biggest singers to come out of the USA!Still enjoyed it though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeannieCass
50,Exciting boulevard,"Walking amoung the stars on the pavement is quite exciting, spotting all your favourite stars. Our guide was very informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/801maureenc
40,Busy but fun,"This was one of the stops on our full day tour of LA and it was good to actually see this famous area although our time was a little limited having taken some time to first view the Hollywood sign.We walked along recognising so many of the names, both those still with us and the sadly departed and stopped outside the Chinese Theatre for a while to spot a few of the stars who'd left their mark there.There's a lot of street entertainers around who are keen to earn a few bucks but never felt any of these were over pushy and it was a pleasant walk, though need to be careful not to walk with your head down the whole time as it can be rather crowded in places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prefdavid
30,"Crowded, not spectacular, but worth a visit","Since it's such a famous thing to do, it's probably worth the visit if you're in LA. It was, however, incredibly overcrowded and nothing very spectacular. It also fairly quickly turns into a sketchy area if you continue looking down and walking and don't pay attention to where you are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellef608
30,Pink Stars,Nice to see in the first instance but after a few says you forget they are there. To be honest it's difficult to use the sidewalk as people infront of you suddenly stop to take pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mavsters
40,Must see When visiting LA,"Must see when visiting LA, but not impressive.You can also visite the Hollywood Highland centre with a nice view on the Hollywood-sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poosen

20,"Only portions, if you have to visit touristy Hollywood","If you are compelled to visit the obnoxious touristy side of LA/Hollywood, just look down as you walk around, or download a map of the honored ones. Not an organized path or tour and too much chaos along the many streets for most people to tolerate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HansAbroad
50,Great Trip,Loved walking down the hall of fame. There were so many tourists taking photos with locals dressed in movie character costumes. There were a lot of tour operators along the road with TMZ and Starline tours. Let's not forget all of the Souvenir stands. Wear some comfortable walking shoes and sunscreen!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/landrovercb
40,Wild and crazy,"Lots of activities and folks to pose for pictures with! Handprints in front of the Chinese Theater. Pretty touristy, but fun. The teenagers even had fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MNVolvo
50,Must see!,If you are in the LA area you need to see the walk of fame. You can't believe how many stars there are. They go on and on down Holliwood Blvd. Also the circle in the middle tells what the person got the star for. It is very interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/883nickih
30,Not what I expected,Wasn't quite as I had pictured but still enjoyed our visit with the exception of some of the aggressive street people. Surprised that the stars seemed to be in need of cleaning but I guess that's to be expected given the amount of foot traffic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vasportsmom
30,Pretty fun and a couple different options for the day,"First off, reading other reviews helped us to not have high expectations; because the sidewalk goes on for blocks with stars you may or may not recognize, and it's not all that impressive. But if you go during the early afternoon, there are not as many people as at night. Street performers start getting more numerous as the sun goes down. We walked the sidewalk for about an hour in early afternoon, even ate lunch, and crowds were pretty decent. Went to a few other attractions (Guinness, Ripley's, and Wax on the VIP discount pass--a good value for anyone). When we came back out to find a couple names/foot and hand prints at the Chinese Theater, the crowds had grown and street performers were loud.Cheapest parking is $10 found around Hollywood High School, so set your GPS for that location, then look for the sign that indicates $10 flat rate. It's really close to the lively intersection of Highland and Hollywood Blvd.I would also suggest lunch at the In n Out a block away. Good food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/96timothyt
50,Star struck,"I'd heard so many things about this, mostly telling me not to bother.I was like a kid. Pointing out one after the other and waiting in queues to take photos.It's really quite special and worth at least 39 minutes of your time.Try and start near near the beginning, at Sunset",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V327YSandrews
20,Crowded and over rated circus,"Must see in LA, but really waste of time in my opinion. Crowds on the street and people trying to make money of absolutely no talent.Don't go here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClausHansen
50,Interesting,It's amazing walking along this Boulevard seeing all the present and past actors forever embedded in the side walk. It goes on for longer than you think. Make sure you have time to see them all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaysI7849ER
40,Vacation,"Great two hour walk and still didn't see all the stars. Food in all price range, we ate at Subway, great location to eat and people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roam153273
50,Amazing walk!,Amazed how many people visit this place. A lot of hidden talent on these streets. The only thing I was disappointed in was the fact that the streets were not as clean as I thought they were going to be. Too much trash!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/50familiaa
30,Fun but heaving and very busy,"We spent only about 15 minutes at the walk of fame. It was hot, very crowded and huge numbers of street sellers trying to give you stuff. We should have got here earlier in the day or late at night. Our two kids were not that impressed. We were glad we saw some of it and how they change the shopping arcade and dress it for the oscars but it wasn't my top attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twoplustwoMidlands
30,Glad I did it.,"It was a lot of fun to see the stars on the sidewalk. I also enjoyed seeing the foot and handprints outside of Grauman's Chinese Theater. It is true you get a lot of people wanting to you come in, take a tour or sell you something, but it was not all that bad. I agree with others who have said not to bother with the costumed people. I'm glad I did it, but now that I have done it, I don't have to do it again. I might consider going back to take tour of the stars' homes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmhhander
30,Hollywood Walk of Fame,Good atmosphere. So busy hard to find the stars you especially want to see. Parking nearby very expensive $20 for 2 hrs plus valet $5! Probably cheaper to get an Uber. California Pizza good reasonable place to eat nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danbendavid
20,Really disappointing,"Well I obviously had exaggerated expectations of this attraction as the side walks were dirty, packed full of people and performers all eager for your money. We walked down parts both night and day and I have to say that neither times were pleasant and quite intimidating. Not great for children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lemonpips11
20,The Walk of Shame,"The ""walk of fame"" is really great... If you keep your head down and just look at the stars and stay super focused on ONLY the stars that pave the way. Otherwise you are attacked by aggressive (and some well-dressed) panhandlers and there's tons of traffic too. Also, anyone who's in costume EXPECTS you to ""tip"" them when they invasively ask you to take a photo with them. Okay, I get it, but my family and I got a 10 minute rant from one of them due to us being new to LA. Very awkward and uncomfortable... And I'm a cosplayer, there's finesse to it -- they don't have it!Hopefully you'll have a better experience than we did! Maybe have the map already in hand of what stars you want to take a photo with and whatnot to avoid wasting time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/735krystalk
40,Everything I thought it would be,"Had lots of fun looking for and running into the names of those celebrities dear to our hearts. Holleywood and Vine aka the most famous intersection of yesteryear was nothing astonoshing, most of the activities are focused around the Chinese Theater a few blocks west. Parking is a drag, and it ranges from 10 to 20 depending on how close you get to the Chinese Theater... But, it is 12 bucks behind the Dolby Theater on Holleywood and Orange, your best bet for parking, super close to everything. Recommend you take Franklin to Orange and head south parking garage should be on the left, going the other way through Holleywood will add loads of time because traffic is terrible there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7016VCstevet
30,Stars & walk of fame,"So busy and crowded. Glad I saw it but wouldn't head back for any reason. The people in character costumes don't bother with, all they want is money. Just keep walking. Lots of souvenirs and shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vnma2017
40,Be Careful Here,"It's worth a trip out to see Hollywood Blvd during the day or at night. Lots of shops open and interesting people on the street doing shows, dancing and dressed up as movie characters. You can take pics of your favourite stars on the ground but it is very crowded. Just be careful. Lots of pick pocketers and people who are not legit there. There are some dressing up in costume and charging specific prices for pics. The ones who are legit will do it for any kind of tip you are willing to give them. Great street vendors with a variety of food. The one main mall is great for taking pics. You can see the Hollywood sign on the second floor from here. Parking is available underground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelindaP823
10,Waste of time,Crowded place with nothing special to see. Full of street performers and people dressing like film characters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcelloNitz
40,"Fun time, but very crowded",This is a must place if you are into celebrities. Go both directions to find your favorite star. Chinese Theater in the middle of Hollywood Bulvard. The place is very crowded. Watch your pockets .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EsterDenver
20,Disappointing,I was actually disappointed when I saw the place. Too crowded. A bit dirty and overrated.I would not come back here and would give warning perhaps to those who are planning to visit the place.Nothing to see in here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellene_santos
20,Thoroughly underwhelming,"Iconic, but otherwise entirely uninteresting. We got there very early in the day, around 8am, so we're able to wander up and down looking through the stars, but it got uncomfortably busy extremely quickly. Surrounded by cheap touristy shops, nothing of great value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8643LNmatthews
50,Popular place for tourist,"wear comfortable shoes, there is plenty to see, also there are ""look alikes"" or people in costume, but they do ask for a tip to take a picture with them. a selfie stick is your best friend, well it was for me since i did this trip solo nice place to visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/863cieraw
20,SO disappointed!,"I was here on a Wednesday night. My first time ever to be here and I was so disappointed. The sidewalks were crowded with people putting on shows for money, so you cant see all of the stars. It is very dirty and smells bad. The traffic getting there is ridiculous and the attraction isn't worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reviewmomma
20,A little disappointed,"This family of four was ready to see the stars....and we left a little disappointed. It was dirty, nothing cool, just looking at stars. It was something we needed to do to check off the to do list, but nothing we need to ever do again. Don't plan on this taking real long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/familyoffourkansas
50,"So many to see, nice walk",The walk is really nice but really crowded at the same time. Some ppl were so rude as you were trying to take a picture they would purposely walk infront of you and the street performers would get in your way! The gentleman out selling their CDs were the nicest. Only walked a portion and drained my phone battery like crazy because there was SO MANY pictures to take. Come prepared!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlaytimewithMiss_T_e
30,Really cool but dirty!,It was awesome seeing all the stats for the entertainers I love but it was really dirty.Hollywood Blvd. is full of interesting people. It was hard to stop and take pictures of some of the stars because there were so many people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Worldtraveller1207
30,Interesting Walk,Hollywood walk of Fame is an interesting walk. Some areas are pretty sketchy so be careful where you go. The area in fron of Manns Chinese Theater is pretty fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crystalr454
40,A Must Do in LA,"Don't miss this whilst in LA, spend a couple of hours to search the stars. Fun activities for Kids as well (not for very young kids).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aworldtraveller2016
30,Over rated,"This attraction is nothing much, it's a bunch of names on the side walk, with thousands of people walking around with their heads down, pushing & shoving, stopping in everyone's way so they can be photoed with a star name. To add to the congestion there are imitation stars and TV characters all along it trying to get you to have a photo with them (for a tip). Some of them are very good imitations but It makes it difficult if you need to access somewhere along Hollywood boulevard. Overall not my thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sm05060
30,Family visit,My first time here... Nothing special to be honest reminded me of Times Square . It was cool to see the stars but a lot of solicitors,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carlanmcd
50,walk like a fame person,"you are famous or not here you are part of it , clean and safe nice stile and you can spend few hours put you will remember it for ever",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntonisA888
50,TLC theater area,There just wasn't enough time to spend in this area mix it was amazing! I liked this area and we can't wait to go back and explore more. Good choices for food and shipping for both teenagers and toddlers. One vendor even gave us a bag of free gummy bears for our kid. Really nice people here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8965XNmichellem
40,Lots of walking :),"You'll need to have comfortable shoes on to do the full walk, and it does go by some rougher areas. Not too shabby though. There are some good food street sellers- you MUST try the bacon pink dog outside of the Guinness world records.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U3190SAmarcr
30,A must see (ONE TIME) but disappointing,"Im really glad I went to see the stars on the sidewalk but it was NOT what I was expecting at all. It was dirty and old and very ""city like"". I was expecting shiny stars and beautiful but it was old, lots of people trying to sell you things you don't want or need. Its worth visiting at least once so you can say you did it but I wouldn't go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/197christinem
40,Fun!,"When we started, I wished I'd gotten a map but then found it more fun just to stroll and look at the stars along the way. Just watch where you're walking and be mindful of others taking pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tlrcia
20,Not worth bothering,"It is somewhat interesting to see the names of ""stars"" on the sidewalk but, then again, they are just names on a sidewalk. I recognised a lot of them, my kids recognised a much lower percentage.We made the mistake of getting off the Metro at Hollywood/Vine - don't do that unless you enjoy the seedier side of life. Every third store here seemed to be a ""smoke"" store. Other than the names on the sidewalk, there is little else worth seeing at this end.If you want to come here, go for the Hollywood/Highlands stop because this is where the attractions like the Chinese Theatre, Disney Store and the new Hollywood & Highlands shopping centre with its views of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenr613
40,Don't miss,If you're in LA as a tourist no way you'll miss it. Go directly to the Chinese theater other then that the names on the sidewalk are totally anonymous. Parking is not that expensive if you'll find a place 4$ for two hours. If you need more than that Park at the parking lot for 10$ for the whole day. Take a city tour also to complete the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadavei
40,Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,"Nice to see the different names on the walk of fame. Especially great when you see famous people you recognise. Not really much else to say, worth visiting but nothing spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmzD_12
30,Average walk and nothing special,Despite the hype this is nothing more than an average street with nothing special about it. If you want to tour Hollywood then the best bet is to go to Universal Studios or other studios that offer back lot tours and theme park rides. This here is nothing but a regular working street. The only benefit is that there are street tours promoting their Hollywood drives which can be of interest if you want to see where movies have been filmed in the local area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brisbane41
20,Tooooooo much,"There's so much going on, it's dirty, loud and just seems like a tourist trap. Head to Melrose or Larchmont before heading to the walk of fame, such a shame with so much history",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jd0827
30,Needs a Good Clean,The walk itself is a great tribute to all the stars of Hollywood from over the years but it was truly a shame to see the pavement and the stars so filthy with such a huge amount of grime.I know there is lots of foot traffic each day but wouldn't it be great if they could make an effort to keep the pavement and the stars tributes clean and shiny. It would also create a few more jobs for some of the many homeless people I saw that day.Just sayin!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlewis66
30,See It Once & Move On,Surprised when we got there at how busy it was with loads of people about. There are tons of stars on the pavement and everyone seems to be looking down at them which looks strange after awhile. Each day we passed by there on the bus or Uber there was a protest with religious people and their posters and a bull horn making a lot of noise. Seriously odd because no one is paying them any attention. Several people with costumes on are hanging about in the core area to have their photo taken with anyone who would like it. Many people are enjoying taking pictures with them. It is the type of place that once you see it you want to get out of there. It is over run and kind of dirty. They should spray the pavement down at night with water to clean it because LA gets very little rain. That would go a long way. We were glad we walked through but wouldn't be interested to do it again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leesat2013

50,Find your favorite star!,"A must do for all the movies, music and arts fans. Find your star and take a picture! Some might be a bit crouded, but you can wait! ;) Get by the Chinese Theater and check the floor! And imagine you are at the Oscars when passing by Dolby Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magpelicano
50,Nice to see all the star,The walk of fame stretches for a few KMs . Lots of stars to take photos of. There is a lot of people looking so be prepared to wait a while to get that shot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wenzzzz
30,Slightly disappointing,Walked by most days as staying nearby but after a while you stop looking. Less is more. There are so many stars covering such a diverse field that you stop looking as we hadn't heard of some. Plenty of look alike character photo ops if you want but the whole area is a bit disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianme97
50,Great day out.,"Great way to spend a day, lots To see on the pavements and view old hotels in their fading glory. Very busy spot and I got feeling there's a lot of deprivation around, people sitting on streets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Billhyland911
50,Walking and Stalking...LOL,"If this is your thing, then you'll love it. Quite amazing to see all of the names, living or deceased. You quickly realize that you've forgotten most of the stars we have watched thru the years. Plenty of people watching opportunities. Hollywierd type people, AND strange visitors too! Our favorite stop along the walk was the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company store. OMG!!! Treat yourself!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timv0960
40,Must see when in CA,"Very glad we went to see this iconic street! The actual centre is bustling with people whether wanting to sell their music to you or asking if you would like photographs (as there are people dressed as characters), however as soon as you walk a bit further down the glamour does disappear quite quickly. I am still very glad I went and got to see such an iconic place and some of the stars of my favourite celebs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kay8991
50,The Pantages,"Took the subway from North Hollywood to right across from the Pantages. Walked up and down Hollywood Blvd, looking at the stars and mostly remembering times gone by. Trying to place the names with the Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pcskibum
50,Fun Walk,Enjoyed walking down the street reading the stars. Very exciting to see so many names and handprints memorized. Lots of stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ritas586
20,Hollywood Stars,"I thought the wall of fame would have at least been cleaned up but, unfortunately it was dirty and, disgusting! There were people everywhere trying to sell you something and, different people in costumes wanting to be their favorite super hero! It was just too much for me!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshleeWells
50,Absolute must when visiting Ca,"As a CA resident, I've brought both friends and family from out of state to visit. The biggest plus is you can take pictures with the prints and star of some of the most notable people in the industry from past and present. The shops and places to see are everywhere, so there's no chance of being bored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelRobs
50,Different year same place,"Why the appeal but there just is.I was surprised to learn that the stars actually pay to be there and have to pay an annual upkeep. Approx. $10,000/yrYou don't come to LA and not walk the fame.C'mon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justmyimpression
30,Worth going out of your way for.,Hollywood is an interesting sight on the slowest of days. The Walk of Fame is no different. It's a heck of a mix of people walking around from the geekiest to the freakiest. Always very interesting. The Stars on the sidewalk include an incredible mix of celebrities that you have and have not heard of. The ones you recognize bring back memories that can make you pause. And smile. Don't miss it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KipColorado
50,Walk with the Stars,A wonderful experience but one which needs time - the stars are well spread out on both sides of the Boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigRon40
30,Meh,"I understand it's important for the history of LA, and it's cool to see the names of the stars, but it's super anti-climactic. The area is run down around it, very busy, very touristy. If you feel you need to see it, go ahead and stop, but don't waste too much time here. And don't judge LA by this little strip. It's not what the real LA is all about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/157kaitlynf
30,Trip,Not much to see. The city is not as good as it seems. Not much to see there. Beside the name is not much more to see. Didn't like that much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhonatand166

10,"Hustlers, Bums and Beggars","Although iconic and a must do on most people's to-do list, the experience is dampened by hustlers, bums and beggars. Travelling with my 16 year old daughter, we only did the walk in daylight and we were still hassled. Because of this we only saw a small portion of the walk. A big let down!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901charmaineh
20,Stay away from the theater area,"Stay away from the theater area if you really want to enjoy the walk of fame. Its seems that the theater area is the most congested with tourists, street performers and wanna be artist. It's paid parking anywhere you go so we picked an underground valet parking which was safe a secure $10 + a tip. The area was packed as expected. There are plenty of street performers charging to take pictures and arguing with each other. The harassment of wannabe artist shoving their cd's in your face got annoying. Go a few blocks away and enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnjZ163PR
30,Plan before you go. Cross country trip attraction,"Daughters had favorites and it is best you look up locations before you start walking about. Lot of the area is run down and has homeless asking for handouts. Best to look at Google maps and check out locations before hand and set family's expectations on who you are going to see. Street performers or wanna be celebrities were awesome. Beware on every corner there is a person asking you of you want to go on a celebrity tour, be ready to have a plentiful amount of no thank yous available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tfpslappy
30,"Cool to see, but be careful!","The stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are really cool to see, and they can be seen on various streets around the Hollywood Blvd. area and the Chinese Theater. But over the years Hollywood has become a rather unsafe place especially at night, and you just want to be aware of your surroundings and the people in the area. As a native Angelino, I always feel bad that people go to the Walk of Fame and are shocked that the neighborhood has many unsavory types and is rather depressed. But if you go during the day and walk around a bit, you will see the stars on the sidewalk and have a nice experience. It's very touristy! Check out the Walk of Fame and then go to Beverly Hills for lunch or down to Melrose Avenue for funky shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bonnyc312
50,So many accomplished actors on the walk of fame!!!,"It was a great experience to see name of stars on a sidewalk!! It so long too as i walk to the end and back. Bring plenty of water with you to do this. Expect congestion of people doing same thing, looking the walk of fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffJenny88
40,"Interesting and fun, but not historic","I think everyone should see some of the stars, and take photos by the ones their favorite people. Just understand it is not as historic as the handprints in front of Graumann's Chinese Theatre, as this program was only started in 1960.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86michealb
40,If you dig looking down at bunch of names…this might be a charming walk for the whole family.,"There are no revelations to one PR agent's blatant commercial brainstorm of charging Hollywood studios and/or individuals $16-20K to put a slab of their celebrity's name in cement in front of some commonplace store on Hollywood Blvd. Yes, its yet another award premise for a city overstuffed with them, but the fun for the meandering tourist is in the context. Walking with your spouse and kids the trick is to identify these icons and, first, know who each person was, what they starred in, and what idea or emotion their presence first triggered inside of you. With a family walk these ""Stars"" encourage a potpourri of generational sharing whose bottom line price is hard to beat…you might even get to know each other a little bit better in the process of getting some exercise before the next Pink's hotdog… It's L.A. afterall!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eggcreamer
40,"Great fun, but a little seedy!","The Hollywood Walk of Fame is great fun for anyone who's a fan of popular culture, TV, movies, etc... It's an enjoyable walk, spotting names you fondly remember from your favourite shows. And along the way there's a lot to see, from people in superhero costumes posing for photos, to the Ripley's Museum, to lots of interesting little shops (and a bunch of tacky tourist shops as well!) and restaurants.The biggest drawback about the Walk of Fame is that quite a lot of is is fairly seedy and tacky, with a lot of homeless and questionable people... I was there on my own (single male), or with other adult friends, so was never concerned... but if I was here with children, or if I was a single female I'd be cautious! That said, it's still a fun time, and I look forward to going back again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalgaryAlphan
50,Stepping on the stars!,We always enjoy our CA Hollywood visits and a highlight is the Walk of Fame. It's fun to remember those who have been awarded a star. Take your time and enjoy a walk down memory lane.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/takrafty
40,Still fun and not as bad as begore,"I visited Hollywood many years ago when this section was pretty bad. They've cleaned it up quite a bit. Fun to see all the stars. They have a free guide in your hotel to find the particular star of your choice. The Dolby Theatre has fun shops including Sweet, a large candy store. It also has a nice view of the Hollywood sign several floors up. If you are a Pretty Woman fan, you can find several sites from the movie within close proximity, including the balcony fire escape at the end (Las Palmas hotel).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaD741

10,"Walk was fine, but watch out of hustlers!!","The walk was below average. It busy and dirty, making it very hard to take any nice photos.

They give a bad name for the people who actually live there and make a decent living.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vince_132014
20,Better stay away,"OK, the place is iconic, but maybe it is better to stay away, it is a big disappointment. Skip it and it will stay iconic and adorable for you. There are many other beautiful places to visit in LA.

30,It's one of those places you visit once if in LA,It's like a ridiculously busy road with the stars all over. You kind of should go once if you're in LA but it was really under whelming. If you're a Londonder it's a cross between Piccadilly Circus and south bank but 10 times the number of people trying to cram onto the pavements. There's lots of people dressed as characters and acts that go on on the pavements. I'm glad I saw it once but once is enough,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vikkim2014
40,Looking at the stars,Wanted to stop by this site to find the stars of some of my favorite movie stars. Had to look hard for the stars of my favorite people. I guest that the older your get the harder it is to find those old timers. We did find most of the stars we were looking for but some have been removed or move to less prominent spots. Still had fun weaving through the visitors also searching for their favorite star. Plan to spent some time finding the star you want.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kenrharrison

30,Famous walk of fame?,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame was a huge disapointment, we were at Veice Beach so we rent a car to visit the Walk of Fame, that was a long trip in a hige traffic. When we arrived there there was no place to park and it turned out that the famous Walk of Fame it is an elegant promenade which we were expecting but only a narrow, dirty, crowded sidewalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anikita86
20,Nothing Special,We visited early evening. It was incredibly busy and hard to see the stars. They faced in different directions so it was hard to read some of them. It wasn't amazing. Worth going if you are in the area but don't make a special trip for it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DC1989

30,A must see but not a big deal,This is something that you go to Hollywood and Vine to do. But its just stars in the side walk. I recommend parking at the Hollywood and Highland Mall parking garage. Have lunch at California Pizza Kitchen and get the parking validated for free parking. Right in front of CPK you can take great pictures of the Hollywood Sign. Go down two flights of stairs and you are right on Hollywood Walk of Fame. For an added bonus you are right next to the Chinese Theater to check out the hand and foots prints of the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ncolon60

30,Don't go in summer,The walk of fame is an interesting experience made difficult to enjoy during the busy summer monthsLooking down at the stars on the sidewalk can be difficult with large crowds walking towards you and downright dangerous at timesAdd to that the street entertainers that draw a crowd blocking the entire sidewalk in places and the constant stream of guys trying to hand you leaflets about the bus tours of the area and it becomes difficult just to move down the street let alone enjoy the experienceWe also came last October and it was a much more enjoyable experience with smaller crowds of people,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DennisF420
30,Do it to say you have!!!,Was ok I'm glad I can say I've been there and done it but was extremely busy and hard to take photos of stars. Great experience overall tho.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lydiab306
50,Excellent Way to Commemorate Entertainment Greats,"We stopped here during a 'Sights of LA' bus tour. We had 40 minutes -- not long enough! You can walk very far following this path and snapping pics with your favourite celebrities (well, their names). It is a very busy, tourist area though, so try and avid during high season!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PipeCleanerWithEyes
30,Nice if you know the movie star,This is a long walk. Lots of different attractions along the walk. A must do in Hollywood. Parking could be a challenge. Traffic is always busy there so be patient when you are stuck in traffic as everyone else is.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skier101
40,Awesome,Always wanted to see this not quite what I was expecting I've got to be honest. I always presumed it was a blocked off area that no one could actually go near without a ticket or something. However it's actually a sidewalk to a busy street that everyone walks on and some of the stars are no well maintained at all. It was still brilliant to see all the stars and get to be where you always see on the tv I took so many pictures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888freyal
40,Interesting,As a destination it is not worth it but as part of walking around Hollywood it fits in. A lot of names with a look back at the past. Not much else you can say except to see who is popular today.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Icedaddy
40,anther tick for our bucket list,"the Hollywood walk of fame. Being one of the older generation it was fun walking along and remembering a host of stars that are no longer with us, but kept us entertained for many years. It was a nostalgic trip down memory lane. We enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jim504
30,"Like sports, it's just about the money","There's your imagination, and then there's reality. It's just a bunch of plaques set in the sidewalk.How do they decide who gets one? If you have enough money and a good agent. That's all.I'm sure there's a guide to where you could find your favorite actor, but really, this ain't the Vietnam War Memorial.Save time and trouble and be legitimately entertained by watching an actual movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mitch708
30,More hype than substance...,"There...I have said it once and for all. The stars of the stars did not give me any special feeling. They were just there...and that all...This place is more hype than anything else. Maybe the genuine star struck fans would go head over heels here, but I did not feel the same way...Yes, it was great to locate the Tarantino star, but then...it's just a tile on the floor...Touristy....very Touristy!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BhawaniPathania
40,Great walk and views,"Great walk down the walk of fame! Nice seeing ll the famous names all with great weather. So much to do too with everything so close by with gift shops, attractions, food places and a lively place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saraiva28
50,Always fun!,What can I say? Sidewalk with the stars on them. Always a good time. It's like a scavenger hunt trying to find your favorite star. My kids had fun looking. There are lots of shops on both sides of the street to shop in as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelewelker
30,Walk of fame stroll,"Strolled along Hollywood boulevard on a very warm Thursday afternoon , it was very busy with everyone trying to pick out their stars on the pavement , the hand prints near the Chinese Theatre was certainly worth a look, you can also get a glimpse of the famous Hollywood sign from here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MICKDUTCH
30,Crazy!!!,"What a crazy place!!!Everyone wants your money!Busy, expensive but kinda brilliant!!Traffic hell... But go for it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H4237IOandyc
40,Fun!,It's in the heart of all the attractions. Fun to stroll up and down the street looking at all the famous people's stars. You can stop for a picture of your favorite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsshellyB
50,Fun way to spend the day,We visited the walk of fame while waiting to check in to our hotel. We had fun looking at all the stars on the sidewalk. Closer to the Chinese theatre it started getting crowded but also fun with all the characters and live music. Lots of shops to see though we stayed out of them since we had our little ones with us. Are at the Hard Rock Cafe next to the Chinese theatre. It was pretty cool!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R8531PXkatherineb
40,Once in a lifetime,This is a thing you should do in your life. Check out the stars you know in streets. There are many different around all areas of art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HannuV
30,Not much too do,I won't put this on my list not much to do here just stars on the wall I didn't get very excited by it.However you can go shopping and visit Chinese theater and Madame Tussauds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sakshisyd
30,Not as impressive as the Chinese Theatre,"We visited the Hollywood Walk of Fame along with the TCL Chinese Theatre. With the number of street performers and people dressed up as characters for you to take pictures with, some of the stars on the walk are covered. I would suggest just stick to the Chinese Theatre area if you have kids as some of the stars were on streets that didn't feel as safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tofurry
40,Places to visit.,"Another place that you have to visit, though watch you don't walk into someone whilst looking at the floor.Good free attraction, even if you may not know who everyone is or what they were famous for.It does bring back memories of those who are no longer with us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SingleStew
50,Cheap entertainment,"I decided to take a stroll down the walk of fame. It was fun to see all the stars on the sidewalk, but the real treat was the people walking up and down the boulevard. It was a fun evening with lots of food and entertainment choices",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessec748
40,a place where the hollywood legends leave their mark,very beautiful place to take a stroll in. lots of stores and attractions along this blvd. can you find your favorite actor's star?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlennSutrisno
40,A bit overrated but fun nonetheless,"The walk of fame is interesting. It's overrated but does provide some entertainment as you look for names along the walk. The main positive is that it's close to other attractions so although nothing special, since you will be in the area anyway to see other things then it's quite good fun being able to see this attraction",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crystalarts
10,Scary Experience,Everyone says this is a must see but I was not impressed. You are frequently accosted by homeless people and those wanting to intimidate tourists to make a buck from shoving CDs into your hands to grabbing you for a photo op you didn't ask for and both expecting payment. Grab a tight hold of your bags as you run the gauntlet. Forget about a leisurely stroll or taking your time to read the names. Greatly disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ozzietraveller69
50,A must see!,"I was surprised at how busy and dirty it was! However, it's the walk of fame! Seeing some of those famous names and footprints left a sense of awe. Avoid the costumed characters unless you plan to pay them. They aren't there for fun but are trying to earn some money. So unless you got a $5 on your pocket don't stop for a photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sableind
40,Super Fun if a First Time Visitor.,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame stretches for blocks down Hollywood Blvd. Some of the area is dirty and to be avoided. Start at the Mann's Chinese Theater, where the concrete slabs of stars feet and hands are and walk East. You can see who has their star and if you want a photo, great.There are shops and eateries and others things to do as you walk along. If you get as far as the Pantages Theater, stop. Now cross the street and go back.When you are in Hollywood, day or night, your wallet is in your front pocket. You do not want to buy a watch from a street vendor and no you don't want to go on a tour.Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
40,Walking thru Hollywood History,"While visiting my sister in Laguna Niguel we decided to ""do the tourist thing"" and check out the Hollywood Walk of fame. While in the middle of the city it truly was a piece of American film history. It was great fun standing where the great stars imprinted themselves. If you are in the area this is truly a super place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandrak903
40,Fun and a perfect photo spot,"You can't miss this and surely you don't want to! It is fun to look for the start with the names of your favourites celebrities. Make sure you have your camera ready, it is a perfect photo spot. And it is free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulitaDavies
30,Bucket list item... Check,"Yep another one that is just like on TV. Lots of folks and interesting sights if you are a people watcher. Careful going with young ones. You may have to explain a few things to them once your visit is done. We had to explain why a guy was walking around in a crop top and fringe hanging over his boy parts and tweaking at each corner! But other than that you get cool cheap souvenirs, can take lots of fun pics and sign-up for one of those double decker Hollywood tours. We opted not to take one of the tours because than are a bit pricey for a family of 6. They run about $30-$60 per person depending on the day and the company you choose. But if pop culture is a guilty pleasure, make sure you make a stop here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimberlyAlise
30,Not what you expect...,"Visited walk of fame as part on LA tour so only spent an hour there. Not what I was expecting, footway was just a regular size, I was expecting it to be really wide. Difficult to see stars as pedestrians walking all over them, no map showing who's wear, so if your looking for a specific one you will need to do some research to know where it is. Dolby theatre nothing special from the outside, couldn't quite believe this is where the oscars are held. Perhaps it looks better with a red carpet outside. If you don't like crowds this is not the place for you!! Plenty of people in fancy dress, but if you want a photo with them be prepared to pay. Nice to say I've been, but no need to rush back, when you've seen one star....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angel2805
40,Walk on the stars!,"Hollywood is a strange place. Iconic, historic, and seedy! All types of people are here. Street musicians, mimes, performers, and everyone in between line the streets. There are so many tourists it can be difficult to see all the stars on the Walk of Fame. I went there specifically to take photos of the actors from the original Star Trek. Using an online web site, I was able to locate all of them. I also photographed the cast's hand prints and autographs in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater, which is located on the Walk of Fame. Lots of restaurants and shops line the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davec110
40,Nice experience..!!,blah blah blah.. usual pros... really rice to see them.. lets move forwardcons--bit difficult to walk through the roads during winter as it was very cold and we were very tired.. and we were not interested in seeing all the names.. if you are to be in the same situation i would suggest to prepare upfront to see whose name you want to see. there are websites to show you exact location where they are.. this could be an important tip we couldnt get..have fun..!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/567giridharm
30,Dirty and smelly,"This wasn't my thing, I had a different overall expectation of LA and couldn't believe the stink of urine and general filthy smell in the air.There are good things to see on the walk of fame, just don't have really high expectations and you won't be disappointed like we were.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E5891
10,Disapointing,"I only gave it 2/5 as it provided a ""tick in the box - I've been there"" visit and in this respect it succeeded. Otherwise it was filthy, cheesy and frankly a real let down. The further you get from the Chinese Theater the worse it gets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gobyplane
30,Fun added extra!,"If you are a movie buff, yes this is one you may want to cover. I would not plan my trip around it but maybe choose to do it on a day when you are doing something around the region. I would do this first as early in the morning as you can and definitely before 8.30ish. this for two reasons first that it gets too crowded for you to take pictures or find the stars you want, there are more people trying to sell you stuff later and second as the sun gets higher it casts a shadow on your picture or its right in your face. This is especially frustrating around the Chinese theatre handprints. Oh yes don't miss the Chinese theatre handprints :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/881amritad
50,Must see,Liked to see all stars on the floor and it's a great place for shopping and lots of people doing crazy stuff but they are too aggressive when u give them a tip one person threw back coins I gave him on my 7 month old baby in the carriage,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sanyfly
40,You'll see more than the stars,Ok definitely the tourist Mecca of LA but a must do. There will be a ton of street performers and freaks but that's what Hollywood is about right?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbyhutch
50,Something you have to do,"We certainly didn't see all of the stars, but saw enough to feel we did it. Our tour guide told us that Stars have to pay for their star and I believe he said the price is currently $30,000",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/323martyd
20,LA,"Fun to do while on your way to another attraction. Wouldn't plan my trip around this though. Be wary of people trying to give you things. Don't accept anything, they only want money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwicker314
40,Not what I thought it would be,"This walk is one thing I would say you have to do when you are in LA. Saying that it was not what I expected, I expected a more upper scale area ( believe me we r no snobs) the area is just like ur normal downtown area if that makes sense, plenty of places to eat, u could spend hours there we just spent about an hour or so,,, like I said u have to walk when in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Srmccracken
50,"Fun, Fun, Fun","It was so much fun looking at the stars on the ground. My kids truly enjoyed it, especially when they saw the names of the stars they are fans of. The atmosphere was good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Magnetic73
50,Oda Transportation Customer attraction area.,"Hollywood walk of fame,where you can see a lot of activity or art show,like wax museum,believe or not,Chinese theater,Kodak theater and much more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/odatransportationt
50,Fun search for our favorite stars!,It was a busy place so it's best to get here as early as possible....we had fun looking for our favorite hollywood stars and enjoyed watching artists dressed in different costumes ....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trinitess
30,So Crowded,I visited on July 4th holiday weekend. And the place was packed. It was difficult to get a photo of the stars on the ground because too many people were walking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hardrocker8888
40,A Must for everyone to see at least once,The who's who in entertainment and celebrity can be found on this famed walk. It's something a visitor to Hollywood must see and take tons of photos of your favorite celebrity's star. Just plain fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahlynnt
40,Fun to find the stars!,"We enjoyed looking at the names as we were walking around Hollywood Blvd. Yes, it was very busy with tourist and tourist stalkers. If anyone tried to bother us, we just shook our heads no and continued walking. We never accepted anything or posed for any pictures with them. It's not something I need to do again, but I'm glad I visited. I wanted to see Marilyn Monroe's star, which turned out to be one of the first ones we saw. It happens to be in front of McDonald's, if interested! We ended up seeing lots of names that even the kids recognized like Walt Disney. It was fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jans778
20,Congested,"This location is well know and recognized by all the movies that reference or refer to it. While it is something you have to see when in LA, expect numerous people and crowds which can be a bit overwhelming to deal. You need to be able to tick this one off the list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrevorBurchell
40,Go early before it gets crowded,The best time to go is around 9am an hour before everything starts opening up. I didn't have a map but most of the big names you will find easily like Michael Jackson. If you're looking for Muhammad Ali his is on the wall at the entrance to the Dolby theater. Neat attraction to see your first time in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taurusthebull40
40,Find your favourite STAR.,"Well, you can spend lots of time on this attraction looking for your favourite person, we did so much walking looking for HUGH JACKMAN (just for my sister - Hugh how lucky you are)We are Ozzies, but I also managed to look for my parents favourites took some photos to bring back to them. You don't realise how many people are notes down in the walk of fame, some I have never heard off, but we enjoyed coming across those that we had forgotten about. At the same time lots of good exercise walking and walking - and don't forget to take PICS.Kristine de la Hunty",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kristine1950
50,Good BUZZ,"Hundreds of people all in good spirit!! Always good to be here!! Street artists vary daily, although the occasional regular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dillieg
10,Horrible,"Hollywood walk of fame is not what you expect it to be!It is full of weird, shady looking people..People trying to give you their demo discs and then wanting money.. People in costumes taking photos expecting money..I felt so unsafe walking around with my kids that we didn't stay long at all.. It was a total let down.. The whole of Los Angeles was the same..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Khylie
30,Streets & Streets of Unknowns,Was a bit disappointed with the walk of fame . I didn't realise there would be streets going in all directions . Was also let down that some of them were filthy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizlolies47
50,Stars and Superheros,There's that Chinese Theatre with a shopping mall attached to it. Which out the back side offers a great view of the Hollywood sign. First star I came upon: TITO PUENTE the King of Salsa and Mambo. Very appropriate for this bilingual Reviewer. Be aware that Pictures with the phonies costs monies!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/papag611
50,Fun to be there,It was just fun to be there and see it in person. Fun time at night and bar hop and try the different food offerings in all the many nearby restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roatandrummerdave
10,Hated it. Congested with people getting in way and not even that interesting!,We were in LA for a day and this was on our to do list. We hated every minute of this. It was hugely congested and people just stop and get in the way. It is also full of entertainers who are not very good trying to get your money (basically just begging). We wish we had not wasted our time coming here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harber1978
30,Interesting,"Been here previously. In general, Hollywood has seen better days. It's an older section of LA and it is surprising to see a number of homeless people as you do. You would not expect as many for such a well know area. At any rate, I recommend swinging by here when in LA. You can have your photo taken with any of the caped crusaders, eg. Batman, Superman, etc. Plus take a photo of the star of your favorite actors/actresses.. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/668walth
30,Hollywood Blv,I think it is a bit overrated. When we visited there were a lot of tourists since it was the 4th long weekend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/650larak
30,Eh,It's nice to see them at least once but not again and again and again. Way too touristy and to crowded by rude pushy people. I've been twice and both times nearly trampled or have been shoved. I don't like big crowds because of that. Cute shops to check out if you go and the stars are fun but way too crowded to be able to take your time to look at them if you actually want to see the names. (went 2009ish and 2010),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laceycrazdwriterg
40,A must do one time,"First you can park for a small fee or free in the parking garage for the mall that's attached to the Dolby theater and you get the parking validated if you shop or dine there. The Dolby is where the Oscars are held and you can take photos on the outside area. Usually on Mondays they are having premieres and you can google which ones they are doing and we saw the setup for the Legends of Tarzan. Once you step outside on the Hollywood Blvd it's a mad house with tons of tourists and people who dress in costumes and try to get you to take photo with them and pay. There's many stars for blocks so research ahead of time who you want to see and where they are located. In front of the Chinese theater are the famous handprints. I hated all the trashy wagons with stuff for sale that were blocking many of the stars, etc. They really need to cleanup this area as it can be scary to be around. Across the street is the El Capitan- Disney's theater and you can watch movies there or at the Chinese theater. You can also tour these different theaters. The Jimmy Kimmel show is taped live down there but we were unable to get tickets since our teen is not 18. Just to walk around plan on 1.5 hrs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BushkaTexas
30,Good but go early morning!,This place gets so packed that you don't get to see the stars well unless you go early in the morning. Worth it just to say you have been.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrsneidert
40,Action Packed,Teenage kids love this place. Besides the Hollywood walk of stars there is an abundant amount of entertainment and dining in this area. Packed sidewalks of people and excellent people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kentucky1968
30,Average,"Honestly speaking I was let down by the walk of fame. It looks nothing like it does in the movies or on TV. The stars are quite small and it's a very busy area with people walking up and down the walk of fame so it's very difficult to look at the names or take pictures of the tiles. There's a lot to do in the area though; shopping, eating, celebrity house tours, LA tours, movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bogolo
40,A must when you are in LA,"We really enjoyed walking down the street and looking at the stars. Trying to find 'our' favorit stars. A lot of people, but fun anyway. Many stores to shop in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindat794
50,Walk of Fame,"I was at the walk of fame 8 years ago and just recently visit it again, at this time I was a kind of disappointed about the cleanness of the city, the streets are extremely dirty and looks like everyone is littering on the street, what a shame",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D_v_D_USA
20,Very disappointing,"Not a very hospitable place, over crowded with too many street vendors and vagrants. Not the place that I thought it would be. Shops very tatty and selling seaside rubbish, nothing classy about the place. Would not recommend this as a place to visit. Too crowded to see the pavement and the names.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/737davidh737
50,Fun!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame was very cool to see. It does take a bit of time to get through it all, however. If you want to see all of the stars, you'll need to spend a good part of the day.....and make sure you wear comfortable shoes. So worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandy252014
20,Crap,It's a sad place. Stinks like pee and has homelessness on every corner. Not somewhere I'd choose to visit with or without my 10 year old son .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A104JUsamanthah
30,Stars... Smars...,This was very much an anti climax... To be fair it was just a load of stars in the side walk with people's names so maybe we expected more for some reason. Most of the names were unrecognisable but all this was probably more our fault. Nice to tick not off the list all the same.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/980philipb
50,Go for the stars and forget the rest,I always wanted to see this and now it is off of my bucket list. Seeing the many different stars was fun but the area is not otherwise a destination point.Go and take some pictures of your favorite stars and then plan other activities for the rest of the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Herdlinger
30,Walk of Fame is in the wrong neighborhood,It was great to see the names of so many people who contributed to entertainment history. However the Walk is smelly and dirty. There are homeless people living in doorways and raunchy shops. The Walk of Fame should be moved to Rodeo Drive. What a turn off.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jal07
20,Very disappointing view of Hollywood,"This was the low point of our trip to LA. It was like walking down ""Skid Row"", with numerous drug addicts, homeless, vagrants begging for change. The entire street except for a section around the mall smelled of urine. It was really disappointing to see all the stars in the pavement covered with scum and dirt. Some of them we could barely read the name let alone take pictures. It's such a shame that in a town of people with so much fame and wealth this is what is around the corner. I had heard the drug problem in LA was bad but I had no idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveL251
30,Find the start,"Find the start and work from there.However, be aware, its full.of beggers and people dressed as skin characters which spoils the whole thing. But theyre there cause they know thats where the people are. Cant do LA without visiting it though its a must",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirstymac
50,Fun time looking at the stars!,We walked around and had fun checking out all of the stars and walked up the Mecca Shopping Area. We viewed the Hollywood sign from the vantage point there and the ate lunch at Johnny Rockets!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistiMorningstar
40,A must see for travelers,A neat thing to do is just walk down the boulevard and see all the famous names and find your favorites for pictures is always fun. Watch the traffic and bums but it's a thrill to just get out and be part of that bustling well known street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/377acc
20,What a disappointment,"Very touristy, as you would expect, but the 'Walk of Fame' is just a sidewalk with cheap tack shops and the Oscars entrance a shopping centre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StuartRon
40,Hooray for Hollywood,My friend and I walked from Vine St to the beginning of the Walk of Fame where the Four Ladies of Hollywood statue is located. Everyone has to visit at least once!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholinel
40,Fun to walk and see how many you recognise!,"You won't be able to say you have been to Hollywood unless you do ""the walk"". Lost of star to remember and many who I had no idea of! If you want to avoid the crowds, try to do this early in the day as in the afternoon and evening, there are heaps of street performers which are incredibly talented and fun to watch, but it makes star gazing dangerous as your head is down, not looking at where you are going!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul-n-Paulette
30,Must to see,The funiest thing there is walking around the Street and trying to fine your favorit movie actor's or musican's star. The Chinese Theater is also mus to see thing. If you don't like the places with full of people don't go there during the night time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/373juhap
50,Great fun for FREE,Hollywood walk of fame is a great fun thing to do in Hollywood and it for r free there is so much to see along the walk heaps of busting and dressed up characters too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z1045DZdavidc
30,Hollywood must do but for a Hollywood experience go see a show,So we did the walk and saw a lot of stars but it was just ok. Excited to see some famous names I know but there were way more I didn't know. Highlight areas for stars on the walk for me was outside Capitol Records and around the Chinese Theatre area. Go later in the evening when it's less crowded and you can take better pictures. But for a different Hollywood experience get online early and try to get tickets to a live show. We got tickets for the Late Late show with James Corden at CBS studios. We had to queue in the hot sun for a while before getting in but it's worth it when you get free tickets and you get to see a live recording of a show with some A-list celebrities. Totally new experience and cool to do and see what goes into a taping of a show. There's a lot of different shows being taped in Hollywood so why not see one if you're visiting the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LPtravelNZ
50,A Little Disappointing,"Was so excited to visit here but have to admit was a little disappointed once we arrived. Definately over glamourised on TV and in the movies. Was dirty, a lot of homeless which was quite sad to see in a city with as many wealthy people as LA, was hard to walk around to look at things without being accosted but still enjoyed seeing the sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodie_rose1
40,"Hollywood History, Hordes, & Hawkers","The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a part of Hollywood you will not want to miss: the ever-so recognizable stars stretch for approximately 1.5 miles down Hollywood Boulevard. There is no obvious rhyme or reason to their placement (dates, alphabetical, etc.) so you may have a little hunting to do but there is such a wonderful collection of Hollywood's best and brightest that you will be taking lots and lots of photos. Several words of caution though: 1) there are A LOT of people on the street, tourists and locals alike, so do be prepared to be patient; 2) you will be handed all sorts of flyers for ""discounts"" at souvenir shops, exhibits, etc. Some are more worthwhile than others; and 3) you may also be offered a ""free"" CD with ""really great music"" on it, then be asked for $10. Do not take it. It is not free; the $10 is expected and you very often just bought yourself a blank CD. With these cautions in mind, you should have a great time seeing one of the most iconic parts of Hollywood. Parking is varied; most of the lots are around the corner a block or so but do check prices. They can vary by quite a bit. Nights on the Boulevard are super crowded with the young and it gets pretty noisy and for me, a bit too much. I preferred going during the early afternoon and did the mileage in two parts. If you want to see the full 1.5 miles and have children with you, this may be a wise suggestion for you as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriJMK
30,If You Have The Extra Time,"The Walk of Fame consists of blocks of stars in the sidewalk with movie stars names in them. It is fun to look at them, but there are soooo many people walking on Hollywood Blvd. that it is hard to get a good look, let alone a picture of the stars. You do pass Grauman's Chinese Theater on the walk and a few historical theaters. However, there are would be actors dressed as movie star characters that want you to take a picture with them. They work for tips and some of them are quite aggressive when it comes to giving them, what they consider, a good tip. Tell them ahead of time what you are going to tip them. Some of them were very nice, others are not. Our hotel was within walking distance, so we were on the Walk of Fame almost everyday to get to other places. Lots of souvenir shops and places to eat. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit, but if you have the time, why not. It is lively at night with all the lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunster-Chicago
20,Dissappointed!,"I thought the walk of fame would be nice, but it was in downtown los angeles and a bad area. there was no map indicating where stars were located. It was trashy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToniBuilt
20,Interesting.,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame came as a bit of a let down to be honest. Watch out for the touts trying to get you to buy a Hollywood stars homes trip. Some are quite relentless with their pitch to you and the vehicles look very worse for wear. Some look better than others, if you want to take a trip make sure you shop around. As you go along the walk you certainly notice the surroundings changing to a more run down area. Disappointed when we saw it the first time and could not believe we were actually in Hollywood, given all the hype.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoneyGTT
40,A absolute must,"When in Hollywood who doesn't want to see the iconic WOF? Great picture opportunity . Plenty of people dressed as Hollywood characters from Spider-Man , Halo to Mini Mouse. You can take pics with them if you then tip them. They can however be a bit annoying when you just want to pass through or take your own pics of the WOF. Lots of great picture opportunities and places to dine. The only downside is the constant pestering from the people dressed as characters and people flogging CD's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMN1986
50,Rlly cool,Its so cool scoping out all of the cool stars because they all walked the same path that you walk on,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ughbella
30,A Little Disappointed,"Last time I was here I was a child. I had heard that the area was not what it used to be due to the many homeless people occupying doorways. The rumors are true. As we walked along the sidewalk and picked out stars on our way to the handprints at the theater, we noticed that some of the stars were cracked, dirty, and broken. Sad. I'm glad we went but definitely disappointed overall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyf209

But there is plenty to see and appreciate as you walk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnH699

50,A must See,I took my son on a tour of LA and one of stops was the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was really amazing to walk along the stars on the walkway and to see the names of all the famous people. It was a lot of fun. I had always dreamed of doing it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vvgancarski
40,Ummm...It is what it is.,"No secret here. It's a bunch of celebrity names in the sidewalk. The kids liked it for a few minutes. If you are going to be here to do something else, it doesn't hurt to glance down on the sidewalk and see who's there.The imprints in front of Mann's Chinese Theater are a bit more interesting...kids liked comparing feet and hands.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492rjj

30,Disappointing!,"The word Hollywood to most people conjures up glamour and glitz. So we were very disappointed by the Walk of Fame (indeed the whole area) as it felt tacky and a bit grubby. Full of shops selling the same cheap souvenirs, the ""stars"" on the pavements just get lost amongst the hoards of tourists, its not a pretty area lined with palm trees as we thought it would be. Very disappointing and not worth the hype it gets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/llpasah
40,Footprints in Cement,"The Hollywood Walk Of Fame is a great thing to see when you are in greater L. A. We went on a sunny day in June. The streets were packed with people, some looking down, reading the names on the stars, as they walked. My favorite part was the 'Footprints in Cement' at Grauman's Chinese Theater. They keep it updated with movie stars from today, as well as the ones from ""yesteryear!"" There are always characters there for a photo op (and a tip, of course) like, Spider-Man, Chee baca, Cat Woman, Snow White, etc. Its great fun for kids of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142yvonnem

20,Lots of dirty stars,"Before I went to California I thought that this was a glamorous place.

You can walk across all those stars on the ground but besides that, there are only movie theaters and souvenir shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonask237

40,Weird!,"If you are in a group take a walk at night. There's a lot more action and entertainers at night. Keep your purse and belongings close to you especially when you are enjoying the street shows. We mostly shopped and enjoyed the street entertainment. At night you will see intoxicated people and party people. Interesting , fun, different. Night visit, recommended for families with older children or friend group.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/171lilianm
50,Photo ops with movie characters,The walk of fame is an experience you don't want to miss. There are likely to be lots of people so be ready and make sure you have plenty of smaller dollar bills for tips to the characters that your teenage girls want to have a photo with. The guy playing Johnny Depp looked just like the real thing! which put smiles on the girls faces. I have no idea how you find a particular star on the walk - there must be a directory somewhere? Watch out for the guys giving out cd's - like everyone on the walk they are there to make money. Likewise with the tours - do some research and don't get talked into a tour as there are good and bad ones like anything. Finally the CVS store and pharmacy on the walk is good for picking up basic food and meds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/birdwood_family
30,Very Crowded,We went here expecting to find the stars for all our favorite stars. It was so incredibly crowded that we stayed for a very short time. We saw the star for Mickey Mouse and maybe a few others and that was it. There was a lot of traffic and a lot of people. Glad I saw it but I won't go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PPooh72
50,Vacation,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is really cool. Go early in the morning to take pictures. It gets very crowded by the afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/730reeset
50,To see Once at least attraction,"This is attraction is a great place to visit once and look for your favorite icon's start. It is in a way a scavenger hunt. Come prepared; wear comfortable shoes and have water during the day. At night time I would recommend having a jacket handy. This is during the hot season. Crowds are everywhere, occasionally there are smelly blocks. There are few repetitive stars. There are homeless people around and some are slightly friendly, which may seem odd to foreigners. Also there are few characters in costumes near the Kodak theatre who may come close to you so you can take photo with them. This is also where the most tourists are and it is very crowded around here. Keep your belongings close while taking photos and looking around. The walk of Fame is about 15 blocks to walk on Hollywood blvd and there are some extended on Vine street (perpendicular) on both sides. If you'd like you can find the map online and use it to track your starts faster. Lastly, there are a lot of promotional tours and other attractions along the way and some salesman would walk along with you to try and convince to get a tour with them. You can definitely bargain and get a better deal. Overall if you go prepared, you will enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annagevor
40,Family vaca!,Worth the traffic and the crowds! People watching is a blast! Parking is somewhat difficult but their are parking garages available one block over. Take plenty of pictures!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K9696DSmelissac
30,See it just to say you saw it.,"All I can say is at least walk it to say you've done it. The walk is not kept up, vagrants all over the place, just a poor looking area.

20,Boring,"Disappointed and very surprised about how lame this was. Expected an all-singing all-dancing experience for one of the most famous streets in the world but it really wasn't. The best way to describe it is Clapham High Street with some stars in the road when the street cleaners are on strike. Quite a few homeless people lurking as well, a general theme in LA. I imagine a lot of tourists leave here disappointed, certainly most of the people that I have spoken to that have visited here were. My advice would be don't bother and just look at the pictures instead, as they paint the walk of fame in a much better light.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Craig_M_L_23
20,Only if you're there anyway,"It's very cool to walk up and down the road to see all the history this pavement holds however it's very hard to just do that. Between the people trying to sell you movie star homes tours, hoards of other tourists, drunks and crazies it's hard to enjoy it the way I would have liked to. As I said very interesting but I don't think it's worth traveling far to see, if you're there any way it's worth taking a stroll though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcimo_NZ

30,Definitely worth doing but be prepared for the crowds and the hawkers,We enjoyed looking at all of the different stars. If you are looking for particular ones it is worth getting a star map.Be aware though that in front of the TCL theatre it gets very busy and it is extremely difficult to get a photo without people walking in front of you.There is also so many hawkers and beware of accepting any CD's for free. If they sign it they will ask for money and they don't ask if you want their signature first. Also expect to pay to get photos with the multitudes of people in costumes or to take photos of any dance acts. If you are prepared for all that then it is definitely worth doing ;),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissaj715
30,Had to be seen! Never again,"Just because it's there and so was I! So we went to see this strip, but all around are touts, hustlers, vagrants.It is what it is and see it if you feel you must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwitterEngland
40,names on ground,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame comprises more than 2,500 five-pointed terrazzo and brass stars embedded in the sidewalks along 15 blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and three blocks of Vine Street in Hollywood, California. The stars are permanent public monuments to achievement in the entertainment industry, bearing the names of a mix of actors, musicians, directors, producers, musical and theatrical groups, fictional characters, and others. I didn't like that idea at all; you are walking on the someone's name. You can go there just to see this famous place! I liked only frame on wall; Muhammad Ali. Muhammad Ali's star was granted after the committee decided that boxing could be considered a form of ""live performance"". Its placement, on a wall of the Dolby Theatre, makes it the only star mounted on a vertical surface, acceding to Ali's request that his name not be walked upon. As Muhammad is name of our Prophet! Also near Chinese theater you can see star's footprints and fingerprints. take 1$ cash to give to street artists, they will do something special for you; especially, boys who are freezing in one position, when you put tips to their box, they will start to dance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/basenyw
20,Too crowded!,"This was fun but I was not overly impressed. It was extremely crowded, which made it difficult to navigate. Also, on TV the Walk of Fame looks clean so I was very surprised to see how dirty the area actually was. The street is lined with souvenir shops & restaurants. People are everywhere trying to sell you various tours, giving away coupons, & I saw a few young boys trying to sell their music demos to tourists. I watched the set up and install of the Red Carpet for the celebrity movie premiere of Disney's The BFG, but my phone battery died before the event started. 😕 All in all it was a good experience & I'm glad I was able to witness it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissabB2460FT

30,Unimpressed,Hollywood!!! I obviously didn't get it. Perhaps this place is only for those that are impressed by actors and their craft but to me the whole area looks like a temporary immigration centre. The homeless of LA are visible on every street and at every road junction. It's a situation that the USA should be ashamed of. You cannot enjoy the area without being bothered. The affluent of Hollywood need to dig deep and help to resolve this for the benefit of their part of California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rewst

40,A MUST VISIT WHEN IN LA FOR THE 1ST TIME,"This is an essential visit if you are in LA for the first time. It's a vibrant place and pretty crowded with souvenir shops, tourists & hustlers but the iconic landmarks such as the Kodak & Chinese theaters & Hollywood sign, all add to the walk of fame’s attraction. When we visited it was especially poignant because Mohammed Ali had just died and his star is the only one that is on a wall as per his request.There are also many famous shopping outlets in the area and tons of restaurants and coffee bars to choose from. Go along and have a look,you’ll regret not going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alexmac24
50,Great walk and visit,"If you go to LA, you HAVE to visit the HWF. It's a long street where you get to see many stars of your favorite celebrity and meet other tourist and new people. While walking you will get into so many people taking pictures that you can ask anyone to take your picture with your phone or camera. Some people will even ask you if you want them to take your picture for you. You get also to see people disguised in different super hero's, dancers, athletes and you can tip them to make a picture with them. It is nice to see as there is many stars on the floor. The only star that you will find on a wall there is Muhammad Ali's. You get to see the chinese theatre where the movie premieres are held and also the wax museum is in the area. You will also find exotic cars available that you can drive. There is a lot of tour companies in the area also in case you want to make a tour to see the celebrity houses, Beverly Hills etc. If you go there, you will definately enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaNgr1
20,Not what it should be,"I'm sure back in the day hollywood used to be a great place to hangout but everyone has packed up and moved to other neighborhoods. All that is left are souvenir shops that sells the same stuff and homeless people sitting on the side walks. There are still some good restaurants and bars in the area but I got the feeling that you should go in to the places, do your thing and get out. Parking is also a bit of an issue if you travel with your own vehicle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wynmardel

We got hustled for money everywhere we went, had CD's pushed in our faces and got picked up literally by big black muscle men that say take a photo and pose with you, then they put their hand out and want cash for posing with you.!

It was easy to walk and click down one side of the street and up the other. We were surprised to find duplicate stars along the way. It was also fun to pop into the many souvenir shops along the way.

30,It's Fun!,The Walk of Fame is fun; got'ta find your favourite stars. The area itself is much like Times Square in New York. Very tourist centric; souvenir stores and stands. And Hollywood Blvd itself is typically closed in front of the theatre in support of a movie premire which I am sure happens almost daily.. Try to dodge the street hustlers hawking tours and you'll be fine; they can be aggressive and outright rude.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WineauxAlexandria
40,Entertaining but CROWDED,"We walked to see all of the stars which was very fun at the start but then as we got more and more closer to the ""popular"" stars it got more and more crowded.

It was very fun to get to see many names though and it feels endless because there are so many stars and you want to see all of them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648elisem
30,Not too impressed,This was not what we expected. The area was dirty and it seemed like a lot of the shops were closed. There were a lot of people dressed up in character that you could get your picture taken with (of course for a donation).

50,"Great Fun, Park at Roosevelt and eat at 25 Degrees","I live in Santa Monica. When friends come to visit I like to take them on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame. My flawless routine is to valet park at the Roosevelt , do the Walk of Fame on both sides of the street ( should take at least an hour) and then eat at the great burger joint in the Roosevelt called 25 Degrees, then get the car from the valet and zip away from what can be a madhouse. 25 Degrees is a fabulous place to get yummy burgers right on the strip. The Roosevelt Hotel also has a great pool bar scene if that suits you better. The hotel is worth checking out as its one of the oldest renovated hotels in LA and I believe the original location of the Academy Awards. When I used to travel to LA on business from NYC it was where we always stayed. Great hotel ( more for a younger crowd) , great location right on the Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coccindy

50,An AWESOMEEEEEEEEE experience for children and everyone,"If you are with children, we recommend explaining how the celebrities can get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Many gifts shops along the way, and this is just like any ordinary street. Seeing the stars is totally free of cost. If you have children, we recommend going near the El Capitan movie theater because you may notice Donald Duck's Star and Tinker Bell's star. That is something pretty cool to point out to your young children. You are able to notice all your favorite movie stars and singers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanctrips
30,"Stars are everywhere, just start walking","The day we visited was a little warm, so avoid afternoon. Plus I would go through the week, we went on a Sunday. Lots of people selling tours, I just kept walking, take water.. And Vicks, smells are pungent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3328IWkathyd
30,"A must see of course, but a bit overrated","Yeah yeah, this is still a must see attraction, but unless you are determined to find all your favourite stars it gets boring after a few minutes. Also seems like everyone is getting a star there nowadays so a bit disappointing for me.You get a good feel of the Hollywood craziness here, with some weird and/or funny characters all over the place. Can get very crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glemmy87
40,"Overcrowded, but still a sight to see.","This is such an iconic sight in America for all tourists to see. The area is extremely overcrowded, but there is still enough room to take pictures and find your favorite star. There are many gift vendors here as well as people in costumes to take pictures with. There are a few crazy people that roam the area though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acejosh11
30,Not what I expected,"Was almost shocked to see what the walk of fame looked like. I was expecting Hollywood glitz and glam however it far from that. The walk stretches over many blocks, sometimes down side streets.Sadly many of the ‘stars’ are dirty and some even cracked. What’s more the actual area is not so pleasant with homeless people and not-so-pleasant people wandering around so you feel quite nervous being there. It is fine around the Grauman’s Theatre as there are a lot more people and more tourists but the majority of the street is not very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussie_2012
40,Its nice.....,"Though a little crowded you will love looking for your favourite stars and getting yourself clicked with them. One can also find various characters there like spiderman , batman etc. One can also find the souvenir shops near Chinese theatre that are very reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriyankaK826
30,Was ok,"Of course if you are in LA, you have to check out the walk of fame. Obviously very touristy place. It was ok, once was enough. Took afew photos of some stars and ended up on a tour that shows you the homes and hang out spots of the rich and famous. That was fun. Great place to people watch but you can't spend a whole day here, maybe an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rineeb
40,Cool place to stop!,"The Walk of Fame is just as you'd imagine - only cleaner! I was pleasantly surprised to see a clean sidewalk near nice shops. I read reviews that said it was in an ""iffy"" part of town - but from an outside looking in, I would disagree. Plenty of people, nice shops, and we didn't have any problems. If you're in LA it's a must see sort of thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeyKell
50,Find your star,"Walking along , you see so many stars ones you know and ones you don't . It can be a great history lesson of film for those who want to take the time to look up actor and actresses . We has visited shortly after Robin Williams had passed and I wanted to pay tribute to a brilliant comedic mind . Just as a reminder if you did not now , the hand / foot prints are next to the Mann and not with the individual stars .. That would make for a rough walk :) down the street .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/52christyq
30,Sonething to do if you are in hollywood boulevard,"Probably the best aspect of this spot is that is free. You dont need to pay for explanations or any of that sort, enjoy on your own while you walk down the street. Avoid the tour of houses and behind the scenes...waste of money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rafamar
20,Overcrowded and overrated,"Just like times Square, this USA hotspot is a waste of time. Very crowded with all kind of luck seekers. The stars on the street are there, but not special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasperK676
50,I loved it,My very first visit to California and I had to visit. It's a lot of walking. People approach you wanting you to purchase a tour. I refused I rented a car and chose places and drove to where I wanted to go. There a lot of characters in customer wanting money for photos. We visited early in the morning so it wanted that crowded and we wanted to make sure we had parking. Also walk around before you but the first thing some shops have cheaper prices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Misstillisa
30,Fun and crowded.,"IF you visit Hollywood this is a must. Prepare to fight for your way to The stars cause this place is always crowded. It's fun to search for your favorite star, and maybe take a photo with some Of The people working their way in costumes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeronicaSjogren
40,Longer than expected!,"I'd imagined it being 1 street but it's 4 streets meeting at a crossroads that stretch out in 4 directions over several blocks, it's takes about 2 hours to walk it all. A percentage is covered by roadworks do I hope we didn't miss too many big names. The section by the cinema with handprints was the highlight",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gurnico
20,A little disappointing,"Let's be honest, the walk of fame its only for tourist. As a tourist, I believe everybody should visit at least once, but you have to keep your expectations low. It's not a glamorous nor beautiful place. It's just a walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiagoh2014
10,Walk of Shame,"Best to look at the walk of fame on TV or Google. Very over rated, tacky shops, filthy, tired and unpleasant area. The are to the front of the Chinese and dolby theatres are OK but the rest of the place is horrible. Been there a number of years ago and the place is a lot worse than I could remember.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troutsley

50,Super Busy,"Lots to do on Hollywood Boulevard. Very busy area with everyone looking at the stars and taking pictures of the stars, street performers and look-a-likes, like Michael Jackson, Spiderman, Thor etc. Some areas busier than others. Madam Tussauds is located on the walk of fame. That is a must visit. Takes about 45 minutes to an hour to walk through and take pictures.There is a small sovenier gift shop located beside the Starbucks close to Chineese Theatre. It says everything $10. Late afternoon the special was everything $5 each in the blue basket. Very, very busy but lots to choose from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pr0ject0ne
20,Crowded,"Crowded and full of people trying to scam you or sell you something. It was hard to get through as there are a lot of people stopping and taking photos, which I get because everyone wants a photo of their favourite entertainers star, but the added characters trying to make a buck and tour promotors really make it hard to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatBan78
20,See once and you are done!,"Yes it is a LA landmark but trust me, you only need about 5 minutes there. It's nothing special and glamorous and you will be annoyed by so many pushy street artist trying to get some money from the tourists.I hate when I need to take someone that is visiting there. My advice is if you cannot escape don't go close to the Chinese Teather - the walk is huge and you can see in not so crowded areas as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/887camip
30,One and done. Saw it and wouldn't return,"Many people on Walk of Fame trying to sell things (comedy DVDs, CDs, tours, etc) and very pushy. It was difficult to even look at the stars with this going on. Best time to visit would be early in the morning id say if you want to get good look at stars. I never need to see them again although it was cool to see once!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLS2013

30,Nice to see once!,"It fun seeing the stars on the ground but the entire boulevard is a little dirty. The vendors selling tours are quite rude even when you say ""no thank you"". If I wanted a tour I would have signed up. You can see the Hollywood sign just a few block off the Blvd. It was busy but not too crowded and the weather was perfect. It was interesting to see once but I would probably never go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U5106XJrobertb
30,Disappointing as overrated but a must-do,"Obviously this is a must do while in Hollywood, LA but it's a little overrated. I was so excited to see the glitz and glam, but the walk is full of homeless/crazy bums, with people trying to sell tours, CDs (ignore these guys, they will hustle you), photos etc. They kind of ruin the experience. The stars themselves are very hard to see as it's so busy. So it might be better to go early in the morning. I wouldn't recommend late at night as the surrounding areas are shady. Either way it's a must-do, but ultimately disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicNicCulligan
30,Glad we saw it but wasn't as impressed as I thought...,"I am glad we visited the Walk of Fame but I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be. It looked like it needed some TLC. We did not walk the entire length, only a portion of it to see the stars we wanted to see. There are shops, restaurants, and many people trying to sell you stuff (souvenirs, tours, cds) all along the way. It was crowded so it was hard to get pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hj99
40,A MUST SEE (at least once)!!!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is something you will want to visit at least once if you have the time (to walk the whole thing can take 2-3 hours depending on the crowd). That said, remember that the walk is a working sidewalk so it is not going to be in pristine condition. I took many pictures of the stars on the walk!(NOTE: people will walk in front of you, photobomb you and literally walk into you when you stop to take a picture. BE PATIENT!!!). Overall, I enjoyed walking the whole walk and taking pictures but probably will not visit again, unless they add a star that I really, really want to get.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A3681DOdavidd
50,Go at 8:30 AM,"Yes, what people say is very true, it's very dirty, some of the stars are cracked, there are homeless people who are drug addicts and many people say its a tourist trap..... HOWEVER....... You can avoid all of this by going extremely early in the morning. When there are not major crowds, it's not too hot, the Desperate Characters haven't arrived yet, because when I went in the morning and I was pleasantly surprised after reading all these bad reviews. Just go in the morning. Don't hype it up too much either. It's not glitz and glamor like you make it up to be in your head. It's just like any other city, dirty with crime. I love this city, it was a very pleasurable experience, I was just going off of stereotypes of cities like Toledo or Oakland, but I think its quite obvious that everywhere you go nowadays there will be crime. But you have to see this if you are in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DragonFruit85
40,Not what u expect,By all means go and walk and look for your favorite stars. Just be prepared that it is very dirty and full of homeless people. Yet in still...it's something everyone should experience! Go and have fun just dont be surprised!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahwC6201WA
40,HOLLYWOOD!!,"If you are there to take pictures of the Stars, I found that it was much easier to do during the beginning of the week, in the morning! My trip was during the week of 6/11/2013 and some of the stars are currently inaccessible because of some construction going on. Watch when you are getting closer to the crosswalks and try to time your picture taking accordingly....if you hang to the back of the crowd crossing the street, you can get the 2 or 3 stars going across and the 2 or 3 on the other side without fighting a bunch of people's feet! Elvis and The Beatles stars are at the top of Hollywood Blvd by the big silver statues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jovellelee
40,Interesting walk if you are into celebrity,"I have walked on Hollywood Blvd many times in the past. The area has gone from run down stores selling mostly stuff you would throw away as soon as you got home or revivalist churches to a metamorphosis of hip restaurants and variou stores. The walk can be interesting but please look up from the stars. You will find the old Max Factor building that now houses the Hollywood Museum, the wonderful Egyptian Theatre, the Pantages Theater, as well as hip night clubs and restaurants near Hollywood and Vine.In the past I would have rated this attraction as a 1 star but it has now become the center of fun for the young straight community so it is actually worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmW421OZ
50,Wonderful Wanderings,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame was much longer than I thought with numerous of the famous stars imbedded in the sidewalks on both sides of the street. The streets are crowded with fans looking for their favourite actors, musicians and Hollywood impresarios. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time as you will be stopped often waiting for people to take photographs and selfies along the boulevard. There are street entertainers aplenty, so be aware of crowds as pick pockets do operate in the area. Something I enjoyed as an experience but not sure if I'd feel the need to do it again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkAB51
20,"disappointing, dirty, full of homeless people","Ok, it is a must do while you are on visit in LA, but I doubt anyone really enjoys it. The street is dirty, full of weirdoes, lots of homeless people, and you really have to do your research of the location of the stars you want to see as it is almost impossible to just look for them once you are there. There are better things to do in LA than this extremely overrated walk of fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mishii_mis
30,Has to be seen,"We had 2 hours, so we walked the entire length on both sides of the seedy streets and tacky shops. The stars are good, but there are hundreds with some duplication, for acting and music. Pose by a blank one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mikethenailer
30,Fun Afternoon,"Hollywood Walk of Fame is a definite tourist attraction. There is a lot of activity in the street, bring your cameras and be prepaired to tip the characters you take pictures with, that's how they make a living. There's a lot to see and do in the area, one example - the Wax Museum. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msarandos
50,A Must Go in Los Angeles,"You've seen it in countless movies, but the Hollywood Walk of Fame really is something that every tourist and transplant should visit. It's amazing to think that so much talent has graced the entertainment industry, and it sure is a hoot to see and interact with all of the street performers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gus_Lindholm
10,Please skip or plan it very carefulky,"I live in LA and I periodically have to go to the Holiywood and Highland Mall which is at the walk of fame and I have the same response--- I want to sweep up the tourists and protect them. It is a skank experience. First of all it is almost always hot, seriously 10 months on the year the Blvd is 80 degrees or more. It is crowded . I mean very crowded. Then there are the awful characters Batman, Superman, Darth... Who aren't all lame but many are aggressive. Your kid wants a photo and then it gets ugly if you aren't ready to pay them. Yuck .The only way to do the WOFame is one way. Early in the morning. Before 9:00am. 7-9am is best. They will have washed the sidewalk. No characters. No crowd. Take photos of Julia Roberts star... Or whomever. Then get in your car and go to a local spot for breakfast like that great place in Griffith park near ferndale and then head up to the observatory. Or go south to Larchmont and hit one of many spots for breakfast then go to the La Brea Tar Pits.Or go to Beverly Hot Springs for natural hot artesian spring.All of these are ten minutes from walk of fame.That's a local suggestion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyHawaii
50,An Iconic Must-See for tourists to Los Angeles!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is world-famous & a must-see when visiting Los Angeles. Be advised that parking can be difficult in the area, and during peak tourist season, the crowds can be a little daunting.Visitors should park somewhere near the intersection of Highland Avenue & Hollywood Boulevard, then enjoy a fun & interesting stroll along both sides of Hollywood Boulevard between La Brea Avenue & Cahuenga Avenue.There are so many activities, sights & attractions along this stretch, it would take many different reviews to adequately describe them all. There is an abundance of restaurants, souvenir shops, Hollywood/pop-culture museums, costumed characters that will pose for photos (for a fee), the historic Mann's (formerly Graumann's) Chinese Theater with the stars' footprints/handprints & the large, glitzy Hollywood & Highland complex that includes the Kodak Theater (recently renamed something else, I believe), where the Oscars are held every year.For travelers on a budget, there are plenty of free things to see & do here. For example, I recommend seeing the ""Hollywood Gateway"" on the corner of Hollywood Boulevard & La Brea Avenue. This is a small gazebo-like structure held up by four statues that represent glamorous actresses from the ""Golden Age of Hollywood."" A little further east (on the north side of Hollywood Blvd) is the iconic Mann's Chinese Theater, and there's no charge to browse the outdoor street panels bearing the handprints/footprints & signatures of the many famous movie stars. Likewise, it's free to enter the impressive Hollywood & Highland complex (named for the intersection where it's located) through the elegant stairway with columns bearing the names of all the Best Picture Oscar-winning films. Take a little time to walk around the shopping/dining complex, as there are great views (and photo opportunities) of the Hollywood Sign there, too. There are plenty of inexpensive fast-food places for a cheap (and quick) lunch in the area, too--so a tight budget shouldn't deter tourists from having a great time along Hollywood Blvd. There is also an abundance of tourist companies, tour information/booking & maps/booklets available throughout this stretch, especially in/near the Hollywood & Highland complex. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941evanb
50,So much fun,"We loved this, hugely busy but still able to get our fill of the stars on the sidewalk and the foot and handprints. The ""stars"" all lined up to pose for a picture weren't too hot, and Spider-Man had quite a tummy, but all good fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheladyLisa
40,You gotta see it,"A great photo opp. However, once you see it there's not much else to do other than the wax museum. You could do the walk of fame in about an hour. There's always street performers but if you take a picture of any of them, they'll try to charge you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ABSearles
50,Famous Street all over the world,"Finally I have a chance to visit L.A., and I went to the walk of fame as my first viewpoint of L.A. This street is full of people, and you can see so many performer here to entertain tourists. The starts is so many that I think nobody can actually count, and the street is also very crowded, so it makes you hard to move and take a good pic. Joining the local trip seems to be a better way to understand Hollywood. The shuttle bus will take you to all the popular vista point, just like Hollywood sign....celebrity's gorgeous huge house....etc. You should come here to experience the amazing movie business first when you visit L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yangor
30,Great experience but not what we expected!,"In all the movies they give you the since that Hollywood is a high class or fancy area....it's not. First off don't be scared away by what I just said. We had a Blast!! The area around the Chinese theatre is nice but walk a few blocks either way and you will notice that the scene changes a couple closed businesses , bums, trash, broken up sections of walk of fame. But this didn't bother us. Just figured we would give everyone a heads up so the are not disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwr1976
20,Hollywood,"Very disappointed, I was looking forward to it so much and when I got there it was just so different. The walk of fame part was AMAZING! But the bad part is all the people trying to sell you stuff, CDs, give you cards, the people touching you, hanging all over you. You can't enjoy it cause all the people coming up to you. I just had to go back to the hotel and shower.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/869gracier
30,Not worth it,There are so many people you can't even see the names. People in costumes make you take pictures with them and then charge you 5 dollars for the picture...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minchih2016
30,Quite disappointing,"When looking at the pictures online, you never pay too much attention to the neighbourhood and surrounding of the walk of fame. The walk itself is nice, it's truly cool to see your favourite actors' and singers' names on the sidewalk but the neighbourhood is not prestige at all. It's not well kept, dirty, smelly, weird shops, weird people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/articok
30,Iconic but busy,Walked along the road for ages!!! Very busy and far too many unknowns now. Down the side streets as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RorysRavers
20,Disappointment as Dirty and Dingy area,"Was looking forward to seeing the stars on the sidewalks. However was really disappointed with how dirty and dingy the sidewalks were with beggars, people sleeping on sidewalks - not at all what I had imagined. No glamour of Hollywood at all. Sad!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nikareeta
10,Dirty and Not looked after,"It took us approximately 4 hours to walk this entire Walk of Fame. I had heard many stories of the homelessness in the area, but it was such a spoiler.Many of the Stars have not been looked after. They are damaged and so many people trying to swindle money off you - from dodgy star tours to ""here you wanna a picture with me""......As the sun went down, I really did not feel safe. Particularly as you ventured a little way past the Chinese and Dolby Theatre area.I did see some police patrol the area, but they were not doing the full circuit of the walk of fame.The state should spend some money in this area, to clean it up.All I can say his, be prepared to ignore hecklers, homeless and drunks as this is certainly not being looked after or cared for!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariatP8162AE
30,Nighttime visit,Nice to see the stars on the walkway and the Chinese Theatre but I wouldn't stray off the main area as it doesn't look the safest. Just be aware of your surroundings. We parked for a couple of hours on the main street for $4 but you can also park off street in places for $10 -15,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/369greigb
20,Silly stuff,Not worth the detour. This looks better in a picture than in real life. I cannot find a good reason to visit this hall unless you are under 16.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wolffman1973
40,Hollywood Star Walk,"This was the second time I've been to Hollywood to see the Star Walk. It's slightly seedy, but worth seeing. I was on a tour bus the first time years ago and had been told to be wary taking photos with the characters as they harassed tourists for money and became foul mouthed if you didn't give enough donation for a photo with them. I unfortunately witnessed a character who'd just taken a photo with a tourist, gesturing to the tourist to keep handing over more cash as he felt what she'd given wasn't enough. This time we drove to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, so we had a little more independence. Parking was super expensive at $20 for the hour in a lot, but seemed safe. We were able to get around to the Chinese Theatre, Kodak Theatre and check out some of our favourite celebrity stars on the Walk before moving on to our next tourist spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvonnechristi
30,Enjoyed it for a good hour but that's it.,"Walked up and down the strip, didn't know most of the names. Did get excited when I did see someone I knew but that lasted 5 seconds, kept walking. Lots of homeless people and beggers. Very over hyped, if you're local come visit but don't make a day trip out of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xeNticex
40,Iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame,"We enjoyed our stroll along some 15 blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and 3 blocks of Vine Street, popularly known as the Hollywood Walk of Fame during our maiden trip to Hollywood. The pavements are full of tiles containing more than 2500 five pointed terrazzo and brass stars embedded in the sidewalks immortalizing the stars of Hollywood. Entertainers can be nominated in any one of five approved categories: Motion Pictures, Television, Radio, Recording and Live Performance/Theater.The images on the stars in the aforementioned five categories are a classic film camera, a television set, a phonograph record, a microphone and the traditional comedy/tragedy masks representing theatre. Identifying the names of famous celebrities such as Johnny Depp, Tom Cruise, Robert De Niro, Julia Roberts, Jennifer Lawrence ....and many more on the sidewalks gives a thrill to world wide visitors everyday.A must visit free attraction when visiting Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArindamG517
40,Very cool but overlooked by most,When we went to the walk of fame I thought that the stars would be pristine and people would try not to walk on them. I WAS SO WRONG! In some cases it's hard to take pictures of certain stars due to all the foot traffic. I would still recommend it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Breen77
40,Find your favorite star's name here,"It was very interesting for us to find so many star's name on this Walk of Fame. It included many celebrities, whether they succeed in the music industry, movie industry or even TV shows, you will most likely find their name here. Go and explore for yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sychan987

20,Not worth it,Very touristy and nothing really to see except Vin Diesel handprint. Don't go to Scientology center unless you want a new beginning. Go to out of the closet. Eat local and not at chains. No celebs there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rachelram
40,A 'must' but not as glamorous as you might think.,"Be sure to attend a show in 'Pantages' theatre, the chinese theatre and for elder people to visit he 'Hollywood museum'.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucv954
40,Much improved from 20 years ago,"Our first visit was about 20 years ago and we left quite disappointed. It was seedy, grubby and couldn't see what the fuss was.This time, we found it so much better. It's not just about the stars but the whole atmosphere. There are better quality shops and restaurants to visit and the whole area was cleaner. We visited in April after Spring Break and it was not too crowded. There was a good police presence so we felt very safe at all times. (We stayed very near so this was our local area).We enjoyed seeing the stars and remembering the ones that have passed away.There were impersonators which were hilarious and other odd bods like Mr Muscles. They didn't hustle but were friendly and yes, did expect a dollar tip for a photo with them. We took plenty of photos for free, we just weren't in them!I accidentally did accept a cd from some guy who handed it to me - I thought it was free! Haha silly me! I quickly handed it back saying no thanks and there was no problem.We ate at the Hard Rock Cafe and California Pizza Kitchen (our favourite). Shopped at Ghiardellis, Victoria's Secret, Pink, Gap, La La La Land (a great souvenir shop that had the most impressive car in it from Elvis days). Jimmy Kimmel is recorded at a studio here too. We saw the Chinese Theatre with famous hand prints and saw the movie ""The Jungle Book at the El Capitan Theatre"" which was brilliant.This really was a buzzy, fun place to explore if you have the time. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimandCliff
50,"A must do if first time in Hollywood, The city of movie stars!","The kids (7 and 15) were running around looking for the hand- and footprints of their favorite actors.

A truly great day in Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karolines85

30,Overrated but a must-do!,Well its actually just stars with names on a street but it is THE most visited attraction in LA!! It was my second time. Well honestly it is kinda fun to pose with the stars which have names of celebrities. The spot also has some restaurants and shops around so one can spend a lot of time here and have some fun!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zenobiak2016

If you haven't seen the Hollywood sign go to the top floor of the shopping centre (on the right just before the Chinese theatre) and venture to the 2nd floor, still small, but you'll spot the big words!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChloeShan
10,"You're Not Seriously Going To Go See This, Are You?","You're a tourist from someplace far, far away, right? Otherwise, you wouldn't even be reading this. No native Angelean gives a flying #$%& about these little doodads. I mean, really - some names written on the sidewalk? Probably ninety percent of them you never even heard of. And the corner of Hollywood and Vine is the sleaze capital of Los Angeles. Avoid it like the plague and go to (what used to be) Grauman's Chinese Theater, just up the street. For a hokey tourist attraction, it's pretty cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProPhotoLA
40,Trip to LA,I was expecting this place to be different. It was smaller than I expected and as expected very crowded. It did not impressed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/84denar
50,Seeing this was surreal,"I visited the Walk of Fame on a school trip and the experience was incredible. Being in a place where so many talented, amazing people are being celebrated was definitely a highlight of my trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C7342YVlauram
20,Just stars on the floor on a normal street,"Honestly, putting the sentiment of seeing names of famous people aside, The blvd itself isn't great. Could use some cleaning up and some more upkeep.Visiting there in the night\evening is even less glamorous. However, lots of clubs and bars around, if that's what your looking for. Otherwise, it's good for a drive-through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danihalf
30,Overrated.,"Its a crowded overrated attraction. The best part is outside the chinese Theatre, everything else is blah. Every few steps you get accosted by people asking for money, people offering tours, souvenirs. It's more hype than anything else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/758shivs
20,Disappointed,"Well not so much a walk of fame more the walk of shame.The whole place needs smartening up, as it's all looking dated.All the shops are selling over priced toot.We could have passed on walking along the street and not missed out on much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/242PaulM
50,Essential Hollywood,"This is It! Stars from Bugs Bunny to Bruce Lee and Oliver Stone...old long gone ones and new ones...it's great to see them memorialized, great to see people take photos next to their favorites...seems endless, so many celebrities...very fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
50,Great place for pics bring change $1,"Shops, building and stars, take a picture with your favorite stars name and if lucky maybe the star itself. I took a picture with my fav (Johnny Dep). Most people will pose for a $1 bring your walking shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sndunga
20,Not Built for Finding Anything,"The Walk of Fame is a collection of over 2,000 stars with names on a pavement. There's nothing particularly interesting about this at all. However, I believe most tourists will want to find their favorite movie star and take a picture next to it.Good luck! Wikipedia has a good list of stars represented in the Walk and their locations, but if you don't have a ready Internet connection (normal in the US, where public wifi is practically non-existent), finding the relevant stars will be nearly impossible. We walked the whole thing just to locate a few of the interesting ones (to us).The whole Walk is really built so that you won't be able to find anything, I'm pretty sure it's on purpose. As far as I could tell, there were no maps or guides, for free or for money. So my suggestion is: find out where the stars you want are in advance! Also, there aren't many interesting locations along the route; just a few buildings with significance to Hollywood which most people are unlikely to care about.What there is plenty of though is pushy ""tour guides"" who want to sell you trips around LA for seeing celebrity houses. These people made the walk quite unpleasant. The Church of Scientology people might talk to you as well, but I found that more amusing than bothersome.In any case, Chuck Norris's star is on the southern side, between Sycamore Avenue and Orange Drive. Just saying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ynhockey
40,"Nostalgia, Great People Watching, & Hard Rock Café","It was a fun morning to see the stars on the sidewalks of Hollywood Blvd. We specifically wanted to take a photo of the Marilyn Monroe and Mickey Mouse stars--Marilyn is in front of the McDonald's and Mickey is in front of the TLC (Grauman's) Chinese Theatre. It was interesting to see the set up of a movie premiere for Warcraft--lot of lights and large figurines.Parking was somewhat expensive--maybe there are great places but we drove around and had to settle on the public parking just off Hollywood Blvd at Highland for $30. June is a busy tourist time, so we paid premium.Be careful of the street vendors like the movie star impersonators. They are overly friendly and want to take a photo with you; however, they also expect $10 per person for a photo. Just know that and pay if you would like a photo. I've been told don't deal with any other scam artists like CD sellers and be careful of pick pockets.We did get a $5 off coupon for the Hard Rock Café and enjoyed a delicious lunch. Totally recommend eating at the Hard Rock Hollywood :)Hope you found this review helpful. ~Lori",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorisJ1821NM
50,Wow! A trip down memory lane. Can be crowded.,"It's fun to see all the stars that have a Star on the Walk of Fame. It can be crowded, and there are a lot of peddlers trying to get you to give them money. Lots of tourists. Plenty of places to eat in the Dolby theatre complex. Underground parking is very reasonable with validation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8michaely
40,Times Square West?,Dropped by and did the walking tour. Plenty of stars and names all around. Caught the Kimmel taping too so that was an added great. If you're in LA and don't stop by your bucket list will be wanting. Has some street performers and aggressive characters trying to get your photo or sell a cd so don't take anything. Once you touch it it's considered yours by these rogue sellers. Otherwise a good visit and another thing on my list checked off.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaifWolfe
30,Busy,"Predictably this place is super busy, you can walk up and down Hollywood Blvd though and you will see a great number of stars (on the pavement!!).There are a lot of people milling about though so not always easy to stop and take photos of your favourites!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maddylucya
40,A must for movie lovers,Excellent walk down memory lane. Great to review the old stars that have been commemorated and there is plenty of history in the street with Grauman's Chinese theatre and the El Capital theatre that premiered Citizen Kane in 1941.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanj2013
50,Viva las vegas,Didn't think we like it but we bloody did. Now warning it's smaller than we thought and you do have to fight our fellow Chinese tourists but well worth it and good fun looking for your favourite celebrity. Look out for the celebrity lookalikes and guys selling there music CDs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcandLauraB
20,Just Names?,Nothing very exciting about this attraction. Just names on the pavement. I was told the path was over 2 miles long but once you've seen one star you can imagine what the next one will look like.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/197andyn
20,Beware the scam artists,"We visited the Walk of Fame today. As an attraction, it's really not that great: It's a bunch of names engraved in the sidewalk, and not a whole lot else. But if you're into that kind of thing, cool.The thing I'd really warn people to watch out for are the scam artists. We fell for the ""cd scam"" today: A guy puts a cd in your hand without you asking for it; asks your name and signs the cd; then demands money for the cd despite the fact that you never wanted it in the first place. He then claims he can't take it back since he already signed it and threateningly insists on you paying him. The guy in this case was a very tall big African-American guy calling himself Black Nate Debiase. My advice would be to not talk to anyone who tries to offer you anything in this area - it's rife with hustlers and scam artists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NZ_oke
40,Great! But ruined by certain thinga,"First of all, if you are looking for the absolute best experience at the walk of fame, chinese theater and hollywood boulevard in general, I suggest you get up real early (7 a.m) and take an uber down to the place. Its practically empty at around 8-9 am in the morning and is magnificent. Pictures turns out great cause there are not a lot of people and finding people gets real easy. However, make sure you look busy when you are not taking a picture because the people who tries to sell you pictures/cds are there and there not being a lot of people, you are more likely to be targeted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/395jasone
50,Amazing!!!,It was so much fun walking up Hollywood Blvd checking each star for favorites ...we made a game out of it with the Grand kids...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/333sharonr
10,Really?,"What a waste of time. Is this the best LA has to offer? Seems like it's in a relatively shabby area, 2 T-Shirts for $10 type of place (they did).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liseyl
50,Hollywood walk of fame experience,"Hollywood walk of fame is a must go see while in LA. If you specifically want to see certain celebrity stars I'd get a map of them as there is a lot to search through, as it goes on for miles. It's a good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanwilkins0n
30,Not what we expected,I am not sure what we expected but to be honest we were not impressed. The area was a bit run down to say the least and the walk of fame stars must be at least a few miles long so if you are looking for a particular star good luck finding it. Would not visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzannes982
30,A bit disappointing,Doesn't really look like you could imagine it. Looks like a random street with pink stars on the ground.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/679lauriep
40,Walk of Fame,You can come across this suddenly. Its actually just the side walk of Hollywood boulevard and circles the blocks. Can get quiet busy and hard to find who your looking forward without prior research,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leyshao
50,Pretty Descent,I went with some friends to a conference and afterwards we decided to visit the walk of fame. It was just a walk nothing that really excited me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiffanyj710
50,Original Walk of Fame,"Something for everybody because they cover so many different genre of stars from singers, actors, directors & producers and some stars have multiple stars for different areas like being a singer & actor. It's something everybody should see at least once in their life because the Hollywood Walk of Fame is so well known. Along the main part along Hollywood Blvd there are many different gift stores and side attractions to take in. The Walk of Fame is free so that is always a great reason to visit and you can spend as much or little time you want checking out the different stars. Also, it's a great place to people watch because you have a lot of different characters along there but I felt safe. If you go I think you will be glad you did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelLong1963
30,Ok.....,"I'm glad we went here and I've seen this, but it was very busy and the crowds are a bit overwhelming. It's a case of once you've seen the first few stars, you've kind of seen them all, so don't plan a whole day around it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheReedies
40,Fun area,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame seems to go forever - so many stars and they add one or two every few weeks. The area has tons of places to eat, shop, and visit. The downside is that there are lots of 'artists' trying to hand you their CD's and then asking you for ""just a small donation of $5-$20"". Too many people from the wax museums handing out coupons too. There are people dressed as characters who want you to take pics with them for $ - Captain America, Spider-Man, Mickey and Minnie, Jack Sparrow, and more. This is right along where Jimmy Kimmel live tapes and also the Dolby and Chinese Theaters. If you want to be an audience member at Kimmel, you can request tickets online in advance of your trip but can also be in a queue for stand-by if you don't have tickets. First come, first serve if standby. There's a lot of shopping in a beautiful multi-level outside mall area right next to Hard Rock Cafe. Parking garage charged $15 for the whole day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kloverfield
30,An underwhelming must see,"I understand that the Hollywood walk of fame is a must see, and it's true! It's worth the walk however it's a little underwhelming.I had high expectations after seeing the glitz and glam of Hollywood from magazines and TV. When you walk down the walk of fame the streets are dirty, lots of homeless people, city tours shoving flyers in your face and people in costumes scamming tips for photos.It's worth seeing the walk of fame, just don't expect it to be glamorous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauramac691
40,Fun walk,This was right by our hotel so was a good pastime for an hour with lots of energy and fun along the street. It was busy but not so much as I may have expected.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dancing_Zorbas
30,The Hollywood Walk of Fame,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is cool, especially if one of your favorite entertainers has a star and you'd like to take a selfie with it in the background. However, be careful and make sure you're aware of your surroundings. As a general rule, get permission before you take a picture of anyone on the WoF, homeless or not. MAKE SURE you compensate them by giving them a dollar or two as your life may depend on it. A young lady was killed a few years ago and it's not worth the risk. Some of us Angelenos call it ""Holly-WEIRD"", and you don't need to be a rocket-scientist to figure out why.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arejaydoubleyou
40,Very busy and good luck with getting a good pic,"I was able to get a good shot of the memorial for Muhammad Ali. I'm sure it will be better to visit during the week where there are no holidays, school is in session and between 9 to 11am - 2 to 4pm.Nearby parking at the mall is $2 for the first two hours, $1 every fifteen minutes after that and $15 all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OuttaW
30,It's a sidewalk,"Stars apparently are handed out to anyone including cartoon characters. Nice touristy place though, busy road with lots of shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lazy-Daizy-10
40,Visit it for Movie Stars!,"If you love movies then you got to come here. You can look down the roads n find your favorite movie star! But it really need some luck to find the one you love, but I hears there are people selling Maps of the bricks which shown their names so you can find those stars you love according to the maps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agneschaotw
30,Not bad....,We did this at the start of a full day in Hollywood and the hop on hop off bus which I fully recommend. As for the Hollywood walk of fame.....not what I expected. Kids loved all the cartoon characters around there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisef544
30,Not what we expected!!,"We drove to LA from Vegas for a day trip and to visit family and all my daughter wanted to see was the Hollywood Walk of Fame, well it was not what we expected it was so dirty there I thought they cleaned the walk and tried to keep it clean but that's not the case, we went on a Saturday and it was packed people everywhere. I did not like to see so many snakes that the people were carrying around seemed unsafe but people enjoyed taking pictures with them, too many street performers you couldn't walk it was just too many people and no order.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lissa27
50,Entertaining!,Smaller than I expected. Filled with street performers and souvenir shops all around. Go early to avoid the crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IsabellasTrips
30,Walk About.,"It was amazing to walk around the place and the historic's of everything that was there. A lot things going on all the time and I really loved reading all the names in the stars on the path. The only thing I did find disappointing was how dirty it was. Everything just seemed grotty. We did do a tour of Hollywood and checked the stars houses were they still live and and who lived where and they take you up to the Hollywood sign, but we thought we would get closer. Overall still glad we did the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/641rinal
50,A gallery of lives!,"I could not have been in California without visiting the Hollywood Walk of Fame. As I walked down the star studded street, I felt I was in touch with the various stars that have been part of me all my life. From Aretha Franklin to Michael Jackson, From Chuck Noris to David Caridine, this was like saying ""Soji, this is your life"". This place is full of history and a should go to anyone who is in the Hollywood area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Godsent007
50,Great walk,It was great to test your knowledge of all the great actors around the world. The best attraction there is you will witness many characters dressing up like high jackman Tom cruise John travolta. Batman it was a visual treatIt's better go after the sunset as the musicians start at the time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vigy1
20,Boring,Nothing special. .Just a crowded street with gift shops in the sidesDidn't feel safe in this place at all😯,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rorophone
30,Night walk,It's an ok road to visit. I have been here couple of times on my different visits to LA. I would recommend to visit the road in the day light to see the Stars' names.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maithabuhumaid
30,Not as exciting as expected,Yeah it was nice to see and wander around but really it wasn't that exciting. It's actually a really large area! So to see it all would take a while. There were heaps of stars I didn't recognise.Was nice to see someone cleaning them!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmadeusAndy
50,History all around.,"Glad I did this tour as part of a group. The overall feel of the walk of stars is exciting. Great to walk in the footprints of Hollywood icons. The area though was a bit ""grotty"" . I felt a good clean was necessary to remove rubbish etc. I'm sure a lot of this rubbish was due to tourist groups. There were quite a few homeless people there too. So the company of fellow tourists was reassuring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandrapF3098BR
20,Nothing much,Go only if you have time to spare. Too many people dressed up as characters for you to take pictures with for a fee. Seriously some were very unfriendly n some were totally hilarious. Then again this is Hollywood!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alencia
30,WALK of FAME,"I must say I had huge expectations for Hollywood, given that it is the home of fame glitz and glamour! But it kind of is what it is. It's somewhere that I guess you have to experience if in LA but I wasn't particularly wowed. If you go there with low expectations you won't be disappointed it wasn't bad it just was not great either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/897louisc
30,Hollywood Attraction,This is a must do attraction for everyone who visits Hollywood. Only problem is everyone is there and walking along the sidewalk where the stars names are. Getting a photo is a challenge. Easy to get to on public transport. Just be ready to be there with masses of others and the beggars and sellers that are all over the place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/249pamc
20,Letdown,Didn't really like the area got a lot of hassle from homeless people asking for money and people who want to get into the music business trying to give you CDs. It was good to see the stars but that was the best bit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/64wesleyh
30,A Must Do In Hollywood,"If you are visiting Hollywood, then you clearly need to do the walk of fame. However, it seems that almost everyone has a star nowadays. Try to avoid a weekend. We went on a Saturday at Memorial Weekend which was extremely busy and difficult to see all the stars. We parked at one end of the WOF and paid $20 for the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PFTraveller62
50,It was great fun reading all the names. Most of which I recognised.,A word of warning. I become so engrossed looking down at the pavement I managed to bump into several people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosD193
40,Only if you are a movie buff,LA is not my favorite city. Too much traffic. Sirens in the air. I would recommend it only to a real movie buff. There are so much nicer things to see in the vicinity. If you don't have plenty of time. Don't waste it on Hollywood blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorinadsm
10,Cheap Tacky and Run Down,We were really disappointed with the walk of fame. As there are now so many celebrities included and private residents can also buy there own star there are a lot of names stretching right down Hollywood Boulevard.We decided to walk the length of the walk of fame which starts in a really run down area and then once the area picks up in cleanliness it is rammed full of tacky shops and litter. There is a few nice feet right in front of the Chinese theatre then it is back to the tacky shops.First time in LA you have to see it but I wouldn't plan to be there for long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trigger85
30,Nice and vibrant. Watch out for hustlers,Watch out for the hustlers (street performers in costumes & guys giving out demo CDs) would recommend to just avoid them totally. They are quite persistent in ripping money off you :S,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lind223
50,!!!,"Great place for fun,shopping and entertainment. And of course the dolby theatre(Oscars venue is worth visiting.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveller0285
40,Interesting history,"I can't help being slightly disappointed. Although the history of film cannot be denied, the area itself has been slightly tarnished by the commercial response to tourism. In its heyday it must have been spectacular. That said the stars on the walk of fame, the buildings and the concrete hand prints bring back the reality of what this once was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redcetera
30,Local's take on Hollywood Blvd,"I live in LA and have been to the ""Walk of Fame"" a gazillion times with out-of-towners who were visiting us. We also go there frequently to go to the Pantages Theater because we are season ticket holders or the El Capitain Theater. The first time I went to the walk of fame was as a tourist 18 years ago before I ever thought of living here. Even then it was underwhelming but now as I drive by Hollywood and Highland or Hollywood and Vine and see the vast amount of tourists walking along I think to myself what a shame it is that these people are not experiencing the ""real"" LA. I guess it's an ok thing to do for an hour or so but this is a tourist trap and nothing more. Combine it with a show at The Pantages and you will have a much better experience. The Pantages is a beautiful old historic theater well worth the price of tickets with Broadway quality shows. For a cheaper price you can buy movie tickets at the El Capitain Disney theater which is also old and historic and beautiful and comes with a live show before every performance. See the stars in the sidewalk walking to and from these theaters and then move on! Here is an alternative thing to do: go to Laurel Canyon and Ventura Blvd and walk west. There are shops and restaurants and it is nice. You will also be in actual LA where real people live, dine, and shop. Even famous people. I doubt you will see anyone famous walking on the Hollywood walk of fame. Truly. It won't happen. Stay in and hang around Studio City and you will see at least one famous person per day over your trip. Happy travels!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vermontlovely
20,Disappointing,"Walk of fame - good idea and nice to look at the 'stars' and find some favourites but surroundings are tatty and depressing. Cheap shops, dodgy shops, lots of people on sidewalks trying to make money. Didn't really find out much about Hollywood beforehand so didn't know what to expect. Only passing through but wouldn't revisit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManchesterJinx123
20,Interesting to see,"Like a lot of people, I'd always been curious about what the Walk of Fame was really like. Simply put, busy and pretty dirty. Obviously plenty of tourists but the annoying part is all the ""characters"" like spiderman, superman, Michael Jackson, Jack Sparrow etc who come up to you. Just as bad are all the guys near Dolby and Grauman's trying to sell you their demo records. It's definitely not any better at night, the crowds definitely seem rougher.It's fun to see a movie at Grauman's Chinese Theater or the El Capitan, but the Walk of Fame itself is nothing too special after your first time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajserrano1452
50,Walk the Walk,"Hollywood Boulevard has cleaned up its act since the 80s. A small fortune has gone into making the place a family friendly attraction. Sure, every once and a while you get the odd scuffle between the guys on the Blvd but they are made-up and in the heat more often than not.It can't be all bad. Some people got a book out of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davelO2450NP
20,"Worth seeing, but know ahead of time...","We enjoyed our visit, but be prepared for tons of people trying to sell you cd's, dad's ect. The pics with people dressed up are not free. Hard to take pics of any stars on the street cause it is constant traffic. Good deals for hats, shirts, ect can be found. Go early and take the metro red line and get out before the crowds get crazy. Even on a Wed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flight000
50,Stars,Easy to find. Have a Starbucks coffee on the corner of Sunset Blvd and Vine. It is so interesting. It is fun to read all of the names.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoastinAndToastin
10,dirty,"we went to Hollywood for 4 days in may and we were so disappointed, its so dirty and loads of tramps all over walk of fame not at all how we expected it to be .would never go back .there was a man just releaving himself in the street opposite Chinese theatre absolutely disgusting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/312nigelp
30,Great but busy!,"Great little 'must-do' in LA, and I would advise making sure if there's a star you wish to see in particular you find out its location before hand. Hundreds of stars like both sides of the street, and if you're right in central Hollywood Boulevard you may find the big names covered over by events going on in the street. We visited only to find a large portion outside Hollywood and Highland was covered by a stores promotional event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben987UK
30,Something to do,Much longer than expected as it runs N -S and E -W and intersects two streets. The stars can be hard to read in bright sunshine and looking down to see names means you risk bumping into people so be careful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lylemate
20,Meh,"Good for families with small kids or if you've never been before it might be worth a visit. Aside from that, if you're limited on time in LA, skip this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsmyname
30,Don't Expect to Spend Much Time Here,"If you're already in the area, it doesn't hurt to spend a few minutes looking at the stars. However, it's not worth taking time out of your trip to see otherwise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeFeeny
30,Hollywood blvd,"Somehow expected this differently. Just stars set into sidewalk, many of celebrities that are quite obscure. Meant many people were not watching where they were going. Sort of difficult to maneuver with large crowds in the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maytraveler
50,Another must for anyone visiting LA,Our hotel was one block from the end of the walk of fame so we walked along it a couple of times while looking for food. On our first night in LA we walked up to the walk of fame and there was a film premiere at the Chinese theatre. While it was busy it was not horribly so but I imagine a premiere for a summer blockbuster would draw a larger crowd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielwS2999OT
20,No Glitz no glamour,Thought this was a must see but to be honest it was a bit of a let down. Stars were in the pavement and hand prints were there but look up and around and you could have been in any run down city centre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andy24658977
50,You have to do it!,"Bit touristy but a lot of fun! Doesn't take long but boy when you find your favorite actor's star, it's a treat. Can always pop to the Roosevelt for a drink. Love it there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrigitteFrancoise
50,The heart of Los Angeles!,"Of course, when you visit Los Angeles, this is the place to go. Look out for the star of your favorite musician/actor etc. Always crowded, and a lot of things to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christpost
40,Glad We Visited,"We were staying fairly close by for a trip to Universal Studios so we stopped by to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I was a bit leery at first having read others reviews here, but we enjoyed it. It is a tourist trap, but what do you expect? The street was busy with performers and characters to be photographed with ( for a small tip ) The kids enjoyed Ghirardellis Chocolates and seeing the Hollywood sign from the upper deck walkway at Loews. We also parked at the Loews garage and had our ticket validated at one of the shops. Yes, there are a few homeless people and guys trying to get you to take the bus tours of the stars homes, but don't let that dissuade you from visiting. I did not think the street was that dirty as others have mentioned - we actually saw a man polishing the metal stars on the day we were there. There was also quite a few mounted police officers patrolling the street so we felt safe as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyCampers85022
40,Look For Your Star,It is very interesting trying to trace one's favorite Star on the walk of fame. One could always enjoy coffee in one of the many cafes along the walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peter-MBS
40,Fun activity,Walking along and then all of a sudden you spot a star of someone you idolise. Cool way to keep yourself busy for a while.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauraswanderlust
50,Tourist Fun!,"The true essence of being a tourist is expressed when walking the Walk Of Fame. There are TONS of people, guys trying to get you to do tours, people in costumes, and toward the end is where you see the bums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/305kiras
40,Go early to avoid crowds,We were parked on a side street by 7am on a Friday morning. Free parking and no crowds. We had the stars to ourselves! Perfect time to go if you're not into shopping or getting harassed by street performers. We went up to the third floor of Lowe's and snapped pics of the Hollywood sign before being asked to leave by security. They were very nice and visitors are allowed on the lower level before they're open. Afterwards we took Sunset Blvd into Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive. We were fine without the shops being open because we couldn't afford anything anyway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAB_VA
40,Star Struck,"Seeing the stars for the first gives you a little bit of excitement as you start the walk. It has people and characters you all know and love. We took photo's of our favorites. It's certainly not a full pack attraction, but it's good if you are passing through that way to check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robyn_256
40,Long street,"There are loads of stars named on both sides of the street, some famous, some less so, and they seem to go for ever. The face both ways on the street making reading them difficult whilst navigating round other tourist doing the same. There are a few costumed look a likes to entertain you for photo opportunities. Good fun spotting the really famous ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bfmcm
40,One of the to do item on your bucket list,The Hollywood streets are adorned with celebrities names' embossed on the stars. Walking down the street could be a great option just looking at the names. A must do activity for the star obsessed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShabbirBaldiwala
40,Worth the walk,Spent most of the day here lots of shops on route walk up one way then walk back down the other to see all the stairs names on the side walk. Lots of people touting tickets for things to do a lots of eating and drinking places on the way too. A lot of vagrants on the streets a few were rude when you never gave them any money I would keep an eye on you valuables and kids but still worth the day out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thesaint73
30,A fun afternoon,"My husband has never seen the Walk of Fame so we made a point to stop on this trip. We really enjoyed it; even our young kids did too. The people watching alone is worth it. It was fun to see our favourite stars and take in all the sights. A couple hours was more than enough time for us. Parking was easy to find and Not Too expensive ... We could have looked to see who offered cheaper rates (we paid a flat rate of $10), but didn't want the hassle. Homeless people were everywhere but didn't give any trouble. There are lots of tour companies trying to get you to take their tours but respectful each time we said no thank you. Overall, a great way to spend a couple hours and worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anne0014
50,Hurray for Hollywood,"My guy and I love this, it is absolutely amazing to see soooooo many celebrities names on their stars and I mean sooo many. We took pictures of The legendary Bob Marley star and a host of others. Really enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/856sonial
50,Fun,"This was an interesting place to visit... Lots of action there... Expect to pay a few dollars as you go along... People are out in costume for you to take ur picture with for a tip. Some handing out music CDs etc. Of course u can ignore them and move along, but what fun is that?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariamT8994RO
40,One of those things to have to do in Hollywood,"So we got told Hollywood Blvd was run down and not worth the visit. But it's one of those things you have to see when in LA, right? It's true, I wouldn't want to spent more than an hour or so here as it is so busy, touristy and many people hassling you to go on 'tours of celebrity homes' and people dressed up in different character outfits. It is cheap and tacky, but it's a must see. It contains the famous Dolby theatre, where the Oscars are held and the Chinese theatre, where film premieres are held. It is fun to walk along the sidewalk and spot celebrity names that have some sort of meaning to you and take photos. It is one of those famous sights that you hear about in Hollywood and you have to experience yourself. If you are driving here, I recommend parking on a side street and using a metre, rather than a garage, who will rip you off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andy_d_c123
50,Walking thru History,A fun afternoon meandering thru the STARS! Lots of photo ops along the way.Scene of the Red Carpet and a glimpse of the famous Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyL781
50,First time,A mini Times Square without neon lights but people watching the same. Walk the blocks to find your favorite stars and then continue on your journey. 25 degrees a great diner open 24 hours near Roosevelt hotel. Enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharoninpositano
40,im Famous!,"Being here is such an experience, one can only see this in movies, well were here. there is no such good time to be here, its an attraction 24/7. my family walk from one end to the other.. walked like 2kms east to west on Hollywood Boulevard from Gower Street to La Brea Avenue, and north to south on Vine Street between Yucca Street and Sunset Boulevard... whew! worth all the hussle and photo ops!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/384davea
50,A lot more fun than I thought....,Stayed close to the centre of Hollywood and took to tube to the Walk of Fame. Did not expect much but I was blown away. This place is amazing and all the family had fun looking for famous stars.... Finding all the favourites was great. Seeing famous film stars and small screen stars on the Walk of Fame was reminiscing. Walking down the street is difficult for all the people crowded around taking photos and looking at all the stars. Something you must do when you go here....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoutheastStar
50,Very Entertaining,There are street entertainers every where. Great shopping and seeing the stars was fun. There are a lot of people at night so stick together.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyyoung
50,Fascinating,"We truly enjoyed walking this Hall of Fame. I do though suggest a mid-morning/early afternoon visit because as we were leaving approximately 4:00 it started getting pretty crowded. I am sure very difficult to take pics of the sidewalk and handprint areas. We also toured inside the Dolby Theater (previously Kodak). Our tour guide was very knowledgable. It was quite enjoyable to actually stand on the stage that has been walked on by many years of Actors/Actresses, American Idol artists. You are also able to view a real Oscar statue. An enjoyable afternoon for sure if you are a movie star fan. The Walk of Fame is free but the Dolby Theater is not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChefMEK
30,Reminiscent of the Vegas Strip!,"I visited the Hollywood Walk of Fame because I figured it's must do for LA. Except for the stars on the sidewalk, it reminded me a lot of the Vegas strip. It's very busy, packed with tourists and sellers constantly solicit you as you walk along. I did enjoy the overlook area available in the upper level of the mall where you can get a good view of the Hollywood sign. I took a few snapshots and was done after about an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bwongswans
50,Hollywood History in One Stop - Los Angeles,"Immerse yourself in Hollywood history with one stop. First, check out Mann's Chinese Theatre with its concrete pavements of cinema's movie star footprints and hands. Then take in the Walk of Fame for a few blocks - it's interesting for memories of the forgotten names, look for the oldest of the silver screen. Finish up with lunch at a Hollywood institution, Musso & Frank restaurant with its famous red banquettes. It's been around since 1919. - Jim Red Maps",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimL_RedMaps
10,Big disappointment,This was one big disappointment. This is simply a busy street with stars on the ground... With lots of homeless people and dealers trying to sell you tours around LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matejs
40,Exciting,"It is an exciting place to be and a must see when in LA. The blvd has almost everything and so you will spend time doing shopping, eating, sightseeing, and of course the museums. The annoying part is the beggars and those dressed as different characters hassling you for a picture or those distributing CD's and really stick around in a very annoying manner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbirViews
10,Overrated and packed with tourists,Too many people around and tourists. Its a VERY BUSY STREET and if you dont watch your things it might get stolen. Make sure you dont talk to strangers and ignore all offers or else they will follow you and try to ask money from you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicamademoiselle
40,STARS!,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is something you dont wanna miss when visiting LA but dont expect to much from it. It's fun to walk down the boulevard and look for your favorite star. You will be overwhelmed with all the companies trying to sell a touristic trip around LA which is very annoying!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizaV26
50,Famous,I had not been to this attraction in many years and it was my daughter and wife's first time. They were fascinated with all of the stars and the famous people who adore them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7808BillyD
40,Must visit,Must visit in los angeles there are more than 2000 stars on the floor to visit around there are lots of bars restaurants famos Theater s kino.... Must visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maxsF4062WU
50,Nothing special,"You can walk, watch every star, go into shops, photos with spiderman,...You will get asked several times by the tour guys to take one...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/802dimitriw
30,Cool to see the stars but...................,"Seeing all the stars along the street are pretty cool. I really didn't enjoy our experience tho due to the constant harassment by the so called ""musicians"" all up and down the street. They give out cd's for free but then ask you for donations. You do one and you will be mauled. If I ever go back the one thing I would do is get tickets to the Jimmy Kimmel show, my one regret.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dhamilton500
30,Worth a visit as it's so famous,It's a great place to wander and spit some of the star names but not worth lingering. Go to say that you've done it but it's nothing special!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarsywarsy
40,Very busy street with lot of excitement.,"Lot of activities on the area including theatres, Chinese theatre, chocolate shops, starline trips to hollywood sign and Beverly hills. You will find a lot of famous movie characters dressed up people like spiderman, batman, Mickey mouse and lot more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hridayav
30,Star trek,"The hollywood walk of fame runs along hollywood boulevard. One steps out of hollywood/highland stn and is directly on the walk of fame. One mixes with other enthusiasts to search the stars of ones choice. There are 4500 to whet your appetite. Film/TV/Music/Theatre are the categories. There is Chaplin, and there is Lopez:the old and new are well mixed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajeetn2015
50,You can spend a long time here,Its neat to walk around and see all the different stars. You could spend A LONG time just wandering around and looking to see whose name you spot. We went there 2 days in a row and just wandered around -- took to many photos of side walk stars to want to mention!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterR942
30,What I expected,"What I expected, but too busy to take pics I wanted and crazy lame characters everywhere in your face. Wish it could be somehow set up so you walk on sides and middle open for viewing/pics etc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cocomolsen
30,Walk of fame,"This attraction goes on for blocks. There is no way you will see everything in one visit, unless you plan a day of just the walk of fame. There's lots of shops on the walk and plenty of places to eat, shop, party and see a show. At night you will see lots of activity and people it was bustling and exciting to see so much going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharya2014
20,Hollywood Walk of Shame,"The sidewalks are packed with people from out of town, average street performers who look bored and tired, Hollywood rejects in dirty looking superhero costumes, who will get pushy for cash if you get suckered into taking a picture, overly aggressive salesmen wanting you to buy a tour. There are a couple of pricey museums and Disney's overpriced movie theater and cheap T-shirt/souvenir shops.It's slightly scary and gets boring quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jetset3008
50,very cool to see,I always look forward to seeing the interesting people performing and wandering around plus notice new things each time i go. A must see for anyone..if you take an item from anyone make sure you are prepared to tip them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaunaR261
20,So disappointed.,"We lent a few hours there and nothing really was as I imagine. The stars on the pavement are damaged and not well maintained. The street is the same as everywhere in the us, same kind of shops and full of tourist . Some people dressed celebrity movie stars tries to get tip from you in exchange of a tip. Not impressed at all?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paternos
40,A place that signifies you're in Hollywood,"Well before coming to L.A this was like the thing I wanted to visit the most, curz when people talk about Hollywood the first thing come out of the mind is the Walk of Fame. But I mean, a one time visit is more than enough, since it's basically stars on the ground with celebrities' names one it...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winnie9r
50,Amazing to see all the stars,I enjoyed every minute walking along the walk but i also found that the people watching was great you can lie down next to stars and take selfies u can take pictures for other tourists they can take pictures for you. Some of the stars blow your mind some you may not know but either way it's worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ruttykids
30,It's a pushy busy area,"On a recent trip to LA I did take in the Hollywood Walk of Fame. And of course, I did it because it's one of those things you do while in LA. And it was underwhelming to say the least. It was super busy and very pushy. People were peddling goods and services at almost every star. While it was cool to see and I was able to remember some of the great ones who are no longer with us, overall it wasn't a great experience. That being said, you probably should see it once and then never have to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nate080411
50,A Must Visit,"This is really fun--seeing all the celebrities we have watched and listened to, honored in such a permanent, yet accessable way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithp867
50,LOL,I had a great fun in the walk of fame.... the Hollywood Boulevard is so long and there are many things to do and see from souvenirs stores to shopping malls and wax museum. I love it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gris573
40,Hollywood Stars,It was a dream come true for me to go to Hollywood and see this specific street as it contains the names of stars and hands/feet prints of the stars. It's a little crowded but worth the walk. Many wannabes walk the street too handling their demo/CD to people to listen to while others dress up as famous movie characters to feature in pictures.. a lot of shops and brands are on the street too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SultanaBeirut
30,Nice to see it,It's nice to see it. Lots of the names you know. Mind you don't walk into people while looking down 👍 a nice walk. Bring your camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michaeltmbyrne
30,A MUST WALK IF YOU ARE IN THE AREA,"This is the all time search and find. If you don't know where your favorite stars name is, you need to find it.Try to see how many names you recognize.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deb4life
30,It's ok... but not something unforgettable...,"It's nice to see the stars and recognize the names, but after a while you just get tired of them. The neighborhood is ok and has lots of things going on. There are tons of people wearing customs and trying to earn money by having pictures with them. Some of them could be annoying trying to pursue their end. The block where the Chinese theatre and the Dolby theatre are is kind of messy and lots of strange characters going around. Not my favorite place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlisdm
30,"A secondary activity at best - far from a ""must see"" thing to do","The WOF is iconic given its long-time popularity and frequent mention on TV shows. But aside from the sidewalk's stars and the wide variety of names appearing on those stars, the WOF is just. a. sidewalk. Nothing more, nothing less. Walking along the WOF might be best enjoyed when combined with visiting one of the many places located along it, most notably Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Madame Tussauds, and/or Ripley's Believe It or Not.Parents need to be aware of the fact a LOT of shady characters hang out on Hollywood Blvd - beggers, homeless, indigents, and most notably the costumed characters and wanna-be rappers and artists trying to pawn off their CDs. If you remember nothing else when visiting Hollywood Blvd, remember this: 1) posing for pictures with costumed characters means being expected to give a ""donation"" - if you stiff a character after getting a photo with them, many of them will get unruly and badger you like crazy. 2) countless people carrying CDs and pamphlets will try to hand them to you - DO NOT TAKE THEM! Don't feel like you're being rude for not 'accepting' them when they try to hand them to you - they're the ones being rude by stepping in front of you and sticking them in your face. Taking a CD or pamphlet opens the door for them to give you their life story and solicit you for money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divisiblebyzero
40,Always entertaining,"Love the walk thru all the stars name. It really is a piece of conversation to look forward to. Lots of people to encounter. Plenty of tourist and locals mixed in with Police Officers, it really is pretty safe and lots to see and do. This is always a stop for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pparmen
50,Anniversary,Just a cool place to walk up and down the street and see celebrities Stars handprints footprints a must-do when you're in California you'll have fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karennewland1
30,Seeing Stars,"Anyone that is not from Southern California wants to visit and see movie stars so they request to be taken to ""Hollywood"". Visiting the Hollywood Walk of Fame, you will see stars alright. They are literally on the sidewalk as you walk over them. Lol. Most stars live and play all over Southern California. You may see them in malls, grocery stores etc. Some are not recognizable. But if you are in this area, you can see and do some fun things like people watch because there are some very interesting characters out there! If they are having a star ceremony, you can watch. Just go to their website walkoffame.com to find out who will be getting a star on your visit. Like we tell our friends and family, stars don't hang out in Hollywood but it's fun to walk and see the stars... on the sidewalks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Earley4
20,Too much drama,"I loved going to the Chinese theatre and seeing the stars and cement hands and feet. They even have an app you can use to let you know more about each star which I thought was awesome.however there are a lot of pushy people in costumes ( I mean things I could buy at Walmart for Halloween) trying to take photos with us and demanding payment after they jump into our photos and also people trying to sell us their personal CDs and getting in our faces to buy them.Also there are some tour companies with very aggressive people working for them and they were getting in our faces and getting into our personal space. For the most part these people don't take no for an answer, one actually put their hands on my husband to stop him and we almost got into an altercation.All in all this would be a great place to see if these people were better managed, maybe they should require permits to be there and licensed through the city...this is how other cities deal with these issues and it works out a lot better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/675kimberleyb
50,and its FREE !,"well, 15 bucks for the day to park in a nearby lot. I must have taken 20 pix of famous stars, directors, singers etc as we walked down Hollywood Blvd. It goes until GRahams Chinese Theatre and continues on, and its on both sides of the Blvd. Lot of fun to see the stars' names, old and new. Bring an umbrella if rain is forecast but it should still be fun. As an aside it never rained on us in 12 days...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artj377
40,Eye opener,"It was an eye opener, people everywhere but it was great. Found the stars we were looking for and visited a few shops. Seeing Spider-Man pushing a tourist to the ground for getting up in his face was a bit weird but hey, Americans are a little weird anyway... Right?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sack0001
50,We saw so many actors and singers that have passed away in those stars. It was like seeing them do it.,There are so many stars and look alike artist on the whole street. It was really fun. You have to check out all the really great stores to get souvenirs. Unique ones that will make your friends and family really happy.\,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/331CarolB
50,Good place to kill time,"Really nice to check this place off of my L.A. sites to visit. But I guess I expected more, it was just ok. Mostly overcrowded streets and poor parking availability. It was cool to see the ""stars"" and took advantage of a cheap souvenir shop next to the wax museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IreneA246
30,Say no to CD's,"Some people on the strip are disgusting !My Boyfriend and I were stopped early one morning by a young gentlemen. Who aggressively put a CD in my partners and I face. Because him and I were scared we talked to these two guys, who asked our names and put it on a CD then when i went to walk away from him he asked me for a tip. and i said no, my partner gave the guy he was talking too $2 then the gentlemen who was talking to me snatched the CD back off me and walked away.Just be aware if you are taking young children with you.and if any problems there are police around, talk to them or any staff members in shops. They are really helpful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/courtneyannelliott96
40,Have to see once,I got to see the section were they filmed Pretty Woman. Nice to see at least once. Lots to do in this section of town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianef721
40,Important attraction,"This is an important attraction in hollywood blvd. However, some areas are not that well maintained. It is also hard to locate the stars that you are looking for, I wonder if there is some guide somewhere?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hok9
30,reminds me of NYC,"This was on my daughter's list of to do places while in California for a family wedding. It was very crowded on a Thursday late afternoon and after paying $20.00 to park we walked across the street to Grauman's Chinese theater. We did see some stars and got a few pics but it is very dirty, busy and crowded with homeless, hawkers and such. There are folks dressed up in character outfits but beware they expect a tip if you take a picture with them. We didn't have time to do any of the bus tours but be advised that you can haggle on the price. All in all I'm glad we went but certainly not what it appears on TV",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuneA241
30,Granddaughter first view of America,"Loved seeing the stars on the pavement,pity they were mared by street people sleeping on the buildings and benches with trolleys and bedding.Pity they don't look as shiny as in the picture also.Very disappointed and this was the 2nd time we had been there over the years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puhoidreamer
40,visit to la,we went on a tour to this and only got about 50 mins on this street but would say be wary as it is very busy and there is a lot of people wanting to get picture taken with you in a costume it will cost you about 15 dollers and if they think that you have taken a quick picture and tghey spot you they will hound you for the money . it is well worth a walk down this street just to see all the names on the stars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frenchyglasgow
50,Fun walk.,"My son and I traversed the Hollywood Walk of Fame during some rare down time at the 2016 TCM Classic Film Festival. He took a ton of pictures with his phone, of his favorite old time movie stars. I didn't think he had enough space for all the pictures he took, but he knows better than I do. If you want the location of a specific star, go to the website, walkoffame.com.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adambomb1701
30,Slightly above average,"I cam specifically to see the New Kids on the Block star. I'm a major Blockhead. Fortunately, that one was easy to find and in an area that isn't too crowded. Overall, the walk is a big touristy area full of aggressive tour operators. Now that I've been, I'm cool with never going again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimohkee
50,Great place to visit,"The Hollywood walk is a great place to visit. Yes it is extremely busy, but you can get photos in as people move for you and it is fun seeing how many you do know. Oops and characters too. People were dressed in costumes of Disney characters and other famous stars. A great feel good place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhondae680
50,Getaway Weekend,"I loved this part of my trip in LA. Being able to see the stars of entertainers, actors and actresses I grew up watching. Bright city lights at night with local people in the area entertaining, lots of shopping and sightseeing to do in this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elzieh
20,Not so glamorous hollywood,"Amazed when we arrived at how much this place looked like a garbage dump. Not glamorous as you would expect "" Hollywood walk of fame"" was very disappointed in this area. You have Madame Tusards, Chinese theatre, shops, restraunts bars but not a lot. It was not what I had imagined that's for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P7570QZanitag
40,Didn't have time to dance on all the stars!,"This was on my list of top 3 things to see before leaving. My daughter and I had just had ice cream and since we were waiting for a live art showing to begin, she decided to take me for a stroll down the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I was able to get a few great photos which I will further treasure ... It was so exciting to see names like Count Basie, Richard Pryor, Lucille Ball and others..... I'm still smiling just thinking about that experience.... Giggling like a kid searching for the names. Be sure to take a stroll while there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_MsBrendaGale
40,Pretty Cool,"I went to the Walk of Fame on 5-13-2016. It was pretty cool to see the stars up close and personal. It was a lot of traffic but was to be expected. The location had a lot of shopping and restaurants, it also had street entertainment to keep everyone interested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeDee700

30,Cool place to see once or twice,We visited here on the last night of our trip to Los Angeles. My wife and I have been there before. But this is the first time we've been there with our kids. Lots of weirdos on Hollywood Boulevard.Hollywood and Highland has some nice restaurants. Wanted to visit the wax museum but did not have enough time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dalep524

50,Fab!,I didn't quite know what to expect with the walk of fame and how it would be lol was surprised it's actually the full length more or less of the sunset bullevard strip we stopped so much and seen so many stars but there was also 1000s I'm sure we missed lol but still amazing all the same! Was funny to see even Micky mouse and Donald Duck and bugs bunny were among them 😂,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whitie84
20,Exactly what you'd expect,"I personally don't like the ""touristy"" spots. I.e I'm not a fan of Times Square type spots. Too cheesy and too crowded for my preference. That being said, I felt I still needed to make the trek to the walk of fame just to say I saw it. It's definitely cool to see the stars although I would just go straight to the Theater and see the hand prints. Just be prepared for tons of tourists, street performers and people trying to get you to go on tours. It's good to see - but you don't need to spend more than an hour or so. The Dolby theater is worth a look though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peaches912
20,Bit disappointed by reality v/s expectation!,We had expectation of nice walk with lots of activities around the street but in reality found the entire walk a bit dull and lacking activities. Majority of places had sellers selling open bus tour to celebrity homes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/243paragn

Also quite of few ""rap"" artist trying to get you to listen to their ""cd"" and asking (pressuring you to buy for a donation ) if you say ""no thanks"" they got kinda rude. Lots of stuff to see if you can get to it. Parking is VERY expensive $17.50 for 1 1/2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JodieC25
40,Lots of stars,After hearing about it and seeing on tv for years I was surprised how many stars there actually are. Much more than I anticipated and lots of them I didn't know. Very fun to see and walk around looking for names. A part of history and neat area to walk up and down. Touristy and vendors can get annoying but it was expected. Plenty of street parking at meters if you don't mind walking a little further. Have a feeling it's crowded most the time but we had no issues getting around. Plenty of gift shops and places to eat as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banny9949
30,Our Anniversary,"Not too safe late at night....daytime is best to visit..great shopping, and nice restaurants. You can see the Hollywood sign in the distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/803tiffanyg
30,Interesting,"Knowing the stars were bought takes the interest away a bit. Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Bob Hope, and Bing Crosby were the only ones I noticed with duplicate stars but left me wondering.... Anyways I now have pictures of stars in my collection too. I feel no closer to anyone famous or better because of the experience. I'm not sure how I could recommend to any other traveler this is a must-see attraction for other than bragging rights. I was a female traveler alone... it is safe, no worries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyM795
20,Not as expected,"Dirty and dingy, not what I expected from ""Hollywood"". Maybe LA can learn from Vegas and keep things clean for the tourists so that they'll want to return. Waste of time in my opinion",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jewelz1976
40,Fun!,Hollywood Boulevard and the Walk of Fame are a really cool experience! Just stroll around and check out all of the shops and touristy stuff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/450clairev
30,Good to see but not to hang around,It's certainly on the list of must sees in LA but it is in an area without much else going on (except the usual tourist places).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahtM3053GR
30,Nothing special,"We had been here as a part of our weekend outing and I am glad we did not go out of our way to get here as there is absolutely nothing special about this. We had dinner plans so just to kill our time we were here. Loads of souvenir shops, crowded streets and very little to actually do! We got too tired after walking so much.We felt it was just hyped too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ritvik16
30,intersting 7 touristy,This is a must when visiting LA for the first time. Yes it is very touristy but the strip is fun for a days adventure,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MuscleDog
50,We even found our own stsr !,Went with my son Lee on a sunny Sunday morning and had a fine time spotting the famous names including one with Anna Lee on it. Since Anna is my nickname it was quite a find. Went from there to the Hollywood farmers Market which doubled our enjoyment of the day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer803637
40,Fun!,"This area is fun to walk up and down to check out the stars along the walk of fame. Only downside is you get bothered by the guys who try shove a cd into your hand every few metres. There are also a lot of people dressed in character, some better than others. It's quieter in the mornings if you're not into big crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Larvan
30,I wouldn't go out of my way...,"....it was fun to see, and talk about the various celebs' music, movies, etc. We were there on a Sunday and it was really crowded!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TG192
30,Tourist trap,It is a tourist trap but a must do. I got out of the car for a few minutes and it was enough but I'm glad I did. I live near Orlando and I've been to Times Square...same vibe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693erint
50,Too crowded,"Was crazy around there (Sunday). Too crowded, hard to find the names, hard to stop and also take pictures. I really don't like to spend to much time with things like that. Just make a quick visit, find your star take a picture and go to another and better place to spend your time. You can find good souvenirs, food, hats etc. Is the best part.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissasN9025LT
30,Beautiful footpath,It's a nice experience to walk and have photos on this road but many people are doing the same. One name which we searched was found on a wall.It's worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohammadi2014
50,FUN,We enjoyed all the performers as we strolled along looking at all the stars! The performers were very talented and loved to talk to us!! Fun evening!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hauk66
30,"Intriguing, but not pleasant","The walk of fame has to be done. And, we walked miles and miles over it going to and from places during our 5-day stay. You keep reading the names and keep finding new ones. It's addicting. But, between the homeless people wandering the sidewalks, ambling tourists and the fake characters trying to make money for photos....it gets to be a bit much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anntravelsalot
40,First time to LA,The walk of fame was ok. It is definitely a must see but nothing spectacular. Lots.of shops but they are basically smoke and gift shops. Very crowded so it makes it hard to see the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/racheleh423
30,Average indeed...,Very average with standard smoke shops and crap Tshirt shops... So many homeless here in America quite unbelievable..... Nice to see the stars and the concrete hand prints of stars gone by but that's it really 5mins I was done,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snapiesworld
30,"Long, long walk... with your head down!","Stars, stars and more stars, we walked a bit and then a bit more. Took a few pictures, been there, seen it, done it! Next ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clarao135
30,In a run down area,It's a shame that a 'must do' is in such a grotty area. You'll get high as you walk down the street from everyone smoking weed. Tacky horrible shops...just grim!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xm12x
30,Interesting,Finally made it to Hollywood Blvd to see the stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Very interesting. Heard so much about the stars getting their star....happy to actually see it up close.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenNoel23
30,They're just stars on the sidewalk,"In advance of our trip, we were anxious to find certain stars for certain celebrities, but after you walk the area for a while, they just start to blend in and aren't that special since there are SO many stars. Sure, it's nice to see a star of a favorite celebrity, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see them all or find dozens of stars. The area where most of them are located is a very busy, touristy area so there's plenty going on around you the whole time. A typical tourist trip to Hollywood has to include some time to see the stars here. I'm just saying don't spend too much time hunting a ton of them down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssy24
50,Such a famous attraction,"This attraction was thrilling for me, to see these famous peoples stars. Loved every minute of it.I can now say ""I've been there!""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suedan30928
30,Walk along the pavement/sidewalk,The stars on the pavement are interesting and the area is buy and lively. Looks to see and do. Only spoil it by people trying to sell bus tours and the unfortunate homeless people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gordonh267
50,Long Walk both sides,"Ok so me and the wife walked up and down and had an absolute blast, so many characters and i don't just mean the ones dressed up there is loads of side shops places to stop and look be warned you will be asked a bunch of time if you would like to take a tour of one thing or another and by all means take one or two you'll have fun. if you have paid for parking i would suggest taking one if you want to see the hollywood sign and a few other treats...would i return...yes with family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lee_jamie_hill
40,Better than I expected! A lot to see and enjoy for all ages!,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this experience. The weather was beautiful and the crowd was pleasant and we did not experience any negative issues. We strolled the Hollywood Walk of Fame on a Friday evening from approximately 4 pm-6 pm. There is something to entertain everyone and for all ages. Throughout the walk there are numerous celebrity look-a-likes who are not to invasive Of your tourism--that is most allow you to photograph them individually or with you and it is totally optional for you to tip them or not... There are also numerous street performers who song, dance,etc and even a young girls dance troop while we were there. There are a lot of souvenir shops with reasonably priced items, some very nice and some quite cheesy/touristy. But all and all fun and safe. I was surprised by how clean the streets were and there was not a large presence of homeless or panhandlers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amelulu
30,Make a quick visit,Visited this place just to do something touristy. Pretty much the stars on the floor for several blocks. It gets boring quickly. Street shows were average and the performers looked bored and tired. The only excitement came from a bunch ofpeople preparing to go in to see jimmy kimmel live.Watch out for the Scientology folk trying to lure you into their building along the walk. We walked past them not knowing who they were when a group of very well dressed and well spoken youngsters came by with flyers offering a free session to find the solution to all your problems. They were very good at drawing us in until I took a step back to see where we were going and saw that it was the church of scientology. Backed out immediately and politely declined. Persuasion never stops. 2 hours later we passed by once again and this time a totally different topic was displayed by the youngsters who started to draw the people in to their building. Beware of their propoganda unless you like it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/173samj
40,Don't forget to look where you are going.,The Walk is very interesting and it is fun finding the Stars of those you like. Just be sure to look up once in awhile so you don't run into others who have stopped to take pictures. Great place to people watch as well with street performers also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kyleandrene
40,Worth a visit if in LA,"Very worth seeing if visiting. Difficult to take photos as always very crowded, but possible if patient enough. Great array of stars in the walk of fame, can he a challenge to find the ones you are looking for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndySmith1967
50,The stars are all lined up.,"Great day for a casual stroll up Hollywood Blvd, pointing out all the stars names on the pavement from the past to the present and naming what movies they started in.Being a fan of classic movies I couldn't believe the amount of actors names etched into the sidewalk.Great to see that can never be forgotten for their talented works.The Blvd is full of great shopping from vintage clothing to the latest street and cool wares, variety of food and coffee est and bars.All different walks of life passing you by, felt very safe to walk and discover.It's a must whilst in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholasg72
30,Missable,"Hollywood is NOTHING that's it's made out to be in movies or tv shows. It's dirty, chaotic and Filled with all the diversity and eccentric people this city has to offer. Don't expect fancy cars, brushes with celebrities or swanky clubs. Rather Hollywood Blvd is a cluster of tourist trap shops, street performers, tattoo parlors, bars, etc. it's an adventure, and maybe even exciting, but locals past the age of 30 now know how to avoid it and target their destination a block or so away.There are decent and fun restaurants and bars, but be patient as after dark you'll be contending with popped collars and 10"" skirts. Try the side streets, really better (less) crowd and more manageable wait times at restaurants.I recommend taking the metro. Finding parking can be killer enough to ruin an evening. AND wear comfortable shoes if you're walking around. The streets are dirty and long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CignoNero
50,Loved seeing so many names!,"Loved seeing so many names! Recommend this to everyone, this is ideal for friends and families with young children and teens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmae682
40,Walking along the walk of fame,"We wanted to visit the walk of fame to see what it was really like. Finding somewhere to park close by was the biggest challenge, so avoid driving there and stop off if you are on a bus tour, as it would be easier.Great to see all the stars and the Chinese theatre. Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Off_down_under
40,A classic Hollywood attraction accessible any time of day,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is probably one of the best-known and most frequently visited attractions in Hollywood, alongside Grauman's Chinese Theatre (now known as TLC Chinese Theatre). I remember first visiting this site in 1998 on a pricey tourist bus tour. But I recommend you go there on foot or by metro. The L.A. metro has a very convenient stop at Hollywood Blvd and Vine. This attraction is good for about a half hour visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcduncan2001
10,Gotta have a reason to do this...,No reason to do this unless:1) Going to a show2) tourist3)ya got family somewhere embedded in the sidewalk4) eating at musso and franks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
20,Not impressed.,I came through the area not knowing what to expect. I wasn't all that impressed. The entire thing felt more of a tourist trap. It was nice to see the hand prints in front of the Chinese theater. Otherwise it's not all the impressive. The added eccentrics in the area seem to be more of a pester then anything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juice_22
40,Who was that?,"I'm an Aussie, I don't really understand the American obsessions with celebrity. Most of these people I'd never heard of. I think the ""Walk of Fame"" is a bit daggy, or as the Americans say, cheesy. Even so, I did enjoy it, it's fun finding the names of the old timers, who put the ""tinsel"" in ""Tinseltown",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/619jeffry
40,A good little walk,This walk is worth a go if you have a spare afternoon. It's a good long walk and takes quite a while if you read all the stars.It's a good walk though and takes you down the main Street with the Chinese cinema and Dolby theatre.Worth a walk for some photos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glenc360
10,Checked the box & never again,"It is dirty, crowded and not anything I need to experience again. The stars aren't even that interesting. Most of them are cracked or missing tiles - poor upkeep and crappy. The street is full of shops selling tourist crap and bad food and guys trying to sell you a seat on their sightseeing bus. Is it even a big deal for a new actor to get a star? Do they give new actors stars? Not sure - didn't see any stars for up and coming actors. Checked the box & I will never go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ctaylor0159
30,Something to see at least once,"My husband and I enjoyed a wander up and down Hollywood Boulevard looking at the various names on the Walk of Fame stars. Our 3 year old enjoyed riding on daddy's shoulder and looking around for a while.Nothing to write home about but worth experiencing at least once, and you can check out other tourist spots like El Capitan and the Chinese Theatre. Plus lots of Hollywood tours can be picked up from there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonnieHall82
50,When stars are found on ground,If you are in LA and have actually watched any Hollywood movies then definitely this place is worth a visit. It's almost 3.5 miles and names of 2500+ written. Spot your stars!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/910pratikk
40,Have fun locating your favorite Star on the Walk of Fame,"There are a lot of celebrity stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Don't be disappointed when you find Marilyn Monroe's star in front of McDonalds. I think the city could do a better job of keeping the sidewalks cleaner. However, I still enjoyed discovering stars of people who I had no idea had a star on the Walk of Fame. Be sure to have your picture take with your favorite. I advise going very early in the morning before all of the people start congregating and blocking your views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindilou
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"Loved walking down the Hollywood Blvd just soaking in the culture! What an amazing experience. The locals are friendly. Loved finding my favorite ""star""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnrC9996QF
30,TripAdvisor advice was good,"I read a few reviews that said that all you needed was to do this once, and after I read that it only takes 30 minutes, I was sold. It's a little chaotic and hard to look down and walk sometimes with the crowds, but indeed worth doing once. With stars on both sides of several streets, we didn't see them all, but checked off the bucket list ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanbE2584JQ
20,"Interesting place, doubt I'd go again!","My son and I stayed near the walk of fame on recent trip to USA so we had to walk through it quite a bit to get to metro etc. This was our first trip to America and I must say I was a bit nervous and this place did nothing to relieve those fears. The walk of fame area is pretty grotty and now I have seen it don't think I would go back. Walked down there about 9am one morning, not as crowded but harassed by the cd sellers. My son had one in his hand before he knew it and of course the person that gave it to him wouldn't take it back. The previous day we had been on a tour and the guide advised us if they won't take it back to place it on the ground and keep walking. I did just this and got called an unpleasant name and before I knew it my son had another one in his hand! This person followed us for a while but took cd back. The whole experience spoilt our time there and we didn't get to see stars that we wanted to see due to not wanting to be harassed! Saw many people being conned by these people. Would be great if the area was cleaned up a bit. I am not sure what I expected it to be like but was disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4janineh
20,"Check it off the list, and get out.","Super crowded. The sidewalks are packed with people. Quite a few street performers and others in superhero costumes. Fun for kids to see. The costumed folk will be more than happy to pose and take pictures with you or your kids. However, this is what they consider to be their job, so afterwards they'll get pushy for cash. If you feel it's a must see, I'd recommend free parking yourself a couple of blocks south of the Chinese Theatre on Orange Drive. Walk straight up to the Theatre, see some stars on the walk, get a few pics, take in the scene, and get out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CobraKy
10,"No good. Too crowded, too ugly, too nasty","It kills me to share my thoughts yet they are true. If you decide to look at the Hollywood Stars, insure it is early am or else you are besieged with homeless people, pickpockets and general low life individuals. Hold onto your wallet",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MusicFlyer
30,Its Free,"Its free, its interesting to see who has gone to the trouble of applying for and paying for their star. Most people don't realise that celebrities pay for their stars.Its crowded as its a prime tourist location. If your in the area yes but certainly would not recommend anyone goes out of their way to see this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rdnkh
50,A walk to walk!,"I admit. I wanted to wear something a little nicer than my regular tom boy look. So of course I had to wear heals for this adventure. Do not do so unless you don't plan on walking far lol. Which would defeat the whole purpose. Besides the stars to check out, there are shops, restaurants, museums, theaters, and more! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolehA5686RN
30,Interesting,"The walk of fame was interesting to move along and see who had been recognised, but it did not really capture my attention like the Chinese Theatres which you will find along the way. That said - been there, done that - got the photo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/580janc
30,"It's fine, just fine.","To see the whole walk of fame you would need to walk a mile in either direction, it's worth seeing but I wouldn't get too excited about it. Save yourself some time and just go straight to the Chinese theatre to see the celebrities who have their hand prints on the payment. There are alot of tourist traps and over priced souvenirs on the walk of fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justing272
40,Busy but fun,"Every step of Hollywood Boulevard & Vine Street is packed with stars on the walk of fame.One of the busiest places to visit but you can easily do it within a day & along the way stop for a bite to eat in one of the many eateries dotted along the way.Also, there are historic places of interest which are pointed out by signs outside so a history lesson whilst trying to seek out your favourite stars.Not everyone has a star due to the fact they cost approx. $3000 & usually it's fan clubs or family who purchase one in recognition so don't be disappointed if you don't find who you are looking for.Lots of other attractions on Hollywood Boulevard & street performers.We felt pretty safe both during the day & at night. All in all a fun day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunkyAfro1974
40,What you'd expect,"Pretty much what you'd expect. I recommend parking in the mall that has the Chinese and Dolby theater. If you buy a pretzel or anything in it, parking is $2 for 2 hours and it's right off the Walk. Expect homeless and people in costumes trying to make a buck off you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danarchist
30,Very fun - commercial side of LA,"If you're into the typical tourist visits this one is a MUST. The Courtyard is the best part- nice shopping stores with all kinds of product, from sports to footwear and fancy clothes.The views are very nice. Mini vegas vibe. The rest is the walk of fame, hand prints of celebs as well, little boutique shops.Go during the day, as it doesn't seem very safe at night. Lots of homeless so be careful as a tourist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinarodriguez29

10,What a dump!!!!!,"Don't bother. Homeless, crazed people in cheap costumes, unkept stars in the street and crowds. Jimmy Kimmy is right, this place sucks. If you come to this area, have a specific destination in mind that is NOT the walk of fame. And bring anti-biopics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F8233INscottc
20,Need to maintain it well,"This place has so much history, connected with so many super duper stars, could have been really amazing place..... But to my utter disappointment the paveway was so dirty... yacks!! It's a shame when you see Stars for Michael Jackson, or Elton John, yet you cannot read their names, cause it's stinking dirty... People dressed as different popular characters, and robbing people for taking pictures with them.... I was thoroughly disappointed!LA City council should consider cleaning the paveways at least once a week, shouldn't cost that much... Cmon, take some pride on your heritage and maintain it!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MithilaNepal

30,It's a must,When you are in Los Angeles it's a must see. We walked back and forth in the main area which is a walk for 4 miles.

30,Random assortment of stars,"This is an unusual attraction in that you spend all your time staring at the sidewalk below you. There is no rhyme or reason to the arrangement or ""stature"" in Hollywood culture. You will see people's names you recognize immediately next to someone you never heard of. Interesting, but watch out where you are walking since you aren't looking ahead! Goes for miles, as long as you want to walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexWorldTraveler

40,Nice but some idiots ruin it,"Had to go here and cross off my bucket list. We went on vacation and stopped by the walk of fame. It is easy to find parking, I had no problem there.It was neat to walk and see all the names on the stars. Of course we were the tourists and took lots of pictures. You can see the famous Hollywood sign as well off in the distance. Lots of shops to buy stuff and many places to eat.The bad, idiots that walk around and ruin it for you. The day we went, there were a bunch of wanna be singers or rap artists who hand you a CD. They say, here you go and then demand money. We would just walk by and ignore them, but a lot of people didn't. It was almost like they were bullied to buy the CD. That upset me. They act like they are handing out free products only to demand money.The next person that needs to go was the Jesus man. He had a loud sound system on the walk of fame, I am talking huge sound system and he is screaming about finding Jesus. Now, I am all in favor of our freedoms, but I don't need to hear someone constantly screaming in a loud sound system about how I need to find Jesus. Again, not the time or place.All in all, glad we went and it was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WG98
30,Wish the city would clean it up,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a must see for many people visiting LA. I actually like the walk of fame but it desperately needs some cleaning up! The streets smell like urine, it is unbearable! I was unable to eat anything in that area because of the smell. There are far too many homeless people there. All in all, it's a must see but it's also gotten very tacky. It would be great if the city cleaned this area up! Don't visit at night! We visited during the day and I still kept my purse close to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aka6245
30,You forget they are there,"I know the walk of fame is a massive must, but if you dont have time, cross it off the list. Don't get me wrong it is cool to see but after a while you forget they are there.Once you get to the centre of the blvd you will have a much better time! With shops and restaurants and street performers its the best bit of the walk!BE AWARE- you will be pested for tours walking along the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965isaach
20,"Dirty, noisy and crowded.","It was almost impossible to see the stars on the pavement for all the people walking by. Also, the traffic noise was extremely loud, and we were constantly approached by people on the street, trying to sell us homemade CDs. Very annoying. The pavement was filthy, and the surroundings were not very nice. Worn-down buildings, beggars on the street and noise everywhere. We frankly did not feel very comfortable walking there at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelGorm
30,Look Up and See the Sites,"Hollywood Walk of Fame is alright. It is nothing to gawk at. This is just another spot to attract tourist. There is really nothing special about it. It is actually very annoying. Everyone is looking down at the stars and not paying attention to where they are walking. I cannot lie, I also did this at times. The best stars were Lassie and Kermit the Frog. This is a good activity for first time LA visits, otherwise you are not missing much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/754dianeh
20,It's neat I guess,It's awesome because it's Hollywood and there's no place quite like it. However we found that over Memorial Day weekend (on a Sunday) that walking down the sidewalk was almost unbearable. We were pushing a stroller and it was about 100 degrees outside.I'm glad we went it's definitely a do it once and mark it off your list. We have ZERO regrets but plan other things in the area especially if you have small kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahmomofmany

50,Stars under your feet,"Going into Hollywood and seeing and the stars dedicated to the famous in the film, television, and music industries is a thrill. Names from the early silent films through current heart throbs. Something everyone should see at least one time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VCG-47

30,Something to do if you want to kill some time...,"The strip itself is overrated and dirty. It's cool to see each celebrities star, but aside from that there isn't much but tourist traps. A few restaurants in the nearby area, would definitely recommend 25 Degrees, great burgers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karinabay22

20,It's ok.,"The area is really dirty with homeless people roaming around all day. It was nice to see some of the stars, but it got boring after awhile.

40,Out on the walk of fame,"Had a blast looking for all the stars on the walk of fame! Interesting characters on the streets to say the least! I wouldn't go out too late at night, it gets a bit shady and the people tend to prey on tourists. At any rate we had a blast! We did the tour bus, it was fun to see the stars homes! Check out the sweets candy shop, the Chinese theatre and the wax museum, it's worth it!Be safe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeRouxcrewCDN
30,"You sort of ""have"" to do it!","How can you not? Yes, it's dirty, there are homeless everywhere, but it's fun to see in person, visit the Chinese theater. Even my sister who was very adamant about not going ended up having fun being a tourist for an hour. We didn't do any of the tours, but just wandered a bit, took a few photos. Worth a short stop and a good place to get some cheap souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenMcG_09
20,Disappointing,"Expected clean shiny surroundings, walk a few hundred yards following the stars on the sidewalk and you feel like your in an uncomfortable ghetto. What a shame it certainly doesn't live up to what you see on Tv, but it's something you need to do, open top bus is a good way to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sampY6937LW
50,Exciting...,"Hi guys, the Walk of Fame is one of the thing I think you can't miss in LA..the Hollywood district in general is nothing special but when you walk on that stars with the names of your favourite actors and actress in my opinion it had been exciting..walk around and enjoy to be part of the global top jet set for a moment... :-))))))))",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FabriGra

50,Interesting!,"Traveled with my 16 year old daughter and her friend, they enjoyed this stop immensely. We did a late supper at Mels Diner which was delicious old fashioned food before we traveled down the Blvd. and took pictures of all our favourite stars. We did it at about 11pm but felt safe and found it empty except for the line ups to get into the clubs, but all and all we were left on our own which was nice. Was a must see that didn't take up a full day and because it was so late most shops were closed which was kind of a bummer because I would like to have browsed, the window displays were interesting. There were plenty of neat attractions and sites even at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessica499
20,Better on internet then in petsonl,Needs cleaned and updated. What a let down. Its not maintained to the standards the movies stars deserve. Its filled with druggie and abusive move charterers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/507DonaldP
40,Nice touristy area,Stopped off here while in the area on a tour. It was great to see all the handprints of the stars. We went during the week so it wasn't as busy as I've heard it gets on the weekend. It's a must do and doesn't take long to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYC2VA13
50,Enjoyed!!,My friend and I went for a city tour in LA and got a time to spent here. We only got limited time so we had to hurry. Tho the place is very lovely. Every corner they have a souvenir shops. Anywhere you can see people in costume performing. The best way to go here is from the afternoon till evening. Gave at least 8-10hrs to explore the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimt327

30,A tourist trap: Here is why,"I've been here before around 10am and this is probably the best time to come because when I went this time around at 2pm it was packed with tourists and characters from every movie. The Michael Jackson impersonator looks so much like the real person that it was freaky.What to do here?Walk. Shop. Look at buildings.The stars are on the floor, everyone are stepping over them and yet tourists lay on the floor to take pictures with their star.There are so many places to shop, cheap places to get souvenirs! A $5 store!Next to the Dolby Theater there a big mall Hollywood and Highland that has a lot of stores and restaurants. You have to purchase something from here if you want to validate parking (if you parked at the Hollywood and highland parking garage).Super Tip: park at the Hollywood & Highland parking garage. It's $2 for 2 hours with validation. Walk the Hollywood walk of fame in an hour (it's just a long street). Shop for souvenirs. Then head to the parking garage within the 2 hour time. There's a small concession stand on the 2 floor of the parking garage, buy a water or some snacks and the lady will validate your parking! Pay $2 for parking! Woo!Sidenote Tip: don't believe the people trying to sell you a tour when they say they will validate your parking because they won't.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariangiec
50,A MUST see if in LA.........,"This is simply a MUST see if you're able to. It was fun to be in the midst of such greatness & talent! We went on two different occasions, a Tuesday afternoon and a Saturday, early evening. I would recommend going on a weekday, if possible. It's just SO much less crowded and you have more time to snap pics of the ""stars"" you wanted, otherwise you feel rushed & overwhelmed by the massive crowds.Go............at least once!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emybtravels
30,Kinda tacky but you need to see it,"Ended up on Hollywood Blvd, lots to see, slightly tacky, lots of people, and every 5 feet someone trying to sell you tours of the stars, save your money. Seeing the stars on the sidewalk was cool, even took a few shots. Being from Canada it was interesting to see the attractions that you would normally see on awards shows or the news. Saddest part is all the homeless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ottr60
10,Boring,Over touristy.Offers nothing of great interest or purpose.Horrible street buskers with poor outfits and acts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulAnthonyC_au
20,Trashy and freakish,"We just were not well impressed, not surprisingly though.There's only so much paint and makeup you can apply to a run down facade, so just don't expect all of the boulevard to look like it does for the Oscars.Looking down for the names of the stars pretty much guarantees you will be accosted by bums, tour operators, Chewbacca's third cousin, and women in apparel from the 22nd century. Do us all a favor and don't give any of them your money.The best part is the Chinese Theatre where there is some semblance of law and order being maintained. And that's where the real Chewbacca left his paw prints, btw.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BearW_13
50,A must-see in LA,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame it's exactly what you expect. It's fun to read all the stars on the ground, and take picture with the ones that you like.

40,"A Must for Hollywood Buffs, but for others, meh","If you are a big fan of movies and celebrity in general, you will enjoy this. Otherwise, it's nothing spectacular. Those who aren't die hards may have a hard time recognizing a lot of the names, but when you find the ones you do know, it's kind of cool. I guess I just thought that the area along the way would be nicer, but it's just a run-of-the-mill city street. It's an ok walk, but if you don't really care about Hollywood history, there's not much else around here to keep you interested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/perun99
20,Expected more,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but the Walk of Fame was in what looked like a really run down area. The main part was swarming with tourists, and people trying to sell tourist things/ tours.As you continue to walk down to see the lesser popular stars - the side streets are, well, we saw a homeless man emptying his bowel... (Poor guy). Enough said.I think we were expecting Hollywood glamorous and were underwhelmed. Even so, we did enjoy seeing some of the hand/footprints of well known movie stars etc in the main part.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tugb0a7s
30,Just walk through..,"The Hollywood walk of fame is nothing but stars embedded on the sidewalks on the Hollywood Blvd. They have names of accomplished stars in Hollywood. I didn't know many of them. But its just fun trying to spot a star you know. There are many attractions (Dolby theater and Chinese theater) on Hollywood Blvd, so you can walk on the sidewalk between different attractions. Muhammad Ali's star alone was on a wall!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/796anithag
30,It's OK if all you want to do is find the stars,"It is just that: you will walk on Hollywood Blvd. and the adjacent streets to find the stars of the celebrities you are looking for.Conveniently, many of the souvenir stores sell the maps with the location of the stars.Some of the attractions nearby are: Capitol Records building, El Capitan Theater, Dolby Theater and most of all, the Chinese Theater.Tips:Try to go in the morning (after peak am hours), is less crowded, less traffic. Most of all it is a little easier to find parking. Parking lots charge a lot, but are somewhat safer than street parking.Going at night might be fun but has it's risks, it is NOT a safe area, be aware.During the day there are many impersonators that for a tip will gladly take a picture with you.We took our friends to one of the ""home of the stars tour"". Big disappointment! We new more about the stars than the ""tour guide"". The people who offered ""tours"" are very aggressive and annoying. Ask questions and bargain.Many souvenir stores sell a variety of nice T-shirts for very good deals.Don't bring big purses, we encountered many homeless and panhandlers asking for money.The streets look dirty and are smelly. With all the influx of tourists you would think the city would do a better job to maintain it, unfortunately that is not the case. What a disappointment!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bea4Trips

30,CRAZINESS!,"I went here in 1969 and again this past February. WOW! What a change! The Walk of Fame was crowded with people and ""characters"" walking around...I think I saw 3 Charlie Chaplins, Michael Jackson, Iron Man, etc. all wanting you to get your picture made with them. You couldn't enjoy Grumman's Chinese Theater because there were guys standing on platforms with LOUD microphones screaming about your salvation and various other things. VERY uncomfortable!!! I didn't feel ""fearful"", just uncomfortable with CDs being pushed at you, etc. Wish they would not allow this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mountain_Momma3
40,Still fun,"Its still a lot of fun to walk along and find your favorites stars, see all the famous (infamous?) buildings and find the HOLLYWOOD sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cyn619
40,Enjoyed the walk,It was nice to walk along and see all the stars. It does get busy so try and go in the morning. Some great shop around also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Expedition809666
50,Not our first walk,"We try to hit this when in LA. There is nothing else like it. Yes it's spread out and yes the streets aren't all super shiny like some movies depict. It's just classic Hollywood nostalgia.When you make the decision to walk The Walk, I implore you...wear comfortable shoes. Broken in, cushioned, Velcro if you can, comfy, foot-loving shoes. You'll thank me later. Unless you are there to see one or two particular stars, which you can pinpoint on any free map online, you are going to be wearing your feet out.Pictures are a plus if this is the only time you plan on doing this. Make sure you have at least a 16gig SD card or plenty of space on your phone. You're not gonna want to stand and upload to Instagram every star you see when you see it. I'll get to why in a minute. But this is a great opportunity to get pics of spots where the stars of old Hollywood once stood. We went shortly after Robin Williams died and the state of his star was nothing short of moving. Took a while to get to it from where we parked (hence the comfy shoes), but was worth every step. From Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers to Mötley Crüe and Morgan Freeman, there is so much to see!Now... The why for the immediate picture posting. As much as I would love to say that nothing bad could possibly happen, I can't. There are some prismatic characters about all along The Walk. Some will just but you about tours or the novelty items they sell in their shops and on carts alongside the stars. Some will come up to you in costumes of known and loved cartoons and superheroes to take pictures and then tell you that you owe them money, even if you didn't ask them to pose. Some will walk up, grab your things and run. Some will pick your pocket. Ladies, leave the purse in the hotel room. Only take what you need and keep everything g either in your front pocket or good ol' First National Bra. Fellas, front pockets. All of it. If you've got a cash stuffed wallet hanging out your back pocket, you're asking for someone to take it. Play it smart. All I'm saying, ladies and gentlemen, there isn't a single thing wrong with a fannypack. You're obviously sight-seeing, so it's not like you can pass for a non-tourist. That makes you a target. Make it less easy for something to go wrong. And don't carry cash if you can help it. If you must, make it minimal. And have enough cash to get home in an in-room safe at your hotel. That way, IF your debit or credit card is stolen, you can cancel the card without being completely screwed. More than the cash stash, have the front desk make a copy, front and back, of your drivers license. Leave that with your cash in the hotel. That way you have some form of ID if something happens. Or if you have a passport, leave that in the room and carry your other ID card. Be smart and be safe.I'll wrap this up by saying that this is fun. It's novel and nostalgic. Totally worth the time to see as much as you can. Visit some of those shops. See the Hard Rock on Hollywood Blvd. Check out Ripley's. Check out the Theatre. You can't really miss it. If you're into music, check out MI. This was incredible to see as we are musicians. Enjoy the things you see and take it all in.And remember. Shoes matter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deeds4918

I would not go near them and certainly don't let your children near themEnjoy the sights and the stores. Beware of those who approach you on the street",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SammyM68
50,Must see,"Walk of fame is a must see in Hollywood with all the stars. Beautiful in daytime and night. It gets very crowded in the evenings with entertainers.

There are several souvenirs shops.Look at the White building from the last scene in pretty woman.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Centropa
30,Run over with aggressive peddlers,"You cannot walk 2 steps without having to say no to people wanting to take you on tours, or shove pamphlets or cds into your hands.

30,Not what I thought it would be.,"The streets are super dirty, it smells, and there are people at every corner yelling at your trying to get you to buy a tour of the walk of fame. The stars are spread out for miles, even on random side streets. I didn't really see too much to do at any of the stores near there either. I guess it was cool to go, but I don't really have any plan to go back. Parking was difficult to get in and out, and gets expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kayla_Chrisman
10,Gross don't waste your time,"It was so dirty, there was poop on the ground. I guess people don't pick up after the dogs at all, it was so bad. It is not worth going out there to see the stars just because of how dirty it is and most of the people dressed in characters can be really questionable. So many other things to do in LA, wouldn't waste your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aydinlik79
50,Must do when in LA,"This is a great experience when walking through Hollywood. There are so many stars and a lot to see. It can be very busy with people and with everybody looking down, watch out!

30,"Good, but doesn't live up to the hype","While the Walk of Fame is definitely a must-see and it's fun spotting the names of stars, it's not all it's cracked up to be. For one, it's exceptionally chaotic! Can't stress how busy it gets during the day! Full of people trying to sell you tours or give you their CDs, or people dressed up as movie characters trying to take pictures with you. I'd still recommend going because it's such an iconic location, especially if there's particular stars you want to see. Just don't raise your expectations too high - at the end of the day, it's really just a street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christmas-enthusiast
20,Only good on certain parts,"Would be lovely if the walk of fame had some signage and consistency (goes down some streets and is all over the place). There are people everywhere shoving tour pamphlets, their new music cd or business cards in your face and then if you refuse they start asking why and following you down the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnieh459
40,Fun to see all the stars,"I recognized many of my favorite actors, directors, singers, and more honored there. What I did not appreciate is wannabes using the fact that people were gathered there to try to hock their CD's etc.. I just wanted to be left alone to enjoy the day with my family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/982markj
30,Cool to see but nothing great,"Being in LA definitely have to see the walk of fame, right? Can say been there done that, right? From that aspect it's cool but in all honesty it's nothing special. Actually it's pretty dirty and I felt bad for legendary actors like Rita Hayworth that are in a side street where homeless people pee! That was probably the most shocking to me! I have a feeling that the stars get moved around based on relevance. I'm thinking that the current top celebs are by the Chinese theater and as time goes on and people forget who they are, the star gets moved to a less prominent place. This is only my assumption and I could be wrong. Nonetheless I wasn't that impressed by the walk of fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slp11379

Homeless people everywhere, drunk people at all hours of the day, filthy and extremely commercialized and insanely busy. We only ever go to Hollywood Blvd if there's a special event such as a movie premier. When we first started visiting LA, we checked out this part of town because it's cool to see the Walk of Fame but after you've seen it, there's no need to return. It's sketchy. So sketchy you feel dirty just walking down the street and it smells like urine everywhere. It's bad. See it once then be done with it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bits58

40,Find your favorite and take a pic,"Be ready for lots of people, many trying to get you to purchase their sightseeing tour and people dressed up as characters who will pose with you for a fee. It was easy to access. We parked in public parking off Highland Ave. It would be difficult to take a selfie with your favorite star on the walk, but someone you're traveling with can easily take pictures. Some people taking pictures just sat down on the walkway while others stood or crouched down. It seems like anything goes. We were mostly in the area of the Dolby Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathys372

40,Interesting,"I love different culture and you definitely get that here. This place defiantly caters to tourist not the stars.. It was neat and I love the experience and memories that I have to carry with me. The sidewalks are kinda grungy and I was disappointed that the 2 stars I wanted to see the most were not there; Clint Eastwood and Van Morrison. These star imbedded sidewalks surprisingly go for a ways, I actually got tired of walking dodging people as I looked at the ground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jezell
20,Scruffy,"This visit was probably my most disappointing in LA.Parking is very expensive.The sidewalk is mainly well battered, with only some small areas looking smart.What most people don't realise is that the stars extend about 1.5 miles on either side of the road and to make it even harder the stars are arranged many different ways round, so you are constantly turning around to read the names.The area is completely overtaken by street vendors and artists and so it is difficult to stop and read a star without being constantly accosted.My opinion is to don't bother visiting but leave it in your memory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveo334
50,Hollywood,Has totally changed since last visit a lot cleaner the usual street vendors are still there. The hassle from characters wanting tips for having your picture with them now are everywhere along with the ones handing out free CDs of there music when you take it they want a donation just hand it back and walk away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1949NLianw
40,Dirty but fun!!,Cannot believe all the money in Hollywood and the fact that it's so dirty. Why don't they make the streets cleaner and have a nice cafe culture??? Nice to see all the names on the sidewalk and fun to do but don't waste more than a few hours around here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBL001
40,Have to visit at least once,We got a park down Hollywood Boulevard for an hour and tried to see as much as we could in that time. We found most of the stars on our list. Fun way to spend an hour or two although to see all of them could be quite tedious. We looked everyone we wanted to see up online and tried to plan our route. Michael Jacksons was the busiest star on the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snjh77
40,A nice place to see your celebrities,"This was my first time visiting. I saw some people I knew. But it's also hard to find your favorite stars, you need to keep looking down and try not to bump into people. I saw people like Donald Trump (don't know why he was there), Betty White, Walt Disney, Winne the Pooh, Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Daniel Radcliff, etc...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimmy2020
40,Fun but be careful at night,I love old Hollywood. It's a lot of fun to see the stars of actors etc from a bygone era. It still gets a little seedy at night so be careful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vivsmom
10,Not impressed,"Full of tourists, over rated. We parked up and went in a number of shops with rude staff. Not the type of place we thought it would be. A bit of a reality check on this rose tinted idea of LA. Never going back. Would recommend driving down and quickly driving away so you can say you've been there. It ain't all that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarmaladeFella
40,Walked the Walk!,"This was an amazing adventure walking down memory lane! Thoughts and memories of stats who have gone on but thrilled us, warmed us and entertained us! Would be nice to have a map or chart of all stars which includes their location, what brought their rise to fame and a short explanation of how stars are selected!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tipsyz
50,Hollywood walk of fame,"Very interesting. I was on a tour. Parking would be difficult with lots of traffic. This is very crowded area, but fun to see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suebD5263ZJ
30,Pavement with stars!,That's it guys! Normal street with normal shops with normal everything just the pavement is full of starsThe area in front of the dolby theatre is full of the superstars on the pavement.Nothing special!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnhanna62
40,Free Touristy Walk,Fun to look for specific names. It seems like something you should do while in LA! Our ten year old learned new names and we had fun hunting for more recent additions that she would know and love to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniemI8283CQ
40,See the Stars,"This is another of those iconic locations you need to go to while in town. You can get a guide that gives you the location of every star on the walk, so you can find your favorites. The stars are in five categories (radio, TV, movies, music, and theater), so some personalities have more than one star. Be prepared to encounter crowds, especially around some of the more famous stars. You will see names you don't recognize (but your parents or grandparents might). Some of the stars may be difficult to see if construction is in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenW590
40,Pretty much what I expected,We visited the Hollywood walk of fame and I found it to be pretty much what I expected. There were people there smearing Something all over Donald Trumps star. But it certainly was attracting a lot of attention. I'm sure that's exactly what he wants. It was an interesting walk. There is a lot to see. I would have to say this one is worth a stop if you are in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1496FFtimh
40,Overrated walk,"Yes, the walk is full of stars and you can easily get a neck ache from looking down at the names, trying to find known ones.It is a must in a visit to Hollywood but don't expect too much. Even my teenage daughter wasn't impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woreditor
40,Loved it!,"My first visit to the Hollywood Walk of fame, and it didn't disappoint.If you have time, you can search for your favourite stars (I didn't have enough time to find mine, but saw lots of others). Would recommend you give yourself a few hours of you want to find particular ones - they stretch up and down both sides of the road for further than you think.I particularly liked the hand & feet prints at The old Chinese theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/475claireb
20,Dirty and Disappointed,"We started our walk at the interaction of Whitley and Hollywood Blvd. the street was dirty and there were a lot of bums or homeless people. They made their ""home"" in front of closed businesses and there were plenty of it. The stars were the most interesting and best view while walking towards the Chinese Theatre and shopping area. This area was nice, clean and busy! They had street entertainers and dressed up characters for the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendeenb
20,Dirty!,"My hopes for this area were so much higher. This area was dirty, grubby, derelict and at some parts quite creepy and unsafe. Some of the stars could hardly be read because of the rubbish on the sidewalk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bellgray16
40,Always fun,Of course it really is just some names on sidewalks but it is fun walking along and finding your favorite stars names. I recommend walking outside the Capitol Records building on Vine to see all of the Beatles. It fun for all ages as the stars of yesterday and today are all represented.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ponderosa72
20,Run down,"Well. What a disappointment. A run down area with cheap tacky shops and limited choice of good restaurants. For the first time in LA we felt very threatened.A dirty, dingy place. Horrid. Might be worth hiring a taxi to drive you through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1734TXsued
40,Fun but a bit dirty,"You have to go just for that feeling of being like a star leaving its print on the walk of fame. It is also fun to look for names of your favorite stars and remembering the movies you loved them in. Also for the producers, ...The streets were a bit dirty but we were there at night after a show so I do not know what it looks like during the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanessaTVC
20,"Overrated, grotty and tacky area",It's worth a visit to the Hollywood Walk of fame but Id do it in one of the Hollywood Tour buses. The area is tacky and grotty and really not worth to stop and look at it! Check out Ultimate Hollywood Tours they are the best!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharbeanBurt
50,Walk thru History,You must visit this site. The Walk of Fame features iconic people in entertainment. The shops in the area are fun. You will feel as if you are walking thru history. Definitely a great site for everyone regardless of age.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drivenboss
50,Interesting...,"I went there with my friends and siblings. It's one of the tourists attractions place. You can find your favorite stars there. Well, we found our star named Donald Trump. Check out the photos how much we love him. lol. Peace! And mohamed Ali, #Respect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arthurnaingwinaung
30,Must see but dirty area,We enjoyed walking around looking for our list of must see stars and musicians. The streets were dirty and unkept. Locals in the Hollywood area as well as vendors and retailers were very unfriendly and short when asked a question or even when we just smiled or said hello.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wandaandkirk
30,Very touristy,Visited Hollywood walk of fame. Was there for about an hour or so. Lots of people and tons of tourist shops with over priced nicknacks that no one needs. It was a similar experience to time square but quite honestly I enjoyed time square more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R1205FJnathanb
40,Hollywood is a hype,Nice way to get exercise! Need better restaurants and more updated stores. Movies make it look way better. The tour ride was nice. There are different tours so pick your choice. Some are dirty and smell. A nice way to see many parts if Hollywood though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mz2nd2none
30,It is ok,"I hoped bigger and more glamorous , nothing special... However you must visit if you go to LAEnough with 2 hours. Parking around so expensive",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LVALLEP
30,"A Tourist Trap, But a Must see","Yes, there are a bajillion tourist. But it's fun to walk down the walk of fame looking for your favorite celebrities, and seeing who is taking pictures with other stars. The theatres are amazing. That said, lots of kitschy shops with trinkets and lots of pushy street performers trying to get you to buy their mix tape. Very similar to the walking the strip in Vegas, minus the porno people. Very touristy.NOTE: find street parking, parking in the pay lots is EXPENSIVE, while the street parking is much cheaper. It's worth searching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiShellery
40,Very cool,I imagined it bigger and more shiny but it was actually small and beauty. You cant avoid the feeling of touching history when you are touching some stars there. We took many photos and we had a great time. I can say that those dummies that want you to pay them for a photo are a bad value.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/267daniele
30,Past glory,"As a tourist, I was excited and I did enjoy the walk. But, I must say, the streets are not clean, tour guides will crowd you every 10 steps you take trying to convince you to buy a tour with them. The Hollywood boulevard does impress.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/athulgp
50,Loads of fun,"I know it sounds dopey, and yes there are crowds to navigate, but for some strange reason there's a great thrill in finding your favorite actors and movie makers' stars along this walk. Not sure why it took me so many years to see this, but well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ken0739
20,DIRTY AND STINKY,"This place was very dirty, stinky and full of bums on the street. I am from NYC area, and found a place to be worse than NYC back in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Petersantana
50,"Walk carefully especially around ""you know who's star"" (last name starts with a T and ends with an H)",A milestone and must see for all first time visitors to LA. Hard to tell where to start and where to end. Some included are surprises and some omissions to date are almost shocking. Get a map! And a good souvenir is your own personal star to take home and hang on your wall!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JordanS8
50,Walk The Walk of Fame in Hollywood!,"Lots of energy and excitement here as you walk the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame!We had a ton of fun strolling the streets looking for the ""stars"" of Hollywood royalty. There are characters along the street; such as, Spiderman, Freddy, Michael Jackson, just to name a few.My goal was to find Marilyn Monroe's ""star."" I found it right in front of the Chinese Theatre in the cement right next to Jane Russell's ""star.""The Hard Rock Cafe is close by and so is the Whiskey A Go Go club. Oh and you can visit the Jimmy Kimmel Live set too!Don't forget to stroll into the historic Roosevelt Hotel. Lovely bar and restaurant to rest your aching feet.Parking is really hard to find here along the Hollywood Boulevard. There are lots of ""Tours of the Stars"" that one can partake in.Take your time, there is lots to see! But most of all...Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimB007
50,Vacation,The walk of fame was fantastic. So much so I went back the very next day because there was so much more to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/assistant81
40,Vacation,Nice to visit didn't stay long. Hard to find parking spaces. Parking was expensive. It was very busy even on the weekday!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alphaw2016
30,????,Not what I expected... Not sure what I expected... Neat to be with other tourists but not sure I'd go out of my way to visit... Just ok,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SSSandMar
10,Paving slabs with peoples names,These paving slabs are in a very shabby and run down street. Not interesting in any way I can think of. Many homeless people seem to live on this section of this street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/32madeleines
10,Overrated and dorty,"Not at all glamorous like you would thing from television perception. Extremely crowded with people trying to haggle with you everywhere. Other than the two blocks where most things are, the area is very dirty and uninviting. Somewhere you of course visit once but wouldn't want to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blakeherbert
10,The Moronic Inferno of Hollywood Boulevard,"Eesh, what a motley collection of people, tourist shops, crappy food and general filth. Yes you can see the stars on the sidewalk, with a surprising variance from Tony Orlando to Paula Abdul, which essentially means any shmuck celebrity has one. It's the Walk of Fame, not talent. The Roosevelt Hotel is the only oasis amongst this trash heap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pbernard9
50,Very Interesting and Runs for Blocks,"I was very surprised by the length of the Walk of Fame. It goes for blocks with many performer names presented. Didn't know that Gene Autry was the only 5 category performer. The things you learn while on travel. We stayed at the exclusive Loews Hotel where Oscar guests stay and you can see a portion of the Walk of Fame as you come across to the Chinese Theater area. I even found Donald Trump's star right in front and took a picture of it, just in case he makes it further in the elections. I didn't see Hillary's star however. Only five category for performers get stars as I said.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H8443OUjamesc
50,Go early before it gets crazy,Sometimes the crowd was so full on you could not see. Good cheap souvenir shops. Go early before the bus loads of tourists arrive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sentosa2017
40,Tick that off the Bucket List,"We stayed at W Hollywood which has the ""STARS"" on the footpath in front of the property. I remember seeing them in movies etc and wondered what they would be like to see in reality. It brought a smile to my face when I saw them - sort of like an accomplishment that I was able to see them in reality. We didn't experience any untoward people whilst walking and viewing, perhaps because it was Oscars week (?)If you are walking along Hollywood Blvd - you can't miss them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelBug735
30,Fun but crowded and watch out for panhandlers.,"We happened to be there when they were setting up for the Oscars so much of the area was a construction zone. However, it reduced the number of panhandlers. The stars are fun but with so many people it was hard to stop and really look. Worth doing when in Hollywood but nothing spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyCampersNH
30,It is ok,I thought the walk of fame was ok.Too crowded and too many tour groups taking too long in the one spot or blocking the famous stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmY7787BZ
30,It Is Everything You Think It Is,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a must visit, it is an incredible must visit, if you start out the front of the Hotel Roosevelt you will find all the really good and well known names, I gave it an average rating because although this is a must visit you will be hassled non stop while walking down the walk of fame with every man and his cat trying to give you something promotional, however these are not free and they do put it in your hand and tell you to pay.... also the overweight superheroes trying to get photo with happy tourists...Nothing is free!However the Walk of Fame has so much just off of it with the TCL Chinese Theatre, Dolby Theatre and many more along the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glyn1989
30,Come see the people who pay?,"These stars go on and on and ... and they're not necessarily gathered in any coherent order. It's kind of fun at first, ""Oh look, ______ has a star!"" (I think Godzilla was my first quirky one.) But then it simply reads like a laundry list. Do some research and find out the funds that go to get these stars (some entity doesn't just bequeath the lucky little rich person a place on the walk) and there's even less mystique.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amesman96
40,Glad We Stopped,"We had limited time, so we parked in the Dolby Theatre parking garage (worked out nicely, cheap, and was seemingly the only place that wasn't full...PLENTY of spots) and checked out both sides of the block directly out front of the theatre. I'm not even going to try to list all the stars we saw, there were so many, and so many ""important"" ones. We were in awe the entire time, pointing them out left and right; we didn't realize how many there actually are. It was extremely busy when we were there, I would guess it usually is, and everyone is walking and looking down, so make sure you're prepared to be run into, and to run into people yourself! I was a bit skeptical about shoehorning this stop in (really? A bunch of stars with names in a sidewalk), but I'm very glad we took the time to stop while we were in the area; in total we were parked for roughly 45mins and we felt we saw plenty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KyleA2402
30,I visit it everyday.,"It is a great place to visit. Plenty of shopping, restaurants, and parking. I recommend taking on of the Open Bus Tours if you are interested in taking in the walk of fame along with the rest of the sights like Rodeo Dr. and Melrose Ave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/371tonyt
50,Well worth a trip,The walk is 5 miles on each side so it is almost impossible to see everything there is to see but you could easily spend a few hours here looking at all the names you recognise. It's also a really good location for picking up gifts for family as there are a number of shops selling Hollywood trinkets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/146careyb
30,Hollywood walk of fame,Was Good to follow the walk of fame. Streets were less cleaner as you moved beyond the main few blocks. Lots of interesting characters impersonating stars to pose for photos with tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thilinag2013
30,Interesting for five minutes.,"Don't go out of your way. It is interesting for about five minutes, but it is just a pavement with names on it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulD19
30,And we walked,"We didn't have anyone in particular who we wanted to see, other than Neil Patrick Harris (random, I know), and only knowing the general direction, a map would have a been good. It wasn't worth fighting the streets full of tourists to walk the 1 mile to our destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123aprilc
30,Movies fans,You have to be a Hollywood fan to love this place. I almost didn't notice we were on the right place. It's nice to see the place and take pictures. That's all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lottermanndiego
50,As Amazing As You Think,"Plan to spend an afternoon of walking if you want to do this attraction. It is WELL WORTH the trouble. Fighting the possible crowds on the sidewalk, and the constant badgering to take a guided tour or to take a ""mix tape"" from a pan handler is a small price to pay. There are so many stars, and people you might never have guessed where there. My only complaint is that the stars are sometimes facing one direction or another, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to their placement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prowler7
30,"Interesting, but still skanky",The walk of fame area has done a lot to clean itself up over the years. It's still a hole. We did a walking tour that unfortunately was kicked off by a crazy guy screaming rhetoric about how English was now illegal and we would all soon be speaking Arabic if we didn't change our ways. It's just a melting pot for freaks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyle7692
10,What a disappointment,Decided to swing by and take a look at the walk of fame. First time for the entire family. Bee were expecting a shiny walkway. Just a dirty sidewalk that is a slightly different color. Really not worth the time or trouble of parking the car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wfdeacon
40,A Walk into the Hollywood Lifestyle,"When I'm in the area I always walk around this area. It is very touristy, but worth a little exploring. Checkout the shops, clubs and restaurants in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidaE7048SV
40,Star gazing...,"Iconic walk to see as many as possible & find your favourites, tried to get some pictures but the sun was really bright on the stars. Not complaining though, was great walking along in the heat.Really busy in places.Carole : )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaroleScott
30,As seen on TV,This was out first Hollywood activity - which we quite liked. It is right on the road and it's not a super swish area. Parking was hard to come by and expensive. But it's a bit of a must see in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinkelpoops
30,needs a lot of improement,"this is one of iconic attractive in LA but unfortunately needs a lot of improvement to met the expectations.i would to see that area looks like what i found in Kalakaua Ave in Waikiki , Honolulu or Lincoln Drive in South Beach, in Miamifrom the shops or coffees point of views",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abdgarni
40,"It was fun, worth the walk!","This was our first trip to Hollywood. Yes there are homeless and people trying to make a buck, has no one been to Vegas? Big deal. Ignore them and marvel at all the stars you want. The hand and foot prints are amazing! We walked the whole walk of fame and didn't regret it. It's amazing to see what you see on tv all the time for the oscars. It's a must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marieb959
40,"Not what you would assume, but I love it","It's different to what you would assume it would be.The Hollywood walk of fame is located on either side of Hollywood boulevard and consists of celebrities names on stars.It's interesting walking up and back to see who's stars are where. The most popular areas are around Hollywood/highland where most of the action is.As it continues down the road you have a few souvenir shops, pubs, and restaurants but it does become less crowded with people.I love the area because of the hype and atmosphere, but it isn't for everyone. There are a lot of people busking for money so be warned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gypsymind
20,Disappointed,"I truly don't know what I was expecting from the Walk of Fame, but it definitely wasn't what I hoped for. Everywhere you walked smelled like marijuana and forget trying to stop and look at anything.... People were so impatient and pushes you out of the way. Not something that I think is very good for young kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plancarte307
30,Something to cross of the list when in Hollywood,Visited about 12.00 mid-day and it was fairly busy. There was a film crew setting up the red carpet for some award ceremony so a lot of the stars in the pavement were not visible.Lots of cheap souvenir shops and touristy restaurants. Parking can be a problem but if you go to the Hollywood and Highland centre 6801 Hollywood Blvd 90028 you can park for 2 hrs for $2 if you get your ticket validated - just buy a drink or some sweets in the shops. Some will validate without you buying anything. After 2 hrs you are charged $1 for every 15 min up to a max of $152 hours is enough if you want to have a quick look around,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/118pault
40,Enjoyed seeing this Icon!,We enjoyed just walking the streets and seeing sites that we often see on TV all the time. We saw the Chinese Theater and where the Oscars are held at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coach02
50,Brilliant,I could do it other and other again and it's just brilliant seeing all of the stars names and taking photos of them and it goes on for a long time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/632joshc
20,If you like being pestered.,"This place would be so much better and nicer if they banned all of the touts attempting to sell tours and the wannabe musicians handing out their CDs. And if you've been in one cheap tacky souvenir shop, you've been in them all. And then you have the people dressed up as superheroes wanting money for photographs.If you really want to go and see the stars and hand prints, I'd suggest going very early in the morning, before all of the annoying things I've mentioned above crawl out of wherever they come from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dterry182
40,Interesting part of Hollywood.,"Hollywood Boulevard, with the famous theatre of Grau Man. The street has a real star route. You can find in the pavement all the actors who played in Hollywood films, all the great musicians and all the producers etc.We were visiting that part of the Boulevard on different moments. I can advise you to go early in the morning, because when the wether is o.k., you can hardly walk after 11 o'clock, from the people. Than do you have also a chance to find your favorite artist....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J5921NNpeterv
30,Go early,"We visited at 8am. It was very quiet with no sellers or lookalikes around to hassle us and it was easy to get a few photos of the big names.If you don't like the crowds, get up early and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Plane_Talking_Travel
20,Disappointed,"Very dirty area. I thought visiting the ""walk of fame"" would be prestigious but actually there were many homeless people to step over and most areas smelled urine soaked!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annecS9647TX
30,It's just good for a few photos,"Nothing much to see here, apart from taking photos of stars you like. Way too busier than it should be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sophilyplum
40,Busy but worth visiting,It's a very busy place but you won't regret visiting it. Good Luck trying to find your Celebrities' star. Lot's of areas you can stop and eat so don't worry about hunger. Enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChicTravelAddict
30,A quick walkaround and photo stop,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is famous for its stars. Beyond hunting for particular names, it is a quick walkaround and photo stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ice_D_8
30,Walked the walk.,"Lots of stores ,saw some odd looking people in costume. Friendly enough. Took pics of famous stars on the walk of fame. Brought lots of souvenir",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauragZ9921IQ
30,Too crowded on the weekend.,"I would advise against visiting on a weekend, if possible. There are too many people on the sidewalk. Everyone is in the way to capture a photo and they shadow the stars so it's nearly impossible to photograph. It is something everyone should experience if they are in the area but once is enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bunny0016
40,Interesting but be careful,"This is a great attraction to see but be careful of the many aggressive tour sellers, characters in consumes and homeless people around. As long as you keep a low profile and avoid them, you should have a good time. I would advise you don't touch or lie on the floor area where the stars are as it's full of dirt and urine! They may look clean and shiny but they're definitely not. The Chinese theatre is also a great place to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizzielicious
30,Interesting but not a nice area.,"We wanted to see this famous land mark, but the whole area is rundown and not very nice. We travel with our children aged 7 and 8 and even is broad daylight felt uncomfortable in this area. It is over run with homeless people on every corner and with them are hundreds are people jumping out selling bus tours. There is a heavy Police presence everywhere.It was not the place we had expected after years of seeing it all on TV and building up an image in our minds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soniaE_12
30,One and Done,"Go once and don't do again. My kids and I had a morning to spend in LA and this was what they picked. It is very touristy and I will admit I did get caught up in the star hopping and had to have my picture taken with certain stars. That being said, make absolutely sure that you take the time beforehand to research where the stars are or you'll be on a wild goose chase. Use hwof.com for the best maps and directions. Park in the mall adjacent to the Chinese theatre and save some bucks (hollywoodandhighland.com). There is a metro station that saves you on walking time (use hwof.com for more info).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RHelp
40,Honeymoon Visit,"Hollywood Walk of Fame was very interesting! Loved seeing the stars!However, it definitely not what I expected. In downtown Hollywood (not West Hollywood), the buildings were run down but the evidence of the history and ""what used to be"" was interesting to see. I expected a little more glamorous all around but I am satisfied with what we experienced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinastinabina
20,View from a locals perspective,"Let me begin by saying this, I am a local. Its typical for me to avoid this section of Hollywood BLVD... So, that being said...From an outside/visitor perspective, its certainly something you have to get out of your system, but don't have high expectations. The strip is dirty, smells pretty bad in the summer, and offers a lot of tourist traps. Most of the vendors are aggressive, and the ""characters"" (the Spidermen in particular look like they sleep in their costumes behind a dumpster) can be gritty and at times vile/rude/overly aggressive. If you want a picture with one, be ready to pay a couple bucks.On the upside, there are some ok views of the Hollywood sign (For a better view - see the Griffith Observatory) and of course the Chinese theatre is a must see... If there is a certain star on the sidewalk you want to pose with for a picture, then great. But please, don't touch the sidewalk and keep your kids off of it! There is literally urine EVERYWHERE.Overall, don't waste too much time here though... Get in, and get out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThatEmeraldGuy
50,Walk your way to fame!,"I have already visited this attraction in 2013 and returned again in 2015. It is still nice but a bit grimy on my return compared to the much cleaner Walk of Fame in my 2013 visit. Also the weekend is much packed with both local and foreign visitors, such that it would be a struggle to take nice,clear pictures of the floor tiles with your favorite Hollywood stars without someone bumping or even stepping on you.Best to visit this place on a weekday, preferably after the morning rush and before the late afternoon to evening rush to avoid the typical vehicular traffic, as well as large volumes of people moving to and fro the area. I definitely don't suggest going around this place on a weekend unless you hit the road at 7 am.There's heaps of cafes and restaurants to fill up the belly, as well as a gamut of souvenir shops which offer a wide range of selection of stuffs to buy and bring home. I suggest running through a few of them to check the best buys both in the stock and the price.Along the Walk you can also visit the Madame Toussauds, the Ripley's, the Chinese Theatre, and a whole lot more. There's a train station near the middle of the stretch of the Walk,and buses ply the area too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scrattie
40,A must see,"As your in Los Angeles this is a must see, I didnt realise how many names were actually on here you could spend hours just looking at it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/414jackiec
30,Amusing for a bit,"Cool seeing the names. For me it's amusing the first few minutes. I didn't feel the need to hunt for more names though others may want to. Several attractions and photo-ops nearby (Chinese Theater, view of Hollywood sign from Hollywood and Highland Center). You can park at the Hollywood and Highland Center if you're only staying for a couple of hours.Cons: The usual costumed characters and mix tape peddlers asking for money a la Times Square.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patlv23
50,So much fun!,"Even though Hollywood Blvd offers the typical touristy things to do i.e tons of souvenir shops, Ripley's believe it or Not and a wax museum there was something just very cool about being there, seeing the Dolby theater, the Chinese theater all the stars on the sidewalk, Jimmy Kimmel Live studio even got to witness the end of the Doritos competition with the bat mobile also many fun and unique shops just to name a few - park at Hollywood and Highland clean restrooms and easy access!! Strongly recommend you take a few hours to check it all out! Our GPS routed us off of Hollywood Blvd when leaving and took us by Paramount Studios a super duper added bonus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LABNC
40,Typical iconic walk,Walking the sunset away with kids will be a memorable thing to do.Lots of pictures to take and take home. Great memories and fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmalanis
30,You just got to see it,"Another must when you are in LA. It is very cool to see it. But got really disappointed with the Hollywood area. Very dirty and not much else to do. Go, see it and get out of there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbanales
40,Lots of celebrity names!,"It was quite enjoyable walking the Walk of Fame - there were plenty of famous people who we recognized, though it was quite annoying that the stars with celebrity names on them were sometimes upside-down so we had to turn around to read them properly. There were lots of celebrities like Nicole Kidman, Donald Trump and even Tinker Bell!We had a good time and a nice walk as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Homelover69
20,"Expectations too high, poor reality","Although this walk of fame it is one of the most important icons around the world, I must to recognize that been so careless, dirty, unsafe (my personal opinion, I don't feel comfortable while been walking out there). My expectations been too HIGH but the reality was poor. :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TatianaCas
50,Meet Stars?!,It feels like walking in a museum with so many stars being honored and remembered. Can also be like a scavenger hunt trying to find the star of your favorite artist,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katiejodly
30,Worth taking a look,"This place is worth taking a look into. Very interesting names from today and legends from long ago. Beware of the street vendors, they will charge you for a picture or music. If you are not interested avoid eye contact or just keep walking, they will leave you alone. Be careful with walking while reading the stars, there is a lot of people visiting here any day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347SandraM
20,Nothing great,"This is not what I imagined it to be. The whole area looks quite run down and when I was there the police was doing a raid on one of the many souvenir stores. There's also an excessive amount of street performers and impersonators that I found rather annoying. I respect people to work for their money and for doing that work in this kind of heat but there are only a few that are somewhat decent at their job. I expected a grand street with amazing buildings. This is nothing like that, best spent your time on something else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krn_137
30,"Another Icon of LA, but do not set your expectations too high","The Hollywood Walk of Fame is another one of those California icons, that you just have to see, but do not expect too much. Anyone can buy a star these days and it just does not have the romance it once did.Be wary of being harassed by street venders dressed up as stars wanting your money for a photo, and the free music, which costs you a donation and do it as part of a LA tour rather than a specific visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockkevin6
40,🌟🌟🌟,The Hollywood Walk of Frame is worth seeing. There's no other one in the world quite like this one. Just remember to pay attention to where you're walking while you're trying to read the names on the stars. There are a lot of people walking on Hollywood Blvd. Especially on the weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maxxxines
30,Neat,I have wanted to go to the Hollywood Walk of Fame for a long time. It certainly is neat to see all the Stars and the Theater but being hassled every 10' - literally - to get on a tour bus or buy CD from an up and coming artist got old - very old. Fun to say I've done this but no need to return and I don't think I would recommend due to all the hassles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TH0718A
50,A must see that hurts😑,"After paying $20 to park, which really there is no other option, I was part of a mob scene waiting at stop lights to cross crowded intersections. This is a location that everyone probably should go to see, but really is difficult to say you enjoy. The Chinese Theater is impressive and the Ghirardelli chocolate restaurant was fun. Mostly, will always just remember the super crowded sidewalks with mostly annoying people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanwR2138KC
40,A Must Do in LA,"You have to see this in LA. unfortunately the stars are all in different directions which sometimes makes them difficult to read, especially when there are a lot in one place. We also walked the whole of one side and couldn't be bothered to walk back the other side as it was getting late and we were tired. A good attraction though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swannifer
40,Wear your walking shoes,It's neat to see all the stars there are a ton of ppl dressed up like characters and famous ppl make sure you bring lots of dollar bills they only work for tips n to take a pic u must tip them or they get angry.. the Chinese theater is absolutely gorgeous and looking at all the stars feet n handprints is cool.. madame tussads wax museum is very very expensive.. we shopped at a local vendor and they were so great to us..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azbullrider
40,Must Do,"If you are visiting Holywood, you will definitely the walk of fame. Each boardwalk has stars on them. The most popular one is located by the Chinese Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PierreTheFoodie
40,The Great Ones,"I lived in Hollywood when quite young. It was fun to watch the tourists ooh and aah over the names on the sidewalk. The nice thing is that most everyone tried to keep it neat and clean. There was only one row of stars when I was there, but it didn't matter. There were plenty even then to keep all tourists...and locals...happy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manay
40,So Much Nicer than it used to be!,Get there early so that you can explore before the crowds arrive. Cleaner than it used to be and right at the Dolby Theater where the Oscars take place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zolnier2
40,fun but you miss everything with your head down LOL,"This is a neat and fun experience but between all the crowds you have to get through the characters trying to get pictures. Just take your time, dont rush this and use a couple hours of walking back and forth on both sides of the streets.It really is neat to see stars past and present on your walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gatorhans
10,Waste of time,"The Blvd is too crowed to really look at any of them, if you stop walking people run into you or try to sell you crap, if anyone tries to ""give"" you something, the expect a ""donation"" for it and if you get a pic with someone they will expect a tip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lambington94
50,Prepare for a long walk!,I think they said it was a 3 mile walk in total - up one side and down the other but I loved every minute of it! I had a map so I knew which stars I really wanted to see. It also helped to have a smart phone so I knew I was walking in the right direction and roughly how far I had to go. Being from Australia I was seeking out all the Aussies and was not disappointed- even found Bob Hawk (an American Quizmaster and comic) but claimed this star for our former Prime Minister!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20grace13
30,"Boring, pushy but you must cross it off your to do list.","It is something we had to cross off our list. Who could honestly travel here and say they didn't go there however it certainly is way over rated.There will be a crazy amount of tourists that are pushing, rushing, stopping abruptly taking photos but if you can go here with the mindset that all that any more will happen when it does it really shouldn't bother you or spoil your day.I must say the excitement the day before and morning leading up to visiting here was almost overwhelming but after about 10 minutes you will start thinking 'is this it!'Putting that aside, yes it is disappointing but no you cannot not cross it off your list. You'll go home from your holiday wondering why you didn't go or maybe my review was misleading. To be honest it is just a group of repeating stars with names on it amongst a very bustling area. Let's face it - it's not the real thing but ""you have to go at least once""I am pretty certain you'll have multiple people approach you selling calenders or souvenirs. Just smile, say 'no thank you' and continue on your way. If you stop and talk you be stuck for ages and then feel compelled to buy something or be left feeling guilty for not for the rest of the day.Don't think you won't; trust me, you will.Take a bottle of water as when you'll need it the prices of water will seem over priced or even hard to find.Despite everything I have said so far you have to go at least once.Don't just take photos of the foot path put your had, food or a body part into it to make it interesting and proof you were there!You can buy a Walk of Fame Souvenirs and Collectibles to help restore the Hollywood Walk of Fame.It is a donation of $25 to the Hollywood Chamber. They will send you ""Friends of the Walk of Fame"" pin with Certificate of Authenticity but I think you could use your money more wisely.I've bought trinkets from everywhere in the world only to find myself packing it away months later. Souvenirs are dust collectors and space wasters. You are way better off collecting brochures, wrappers etc and creating a memorable book of fun and photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yummy472

40,Free fun to watch the stars,"The thing about Hollywood is that it became famous almost a century ago when the movies came to town, along with the movies came the movie stars.So it's perfect to walk along Hollywood boulevard to see the names of some of the biggest stars not only those who have worked in Hollywood or the movies but are stars.There are 5 categories for the stars from movies, tv, music, radio & theatre. So as you walk along the boulevard checking the stars you can see the name and which category they have been chosen from. It's very possible that a star can have more than one star if they are worthy from more than one category.I believe there is only one star that has all 5 stars in each of of the respected catergories and that is Gene Autry.As I'm from the uk half of the names on the stars don't mean anything to me as I've never heard of them.The only thing about this walk is that through most of the day and early evening it's too busy. Best to do this early if you have the chance.Good fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianbY752PL
20,Kind of a bust,"I am kind of glad to at least cross off my list, but not anything special. I just had to stop though! Really crowded and way too touristy. All the stars are the same and I guess if you see one, you've seen them all. Very much like Times Square down here in general. I wouldn't spend too much money parking. Do your homework and park cheaply because I don't think you will be spending that much time here unless you want to do wax museum or star tours etc. they try to get you with 20 dollar parking which is not going to be money well spent. If you can stand traffic, take time to circle block and walk over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RochelleL119
40,You don't go to Hollywood if you don't walk along...,"I think these sidewalks is one of most important thing to do in Hollywood. We can check name of artists in the star signs along the sidewalks and enjoying the crowd. There are many impersonators, especially around TCL Chinese Theater and Dolby Theatre. You can take picture with them but you must be ready to give them money...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbertNoers
30,just a walk down a sidewalk with stars on it,I live in Los Angeles. Hollywood is not the best part of our city. It is souvenir central and all about tourists. Many bus tours start there. If you are a major star fan go see it. If you do not have much time to spend in the area put it lower on your list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanneg28
50,A Walk to Remember,"If you are a music (recording and radio), film, theatre and/or TV buff, this may be a good attraction for you. The walk is beautifully done with pink terrazzo and brass stars with your favorite stars names set into the sidewalk. It is a good place to take photos. There are many souvenir stores, impersonators, live performers and people selling rides to the stars home, if you are interested. It is a definite tourist spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debraw679
40,Good but not too sophisticated,"I thought I will be a unforgettable experience, but after go there, nothing special to be mentioned about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/342mercyr
30,Ms. R. Davis,"Though a bit tacky, it is still a great attraction for tourists. Walking the sidewalks, seeing the famous names; seeing the actual footprints of favorite stars is really exciting. The theaters are fun. The impersonators in the streets are fun to take your photos. Restaurants crowed, but fair food. Many souvenir shops. One cannot visit Hollywood and miss this area. It is truly historic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhodad2016
30,Much longer than expected,"We didn't walk the entire Walk, but it was fun to check out the names on each star we passed. Stars actually take up 15 city blocks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/writrsblck
40,walk of fame,i have see this place my entire life being born and raised in LA. It is very memorable as u see a TON of names you have never heard of before and names of people that are impressive. It is a MUST see if you come. And if you do please see a movie at the El Capitan. Hollywood history under your feet.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/omecihuatlf
50,Star Gazing in Hollywood!,Since I've always been fond of the entertainment industry I find it very fun to star gaze as I walk down the streets of Hollywood and notice the names of all the people who earned their stars on the walk of fame.Not many boulevards or streets in American can claim such a unique way to walk step by step over pink stars with famous names on them. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is one of the highlights of being in Hollywood.Hooray for Hollywood!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdriannaA_12
30,Nice spot for photos,"It,s not as seedy as part,s of Hollywood use to be no more Prostitutes and Pimps, but still a lot of Homeless, begging for money. DO NOT PULL MONEY OUT OF YOUR POCKET TO GIVE THEM. Sounds mean, But you will get swarmed by the homeless and could get robbed. It,s very bad in certain spots, and all over LA in general.Do not recommend visiting at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/300willieh
40,Don't Walk It At Night,"This really is a must see if you come to Hollywood. The best view of the Hollywood sign is seen at the Hollywood and Highland Center. The designers had it easy to get great backdrop photos of the Hollywood sign from this center. If you want to look at the stars on Hollywood Blvd, then you should do it during the day and stay as close to Hollywood and Highland as you can because the neighborhood is sketchy. At night it's flat out scary. Once, a deputy sheriff friend of mine was walking with me and got concerned with a drug dealer being arrested and prostitutes on the BLVD. But if you go hear Graumann's Chinese theater, park in the Hollywood and Highland center (some of the restaurants in the center validate your parking), see the Dolby center and stay in that two block radius, you can be fine. The dressed up characters are also a bit sketchy and want tips to have their pic taken with you. Dinner at the nearby Pig and Whistle is a great option too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllieRKay
20,Much To-do About Nothing,"I've had a lot of ""been there, done that"" experiences. This is a ""been there, wish I hadn't bothered!"" What's the attraction? Dirty, crowded and boring. What more could you ask?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/technocleric

10,Noise and light - bad,"Not sure what it all means. Lots of noise, lights, and looking for something that is not there. It's interesting for about 5 min then you realize you are staring at names embossed in the side walk like all the gum folks spit out. Dodge the star map folks - not sure what they are selling - tours or Smack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mailo17
50,Hollywood!,Very nice place to come with friends! We have a lot of fun and take pictures of legend starts! That is a lot of people dressing up as starts and you can take photos with them! Accessible parking is available. Food and entertainment is at the location as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F4699HWsoniab
30,Boring… not what I expected.,"This is just a sidewalk; I did know that but I expected something more than that. The atmosphere is ok, nothing special. There is nothing to do at the area, so after you look as some pavement you will need to go back to your car (its LA…) and drive somewhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiladBroun
40,What I expected,It is the Hollywood Walk of Fame... a little underwhelming.. allow plenty of time to see each star... scattered across to walkways minimum. A must see but not spectacular,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/639kaseys
30,Enjoyable,"We wanted to visit Madame Tussauds wax museum and see the walk of fame. I started out overly cautious of the location but turned out it was pretty clean, easy parking and enjoyable. You can pick up a map and it tells you where your favorite stars are located, which helped me find Hugh Jackmans star quickly 😁. Would I come here at night? Probably not but during the day it was fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarylR1010

40,Has to be done,"A busy place as to be expected. We were fortunate to visit at a quieter time of year.

Snap your favourite celebs names on the sidewalk and move on!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BradCymru
20,Should have know better,"The street is such a scene with people dressed up in cheap character costumes trying to make a buck, tour companies have people pushing brochures into your hands, man preaching on a loud speaker. It was difficult to enjoy all the stars and take pics of your favorites. For us it wasn't worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayner534
40,Fun walk,This was a fun walk as you shop or eat on the strip. We walked in and out of the shops glancing at the names. Nothing to eat but something to see and truly a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/630andid
10,Don't believe the hype.,"With the exception of the Chinese Theatre, the rest of the Walf of Fame is not worth the effort and there are quite a number of unfortunate homeless hobos in the area. Something tv fails to portray.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rjoc

10,"a filthy, busy street with pink stars","I was appalled by LA's homeless problem.There are over 100,000 homeless in Californiaand it is the number one state with the largest homeless population.I could not believe how many homeless line these streets and how many people are trying to sell you tour bus tickets to take you past the stars homes, which is asexciting as watching hgtv for 2 hours.I cannot believe that people just walk by every day ignoring the people laying in the streets and that no one is doing anything to help this problem in their own city.Every street smelled of pot and urine, cracked and filled with garbage.LA has to be the dirtiest and dumpiest place I have ever seen in my entire life.6 miles driving in from Nevada all i could see is the cloud of pollution hovering over the city.LA needs to solve their pollution problem and homeless problem.How can these stars even buy homes 4 miles away from sunset blv?Why would anyone want to look over a valley of garbage and dirt?Walk of fame is better seen on youtube or pictures.There is nothing to see here.Dolby theater is tiny and no big deal.....i almost laughed at how dirty andsmall everything looked.Rodeo drive?? Ive seen better stores in downtown Chicago.Do yourself a favor and don't visit this festering turd of a city.I left early and wouldn't go back if you paid me.Beverly Hills is laughable.There are suburbs of Chicago with nicer homes along the lake shoreand in the western suburbs.Traffic is so bad here and the people walking the streets look likedown on their luck, wanna be artists or hipsters and the homeless.Everything that was beautiful in the glory days of Hollywood has vanished.It definitely felt like walking among the walking dead.Zero glitz or glamour!!!Spend your money and vacation wisely and skip this bucket of turds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vegasgypsy10
20,Disappointing,Constantly being harassed as you walk down the street with tours and people handing you 'free' CDs and the asking for a contribution for them even thought it's more than likely something you really don't want.

30,Nice early morning walk,My wife and I walked early in morning so that we had time to take pictures and check out names. We had picked up a map with location of stars we wanted to see and planned ahead of our walk. It does get a little boring after a while but it was a beautiful day out so we also enjoyed the weather. This was not one of top things we did while in CA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brentb1166

30,Don't expect to see it all,"Our bus tour stopped here and pointed out that we couldn't see every star. It's over 2 miles long.

There are sidewalk performers, as well.Lots of people there making it difficult at times to get the pictures you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoannaS812

30,Once you've seen a few stars it's enough,Hollywood is not a very clean or savoury place so the walk isn't in the best condition in parts with a number of unfortunate homeless people.

30,The hustlers take away the enjoyment......,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is good except the fact you can't enjoy it without somebody asking for money. They are very aggressive and try to pressure you into giving them money. There is really only a short section that is worth it that is the most busiest. The people that beg you to go on tours or go to there restaurant is very annoying. The Jimmy Kimmel and Dr. Phil experience is worth it. There are some good restaurants that are in the area. So if you go focus on your surroundings especially if you have little kids with you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/masonalpha9603
40,A must see,"If you are in LA, you've got to go and see the walk of fame. It's rather packed with tourists, but again you just must go there.

Find your favorite actor star, see the hands imprints at the Chinese theater and than go the Griffith Obervatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Me74126500
20,Walk of Shame.,"Hollywood Walk of Fame has lost its shine over the years. Numerous so called stars managed to get a star on this iconic walk. One notable Name is Donald Trump!! {I was told he purchased his star for $$$$$$} There others that I saw that don't fit any Walk of Fame category, but they are there.!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plavoo
40,Fun and good walking exercise. ..,You have to see and experience it. Its fun and exciting specially if you find your favorite actors/actresses name. And its a good walking exercise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WOW_mom93
30,Hollywood Walk of Fame,Ok to to visit to say you've been but very tired looking area full of souvenir shops. Ample parking at the shopping plazas for an acceptable price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/402brendanb
50,Must see while in LA,"If you're on Hollywood Boulevard, you literally can't miss the Walk of Fame. It does take quite a bit of patience to get through with crowds also hurrying along the Boulevard. If you want to know where to go, simply Google WOF Star Maps before you go to save the hassle of trying to find out where your favorite stars' stars are located. You'll also enjoy plenty of impressionists looking for tips for photos, as well as the Jimmy Kimmel studio and plenty of fast food, as well as the mall with a decent distance view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theOneiricTraveler
40,On the to do list,"We recommend going on the morning around 6.30 am to get really clear shots and be able to stop at all the stars you want to see.Also, check on Wikipedia the street number of the famous people you like. You'll actually see many more names that you didn't know were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/744lilyr
30,Disappointed,"I was exited to see the walk of fame, but when we arrived it was a sad sight to see endless over weight chaps in Spider-Man outfits and wanna be rappers pushing their CDs as you try and walk down the strip. It is dirty and certainly has not got the nostalgic feel that I always imagined. Would not go again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PNMO1978
50,You have to experience,"So I'm from NY and I love to travel of course but there's no place like ny. But I must say Los Angeles has to be a close 2nd. I mean it will take you over a week to visit all the nice cities, but let's get to the core of LA .....Hollywood! You have all kinds of stores and people. Let's start with the walk of fame with all the stars who have made it have a star on the sidewalk with their name on it. From Marilyn Monroe to Puff Daddy. They have a great wax museum, the Guiness Book of World Records and Ripleys Believe It or Not. You can tour all 3 spots for a low price. We did the world record tour and it was fun. Then I wanted to find the Micheal Jackson star. I found it thru Google maps. Then we went took pictures with look alike actors. They are nice people some look just like the stars. I felt too many spider mans characters though. Batman needed muscles, but iron man and wolverine were great. I met Eazy E a look alike guy from the NWA movie and I helped him a lot. Best of all was a Pirates of the Caribbean look alike. Jack Sparrow.... he was great and a lot of fun. There is also a hard rock cafe on the strip and a nice Shrek statue you can take a pictures with. We will be here til Wed but we will come back. There was a nice look alike Harlem Globetrotter actor and he was a lot of fun with ball tricks and he interacted with the crowd the kids loved him. Fun fun fun!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F4476XLjamesb
40,What you expect,"The hollywood walk of fame is just what you expect! Its great to see all the stars, the walk is a lot bigger then you think it would be too so if you do want to see them all it might take you a while as its also very busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allypop890
30,Good,It was ok - we took a quick tour and it wasn't exactly what I expected - lots of street people peddling there goods... Not the atmosphere I would recommend for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/322briann
30,Stars,It's one of those things you're expected to do when you visit LA. Cool to find stars you really like. There's not too much to it though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colourpop
40,Must see,If your in LA and have to see one thing other than the Hollywood sign this is it wonder the street and point out to one another look it's such and such it's well worth a look,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reeceyb
10,No What It's Cracked Up To Be!,"You think that Hollywood would be glamorous and what you see on shows and movies. NEWS FLASH! It's not, full of buskers, hustlers who want money.They just trying to make a buck but still they want $10+ for a photo with a super hero.When the taxi driver dropped me and my partner at the walk of fame his advice was not to leave the main strip because you may come across trouble. It's just a seedy place.There are nicer places in L.A. The tourist places could use a clean and revamp!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anderson2023
40,If you go to LA you must go here,It's a spot to visit if you go to LA. You will see your favorite artist name there and at same time you will feel the Hollywood environment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jo_opaulof651
40,Go early to avoid the large crowds,We arrived at 9 am and there were very few people out taking photos. We were able to capture good shots and easily access stars we wanted to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/345brendas
40,Fun times,We had a great time walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard. Always a great place to take in the sites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/774salm
30,Worth an hour,"This place is certainly worth an hour of your time. Anymore and you realise just how dirty this place is as well as the stars themselves. Being such a tourist trap you would think they would make every effort to make it welcoming. Instead you get hassled constantly by homeless people, street performers, and street hustlers. Although there was a police presence I just didn't feel 100% safe and was glad to get back to the car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m4rcus2001
40,A bit of fun as you stroll the footpath,The walk of fame covers about three or four blocks on each side of the street. We enjoyed wandering along finding names we knew and taking the odd photo or two. I believe you can use Google to find particular stars but we just took our chances.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OutofAfrica46
30,Nice to look at,"We had a look at the walk of fame, it's ok to look at but there are a lot of people hassling you to take photos of comic book people , selling you stuff etc, so it's a bit of the pain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ndeborah
40,A must do but difficult to get good photos,I have to say there was a lot less to see/do in Hollywood than I'd imagined but the walk of fame is a must do.Hard to get good pics when it's busy as it's obviously just a sidewalk so don't be afraid of getting in people's way if you find a star you REALLY want to take a photo of!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russellm691
30,Just to say you went,I didn't really spend much time here. It was nice to say we went but don't need to go again. Shopping center close by was nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leeyparsons
20,"A few ""stars"" but not maintained","While there are a few gems in the area (Second City in particular), Hollywood Boulevard is run down and seedy. Many similarities to Philadelphia's skid row in the 1970's. Needs to have the same level of attention paid to the upkeep of the neighborhood as other parts of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968budm
40,Nice to visit. A bit overated.,I've always wanted to see the Walk of Fame as it looked really interesting but once I actually got there it was actually a bit underwelming. It was cool to see the names and all but it's not all that exciting after a few minutes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phillips714
50,Fun day,"I haven't been to the walk of fame since I was a kid. This was a fun way to spend the day. We were there a few days before the Oscars, so it was fun to see them setting up. Lots of places to eat and lots of things to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelewelker
40,Nice Signs,This a tradition of every tourist to go here. The problems they are al here along with tons of folks dressed up as characters for a photo op for a price. This whole area has a sort of Fellini feel to it. Its fun do it and move on,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/forestw300
40,Interesting to see but not in great part of town,Like many attractions in southern california- it's just part of town and not always in the greatest areas. So go during the day and don't go alone and things should be fine. Don't expect it to be super clean- it's a regular part of the city sidewalks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WandaH735
40,Energetic!!!,"This is a must see for anyone who likes movies, Hollywood history and people watching. So many colorful characters and shops and of course, the stars on the sidewalk. We were there on a Sunday afternoon and just loved the energy there. There were street performers and characters in full costumes and makeup for picture taking opportunities. Check out LA LA LAND for souvenirs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Javajude
30,It was ok. Nothing magical...,We parked in Hollywood Highland (max $15 a day which was pretty good) and made our way through the shopping center to the Walk of Fame. The overall experience was ok but not the most exciting thing I've done while in LA. The street was a bit grubby and the crowds bugged me after a while. Go to tick it off your list but don't feel the need to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katrinder
50,What a vibe,"I mean the block isn't glamorous at all, it's not like the movies at all ! BUT there is a vibe or an aid about the place that really makes you appreciate the magic of the Hollywood star strip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bornstarv
40,Exactly what it says it is,"First of all if you are going here be prepared to be frustrated finding parking but after that the street is kind of cool. There are a lot of stores and things to see along with the stars, like the pantages theater. One big turn off was the high amount of homeless people we saw which was pretty uncomfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steevz
30,Crowded,It is a must see for tourists. We took a foreign exchange student. So many people. Interesting if you like to watch people. Not enjoyable if you don't like crowds. Often hard to walk due to crowds on the sidewalk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A4345VSnancyg
20,Dirty and not glamorous,Seeing the names is fine but in reality the streets are dirty and it just doesn't have the glamour you expect from it!! Good to see and do but does not meet the hype,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/966zacb
40,Stars on the street,"Ok. From the perspective of its Hollywood, you have to do this. If your travelling with kids do it during the day though as there are a lot of dark things that come out in Hollywood at night. Heaps of shops and bars and resteraunts. There is a really cool Mall right near Lowes Hotel, but i cant recall the name. The Hard Rock Cafe is there and if you like meat, there is a great steak place opposite Lowes Hotel.Then take a short ride to Sunset strip its also a great place and much cleaner. Thats mainly resteraunts and clubs",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankrI7580MS
20,Worse than I envisioned,"Ever since I was a little kid I had always wanted to visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame and honestly I was not impressed, in fact I was quite disappointed. The streets are dirty and there are people constantly heckling you to buy unnecessary stuff. I even felt like I was being harassed at times. I was not a fan of the overall experience.On the flip side I'm glad I got to see this place but by no means would I ever go out of my way to visit here again. The way everyone had talked about here made it seem like it was a must see attraction but I tend to disagree. Sure it was cool to see some of most prestigious actors and actresses names printed in the stars on the sidewalk but all in all I only recognized a small fraction of the names. There is plenty of stuff to look at and many places to eat, but the majority of everything was overpriced and repetitive.If you're in town I would check it out, but I wouldn't come to Hollywood just to see this. We drove down from San Francisco because we thought it was going to be epic but in my opinion it was not worth the drive whatsoever. After about an hour of walking around we were already over it and were glad to get away from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/962justink
50,Saw Robert Wagner near his star,How could it not be fun - walking down the sidewalk and reminiscing about people you knew and googling people you don't. Good to have one person as the lookout so you don't run into others. Jimmy Kimmel still doing a good job keeping Regis and now Kelly's stars clean. Not so much for the stars covered by the Oscar fencing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959gailc
40,A galaxy of stars!,Stars are found on both sides of Hollywood Blvd. The fun part of the visit is to find your favorites and to avoid bumping into people walking by either doing the same or going somewhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Texhusky75
10,Not worth it,"Pictures are prettier, the area is grubby. It's not an enjoyable walk down the street due to the vast crowds and hawkers. If you feel the absolute necessity to visit it I strongly recommend doing it from a vehicle or tour bus",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JS5071
30,Had to be done whilst in LA,The walk of fame was a must see whilst we had a free day in LA but now I've been I wouldn't bother to go again.The obvious thing is the attraction of the stars but Hollywood Boulevard itself is not great. It's a grubby slightly seedy Street with pushy hawkers. Once you've been to the theatres at Hollywood & Highland & seen the stars you've seen it all & have an urge to find somewhere nicer!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pogwig
40,People watch goals,"Interesting place! Perhaps just because of oscars it was busy, not not sure.Went at night and walked along looking for our favourites.Lots of oddballs in terrible costume just enjoying their day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jambri01
40,Just for the photos,"We were with a stroller and even our 6-month-old daughter enjoyed it. Nothing special though, stars with names, the Chinese and the Dolby theatre, but you cannot leave LA without seeing these, definitely an iconic place, but don't expect too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melindam84
30,Kind of boring this time !,Usually we go December but went this last February was packed but really boring not much going on not a lot of fake celebs or weird people out lol but other than that it was cool as always,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/918jc
30,Looks better on the tele,We went to the Hollywood Walk of Fame the first evening we arrived as only a 5 minute walk from our hotel. Honestly it was a bit shabby but lots of hustle and bustle. Obviously you have to go but don't expect too much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindaaG861UL
30,Not as spectacular as we'd expected,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is not as impressive as we were expecting based on what we'd seen in movies etc. Hollywood itself is actually a bit of a dive, and while it was good to check out the area and see some of the big names in the stars, we left feeling a bit underwhelmed.It's kind of one of those obligatory sites you have to visit while you're in LA but it certainly is not as good as it looks in the movies. We also got hassled by a lot of street performers and people trying to sell things, just looking to get money from tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WoozyBanker
30,Very crowded place,"If you'll be looking for specific celebrity star, good luck on finding it! The place is crowded, you jostle with tourists for space. Many entertainment around, people in costumes. If you're going in a group, like we did, be sure to keep the kids next to you all the time because they can easily get lost in the crowd!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Draxxzo
20,Best avoided,"This was a big disappointment. Firstly it doesn't feel safe, between the hawkers, homeless and hard nuts you feel like gazelle parading on the plains in front of the carnivores. Even the Bank of America ATM ripped me off registering a double transaction when there was only one.This area needs to be cleaned up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hoaile1987
40,Always wanted to see it,"My wife and I had a blast walking this. We did not do the entire walk of fame, both sides, due to time. We turned it into a little game to see who could find stars we knew the quickest. Was a lot of fun and brought back memories seeing the names of Celebs that are no longer with us. Took lots of pictures and had fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonyrU1046VH
50,I LOVE THE WALK OF FAME!,"What a fun place to people watch. It is very touristy but a must see. There is great shopping, food and drink along the path of broken dreams. There are also still many old Hollywood buildings left standing including the incredible Roosevelt Hotel. I used to live just up the street and in the mornings around 8:30 or 9 am before the shops were open, I would walk down to Hollywood Blvd up to the Starbucks that has a view of the Hollywood sign and get a coffee and collect my thoughts. The vibe of the blvd early morning has a certain energetic feeling of anything is possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/642marlam
30,Probability you will be disappointed but You must go,"It is a place that is really boring with a lot of people trying to deserve some tourist attention. Sometimes is annoying.But, please, understand that you must pay a visit. Go to the theaters take a lunch and enjoy, but for few hours, not more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabio-Cipolla
50,Rock star,myself and my daughter visited here she felt like a rock star great for children she picked out her favourite stars and took some pics,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cluainnalaoi
30,Stars that go on and on . . .,"It was on the ""must see"" list of places while I visited LA. I was a little disappointed in the cracks and the condition of some of the stars, but it brought back memories of a lot of the stars I had forgotten about. I think it's one of those places you have to see while there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763bethb
40,must see,Definitely a must see if you go to LA. It's fun to look for your favorite stars. Actually the most fun is the crazy street performers and impersonators you see. Of course there are stores around to visit also for souvenirs and shopping in general.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinhH177
10,Its a has - been,"This was the most dowdy, dirty, left to rot place I visited in America. I thought I would have got plague if I put my hands in the hand prints outside the Chinese theatre and the place is awash with tat shops and grubby character photo touts. Give it a wide berth and look at some old Vintage footage of its hay day instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AprilBBlu
50,First time noticing,I was in Hollywood on business and had never paid attention to the walk of fame for some reason this time I did. It's pretty cool. Lots of familiar names but the ones I didn't know I looked up some and learned some things. I need to do some more research on the stories behind the names.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/440jackk
30,Eh,"Its cool and everything but its one of those things that once you see it in person for the first time, you're good. There's so many stars that it's hard to find the one you want and it's just not as great as you might think it could be",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/824amberu
20,Eh,Went there whilst Street was getting set up for Oscars as well. Maybe it was the day but I wish I did something else. Not so impressive.. Would never go again..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thatzidimitriou
50,Great fun street,"This is a must go to street if you are travelling to LA, Parking nearby is pretty expensive ~20$ for parking.You will see people dressed up as famous movie characters, fiction characters. Its good to get a photo or 2 clicked with them to have memories forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bipind2014
40,Fun & almost free,"We walked down part of Hollywood Blvd while they were dismantling the set up for The Oscars so there was some chaos since parts of the street were shut down. But how many times are you going to be able to see something like that? I guess once a year. There are several annoyances though,. The first is finding a place to park, the second is dealing with people trying to put things in your hand like flyers, CDs, & DVDs (?), and be wary of certain people hanging around there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aztxcat
30,It could be better,"I expected more from Hollywood but it is not so bad. If you really want to see all stars you will need so much time so better start visit early we came in the evening so we didn't have enough time,it is hard to read all that names when is dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jovanas736
30,Find your favorite star,"The walk of fame covers a large area of Hollywood, so if you want to find your favorites from movies, tv, music, etc. you should ask one of the locals or seek out one of the charts of the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,Rainy day but super fun.,"Sad to say it was raining the day we busted the Walk of Fame but who cares it's so worth it. You wouldn't think seeing stars are on the ground could be so fun. There are a ton of shops right on the strip, so you most definitely won't leave without a souvenir.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StanayK
30,Pretty neat,We walked along part of the trail. Got boring very quickly. Would be neat if you were a big fan of a particular individual. Otherwise so so.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenimler
50,Just fun!,"It is just fun to walk the Walk of Fame. We went in the morning around 10 am and it was not crowded at all. It was even more fun to see if my daughter recognized some of the classic stars. It seems so simple, but it was really worth the trip for us.The parking was easy, I just parked on the street. There is free 2 hour parking. It won't take longer than this, but there are so many other things to do along the way. Just watch the time. We went to hollywood a couple of times and never had any trouble parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASLOV
40,"""great experience, changed since last time""",my favourite place in America has always been LA ever since i was young i have visited twice. my favourite thing to do is walk up and down the hollywood walk of fame and looking in the souveneer shops!! i also enjoy looking up to the hollywood sign in the hills!when visiting i would take a camera/phone but i woukd recommend to keep your belonging safe while walking up and down as there is many poor/homeless people around which massively lets it down to visiters. ity can be very crouded so if you fancy visiting whatch out for the celebrities!!! also i would reccomend buying a map and visiting the stars houses my favourite house was obviousley the beckhams!! :) :) good restraunts including a mcdonalds in the middle!! have a great time if visiting :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/782elishac
40,Exciting,"Love this city. We tried to walk the whole street, but it was very crowded. You can anytime see a celebrity, so watchout :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hopefulll
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"We had a blast-whirlwind trip from WI to LA- took in the Hollywood walk of Fame. I had a select few I wanted to find and did. Its a fun area, alot to see including all the ""characters"" that want to take a picture with you..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/195timc
30,Nice to see but disappointing,"Wasn't quite what I was expecting, bit of a dump if i'm honest. Nice to see some of the stars but overtaken by companies and people wanting pictures and your money.Keep an eye on your bags as well, lots of pick pockets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikemoyes1987
20,Beautiful but too busy and crowded with street performers couldn't take pics without being hassled,I was looking forward to this visit so much so but unfortunately the street characters and hustlers trying to sell their cd's really ruined it for us. We couldn't stand for a picture without being hassled for money or to take a pic and we didn't really want pics with any randoms it was a family holiday and we only got to take a pic with 2 stars and rushed away from the crowds and annoyances. The shopping there for souvenirs was great though and we hid away shopping to avoid the crowds it worked out well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maleya
40,Fun but needs TLC,"I loved looking at all the names. Some of the stars needed looking after more. I did however love walking along reading the all the names, a lot I admit I did not recognise, it was quite poignant seeing David Bowie's just after his passing. I am glad I visited this place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/647louisew
20,Overrated,"Crowded. Loud. Dirty. Overpriced. Too many crazies.Worth one quick, brisk perusal, and then move on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/200ashleys
40,Walk of fame was cool,"The walk of fame was cool, kids enjoyed looking for their favourite actors actresses. Its very crowded in some areas though so a bit of patience is necessary. A must see for tourists though!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamm37
50,"A ""MUST"" if you are a film fan and you travel in California","Well... it is HOT in August in Hollywood but is so nice because it's crowded. The both parts of the Boulevard are animated with star fans trying to get their most advantageous angle with the star on the pavement, sometimes in quite funny positions. Many advertisers invite people to visit the shops either with souvenirs or with refreshments, many times for shows is a chilly shadow. It was very helpful for us to get informed where my wife's precious stars were situated, at which number on this looooong Boulevard. Probably next time we will do that it not be in August.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calingabrielp
30,Ok I suppose,"Friend took me here because I insisted, he did warn me that it wasn't that exciting and have to say, I agree, the area was nothing like what I was expecting and shops nearby were like blinged up pound shops, overall verdict, go just to take some photos and say you've been there, nothing more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliP504
30,You could spend time walking somewhere else.,"Are you a Celebrity know-it-all? Or you just love media entertainment? If this is you, then this is a trip you want to take. If you don't meet the criteria above, then I suggest you do something else.Heres the thing, unless you love everything celebrity oriented, there is nothing else to see.Located on 4-5 block stretch of Hollywood Blvd, the Hollywood Stars sidewalk has been a tourist attraction for many years. Yet, most of the commotion that happens there only occurs for about a block. There impersonators, costumed characters, but for the most part - NO CELEBRITIES. Unless, they're about to get a star on the Hollywood strip.Yes, that's right, there are NO celebrities hanging out here. NONE. Just their stars and some have foot prints in front of the Chinese Theater. If you happen to catch a celebrity walking around Hollywood Blvd. You're very lucky.However, if you're there for El Capitan, Mann Chinese, or Jimmy Kimmel, then you're in the right place. But if you're just there to see the sidewalk, well, you might be disappointed. Here's why.The Hollywood strip is going through a renessaince of sorts. It's trying to become the Blvd. that could. With the W hotel, the Hollywood/Vine Mall and some very nice hotel rennovations, it great for a day trip. However, it really comes to life at night. With several restaurants, entertainment venues, and bars, Hollywood and Vine is really jumping.I don't recommend the Hollywood Strip for those who are not enthused with the Entertainment Industry. You're time would be better served trying to get tickets in advance for the Ellen Show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joycelynnq
40,Walk of Fame,Fun way to see the different names in each star. Walk along one side and then come back on the opposite side of the street. Check out the size of the shoes or hands of different people. Don't forget your camera to take pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/413lisea
50,The Stars Are Out,"This is another tourist attraction that is awesome to see. For me I like to go back on some of the oldies but goodies here. You must watch where you are going, most people gave their heads down looking at the stars. It is very easy to collide with another star gazer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinem503
40,Check out the stars,"This walk of fame is actually spread out over several blocs, so if you are looking for particular stars, be sure to look them up online to see where they are located so you can go to the right location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lagiant
30,I expected more!,"I expected more of the Hollywood Blvd.. It was good, but nothing more.. First time there I was excited to see the stars of the walk of Fame! It was fun! But the second time I was there I didn't even look at them.. the buildings around it, I thought it would be more glamorous! Some were tho, but many were not! So we're some tiles, they need a renovation! For souvenirs you should go to LA LA land, it's the best and has a lot! There was an other store, I don't know the name of, but people outside almost pull you in and when you're inside you see it's all trash!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ritch89
20,Overrated and filled with lots of scammers,"Walk of fame is good but is littered with scammers that will harass you to accept 'free' CDs or free photographs with them, only to convince you to part with your money. LA law enforcement needs to remove them. It is a massive taint on an otherwise decent place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FranzA848
40,Just happened to park near stars for a Beauty Salon appointment. Had 2 hours extra on Meter so did almost the entire wal,My favorites are the musician's stars in front of the Capitol Building. I wondered why so many musicians were in that area and looked up and I was in the Capitol Buillllding doorway. Great experience. The area is being renovated and alot of construction going on in the blighted area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malibumaven
20,Filthy,"I live in the area, so pass it every day, seems that there's been a decline in the cleanliness/safety of this area lately.It gets REALLY busy, the streets are absolutely filthy. I see so many people sitting on the ground next to the stars to get a photo. I would not recommend this!!You'll get harassed from every angle. The guys handing out CDs are particularly bad, they've called me all sorts of horrible names because I've been out for a walk and ignored them. It is really uncomfortable. The people dressed in the character suits at Chinese Theatre are awful as well. They all look as though they haven't washed their outfits for 10 years. They'll also harass you, jump in front of you, make you feel uncomfortable.If you want to see the stars go first thing in the morning when it isn't as busy. Avoid in Summer. It's a total nightmare",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/World-roamer87
30,Memory Lane,We stayed at the Roosevelt hotel right on Hollywood Blvd and the Walk of Fame was right outside of our hotel. If you watched a lot of TV over the years you'll get a kick out of all the celebrities that you forgot about. Seeing their names in a star on the sidewalk as you walk is kind of cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415joec415
50,Love the walk of Fame,"Just a must do when you're in LA! we loved it! probably annoyed many passers by, by walking incredibly slow as to read all the names!! just a must do to be able to say you've been there and done it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iamwoodlepops
20,Just a walk through,Pigstye. Sad SAD condition of sidewalks. Very sad. At night it's an area for the aimless. I'm sad Hollywood has a dump of a downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathypH1987KC
30,Freakshow,"It's a total freakshow down there. Crazy meth cosplayers and their passive aggressive photo ops. Lots of people bumping into each other or just standing in people way or on the stars.If it truly interests you. Get there early. Otherwise there are so many people it's almost impossible to see the stars you want, let alone take a photo of one. There are lots of good actor stars away from the theatre itself...but the whole area is just filled with cheap crappy gift shops. It was kinda disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedandJonny

30,Lots of History,"If you like to reminise about old movies and stars the walk of fame is a great places to do that. Stroll along and look down to see movie star names as well as music industry stars too. Be aware of the people around you, there are tons of homeless people and weirdos too but don't let that stop you from enjoy yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pacundo
30,Disappointed,"I've always thought of Hollywood walk of fame being glitz and glam and very, well, Hollywood! And seeing the stars was wonderful but the tacky sex shops the entire way along the Blvd absolutely ruined it for me. And tour guides hassling you the entire way along to go on an expensive bus tour. The stars themselves and the Chinese theatre etc are all great and it's worth seeing but be prepared for tacky shops and tacky people along the way",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachaellouisem
30,"Find the ""starman""... or other people","Take stroll down the street and find your own favorite star or hang around the ""insert flavor of month brand name here"" Chinese theatre to look at the foot, hand and other inprints of stars new and old embedded in concrete. Mind the costume guys and gals hanging around because their job is to try and make you take a piture with them and then make you give them money for it, especially with kids this is quite hard as of course little Johnny is going to want a picture with Batman and oh look mom there's Darth Vader too.... I'm sure you get the picture or rather don't get it, is my advice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyLA76
40,Gearing up for the 'Oscar's,"Hollywood as you imagine it!Busy and a bit brash, but fun for all that!Right now the whole place is gearing up for the Oscars with seating being built and the famous red carpet about to go down. Blocks off some of the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paxlot
40,Free Fun,I absolutely loved walking the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was so exciting to see which names you would cross and I took many photos.

40,Find your favourites,"You can spend a few hours if you are playing close attention and want to find your favourites to take photos of. I enjoy the placement of some of the stars, for instance the Disney themed ones outside the El Capitan Theatre and Disney store.

40,Had fun!,"It is a nice strip to take a walk and try to see which stars you can find and which ones you know. There is a mall near by so if you want to shop, you can. There are also several shops along the walk of fame. You can also enjoy souvenir shops. I bought a $5 California sweater!!! There are some small food carts that you can enjoy delicious fresh food from. It is a nice place to go to, specially at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuthyIsaias

However, the area is crowded and there are some real characters roaming around.. I would suggest just walking it on your way to somewhere else.. Or perhaps getting a map of the stars so you can locate the star you are looking for... So like I said.. Snap and keep it moving.. Don't waste too much of your trip in that area.. So many other cool parts of LA to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255meghanm

50,Tradition and Honor,"It's an awesome feeling as you walk down Hollywood Blvd. with stars dedicated to real Hollywood stars. Even though every star was paid for by a studio for business, it still is a one-of-a-kind experience that is not to be missed. Disregard some of the tackiness around you; just look down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lurkinc
40,Lots of stars,It's just like what I imagined. I Googled the stars I wanted to see and that made it much more manageable to find them. There are the usual people dressed up as celebrities in front of the Chinese theater. I have to say it was slightly dirtier than I pictured.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrystalAnn56
20,Seedy 'hood ~ but entertaining people watching,As a So Cal Native I always worry about out of towners LA experience being ruined by Hollywood walk of fame. If you go in knowing that its filled with local freaks and geeks and keep expectations low you'll probably be less disappointed by its seedy nature and material culture. The present day walk of fame is filled with out-of-work actors in superhero or scary costumes (from awful to spectacular) and random musicians handing you their music cd's hoping to be discovered. Its an odd collection of people. I would recommend a day at Santa Monica Beach for a more real LA lifestyle experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carobritravels
10,A more wretched hole of...,"When visiting LA you have the option to walk amongst the stars. Seeing a sidewalk that contains the names of famous people in the least interesting way possible, with repetitive designs in random placements. The random placements are through some of the ugliest parts of Hollywood. The inducted stars pay for the installation and upkeep (ha). The bums on the street are certainly more interesting and the tourist rip off stores are the slimiest in the area. No reason to walk this walk, you'll see the best names and get the idea as you visit the Hollywood and highland corner. Don't wast any extra time on this just snap a quick pic as you walk over it and move on! Think of the path as a clear indication of where not to bother going unless you like deal potatoes buildings, beggars and con artists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FilmNeil
30,Stars at Your Feet,"Not a whole lot you can say about the Walk of Fame. Stars have to be purchased by someone and they are all up and down Hollywood Blvd. and Vine Street. All entertainment stars from movies, TV and music fields. More fun to visit Grauman's Chinese Theater and see the hand and footprints in cement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardJ3
30,Cool Tourist Attraction,"It's a cool place to be able to saw you have visited but I wouldn't recommend women hanging around the area at night, people can be a bit annoying, within seconds of being in the area had two men grab and harass my friend and I.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runawayblond
30,"Skip it, unless seeing other things as well","Every time I'm in this area of Hollywood, I ask myself ""why am I here?"" There is very little that isn't obnoxiously touristy or just completely gross. If I felt like I just had to see the Walk of Fame, I would rationalize it by also seeing something fun nearby. For example, my kids love going to the El Capitan Theatre. It is a special, once in a while, outing. Or going to see a movie at the Chinese Theater is fun because it's so large and an interesting bit of history. Otherwise, there is very little reason to pay a lot for parking, push your way through the crowds, and tell your kids time and again that you're not going to buy him a plastic Oscar statue, just to see a few stars on the ground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teatour_karen
30,Nice / dirty,"It was my first time and it is pretty different to how I imagined it would be.It is interesting find your celebrity star and it's like a show watching all the caracthers around, but in the other hand the street is dirty and there are a lot of homeless people.I loved to see the Dolby theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giselaysm
30,Not so great but needs to be seen!,"Whenever you hear Hollywood, this is probably one of the things that springs to most peoples mind and for exactly that reason you can't go there without saying you've been to the Walk of Fame. Its very crowded, full of tourists and people trying to sell things such as trying to sell you 'celebrity tours' and street performers wanting money or trying to take a photo with you and the streets are lined with gift shops. I went during a heatwave and it was unbearable to walk the street without getting irritated by all the tourists and just how busy it is. Saying that, you can try and get a good photo of the stars (thats if no one is covering them). I'm glad I've been but going once in a lifetime is more than enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snsimmy23
40,Fun to see all the names but who are they?,"The Walk of Fame always has people taking phone photos of particular stars who are famous. But the majority of Stars on the walk are long forgotten, many from the height of radio days, the big band era or old movies. I think the enjoyment one gets probably depends on one's knowledge of Hollywood history. Since I live in Hollywood and walk these streets often, I still study who is under my feet and it's fun to see names that ring a bell. As for tourists, it is probably a good exercise to find out who these people are since you came to where it all took place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/habitatp2014
50,Only if you have too 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁,"I guess when in LA you have to walk the walk but it's not all that, I guess you can say I did it and check it off your list, but there many more things to do in LA, people, food, art, shows, theatre, interesting clicks bars, places off the tourist track, if you are in LA go out and explore its amazing 🚴🏽",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/galactictraveler
50,Not impressed,"Where a bit surprised by the place, in a not so nice neighborhood and odd surroundings.

Not recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SHA12311
30,Walk of Fame without any special,"It was nice to see the walk of fame, but also partly disappointing - no funny persons ex..Maybe because it was pretty cold and rainy the days we where there and the street was more or less blocked because of the event with releasing the new Star War movie.A place you have to see beeing in Hollywood :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karsten1960

30,Getting Tired,"To be truthful, it was hard to give this 3 stars-I did so only because for movie buffs, there is a certain amount of history here. Yes, it's fun to see the stars of your personal favorites. However, it wasn't enjoyable to see the tacky, dirty costumes the street performers were wearing, nor was it fun to be accosted by tour bus employees pushing whatever company they worked for. All in all, the glory days of Hollywood Blvd. are long gone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappilyRetired818
50,"See the ""stars""",See the stars on Hollywood's walk of fame. You might even see a movie star or two. They run movie premiers at Mann's Theater with red carpet events. We just drove by the red carpet for Kung Fu Panda 3. Road was blocked off. Angelina Jolie had just been on the carpet right before we drove by. Find your favorite stars and take a picture or two. There is a lot of activity on the street on Hollywood Blvd in that area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mardisdar
40,Have time,"If you want to look for your celebrity, you will have to have a lot of time on your hands. During the weekend it will be very busy time. So, if you want to have a slow stroll, try the late night time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoWBe
40,The biggest and brightest stars line these sidewalks,"We went looking for the Beatles star and the individual stars of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. We saw many of our other favorites along the way.It is an advantage to be looking down at the stars so you can ignore the many hucksters trying to sell tours that claim ""We know where the stars live and we will take you there"". There are some interesting people on the street but they are few and far between. There is one area where skinny dudes dress up like superheroes looking for money if someone wants a picture taken with them.Also creepy are the shops that line most of the sidewalks selling trinkets and trash.It is fun to spot Gable, Bogart or Cagney. I loved seeing Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland and Lucille Ball. We saw Hank Williams, Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley.Take a stroll down memory lane and see your favorite stars from stage, screen, television and music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bombersfly10
30,Good but the tour guides are pests,Was interesting and a must see that's for sure... There are shops and bars restaurants constantly down the street. The only thing was the tour guides... I don't mind themAsking but to follow you 100 metres down the street waving flyers in your face is rather annoying,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunnywilson04
50,Fun to check out,"It's fun to check out the different stars and look for your favorites to take your picture with. It is a neat area with lots of shopping and food.Just be careful. There are people all over dressed up as characters wanting to take photos with you but as soon as you do they want money. Also watch out for tye ""free"" CDs... for a donation of course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beccah0206
30,Longer than I thought,"Honestly thought the walk of fame was just maybe one block long, full of stars. Instead it covers blocks and isn't just on one street but turns corners and makes it a very tiresome endeavour to find the celebs star you're after. Coupled with the fact that I didn't feel safe walking around the area makes it an average thing to see in Hollywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TawJackson
50,Had a great time.,"Actually, we found the walk of fame by accident. I am glad we did because we had a blast. Walked down the boulevard and checked out many of the shops. As other folks stated, street vendors are a hassle, but just ignore them and enjoy yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/starryr2018
50,Most recognizable pedestrian walk,"You can track down your way to the Kodak walking on the pavement with the most famous people of the planet. Even though the process for having your name on the walk of fame is quite expensive - plus you need to be active for many years in the entertainment business - it is absolutely free to see the stars. All you need is just some time and good mood and on your way, stand some of the most famous stars of all time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meeoozeek

Kenny Loggins' star on the pavement. Close to the metro for a quick escape.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J9347JFjohnm
30,A must do.....,"The only reason I've marked this down is because the street vendors are a complete hassle. The city should clamp down on this, impose proper licensing and arrest all the freeloaders - they were a royal pain. Although this is on all the bus tours you can access it from the Metro stations at Hollywood Highland and Hollywood Vine - the tours are $59-$69 but a Metro day pass is $7.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johneK6499BK

30,Hollywood Hike of Fame,"For years I've heard of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I've seen celebrities get their star with attending pomp and circumstance. But I never realized until I was standing on the sidewalk along Hollywood Blvd that the Walk of Fame is actually about 16 blocks long. Walking the whole thing looking at every star is not something the average tourist would set out to do, in my opinion. While in Hollywood, it was interesting to look at some of the stars while we visited other attractions but there was no way we were going to walk the whole thing and look at every star or even look for certain special stars. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is something you do that's secondary to other things done in Hollywood. If you're going to be on Hollywood Blvd, then, by all means, look down at the stars. But don't go out of your way just to see them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wmloyd4855
40,A walk on the wild side,Interesting set of engraved stars as reminders of stars both past and present. The whole area is movie centred including the many and various trips to the homes of the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuddyBrooke
40,Interesting. Lots of walking.,The walk of fame covers 15 blocks both sides of the street and has over 2600 starters. And if you need walking along and seeing all the people that are there. Difficult to actually see most of the stars do today walking traffic on the street. Also hard to look down at the stars and not walk into people on the sidewalk. Interesting creatures come out after dark and call them stones street performers. Kind of bizarre but interesting nonetheless. Very crowded and noisy but kind of fun for a short while. Parking is a challenge. Several parking garage is our off the main street and there are signs everywhere. An hour will cost you $20.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/916KenB
20,Walk of shame,"The walk of fame is the classic attracting which everybody wants to do when visiting LA. However, I was thoroughly underwhelmed. Central Hollywood is quite run down and there are a lot of tacky tourist shops and people trying to sell tours to you and fast food restaurants. Wasn't a massive fan of the area, and unless someone is being awarded their star I wouldn't even recommend visiting the walk of fame as essentially it is just stars in the ground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shmead13
30,OK but pretty over-rated,"This is a place you always hear of when you speak of visiting L.A. and, like everyone else, we just had to go to see what all the hype was/is about.To be honest, we're still asking ourselves that question: what's all the hype about?!On reflection, now that we've been there, if we hadn't gone there, I don't think it would have mattered all that much.Yes it's different and yes there's a different character to this place than there is in the rest of L.A. but, there's also, constantly, a great mass of people, walking along with their heads down to see who they're stepping on and stopping to take pictures which, is highly expected considering the attraction you're at but, makes it extremely hard to get around.The impersonators standing at the different stars are uncannily like the real celebrities and, from a distance, you'd be genuinely fooled. Don't be fooled to think you'll get a snap of them without paying a fee because they are exceptionally talented at avoiding the camera if you haven't slipped them some cash first!If you are trying to work out your itinerary for a visit to California and can fit this in, go for it! If you're tight on time, I wouldn't worry about it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhereToTry

30,Great to walk amongst the stars however “stars” not maintained,"We thoroughly enjoyed the walk along the Walk of Fame seeing the names of the stars that we have admired for so long.However, the stars are not maintained. The majority of them are filthy, have chewing gum stuck on them, cracked in several spots etc.It would be nice to see them maintained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GSTAA5
50,Loved this walk of fame.,"The walk of fame is an experience to go and see - you can see stars of all kinds, music, film, comedy etc etc. This is an excellent walk to go on we have been a few times and still go when we go back to LA. Loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yvonne68
40,"Definitely a MUST SEE!""","It is somewhat amazing to see all the names there-the tribute to David Bowie was very touching. There is a lot of pedestrian traffic so to stop and take pics is a juggling act-also the street vendors who try to lure you into the discount shops is somewhat of a distraction as well, but again the collection of names is impressive to say the least. We only had 30 minutes to do the walk so we missed some but again it was a nice 30 minute adventure. If I had to do it again I would start by the Chinese Theater and NOT by LaLa Land.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brooker813

30,It's nothing special,"Me and my family drove to Hollywood from Los Angeles and as tourists from London we had to go to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. However I must confess we were sourly disappointed, the Walk of Fame which stretches both pavements on the road were pretty dirty and unkempt. Moreover, aside from the plaques on the floor there is not much to see since the McDonalds and Hard Rock Cafe have pretty bad ratings. Furthermore, the stores which are located are not really noteworthy to purchase anything if you are looking to do some shopping as tourists. If you want to have a tour of Hollywood there a number of tour groups on the Walk of Fame offering to give you a ride around Hollywood and show you the residences of some of the stars that live there. However, apart from that I would just say it would be better of having a quick glimpse of the Walk of Fame and your favourite celebrity's plaque for a picture and then moving on towards the Hollywood sign where you get a beautiful view of the city instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amritpalh
40,Great to walk among the stars!,"It was an exciting little walk, seeing where all the stars placed their honours and become part of history. It was however a shame that the area itself was quite dirty and not really that well maintained.

30,A LOT of names,I guess this is something that you have to do when you go to Los Angeles but I would say: Don't get too excited about it. I didn't recognize a lot of the names and one end of the Walk of fame is actually in a rather dodgy neighbourhood. And it defnitly feels weird to step on other peoples names as a form of honoring them. That said - check ou Muhammad Alis star!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/662antoniab
40,Has to be done but once is enough!,We did a quick 30min walk around this part of Hollywood Blvd. It definitely is something one should see if in LA however I personally don't believe it warrants much time. Surrounding areas are dirty and run down and people are interesting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RodsieJ
40,A must do if you are in Hollywood.,Being a native Californian I have been here many times. This time we were with an out of town guest that had never been. It's fun to see it with someone still excited by it. Some of the stars are of people long forgotten but immortalized on this walk. It's a crowded area with lots to distract you from the stars so just take your time & enjoy the history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenl706
20,A bit grungy,"One of those things you probably feel you have to do, but I wouldn't leave a lot of time for it or have high expectations. And hold onto your possessions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacMBrisbane
50,The Stars have theirs stars,"The stretch of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street has over 2400 stars placed on a sidewalk. Around 500 are still blank and waiting. If you are a movie industry lover, it is truly exciting to walk these streets, see names and imagine them being honored there and feel their happiness as well. Be sure to always stumble upon someone you admired or still do",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/675larissab
40,Walk of Fame,It was exciting to see my favorite Stars names. I took some pictures with some of them. Problem was it was crowded and people will bump into when you stop to take a picture. I thought it would of been more glamorous but the surrounding area was kind of seedy. Watch your wallet.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/101ginas
50,Cool place,I was surprised by the number of names that we didn't know but it was great to see many names that we knew - a lot of tour people out hustling the toursLes7h,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Les7h
40,Find your favorite star,"Its always fun to walk around Hollywood and find your favorite star. It's really amazing to see how many years ago the movie stars were there having their hands and some feet imprinted into the cement. It's fun to match your hands size with the stars. Some men you would think had large hands, really are as small as a womens.There are a lot of shops around and can do some good people watching. It's rather a seedy area, park in a lot, not on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyandretired318
20,Review,The fun part is trying to find your favourite stars. I was very disappointed with the scenery tho. Very dumpy looking and when the red carpet comes to town they wash the streets and clean up the town. Other then that a lot of poverty unfortunately in the area. Lots of dollar store types in area for souvenirs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/714drews
40,You must do this at least once!,"You must do this while in Hollywood. Find your favorite star's star. Souvenir shops nearby. Lots of activity around the walk of fame. Wax museum, Chinese theater, Dolby theater, Jimmy Kimmel live theater, Highland shopping plaza and more. Take a walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joaniemaria
40,Fun Walk..,A stretch of sidewalk marked with stars bearing the names of entertainers who have made their fame in Hollywood. It's fun to come across the names of your favorite celeb in the stretch. The street gets filled with artists dressed like stars by the afternoon with whom one can take pictures with. It's a long walk and do bring in the camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dipbora
30,Underwhelmed,"Not what I thought it would be, fairly disappointing to see compared to what I imagined it would be like",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mickm333
40,Watch Out,You do have to be paying attention when you walk the stars. Someone is always looking down. I was impressed with some of the stars and some were cracked or dirty. I did like the challenge of finding my favorite stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/509cheriw
40,The cool thing here is finding the star you want and taking a selfie!,"This is two streets worth of Hollywood star names imprinted on the floor!We went during a busy period so it was difficult to stop and see all the names of the actors/actresses. I was gutted I couldn't find Ellen Degeneres. But on my bucket list for the next visit.The cool thing here is finding the star you want and taking a selfie!I would recommend spending 4-5 hours in this area, depending on whether you want to eat and shop here. The TCL Chinese Theatre, Hollywood Highland and Dolby Theatre are all within walking distance.There are lots of places to eat and cool architecture to take pictures - you can spend a whole afternoon here.You can even see the Hollywood sign on one of the balcony at Hollywood Highland - though you will need a pretty good lense to be able to take a decent picture!Weather was perfect too. It was hot during the day and by the evening it got a bit chilly so make sure you bring a jacket to keep warm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minibubblegum

30,Not that cool,"To be honest. I was expecting more of this place. But when I got there, I got a bit disapointed. It is pretty dirty, with a lot of crazy guys walking around and asking for money.

50,"Fame and vanity, all yours","Worth a walk if you want to have fun and find some stars you are fond of. But beware: it has been piling up, so, half an hour is not enough to see it all!

30,Not Impressed,"The street was very crowded and you really can't see all the stars on the street for all the people. Also, there were a lot of homeless people sleeping and laying all around.

30,One Visit Was More Than Enough,"Yes this place is famous but my gosh it is over rated.The place is filled with people trying to leach money off you and the streets aren't particularly clean.Overall, the street is pretty seedy and I wouldn't bother coming back for a second look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kosta100
30,A must-see -been-there-and-done that event,"Coming out of Hollywood Highlands for the first time, Hollywood Boulevard shows it spell, but after that initial factor, its just a boulevard, and the Walk of Fame a pavement, where you have to manoeuvre around people who wants to take the photo of a particular star. The stars are well maintained, but of course every day grime is visible. It is fun though to try to find stars or recall a long-forgotten star. Having seen the Walk of Fame, the Chinese Theatre to your right as you get out of the metro, has concrete pavement blocks with hand and foot prints. And finally, if you are really into the hunting of stars visit the Guitar Center Hollywood for the Rock Walk. Enjoy your walk through Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anitao455
20,"Not impressed by the Hollywood Walk of Fame, not impressed at all!","OK, maybe I was hyped too much or my expectations were too high, however I was really disappointed by the Hollywood Walk of Fame! I went there at night and it was full of drunk people, a lot of homeless as well. Overall the place is very dirty, the stars on the street are not impressive as well...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DimitarDimitrov
20,Didn't live up to the Hype,"This place is famous right? This is where you go to reminisce about your favourite movie stars and get a photo near the names on the walk right? You can do this there is no argument about that. The things I didn't want to contend with is the poor disadvantaged guys on the street trying to get by and asking for change, the guys who dress up as characters trying to get a tip out of you for a photo, every second person trying to sell you a tour of the stars homes and the condition of the walk itself looks as though the state of California needs to make an investment into the maintenance of one of its main attractions. I could go on however I will put this caveat on my review that I am not someone who is starstruck and I did enjoy my first early morning walk down Hollywood Boulevade. For me it was good to see and not good to linger.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosst256
40,How many do you know,"It was fun to walk the length of the Walk of Fame and see who we knew as we read the names on the stars.

40,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"As a required tourist attraction when in LA I went with family to visit this landmark. Found a few stars of favorite actors/actresses/musicians.

Chinese theater nice, lots of souvenir and thrift shops around, much cheaper than airport for sure for t-shirts, oscars, mugs, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aghyba
30,"Pavement Tourist Attraction - don't have high expectations, then its fun to see!","Second visit, and it had improved since nearly 14 years ago. Expectations are high when you've seen this place look exciting on the TV so many times. However, it is just a pavement that is crowded, manic and it is a tourist attraction that draws the weird and wonderful! If you visit the Tourist Information in the main shopping centre they have a free list of the stars and where you will find them as they are all over Hollywood. They will also provide you, for $7 a list of the stars homes to self tour. You can pick up all sorts of Hollywood souvenirs from the shops including fake oscars, t-shirts etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poroger
20,Not as glitzy as I thought it would be.,"I should have known the walk would be more exercise than sightseeing when I couldn't find a free map of the stars. Not only was it hard to find specific artists because of all the people just walking along and the hawkers trying to get you to take their 'tour of the stars' but it was also a bit dingy...I had expected glitz and glamour but got mostly smog. Having said that, it was still nice to see the stars...I just had to give up my need to find specific ones and go with the flow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dfscully

10,Stars,Needs to be sign posted better from the hotelAt check in it would have been helpful if we had been offered a mapSo we knew which direction to walk for the strip also if the stars were mapped so we knew where to find specific stars that would have been helpful as we did not always have Internet accessAlsoOn the web site it specified we would have Internet access as it turns out this us only in the lobby and not in your rooms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjane70
20,"Hey movie stars, fix this mess!!","Oh, how I longed for yesteryear. Hollywood Blvd was likely a classy place 50 years ago. Now it is a seething mess of derelicts and nut-bags. We even saw some of the stars on the sidewalk with he medallion broken out of them. Seriously, Los Angeles and the mighty rich who profit from Hollywood should fix this place once and for all.

20,Worth a brief visit but it was pretty meh,"When in LA for the first time yes its good to say youve been there but overall it wasn't much to write home about. The chinese theatre was cool to look at but the truck loads of chinese tourists was a bit crazy and a put off.It was fun finding your fav actor or singer for like 15 mins but couple that with the run down shops, homeless, street characters asking for money and those dodgy looking tour vans then it gets old relatively quick.Overall have a look then get out of there. Not worth it. Go on a tour of warner bros or go to Universal studios if you need some education of the happenings of hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DChewie

40,See the stars,Walking along the walk of fame was interesting and a little nostalgic because they have stars from a wide range of eras and different media. You'll definitely see a star for someone you didn't expect and you'll see one that makes you remember something from years ago.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewmS3206GT

50,Exactly like the movies,"I was in awe at the atmosphere of this place! It may be tacky but it was such good fun tracking down your favourite celebs!

If you're in Hollywood, make sure you pay a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CPB1987
40,Cool and crowded,"There's just something about walking along the streets of Hollywood and looking down to find the star of your favourite actors, musicians, etc. I really enjoyed walking down the walk of fame and taking pictures with the stars. Although I had a great experience, -1 for the people who try to take tourists' money aka those who dress up as characters and get you to take photos with them and ask for money or people giving your their mix tapes. Don't give into it!! I went during the summer so it can get pretty crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessjess14
30,Not what I had hoped,"It was really neat to see the walk of fame, however the things surrounding it left much to be desired. Rundown shops and homeless people were everywhere. It felt dirty walking up and down the street. I am glad we went, because I can say I was there, but not likely i'll ever return.This being said drive a block or to and there were better dining areas and more shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Bethvh
40,Worth a visit.,"The whole area is heavily occupied with beggars, mental health disabled homelessness and annoyingly - hawkers. They will engage you with 'where are you from' and a handshake. Immediately they'll hand you a 'free' music Cd from an 'up and coming artist'. Ultimately they'll demand a donation. Really put me off the area and there are dozens using the same pitch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonymc47
10,Overrated,"Dont know what the big buzz is about. Its just a filthy pavement with stars. Its overcrowded and filled with people in costumes who just want money for taking a picture with you. Save your time, there are better places to visit in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PavelH230

20,Tinsel and tacky,If seeing movie stars names - sometimes handprints in the cement - is your bag then the boulevard wont disappoint.To me Tinsel Town and the landmark Chinese theatre gives a feel of the tacky so well portrayed in Pretty Woman. Maybe the cold light if day reveals all the warts not visible during the opening night spectaculars. But my impression is a false marketplace embracing the American ideal of making a buck out of anything. Not worth the effort unless you are truly starstruck!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/postscript65
30,See the Stars ... and lots of people,"Just had to check this one off our list of things to do in Hollywood. The Stars actually go a long way, and we walked the entire distance. It was neat to see mostly names of yesteryear, but our young teenagers barely recognized 10% of the names, so not very interesting for them. During the day, it felt pretty safe, because there were so many people lining the sidewalks. Saw the outside of the Chinese Theatre, strolled through a mall right there, ate at a Johnny Rockets, but other than that, the neighborhood wasn't very appealing as far as things to do. Go once just to see it for yourself, but once is enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20854Dave_K

40,a short stint on our way to anaheim,"We had a quick visit here after checking out of Santa Monica, on our way out to Anaheim. We walked a couple blocks, up Vine St and I managed a shot of the Hollywood & Vine marker. It was a lovely winter's day, and not too crowded. There are a number of people spruiking their stars homes tours, some looking not-so-reputable i must say. Stopped for a coffee at Starbucks. I think further up from where we parked there were more recent stars (but I did manage to get a photo of the Ellen|JLo|Jennifer Anniston|Thalia area, as well as the Beatles on Vine, which were pretty cool! We didn't get as far as Walt Disney. I must admit having the surname of Adams we were wanting to know if there was an Addams Family star - which there isn't - but would have been cool to get our photo taken with one (friends of ours have surname of Simpson and their ""The Simpsons"" photo was way cool!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/superj1978
30,a little run down and dirty,First impression was so much people and the place looked a little run down and dirty. It was pretty cool walk around and lots of shopping and wax museum was awesome!! Don't get ripped off by those people who wears costumes! They charged me $20 for one photo using my phone! I didn't want to pay but they were very aggressive and wanted money. So beware!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NathalieO434

40,"Come See The Stars, And Lots Of People","Hollywood Walk of Fame is something that everyone should walk.

20,Don't go at night!,"After attending an attraction on Hollywood Blvd. in the evening we decided to walk along the walk of fame while looking for a taxi. The area looks run down during the day but at night it gets plain seedy and frankly feels quite dangerous. It's very cool to see the stars but it was not the environment I was expecting at all! When you watch the celebs unveil their new star, the organisers somehow keep the background from truly showing what the neighbourhood is like. Trying to find a taxi was impossible and because we have overseas mobiles using data for Uber wasn't possible. Our last resort was to make a £5 phone call to a taxi company. Definitely don't go at night, try to go with a group and prearrange to have a ride back to your hotel. The whole Hollywood experience was a disappointment, but the walk of fame proved to be especially falsely presented by the media. I'm glad to say I've been here in person but would never go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreK933

30,Busy!,"Worth seeing and experiencing but if you crowd to the centre of graumans theatre, expect large crowds and the dreaded cd scam, if someone offers you a cd, don't take it!! Would still recommend seeing it, don't forget it spans for some length so walk away from the crowds a bit, you will still find some great stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrishTravler96

40,David Bowie's Star,"My husband's cousin from Kansas (my fun new friend) and I walked the Walk last Sunday. The purpose of the trip was to visit David Bowie's star. ♡ I live in southern California and it's fun to take a day trip to Hollywood to be a tourist with an out of towner. I was terrified that parking would be a problem, but there was plenty. Traffic there wasn't even that bad. We parked near Toi on Sunset Thai restaurant (awesome!) as we planned a late lunch there afterwards. We walked about a mile to the Chinese Theatre, took a left and found the star. We walked around the area a bit and took pictures. Walking back to the restaurant there was a band setting up on the sidewalk. After lunch we listened to a couple songs. They were pretty good! Great day! *Remember, it's Hollywood, there are a lot of homeless. Keep aware of your surroundings when visiting.*",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gimpyk
40,Terrific honor for some of our greatest...,"It's fun to see the stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. You just never know who you are going to run into -- or should I say -- walk over, or where.

30,A good stop on a tourist trip,"The attraction itself really is just a bunch of stars on the ground, but the area that it is in is worth visiting. Especially if it is your first time in LA. There is a nice mall right there, and one of the better views of the Hollywood Sign is from inside that mall. And there are a couple of cool stores on that street.While I was there the street was closed off for a movie premiere / red carpet event. I could still see all the stars but it was pretty crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20priscillab
30,"Good Experience, but not that great!",Its overrated for sure! The walk of fame isn't that great though its nice to see some famous names as you walk down this road. Its rather crowded though. The TLC Chinese Theatre thats close by has hand and foot prints of celebrities and these are pretty interesting. You can get a view of the Hollywood sign from here too. There are other attractions like the Hollywood wax museum and Ripleys'. You can drive down to Beverly hills and Mulholland Drive too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlokKarande

40,"More than the place, the people!","Next stop: Walk of Fame! It surprised me how easy it was to park my car very close to the Walk of Fame and the Chinese Theater. Many public parks available and charging a very honest price! Take a time there, try to find funny characters within the stars on the sidewalk (my preferred ones were Woodpecker and Mickey Mouse) but mostly pay attention to the people. The nicest thing to do there is to sit in a coffee and stare to the streets looking the craziest people in the world. I’m not talking only about the people dressed like movie characters performing to make some money, but mainly from the individuals who are just walking around! Hope nobody was looking at me and thinking the same!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robertopelomundo
40,Great experience!,"Amazing to see all the stars and good to see they take the time to wash the sidewalks to keep the stars clean. Unfortunately, the walk of fame includes many homeless people which doesn`t make the walk pleasant at times but we never felt unsafe. It takes approx. 4 hours to walk both sides of the walk of fame.

This is one of the most disappointing places in L.A. I thought the place would be illuminated and be very lively. It's the media that has created such vibe and hype about this sidewalk. Just go there to fulfill one of your wishes and to check off from the bucket-list, nothing else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tazrianahmed91
30,Historical Walk of Your Favorite Stars,"A must see in Hollywood. It is a very good experience walking through this famous boulevard to take a picture of your favorite star. Many fun attractions are also located along the boulevard including Madame Tussaud's, Ripley's Believe it or Not, and Jimmy Kimmel Live.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdortiz
30,Only few blocks of frill,"The place is fine with all the hype and everything but can be shady after few blocks. We went there around 8 PM, had to pay for parking/hr and returned back within 30 mins or so thanks to the area. Both side of roads has star tiles with movie stars name on them but I was very disheartened to know Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't have any star. :( Also, there were few salesman on road and when I didn't pay much attention to them, he hollered back at me. So basically, not a good experience.Walk of Fame also has TCL, Madame Tussad's, Hollywood Museum and few night out places to make the street more interesting.I personally would recommend the place to all if you have some time in hand but not during night time (esp. to families with young kids and female solo travelers )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/899indus
30,Keep your expectations in check,"It's one of those touristy things you have to do if you’re in the area but keep your expectations in check. I was expecting a much grander shrine to Hollywood's elite but in reality, it's just a sidewalk in a crummy neighborhood.Nothing else really remarkable to do or see in the immediate vicinity besides a few tourist trap souvenir shops and Grauman's Chinese theatre which is certainly nothing to write home about either.The area is littered with folks out to scam you from impersonators that take photos with you for tips, to wanna be rappers trying to sell you cd's, people selling tickets to this or that, as well as street performers just trying to grind out a living. A simple ""no thank you"" is generally enough to discourage them but if you do decide to partake in whatever they are selling, do so at your own risk.I imagined we would be able to have a few drinks and a bite to eat but there isn't much there. Can't imagine staying longer than an hour or so… Be sure to keep this in mind as parking fees are quite expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/outlaw1865
30,to do and to cross of the LA check list,"This is something you have to do while in LA, but don't have your expectations running wild. It's a street with names of the stars written on the pave walk - that's it.There are a lot of souvenir shops and lot of tour agents trying to sell you tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobeTrotter_x80x
30,"A must do, at least once","While this is a must do, at least once. This time we went at night and it was particularly dirty feeling. The smells of cigarettes, loud colognes, and street food vendors was overwhelming. The area is just cheesy, souvenir shops and celebrity look a likes who pose for pictures in expectation of tips. It's touristy, but it is cool to see the stars, hand and foot prints and the Chinese theatre. But that's about it. Does not take long to see it and be done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thescottfam

50,A Really Neat Place to go,"If you want to see and experience Hollywood history then you got to go and experience it. Here you can see the new and old stars of movies, TV and radio and know you are standing or walking where your favorite stars have gone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertsV6335CD
30,The Walk,"Another free thing to do in the city of Los Angeles. I didn't walk the whole walk because frankly after a while it will lead you into some not so secure parts of the walk. There seems to be a definite line of demarcation of where you should stop. I went further than that and almost had my camera taken out of my hands. I guess lucky for me I noticed the guy walking toward us had an unusual stride and seemed bent on wanting to walk into me, when I moved right before he past me, he practically fell over because he leaned in and had his hands out toward my camera. But since I moved he had nothing to grab on to and then he bolted.So I would recommend doing this with at least two other people and keep aware of your surroundings and the people around you. Once the area around the walks starts to look shady, run down, and the stars on the walk look in desperate need of repair turn around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judie2015
40,A must see for everyone,This is definitely a must see attraction and it's free. It is much longer than I realized until I walked the entire thing. It's difficult to find specific stars because there is no easy map that I have found. It's also not a clean sidewalk and you must avoid panhandlers for a major section of it. It's never closed (unless there is a special event like a premiere then part of it will be inaccessible) but I wouldn't recommend going alone at night if you aren't familiar with the area. It's not the safest of areas mostly because of the crazy street people that can get quite aggressive at times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppetgirldotnet
40,Bob Hope & Phyllis Diller found immediately!,"We started our walk down to what used to Graumans Chines Theater (name now changed) and were amazed at how many of the stars on the sidewalk we recalled and had fond memories from in our past. The best finds were Bob's and Phyllis's. The theater was smaller than I had imagined, but interesting. Parking wasn't easy and was over priced. But, going at our own pace was best for us as we wanted more time than offered by tour groups. Fortunately, all of the places we wanted to see were not very far from each other. Thanks to my iPhone gps and Siri, we easily went from one attraction to the next seamlessly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelingirl1967
30,Main Street for Visitors to Las Vegas...,"Come early! Especially if you are driving, because parking is indeed a premium here. All parking are paid and even so, if you come by after mid day, you will need some time to find a parking space. Look out for signs indicating parking and the charges. We paid $10 for valet parking right beside TCL Chinese Theater. Although there really isn't much to do along this street, it has all the glamour clamour vibes of Hollywood. From the star plaques on the streets to entertainers in costumes vying to take a picture with you, the street is filled with activities. Note! You are expected to tip the entertainers if you take a picture with them. No standard charge but i heard a fiver is well appreciated. There are plenty to eat and see and you can also hop on one of the open top buses to go around Hollywood boulevard and visit some celebrities' homes. Authenticity to be verified of course...If you are sooooo obsessed with taking a picture of the HOLLYWOOD sign, go onto level 3 of Hollywood Highland mall for the best view. Also, when you are walking along the streets and some hip hop looking men approached you with CD claiming they are popular or famous around here, just reject and walk on. They would push a CD onto your hands and ask you for some cash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LarsonSG
50,This was fun,Christmas Day we decided to go to the area since it's always open to just check out some of the stars. Was surprised much of the shopping in the area was also open. It was a lot of fun to find different stars and a few photo opportunities. The kids found those who they could relate to and the adults found theirs. Brought back some memories around Bob Hope and a few others even that my grandparents use to follow.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jiberjab
20,Interesting but nothing else around it,"It was interesting to see the stars buy we thought we could have a couple of drinks and grab some food, soaking in Hollywood's atmosphere. That wasn't to be, apart from Hard Rock Cafe, there isn't much there apart from people selling tours and expensive shopping. Would recommend only an hour long visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GinnySherwin

A must see when visiting LA.Hot Tip: plan on ending your walk at the chinese theater to see the hand prints and foot prints of many of the iconic actors and actresses with stars on the Walk of Fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiegoCandela

20,concrete stars: so what,"With so much to do in LA, Hollywood walk of fame is not one of my favorites. You've seen one star embedded in the sidewalk : you've seen them all. Some of the street performers are good, but so many theaters and concerts venues are offering inexpensive tickets, where you can see professionals: the choices are endless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tani101
30,It's a dirty sidewalk littered with stars from a byegone era,"The only stars, in my opinion, worth seeing are John Lennon's and George Harrison's. In 2009 they added a star for George Harrison, alongside the existing star for John Lennon in front of the famous Capitol Records building on Vine Street. It's a perfect location for their stars and makes a good photo opportunity. You can find a decent place to eat close to that location too.Hollywood Blvd., the classic ""Walk of Fame"" is so dirty now, littered with bars and cheap tourist stores selling junk, as opposed to the trendy and interesting shops and restaurants that used to line the street, that there's not much there except the dirty stars! It smells like urine in places. You'd think they'd at least hose it down now and then, since it doesn't rain often enough to clean it. Since the Hollywood/Highland shopping complex was built, Hollywood Boulevard began to die a slow death. That said, you could wander along that dirty street and find some stars, but beware of the thieves and homeless that wander there too. I find it sad that the city has let it become so nasty.The Chinese Theater located at the top of the Walk of Fame, with all of the hand imprints will be interesting to see, but now there are those ""characters"" all around that will try to charge you for having your picture taken with them. Sometimes they get very aggressive. Just be aware and you'll be fine. It's a beautiful old theater that is well worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/538suzannee
20,Save Time. Avoid It.,"If you visit Los Angeles and want to fit in as much as you can, let this make your bottom list of stuff to see. It isn't worth the trip to see obscenely crowded walkways and bump into tourists who obsess about standing or even laying in front of Adam Sandlers name on a star. There are many places to eat around here, but I don't recommend any. It's a tourist driven location and that means high prices, large crowds and terrible food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomguzow
50,Pretty cool to see in person!,"Seeing the Walk of Fame with the stars on the sidewalk, in person, is well worth the trip! It's something many tourists do, but I went here as a local and it's pretty cool to see this in person after seeing it on TV many times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brent_N_Hunter
40,Must see,It's a must see if you've come this length but don't expect the glitz and glamour of Hollywood quite the opposite it's like most tourist attractions full of tack and memorabilia but the stars on the sidewalk are all there just a matter of finding your favourites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/normanh7
40,Famous Hollywood Walk of Fame,"This is a must do event if in California or if from another country. The scene is lively with lots to see. There's food, music, bars and tattoo shops. Much of this is within walking distance. Other popular places are Grauman's Chinese theatre, Wax museum, Amoeba music, Roosevelt Hotel and Grauman's Chinese Theatre. If you are a pork eater, don't miss the bacon wrapped hot dog carts, they're very good. These are just some of the many sites locally and most within walking distance. Venice beach, Santa Monica pier, Laugh Factory and garment district require cab ride from Hollywood. There are homeless people around so don't be surprised.Just a few minutes from LAX with the Fly Away bus That can drop you off in the scene. Taxi cabs are readily available to get around Los Angeles and to and from the Lax or Burbank airports.

20,Not Worth The Effort!,It's just a street with a few stars on the floor. It can be a hassle with people bothering you trying to sell tours etc. Nothing special!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Olly13538
30,"Worth a visit, but just once","The first time I visited he Walk of Fame was decades ago as a child and I enjoyed it. I'm not sure if it's because it has changed since then or I have grown up, but I didn't feel any of that pizazz on my recent visit.The best part is probably the hand prints at the Chinese Theatre, but other than that it's just a long sidewalk with stars. There are people all over pestering you about tours and I saw some costumed guys harassing tourists for not tipping after taking photos.If you're looking for a specific star, I would Google ""Walk of Fame list"" rather than walking around aimlessly, as it can take ages to find otherwise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daniko8
40,interesting,"it is a side walk with star names. Mainly a tourist attraction place with souvenior shops near by. You won't be able to find all the names of actors/actresses that you would like to in a short period. Depending on your interest, it is to be spent only less than an hour or to spend there for hours looking for your favourite stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leo218
30,PROCEED WITH CAUTION,"Honestly it's a must see if you're a tourist visiting and if you have a favorite actor/singer. Just be warned that you should exercise caution when you go. Many of the people on the walk are nuts. Last summer I witnessed man pull a chain out and beat up another man on a crowded hot day. If someone famous is there, people are in a frenzy and you can get hurt. Also be warned when it comes to the characters in costume. They are thiefs, as a spider man tried to take my camera this last December and a ""spongebob"" poked me and cussed me out as I tried to take a picture of him. It was super scary. Not to mention that the area by Madame Tussaude's has a variety of wackjobs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KharysTz

40,Nice walk if you're into celebrities and Hollywood history,"We've been numerous times. Hollywood is still Hollywood, plenty of sidewalk characters, shady and otherwise. It is definitely a tourist area, with plenty of shops to get tourist trinkets, but if I was visiting for a short while I would skip this stretch and discover local neighborhoods instead such as West Hollywood or Los Felix areas to get a taste authentic Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Radius360la

Happy didn't end up staying here in a hotel. Would've hated it. The stars are fun to look at. Although as someone else said, many are out front of stripper clothing stores (seems to be a lot of these). Towards Hollywood/Vine. We went for pizza along the way at a run down looking pizzeria, that was great. Going outside wasn't fun. Saw a movie at the Chinese theatre and that was definitely worth it. We caught a train in and that was an experience all on its own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atuckw

40,Walk of Fame - Fun if You're in the Area,"The ""stars on Hollywood Boulevard"" is a talked about historical favorite from years past when Hollywood was everyone's fantasy and dreamland. Now, with the ease and speed of not only travel, but information, this is one of those ""oldie but goodies."" It remains fun to walk down the streets of Hollywood and see how many of the names in the stars you know.

I might this was explicitly against his recommendation that it was absolutely not worthing seeing. He was absolutely right - nothing at all worth seeing here as far as we were concerned. The road itself and general area is pretty run down, and the ""Walk of fame"" is boring after you've walked over the first 5 stars.Unless you're in the area, don't make a special trip to come visit this part of town.

30,Crazy place -- a tourist trap,"Hollywood and especially the walk of fame (on Hollywood Blvd and Vine) can be a crazy place. Clearly, it's a tourist trap. I would recommend walking down Hollywood Blvd early in the morning when there are no crowds or hustlers. I was surprised how small the entrance to Grauman's Chinese theater is. Anyway, in front of the theater you can see the hand- and footprints of some famous people. Not that exiting, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hamppu

Get excited recognising the names of the stars on the footpath, look at the shops and buildings as you wander along, play trivia trying to work out who the stars are that you don't know. You can start anywhere and go for as long as you like. This is really Hollywood. And it's great fun and it's free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul62Canberra
50,Advice from a Local,"Although the Walk of Fame, the famous stars embedded in the sidewalks, runs up and down Hollywood Blvd. from North Gower Street to the east and North La Brea Avenue to the west, the main section of the strip runs from Highland to La Brea. Although this is the busiest section of the Walk of Fame, it includes the famed Chinese Theatre on the north side of Hollywood Blvd. where there are footprints, handprints and inscriptions in the cement (a ""don't miss it"" - ""must see"" part of the experience). Parking on this section of Highland is non-existent, but just south of Hollywood Blvd. on Orange behind the Coffee Bean on the corner, there is a parking structure that is the most convenient way to then walk to the main stretch of Hollywood Blvd., less than a block away. Also worth seeing, just North of Hollywood Blvd. at 1750 Vine Street, is The Beatles Walk of Fame star. It is directly in front of the entrance doors to the famed, record shaped (round) Capital Records building.If you are looking to actually see famous folks while in town (not downplaying the Walk of Fame - but they don't hang-out in places like this), try walking around on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills (a couple miles to the west of Hollywood Blvd.). On weekend mornings, many can be seen hiking up (and down) Runyon Canyon at 2000 N.Fuller in Hollywood (a few blocks west and a couple of blocks north of Hollywood Blvd.). It is frequently hiked by an incredible array of contemporary film, television, and music industry people - but you have to look more closely because they are not in their glamour attire! Many times you will recognize their voices before their faces - everyone kind of blends-in up there. Be polite, though - they aren't expecting fans up there and it is better to just do the hike and enjoy the ""scenery"" rather than approach them. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenel714
30,Not interesting for children,This attraction is not a good for children because there are no stars that children under age 11 will know of. But otherwise it is fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goodgooseberries

Nevertheless, a nice experience to see, also with the people in costumes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharianto
30,"Worth going, but also worth missing.","Despite growing up in California, this was my first (and likely last) visit to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. But since I had relatives in town, it was something to do.Pros: Seeing some cool names of people you don't normally think about, and people watching. There are folks in costume, etc who you can take pictures with.Cons: Kind of dirty, not well maintained. Also, lots of pick-pockets and people trying to sell you tours. I think there was a tour salesman every 30 feet or so. My recommendation - carry your wallet in your front pocket (like I do when I am in the third world) and leave the purses in the car.Overall it wasn't bad, though getting into and out of the area by car is somewhat painful. It is worth going once to check it off the bucket list, but doubt I will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkUSNA1998

50,Walk the Walk!,"If you are ever in Hollywood, CA - or anywhere in LA for that matter... you MUST visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Hollywood Blvd. It is a MUST SEE! Every star has walked the walk of the fame, and you should as well! See hundreds of stars (no, literally - the actually star imprints on the ground), hand prints, foot prints [in front of the Chinese Theater], shops, eateries, TV characters (people dressed in costumes only), performers, high-end stores, souvenir shops, eateries, museums, etc., etc, etc.! There is sooooooo much fun for the entire family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skystar2
30,walking on the Walk of Fame...,"for me it was disappointing, however, it was pretty crowded, people from all over the world have been there and it is a must see attraction...I expected everything to be in more style, it is from my point of view a low level attraction and as usual, not the walk of fame is wanted, just your/our money, parking for $ 30.00, I think they are made, but it seems people pay it. We went down the road where the Hollywood Museum is and paid $ 10 bucks for all day parking...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDHanke
50,Go at night,Go at night when there are less people around. Don't forget to stop in to see the hand and shoe prints. It's a once and a lifetime event that everyone should do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B8089YGjohns
30,Good for a visit,"The place is full of entertainment history. The dolby n Chinese theatre are quite cool. Lots of characters standing there for photo (you need to pay them)If looking for specific star name on the side, highly recommend to check for its exact spot before hand (just google it). I was looking for QUEEN n found them to be almost a mile up Hollywood blvd.Be careful when checking out the many stars on the side, around dolby-tcl-madam tuseau it can be really crowded and here there are peoole coming up to you trying to get your name n give out cd. So...just stay alert and watch your pockets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/narup0ns
10,Don't waste your time,"Unless you are star-struck by signs, don't waste your time. I literally felt like I needed to take a shower once I left the area. It is filthy and smells awful. The whole area is seedy and nasty. Did not enjoy this at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginasearay
50,Bit of a letdown very overrated.,I know this is a must do for many tourists but I felt I nearly blinked and missed Hollywood it reminded me of a souped up Blackpool. I found it quite seedy and not at all nice area I was honestly disappointed but this is purely my own personal opinion. I much preferred West Hollywood or Sunset Boulevard to sit in one of the cafes/restaurants and watch the world go by. This review is based from my travel in the US at the end of 2008.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AI644
30,Quick Visit but Move on Quickly,We all wanted to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame so I would do a quick visit so you can check it off your list. We paid for parking which was expensive and probably could have parked on a side street for free. We were all happy we saw some of the stars but would not recommend spending much time over 10-30 minutes as we didn't like the area and we were also aggressively hassled by the tour people soliciting business. It was a huge let down but we weren't sure what to expect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Farleymon
30,Overcrowded not fun,"It's overcrowded and there are hustlers all along the road. It's not a great experience.,, it's just an experience really.I've visited on 4 occasions with different folk. I wouldn't ever go back really if I'm honest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharon3001
10,In LA,"Expected different. It was sooooo crowded, that we could not see all of the stars. I guess during the week early in the am is the best time to walk and enjoy the walk of fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ankemom
50,Beatiful place,"Everyone nice, lots of souvenirs, very nice places to visit, guided tours, on Hollywood Blvd you can find things you never imagined",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/172juanmanuelr
50,Unique Experience,Had to do it! Where else do you walk on the sidewalk reading stars? Fun time. Unique and different. A must do for any tourist!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cabotoy
50,Busy with Disney characters and guys wanting money for a music CD,"Loved the buzz but did get tedious with all the street performers and peop,e trying to sell things. It's free so that's a massive plus",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seagull021
40,Great place to escape from reality,"It was great walking around Hollywood walk a fame, not only seeing different celebrities names on the walk but running into famous movie characters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shakeels2018
50,Holidays 2016/2016,Very interesting to see all the names all long sidewalk. Some spots busier then others so it is hard to catch a good look or take a picture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellylmillar
40,Hollywood Movie Stars Memories,"This attraction is free and is suitable for the young or old who love looking at the icon stars of their favourite movie stars or pop star idols. The icon stars are on both sides of the Hollywood Boulevard strip and it is a long strip. You can walk up and down the street and try to find your favourite one. Legends like Robin Williams, John Travolta, Danny Thomas, John Wayne, Victoria Secrets and many many more. The list goes on and on... The street is very busy with tourists but that won't stop you from looking or taking photos. There are a lot of people dressed up in costumes like Spider-Man or Marilyn or Batman and the want to take photos with you and charge you US$10 or $20 so be firm and say NO. There are a lot souvenir shops there as well & one souvenir shop has Elvis Presley's Cadillac worth US$1,000,000.00. They have a full time security guard standing there to keep an eye on the car but they will let you take a photo of it. It is really cool. There are a lot of tour agencies trying to get your business so again if you don't want to be hassled just say No thank you and they will leave you alone. If you are in Hollywood than you have to do the Walk of Fame, the best part it is free & you don't need a tour agency to take you around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulettea621
20,Bit of a let down,As a local I always feel bad for tourists who come to see Hollywood blvd. It's just an ordinary street with some stars on the pavement. Don't stay around here especially if you are with kids. The surrounding area is noisy and dirty. There is barely any public transport. The Chinese theatre and a couple other places and you're done. There is some shopping but just chain stores and tourist shops you can see it all in 4 hours or less. Get a hotel in Santa Monica or The South Bay where you can walk to the beach and there are lots of buses or bikes for rent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/256claudiam
20,It's Hollywood,"Took the friends from Iowa, saw the stars took pics and left. It is of course a tourist trap, very crowded but a must see for out of towners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/517DianaH
20,Phew,The footpath is always covered in urine. It really stinks. It is never hosed down. Lots of stars are broken. Lots of homeless people begging. A total disgrace for Los Angeles government. 30 years ago it was clean and something to be proud of.. and it was CLEAN,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liz822
20,Better seen on Television ...,"Shabby, Dirty and Crowded. We took the tour and it is not like the movies. If you do go, be sure to stay close to the Highland & Hollywood area. Venture east at your own peril. We took a most likely illegal, open air tour of the Home of the Starz! Our driver proceeded to drive like it was a Nascar tryout and broke nearly every traffic law. He must have had issues with the police, as he made 3 U-turns at speed to avoid the men in blue. All we saw were large iron gates and tall ivy covered walls, with the commentary, ""Madonna once stayed here!""It's checked off the bucket list but it's not recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GearyOutWest
50,Great experience but be prepared...,"Had 1 day to sightsee in Hollywood with my wife and 2 teenage daughters and made a point to spend some time exploring the stars on the Walk of Fame. Had a great time searching for the stars of our favorite actors / actresses and singers. It was a nice sunny day, we had a great walk and took lots of pictures. There are several people dressed up in costumes in front of the Chinese Theater that you can take pictures with (super heroes, cartoon characters, etc. – our favorite was Jack Sparrow!). These folks do expect donations if you take a picture with them so bring some $1 bills. We had lunch at Mel’s diner which was great (see my review) and there are plenty of other restaurants to choose from. We also bought some T-shirts and other “touristy type stuff” in one of the many gift shops and also visited Madam Tussauds wax museum which I highly recommend (see my review). We got lucky and were offered coupons for 50% off admission to the museum while taking some photos of the Chinese Theater which is right next door. A couple of negative things to note that took away from our experience a little. Be prepared to be approached by the guys that try to push their CDs on you for a donation especially in front of the Chinese Theater. Just say “no” to them politely – they will follow you a bit but will eventually give up and go after another tourist. There are also many drivers trying to get people to take their “star tours” – they can be pretty aggressive trying to hand you their pamphlets but again, just say no politely if you are not interested. If you are interested in a tour, some of the vehicles look nicer / more professional than others so pick a good one or do some research on Trip Advisor before you go to get reviews on the best tour companies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EaglesFan11
20,Don't go here at night,This was too much at night!!! A lot dirtier and unsafe than I expected. Panhandling and people trying to hit you up for money...Day trip to see a star's star...but that's about all!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginawilliams80
30,Okay,"Definitely a long walk to find my favorite stars. (They didnt have any map or guide to show the exact location of the artists' stars). Best to go during daylight (I went in the nightime and there were homeless people everywhere). Overall, it was okay (maybe just to check off your bucket list)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afzasones
20,Way over rated!,"During my visit I thought whilst I was there I would go to the walk of fame. Not only was it a very dirty part of town, there were people dressed in costumes who charge you for photos (up to $20USD).I would not bother to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaniW_86
30,Iconic so worth the trip !,"Definitely not what I had expected but I'm still glad we made the time . The area is not well maintained and quite grubby with cheap touristy shops all along the way. The characters plying your for money to take pics with them feels intrusive and a bit annoying. Despite all this , it's still fun to make your way along searching for your favorites. We were also lucky enough to actually watch the process of making a Star . The road was closed for the Star Wars premier which added a bit of excitement but made crossing from one side to the next more difficult",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimDomi
40,Interesting,Wandering down the walk was interesting.Seeing celebrity names was fun.The downside is everywhere you look people are looking at the ground so getting jostled is very common.Appears to be a prime tour bus stop so can busy.Look alikes pose for paid pictures which can be interesting to see.Worth a least a quick visit since it is unique.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hawkeyetob
50,A must do!!!,Stopped here for a quick glance at the newest starlet on the walk Mariah Carey but of course we had to go say hello to Marilyn Monroe star also. A fun thing to do for anyone and one of the best parts about it is that it's free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rshaneel
50,Upgraded significantly since my last visit,"We were pleasantly surprised with the upscale shops and restaurants in the area. The Stars were fun to see as we walked. The tourist shops had a lot of cheap stuff. A good view of the Hollywood sign is from the Hollywood and Highland mall. We couldn't get close to the hand and footprints in front of Grauman's Chinese theater due to the line set up for Star Wars, so that was a bummer. We were there early and it started to get crowded as we were leaving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovingNewAdventures
40,Walk in fames Stars,Enjoy the stars and famous people enjoy the foods and night life enjoy the theatre and cinemas just get out from star war fantastic movie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hakiem007
40,Exciting energy and free,Walk up and down Hollywood Blvd and read the names of stars young and old. Fun energy to Hollywood and lots of terrific people watching. Free activity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyu390
50,Quick walk,My wife and I visited the walk of fame on Christmas eve so everything was shutting down early . Bring your camera and you will not only see stars but street performers as well . We had a great time not to be missed .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rdkng12
30,"Worth half an hour to say you saw it, but nothing exciting",Interesting but crowded and lots of tourist trap shops around with pushy tour guides selling tickets for rides to see the stars homes etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lojomu
30,Zoo but must see,"Kids has not seen this.. We hopped out of terrible traffic..walked toNext blockTo meet our car..packed at holidays w tourists and hard to see too much while you are guarding your people, your handbag etcGo and see a movie here-that would be a great idea and uber back and forth since parking and traffic are terrible!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drmader
40,Iconic,This is a once in a lifetime stop. It goes without saying - if you visit Hollywood you go to the walk of fame.It is just an overcrowded walkway but nonetheless it's an iconic part of Hollywood history.The museums and theatres and look a likes along the strip make for good sights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MasterRater
40,Great but ...,"The Walk of Fame was great. The stars on the sidewalk were cool, but some need care and attention. The theatres and restaurants are great. Very easy to get to using the Metro. However, the street is really really busy. Street performers swamp the sidewalk and make it difficult when crowded. Too many souvenir shops ... and overpriced. Regardless, we had a great time! Got to see a celeb get a Star 😀",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/murrayh590
20,Poor,"Ok, stars are great, but just in front of chinese theatre...the rest is look like a really bad street, with lots of strange people around you, not so cool as i imagined",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y2744RRlucap
20,Not as great as hyped,"The walk of fame is worth going to don't get me wrong, but be prepared to be hassled by people trying to get you to buy something or go on their tour. The place is so busy and quite dirty. Glad to have done it though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beckc733
50,"An unseen dream, yes it came true!","I spent 24th December here with friends. From noon till night, randomly we spotted our favorite celebrities and other artists we admire. Interesting walk, very well-maintained and studded with the attractions, showrooms, restaurants, bright and lively tourists, individuals dressed-up as celebrities and animation characters on both sides of roads made the whole experience a happy and memorable one.However, if not with friends or if any of the other attraction along the sidewalks are missing, it won't be a fun place. Also, I think it is a one-time excitement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suchig06
40,A day with the stars!,"Something you must see if you visit LA. The Hollywood walk of fame runs for blocks along the main strip in Hollywood. You can spend hours here searching for your favourite celebrity. If you have a celebrity you want to see, perhaps ask someone if they know the location of the star as there are hundreds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EliseH9
30,"Too crowdy, too much cheap shops","Honestly, I expected more from the walk of fame. The street is a real 'cheap' tourist attraction. You can barely take a look at the names or take pictures because it is so crowdy that people push you around. All the shops are cheap souvenir shops. It is a must see but could use some updating and upscaling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/family-van-den-Berg
30,It's ok,"Hollywood Boulevard is always busy. Honestly, I think it's just a tourist trap. It's fun to see, but be cautious. The character actors want to pose with you in pictures, but it's not free. It's for tips. Beware of the guys trying to give you a free CD. It's not free. But if you're looking for sight seeing tours, those businesses are mostly located on Hollywood Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soccerman4000
50,One of the main attractions in Hollywood,Celebrities of the entertainment industry got stars embedded in the sidewalks along Hollywood Boulevard - showing permanent evicence to their achievements. It is a must-see in Hollywood but highly overestimated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlaColumna123
40,Must do in Hollywood!,"I really don't think this attraction gets old. At this point there are some 2,600 stars spanning a few miles in the Hollywood area.Be careful on some of the side streets... but otherwise I always love walking amongst the stars.It never gets old truly... especially the stars of celebrities from yesteryear. These ""plaques"" have been there forever.And smack dab in the middle of it - you'll find your favorite.If you go on the Hollywood Chamber's website, you'll find a list of stars and where their ""stars"" are so you're not walking around forever while looking for your favorite!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philb760
40,A Bit of Fun,"If it's your first time in Los Angeles, you can't come without visiting the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It's the quintessential thing to do for tourists but will lead you right in the heart of Hollywood where shops, restaurants and tourist photo opportunities await.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Firey3
30,Worth seeing once,"The Walk of Fame is one of those things you should see once. I suppose there are maps telling where each individual celebrity has their star. We didn't have one and after walking a few blocks and checking out each star, boredom set in. Do it once to say you where there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/766donalds
10,Total waste of time,"The only good thing about it is that I can say I've been there. Total waste of time. Run down area, dressed up characters who are chasing you for money. The area didn't feel safe and smelled of urine. Such a shame that LA left this area become such a ghetto. Avoid it if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikogeorgiev
30,visit once,"The walk of fame is worth seeing once. Probably wouldn't bother going to see again. Watch out for annoying people pushing ""free""CDs in your face and then asking for money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ondfre59
40,"Good fun, watch out for the picture hoggers","Great place to walk around and look at the stars on the paving blocks. If with kids then watch out for the costumer photo hoggers, they do try and push you to give them $20 for a simple photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DragonJay
40,Nice Stars!.,I took my visitors to the walk of fame and they were thrilled!. It was pretty cool seeing so many stars with recognizable artists. It does get ridiculously crowded later in the day. Its best to go early and enjoy it better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marelisr2015
30,Just ok...,"Of course it's on the list of ""must visit"" while out in LA but it really is just a crowded street. We went on a Saturday morning and it was so crowded you couldn't really see the stars since they had so many people walking over them. It's also full of people dressed up in character wanting you to pay to take with them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoniAnnette
40,Hollywood,"The place was packed, wall to wall people, characters dressed in Minnie Mouse, Three or four spider men, Marilyn Monroe. Paya tip and get your picture taken with them. People selling CD music. Not fun if you don't like crowds. Not much to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gyee50
30,Yuck!,"We went to Hollywood for Amoeba Records, which was terrific for our 19-year old, but the younger teen wanted to go for a walk. It was cool seeing the stars on the sidewalk but what a chaotic mess of humans. Not worth the stop for the walk of fame, but go for Amoeba Records.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebinPhilly
40,A lot of fun.,"Thankfully we had read a review before going and liked up the star we really wanted to see; Marlee Matlin. We were able to walk straight to it and my daughter loves seeing her star. A fun way to spend a few hours. It is super crowded and I would take care of you bag etc, but fun all the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenbB4293MA
40,Stars,"This is a great place to walk around and check out the stars of a bygone era. You can download maps if you want to see a particular one, as I did, and it is fun. There are quite a few look alikes hanging around for photo opportunites and some street performers too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexandraVella
50,Lovely shopping,"At this time of the year, Christmas and New Year round the corner, there are just many offers by shops in the area. Take a slow stroll and sure will find yourself some real bargains! There is also one seafood buffet restaurant within a short walk from the mall where you can enjoy lunch or dinner without having to pay too much (below $20)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eyfashionaire
40,I am a walker and this is an interesting place to walk,"I was with 3 grand children 10-18 on an LA mini vacation it was Christmas Eve. We thought Hollywood Blvd would be disereted and we could have all the stars to ourselves. Guess a whole lot of other people had the same idea. It was still fun to look at the stars,and think about the movies and shows they were in. Lots of look alikes were wandering around. It was a fun hour.Parking was difficult. Be patient and park a few blocks away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Computernana
40,A cool experience,"I thought this was fun, got a few photos, there are all up about 2500 stars, didn't get to see them all, and apparently of you want your name on one it will only cost you $30k 😂",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kamejaje
10,"Scam everywhere, be cautious if you really want to go","As many people have pointed out, scammers are everywhere near the walk. Refuse anything strangers offer to you, there are 99% NOT FREE and not worthy. Ignore those ""actors"" asking you to take photos together, they are NOT OFFICIAL and just want to take unreasonably high tip from you. If you are Chinese, ignore anyone trying to chat you up in Chinese (otherwise they won't let you leave), except they are also tourists asking for directions. There are also many homeless people on the street. Universal Studio is much better place to go if you really enjoy Hollywood movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/XeHHXe
40,It was good,"It's fun to take a walk there and see all the stars, make sure you have cash to tips all the people in costumes if you want to take a pic with them or if you want a mixtape!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alg239
30,Star wars premier,"Not what you expect it to be, just a standard side walk with a range off shops on both sides, was mostly closed off for the above which made people get frustrated and the area very busy. Can walk through it in just over an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenmclean23
50,Stars everywhere,"We took the metro subway from the children's hospital to do something fun. If you get off at the most talked about street corner of Hollywood, hollywood and vine, and start walking towards north Hollywood you'll see every star on the sidewalks you could ever imagine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bacon111
40,Interesting But Get A Map,"I would recommend that you Google your desired ""stars to see"" or get a map somewhere. The random searching can be tiring. I finally found my favorite entertainer Tina Turner. I also have blisters as a result of walking all over - - ha!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trjeff1
50,Fun night,"Try to go at night, the lights and energy are great. The walk is fun-- great trying to find our favorite stars. Fun shops to stop in. A lot of street shows going. A lot of characters lining the street ( but expecting $ for pictures).There are several places to go ( Wax museum, Dolby, etc) but we were on a time crunch and couldn't stop.Definitely a must see if you go to Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Movingalong1234
50,Find Your Favorites!,"You can literally spend just a few minutes or spend hours at the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It's fun seeing names that you haven't thought of in a long time and seeing what they are famous for too. If you are in Los Angeles, you must go to the Walk of Fame. You can always squeeze it in even if you don't have much time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/706debbied
40,Great free activity,"Great activity spotting you're favourite stars. Much more than I expected and is quite a walk. Very busy area, better to visit early in the day. Lots of people trying to sell the trips around the star's homes but they took no for an answer and didn't push too hard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/195alisonc
50,Shiny!,The Hollywood Walk of Fame was a lot of fine while we were on holiday in LA.It was a lot of fun!A bit like a treasure hunt for all the stars names you were familiar with!Sleek & shiny! Loved it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abrtm
30,Nothing Special,"Its kind of an attraction you go to to say you say the star of such-and-such.. The whole area is dodgy and covered in people trying to sell you something. As two young female travellers we found that we encountered a lot of inappropriate comments and harassment, even from tourist guides and shop owners along the boulevard. Sure go there but definitely not worth spending too much time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsjustkayla
30,I dont get the hype,I might be the only person who doesn't get the walk of fame....I guess it's a good FREE activity that you can fill in part of the day with if you're in the area.Lots of people trying to sell sight seeing tours around the area. Be savvy people,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmberCee16
30,Hollywood visit,We took our teenage boys to Hollywood via the Metro. The Metro stop was just near the Chinese Theater.The walk of fame was cool. There were some really good street performers but they can be a bit pushy about tipping for posing for photos.We didn't do any tours. Perhaps that would have made it more interesting.My teenagers had a good time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MopRfans
50,Must visit the Walk of Fame!,"I was pleasantly surprised that stars are located on both sides of the sidewalk. I was not disappointed with this typical tourist attraction. There are so many other attractions in this area, too. Beware of people dressed in costumes wanting you to buy pics of them and guys selling their music CD's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NRH88
40,Crowded,We got there early and had a great time shopping and eating at HardRock Cafe. It was a beautiful day and although touristy it was a fun afternoon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanieljLea
30,So much people..,"This street is crowded... It almost hard to see the stars, to much people. The atmosphere is fun. It feels very safe there,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R_Sweden
40,Crazy,First time here and not disappointed. Crazy place full of life. Lots to see and do. Heaps of photo opportunities and a glimpse of the Hollywood sign in the hills. Shame about the bomb scare at one end of the street but it had no effect on our trip. People every where brings the street alive. Endless people trying to sell crappy tours and the like but this is a must do for your trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tulkara
40,"A cool place to visit,",Not much to talk about. Its not 5 out of 5 because it is EXTREMELY crowded! You can look down at the stars. Look around. Not many places to eat but lots of stores.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761them
30,Hollywood Blvd NOT so Glamorous,The Walk of Fame it seems in just Cliche' now....some stars had TWO where others it would appear didn't exist....it seems any and everyone can get a star now....Hollywood Boulevard and Sunset Blvd are no longer the place to be is run down and not kept up much Homeless Loitering.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinebS926OG
30,Okay,It's very crowded. Not sure what it the best time of day to be here as the place is really crowded and busy. You will not have the comfort of looking for the stars of your favorite celebrity. Careful with your stuff too as you can't guarantee safety here. It's not that bad though. There are shops where you can get souvenirs and there are restaurants around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizd621
40,Mixing with the stars,"We found the best place was around the chinese theatre where you can also see the hand and footprints of the stars. Not all of the walk of fame is glitzy pavements as the photos suggest.Also you will be asked to go on celebrity tours as you walk around. I would suggest to tripadvisor the best one first if you do want to take a tour. We went on one and although good, found out some of the houses photographed did not belong to the person we were told they belonged to. Also the guide almost begs for tips at the end.On the walk of fame the people dressed up as movie characters will want tipping if you have your photo taken with them.And the people handing out their music CD's for free will want something in return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyHouse
20,"Do it to say you did it, but don't expect much","There isn't much effort given to making this a pleasant experience. You may enjoy the history if you try really hard, but the street feels more like a bizarre bazaar with the added bonus of homelessness and urine odors. As you dodge the obstacles along the route of overpriced and disheveled storefronts, you'll be constantly accosted to buy tour trips, greeted by out of shape superheroes wearing filthy costumes that want to pose with you for money, and fake wanna-be musicians hawking ""their"" discover-me CDs for a $20 donation. This place seems way overdue for a facelift, a cleanup, and some permit legislation/enforcement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
40,Worth seeing,It is different from what we expected from seeing it in the media and hearing about it. It is more relaxed and casual and really packed with people.Few souvenir stores on both sides of the street and few groups and individual people who are dressed up in costumes and will take pictures with you for a little tip.It is fun to look among the names for the ones you know most and pointing them out to your friends or taking pictures with them (require going to the ground) but the entire thing is just a low maintenance tourist spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/252jayr
50,Was Fun To See,"We started seeing thè 4 statues at the end of the Walk of Fame and went from thère,its fun to see and read the stars but pity there is not to much effort put into maintaining them..some are cracked and some are just plain old and dirty.Not good for the stars living or dead.The stars seemed to go on for ever and we had to stop and go back as we were running out of dàylight..loved being there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryM493

Crowded and intense, no public restroom n sight ( had to sneak in to Mc Donald's ) a lot of entertainment going on on the street. Here you can see both sides of LA and Hollywood. Homeless on the street next to the movie stars.....( didn't see any)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kattsvansen
30,Cool to see the first time,"It's fun to check out and find your favorite celebrities' names, but was a little underwhelming for me since it was just a regular sidewalk and did not seem as glorified as it is in photos.

20,Not all its hyped up to be,"Have walked down Hollywood walk of fame a number of times and each time it surprises me at how disappointing it is. It's just stars on a street in a big city nothing special. It's nice to get a pic beside your idols star and move on. Plenty of people trying to capitalise on it so you will see fake minions fake super hero's etc. Watch out for pick pockets. Best advice is to jump onto it get a few snaps and get out of it. Best bits hand prints outside Chinese theatre, worst bits the homeless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T8567ORmarkm
30,A must in Hollywood,"Visiting here is a must if you are in Hollywood and seeing some of the stars are cool, but be warned that it stretches for a while and on the ends it isn't in the nicest area.

40,Fun to see!,"This is a tough one to rate. On one hand, everyone knows about the ""walk of fame"" and it is fun to see your favorite stars memorialized. On the other hand, it's names on a sidewalk and parts of the walk are dirty. People do constantly ask if you want their CD's but all you have to do is say ""no thank you"" and they do not bug you. People should know the dressed up characters that offer to have you take a picture with them CHARGE A FEE.

I wouldn't stay for more than ten minutes if I ever went back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AreeGoTheDistance
30,Harassed every step of the way,"Be careful! We were not warned about the constant harassment by our tour guide, and found the trip down Hollywood walk of fame quite daunting. DO NOT talk or even give eye contact to ANY of the rappers trying to give you free CDs. They are not free and they harass you for money, or a donation as they say. They are very good with their words and they trap you. Don't even start a conversation. They are every 3 metres apart so makes it very annoying. DO NOT have a photo with any characters, they want money too, and I was grabbed by Spider-Man and not let go, until my husband came back and gave him money. You can't give any eye contact at all. They target your children too, and try to grab them to give them autographs and to take photos. They want money for all. Really wanted to enjoy the time looking at the stars and enjoying the tourist sights but these people make it very hard. If the tour people approach you, just say you're already on one. They left us alone. There are homeless also. We are from New Zealand, so this was a very unusual thing for us to witness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Demchyclan

40,Great to see,You always see Hollywood walk on tv and think it's this elaborate place. But it's literally a walk way with stars on the ground. That goes down Hollywood Blvd quite a ways. We did see some that we recognized. But it's hard to really look down and walk and check out the stars when everyone is trying to walk the side walk. Glad I saw it.

30,Sorry tourists....there are better gems in Hollywood,"I really feel sorry for all the wonderful tourists who visit my city when thy come to Hollywood and the centerpiece is the ""Walk of Fame"" The commemorative plaques, etc. are great, but you are not going to see a movie star anywhere close by except at Oscar or opening times. The street hustlers are very annoying and watch your wallet. Instead, you should yes...go to Grauman's Chinese to see the footprints, the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel was the site of the first Oscars and is a wonderful old building, there is the Cecil B. DeMille barn (the first movie studio and a museum of Hollywood) across from the Hollywood Bowl, the Hollywood Bowl is amazing (you can often get seats high up in the bleachers and take a picnic with your own wine), have a drink at Yamashiro (incredible Japanese old and authentic structure with the best views), go to dinner at Musso Frank, go to our fabulous planetarium (from the 20s) in Griffith Park, stroll along La Brea, Highland or Fairfax for very interesting shops and restaurants (do your homework to know where to go), take in an outdoor summer movie at either Hollywood Forever (yes it is a famous cemetary and has the most wonderful Day of the Dead celebration, or find out about the Oscar movies shown in their park), go to the Sunday Hollywood Farmer's market at Ivar...spectacular, or to the original Farmer's Market at Fairfax and Third (which is now part of the Grove)....and on and on..I am so sorry that Hollywood is portrayed by the seedy souvenir shops and less than pristine sidewalks of the Walk of Fame...Soooo much to see otherwise...hey and the redone Peterson Museum and LACMA (free concerts all summer)...Watch out for Scientology prostheletisers on Hollywood Boulevard...unfortunately they own some of the best old buildings and try to sign you up to their cult when they can....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kneedlersr

The dressed up characters do not help, they make the place feel seedy as they don't seem to clean their costumes.The stars are worth seeing but you can look at pictures and get the same effect.The walk is long and there are some things to see along the way but don't fall for the overpriced attractions and trashy shops.One hit is the lolly shop above the Hard Rock Cafe area. Heaven!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cruwys-wanderlust

For first time visitors to Los Angeles, it's not a ""must do"". However, it can be an interesting experience seeing the names of major (and some minor) stars from the various entertainment industries as film, music, radio,television and theater set in plaques one after the other as part of the concrete sidewalks. Each plaque carries a brass emblem representing the individual's area of performance. But...be careful, as the sidewalks can be crowded with an assortment of interesting tourists, sometimes annoying street performers and a variety of hustlers, pickpockets and other unsavory characters.

It was late at night so I'm not sure if tours or maps are handed out but it would of been really handy during my visit. I saw more of a gritty side, it being night time. Homeless sleeping on the corner, trash everywhere. It looked more like a celebrities nightmare than something to aspire to have your name etched in.

It was a 5 minute walk to Hollywood Blvd. We walked to the walk of fame at about 10:30am and it wasn't too crowed yet. There were a lot of friendly costume characters there. My favorite was Alan from the Hangover. However, the CD guys were very aggressive and unpleasant. They were mostly concentrated around the Chinese Theater. The Chinese Theater was very cool to see. But that was about it to see besides the stars on the walk. There is a $5 souvenir store by there that we got a few things for my cousin. So glad we signed up for a TMZ tour as we were done with the walk of fame in about an hour. We decided to leave and stay by the airport for our second night. As we were leaving that night our taxi drove through the intersection of highland and Hollywood and there were at least 50 people lined up to just cross the street.

We also checked out The Scientology information center… (Out of curiosity). The Dolby theater was beautiful, our event was terriffic. We dined at another Hollywood icon, Musso and Frank's.

Besides for the stars there, there is really nothing to see (just a ton of souvenir shops, wax museum, and ripley's...things you can find in other tourist cities).I think the tourism board should really do something to crack down on the aggressive sales people and clean up the district.

Don't be fooled by anything anyone tries to give you on the street, anyone in a costume wants money for a photo, 'free' CDs are not free it's a con. It's a place you seriously need to go to and see for yourself and walk the fame. There are a lot of good shops and attractions to go to see while you're there so you can make it a half day trip (recommend going early in the morning as there are less people walking the street and you can stop and read the stars).

There are pan handlers every few feet; people hawking CD's, shirts, characters dressed up like M.J., Batman and at least 4 Spider-man characters. These people make great money haggling tourists. Some are professional con artists. The stars on the sidewalk, however, are interesting if you can get a descent look at them due to the heavy traffic.

30,Probably not worth it.,Could do something more worth while with your time. But still a great time trying to find your favourite celebrity's start.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shylow2015
50,A must see,"Just for kicks, this was a fun walk around Hollywood. Go browse the tourist shops, have a drink or a malt at Mel's. Lots to see around the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyZ168
30,A Few pictures and that's it,Maybe if you have some spare time it is worth the trip to the Blvd and picture yourself with your favorite star. Other than that there is some more shopping and that's all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JorgePerezG
10,Watch out,CD peddlers far too aggressive and bordered on threatening. Good thing our tour guide Mick said to avoid them at all costs. Characters are such a scam. Need to clear them out so you can see history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J_r_S550
20,Grubby,You have to go here when in hollywood but there are so many scumbags trying to solicit money and rip you off. Rubbish everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrimoireNZ
40,"A must see, try not to bang into people","So this is a combination of fantastic and infuriating.The stars cover both sides of Hollywood Boulevard for many blocks and you can walk down and get a picture of your favourites. The only issue is you have to walk looking down so you have to do that, juggle the crowds and try to take in all the other things going on around you.That being said, its very cool to walk down and see it. Incidentally Elvis is at the top with the three statues of the ladies.. i think the Beatles are there too.Give it a go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyMooMcr

40,Good fun...,"This is a must-do while in LA, but you may get a bit tired of trying to find the star of your favorite star. I wish there was a map (or is there one?) to find all your favorites. Honestly, after a couple of hours, you are just walking along Hollywood Blvd without even bothering to look down at the stars...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripasucks
30,Fun while you do other things,"There's 4500 stars all up and down Hollywood Boulevard. They were kinda fun to just look at while we were walking to other things but if I personally came to just see the walk of fame, I would be a little disappointed. I mean, as long as you realise its just stars in the sidewalk and you'll have heard of maybe 1 in 5-10 of the people, then enjoy it. It's just a fun way to pass the time while walking to other things I thought.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/309shaunv

50,A famous walk,Take a picture of your favorite movie stars and your feet and feel famous when you share the pix with your friends.Place your name on a star an be famous for a second while you take the picture. This is perhaps the cleanest side walk in the world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissDCWilson
40,This never gets old...,The area is lame but the Walk of Fame will always be interesting no matter where its located. Well worth the time and make sure to have cell phones ready for pics.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelinmd
40,Looks a lot more impressive on TV.,Goes for several Streets and certainly has a long list of impressive names on it but somehow the magic of the screen is lost when you are actually there. Maybe it's all the homeless people around you or maybe it's the vendor's all trying to sell you tourist attractions. Still a must see in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/871frankg
20,Don't expect to dally,"Interesting to see all the stars on the sidewalk, but when it is crowded don't expect to stop and look without being run into. Getting a picture is very difficult. okay to see, but wouldn't make it a priority.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wewannagoagain
40,Just walk around,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is cool to see the stars from the past and present. You may need google to find your favorite stars' star but it's also interesting to just walk around. (FYI: Michael Jackson's is in front of the Chinese Theater and Marilyn Monroe's is in front of the McDonalds),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/172janelleh

20,Unimpressed,Sorry but I don't see what all the hype is about this attraction. I actually told my husband not to stop the car as the area looked very dirty. Lots of shops along the walk boarded up. I felt very uncomfortable in this area of Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnel944
30,"It's an interesting walk, but I can't get excited about it.","It is what it says on the tin, the walk of the famous. It was interesting to see all the famous with their imprints in front of the Chinese Theatre but it's not something I can get too excited about. But that's just me. It is interesting but you are going to encounter a lot of the ""I'm dressed up in a costume so have a photo with me and pay me"". They are everywhere but a simple no thanks seems to be enough. Like the famous? Then drop in on the Hard Rock here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/956adriann
50,neat place,same as the tlc review. just look at the stars and take pics with ones you like. easy no issues. just plain cool,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/166ajayk
30,Splash and dash.....,If you are in LA for the first time you have to see walk of fame. To be honest wasn't so special according to us. We made picture as proof been there and went along. Nice to have seen it but not so special.........,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Berendd

40,Fame had lost its glitz,"I only spent a few night in the area but was disappointed at the lack of glamour. Many of the 'stars' were dirty and had chewing gum on them. I was bombarded with 'wannabee's' wanting to have their photograph taken with me or sell me their CD, which they initially make you believe is a 'gift' !! I loved 'star' spotting and looking at the handprints in the cement outside the Grauman Theatre. There is a great assortment of shops not dis similar to Oxford St London! Glad I've been but wouldn't rush back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tetleymagic
30,Just stop in,Just go to say you went. Still an experience to say you have been but nothing special than to take photos to your family back home.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jordanf930
40,Wow.,This was way bigger than we thought. It went for quite a while on both sides of the street. It was fun trying to find celebrities we knew and there were also quite a lot we didn't.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y5920KVdonnat
30,Now we can say we've been there.,"I had high expectations for the Walk of Fame but I left feeling overwhelmed and a little disappointed. Before this trip, I didn't realize that the Walk of Fame was more than what surrounds the Chinese theatre. The ""Walk"" is actually over a mile in length and runs a 15 block length. If I would have know about the complex in the vicinity (Hollywood and Highland) that had great shopping and food or we would have planned more time for this. We wanted to take photos but it was so congested, I didn't get a lot accomplished. People dressed up as characters wanting you to take a photo with them for money, people trying to ""make it"" giving out CDs ""for a small donation"" or people just asking for handouts...it was all a little much for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worknschoolmom23
40,Iconic and Fun,"Prepare to be besieged by hordes of superheroes, scary monsters, glamour girls, and celeb look alikes as you admire or photograph the stars hand and footprints at the grauman's chinese theatre on Hollywood Bvld. We saw Spiderman, Batman, X Mens Wolverine, Marilyn Monroe, a couple of Freddie Kruegers and even a very short plump Superman. They all want to have their picture taken with you for tips...........its a laugh but be careful those tips can add up fast. You are also likely to be handed a CD by a number of wannabe rock and pop stars......they too will ask for a contribution once their disc is in your hand. We enjoyed the fun of it but it could be intimidating for some being surrounded by swarms of people all trying to get your cash. I",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scruffygirl2013
50,Funners!,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is very beautiful. It has names of celebrities I've never heard of. I love walking down the walk. I love Marilyn Monroe and her star is right in front of McDonald's. There are different artist and vendors all down Hollywood Blvd. It's an exciting place to visit and hang out! Have fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/432reneef
30,Yes and No!,"As someone who is not a big fan of Hollywood, I would say this place can to be visited only for the sake of crossing it off your ""LA list'. The path seems endless and I could identify only a handful of names. But again, this may be because I am not a hardcore follower of Hollywood movies. However, the shops along the way are worth visiting...there are costume shops, shops exclusively for wigs, souvenirs, eateries and the like. If you are a shopaholic, you could spend some good time shopping and clicking pictures along with a 'star' or two! And yes, had trouble finding a parking in this area...it was a Wednesday evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soumyan145
50,Photo ops gallore,This is one place where you can click a lot of pics. It's a long walk at the walk of fame on both sides of the road. You will even get Chinese and Dolby theatre around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisaF3176MX
20,"Not bad to look at if you are strolling through town, but I wouldn't go out of my way","This ""attraction"" seems to have lost it's luster. Seems like back in the day it was great to see the stars of classic movie stars. Now, nobody things twice walking by Brad Pitt. Most of the younger people have no idea who all the old movie stars are, not to mention old music and directors. If you are downtown take a peek at a few as you stroll by, but don't go out of your way to see them. Also, lots of ""street actors"" hang around (especially by the Chinese Theatre) that want to take photos with you. Many look to have costumes they simply picked up at a second hand store. Nothing like getting your photo taken with a dirty, chubby super hero!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertwJ9824WM
30,"Fun, but crowded",We spent some time here looking up our favourite stars. Fun and kind of mandatory when you're in town :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asgeirn
30,Check off the bucket list.,I grew up in Hollywood and Los Angeles and loved to watch the tourists. Hollywood is more glamorous on TV than in person. Go during the day and be aware of your surroundings at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanneromo
30,Cool to see buy dirty part of town,"The starts and hand prints were cool to see but it was definitely in a dirty part of town. Some of the stars were covered by trash and there were a lot of homeless people sitting by them covering them as well. I definitely wouldn't be down there after dark, especially alone. The stores around aren't worth going in, they all have cheap things in them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamieg337
30,We felt we had to go if in LA,"We're not really film buffs, but being our first time in LA we felt no visit would be complete without seeing the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Once was enough though - it's crowded, hot, dusty and every few yards people are trying to sell you stuff. There's SOOOOO many stars too and we had no idea who most of them were but I guess as we're not into films that's understandable. Some areas are a little shabby now and if you want to buy tat, this is the place to go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cerris1
40,Nice,Great to see the stars on the sidewalk. Lots of homeless people walking around and asking for money. Plenty of police sitting at corners monitoring activity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toshab379
20,Dissapointed,"although its great fun looking for your fav stars, Hollywood boulevard is far from glitzy and glamour, all you can smell is the Marijuana everywhere, the shops are seedy and wouldn't feel safe walking around at night, and the homeless is epidemic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marylY3506KY
30,Worth a look,"If you want something to do that is free and you need to kill a couple of hours then going for a walk along the street is kind of cool. There are plenty of people dressed up and tour operators selling tickets to stuff, if you like that kind of thing. I hate people trying to hard sell me tickets to stuff so I avoided them but it's convenient if you don't have a hire car I guess. We also had a look through the massive shopping complex there. It was pretty amazingly huge! And had avatar selection of well air-conditioned shops. It would be a good activity on a rainy day because you could just look through the shops or if it's super hot too because of the air con. You can see the Hollywood sign from the shopping plaza too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgief798

50,So Many Stars,"It was great to see the stars and there are lots of them. Although I enjoyed it, it is a little overwhelming due to the amount of people on the sidewalks trying to hand you things, sell you stuff and suggest discounted tours. It also seems a little run down closer to Vine and the stars are not quite as kept up. Overall, if you know the specific location of the star you would like to see, great; otherwise, it's a lot of walking and you'll spend most of the time looking down which could be dangerous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewGirl2001
40,Fun,This was fun to walk around and look for the stars of your favorite people. I didn't realize how big it is and it took awhile to find what we were looking for. The main area reminds me of Times Square in NYC but smaller. A fun afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13Kim14
20,Not a blockbuster,"So many great things to see and do in the US and in LA. Unless you're a completely die-hard Hollywood nut, I would say 'spend your time elsewhere'. Just an average American street with a 'stars' on the footpath. I've been twice, and I've been underwhelmed both on both occasions. There a few good local restaurants, but that's true all over town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBRownhams
30,Walking with the Stars,It looks quite impressive when you see all the stars on the pavement but when you find out that they pay for this privilage it's not just awarded to them for me it took some of the shine of it. Great trying to find the famous people you want although not always easy to see if the pavements are busy with tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/232jaredc
30,Interesting,"Although I enjoyed it, the walk of fame seems to be somewhat run down at one end, however, at the other end where the Chinese theatre and Dolby theatre are situated, it is buzzing and safe. Lots of mithering to sell you stuff ect. It is fun to see the ""stars"" along the pavement and the section where all the prints/signatures of the famous actors are!!.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamelaVio
40,Brilliant to see!,It was great to walk along the street and see all the names on the stars. We didn't realise there were so many so be prepared for quite a walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciamty
30,It's Hollywood,"Like everything else in Hollywood it looks a lot different than on tv. First depending on what time it is the sidewalks are fairly conjested so the stop and go of looking at the stars can be an adventure in its self. Early morning or late evening seem to be best. Second when you watch someone getting there ""star"" the place looks immaculate not so in real time. gotta remember its a busy sidewalk Ina not so clean town. Having said that however its was still very cool to walk down Hollywood Blvd and read off the names of stars of past and present!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/a12barblues
30,A must but brace yourself for the madness,"Obviously a must if ever visiting LA but once is enough, unless that crazy mad tourist hot spot is your thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luluxlou

Every age of celebrity fromMickey mouse and Donald duck to Marilyn Munroe and Elton John and many in between.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valerieh3360
40,Lots to see!,"Take the metro that stops at the Walk of Fame station and start there, not the Chinese Theatre station. I recommend you walk this twice. Once to look only down at all the stars, and the second to look up at all the shops and attractions!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhonhagedorn
20,"Nice, but needs maintenance/repairs","When you see these stars online or TV, they look so posh. But in person, they look kinda gross. Some of the stars are cracked and missing pieces. Some have black goop on them. Some have graffiti. Who maintains these stars?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/15LisaT
30,Great history but not well kept.,Visited The Hollywood Walk Of Fame for the first time.As it is a major attraction in LA and with all the history of the stars and movies we had to visit.My take on it is very torn between loving the history and the beloved stars premiered there but on the other side it is not well kept at all. The street literally smells and while walking you get hassled by hundreds of tour operators trying to get you on their tour bus or van. Besides that mostly everything is expensive but you get the feeling of the movies.We took a tour of The Chinese Theater which was well worth it but other tour operators tried to get us on tours to see celebrity houses or sightings and we were not much into that.Just imagine being a celebrity getting followed everywhere with vans of people taking your pictures all the time.Anyways still a place you gotta see even if it is not as clean anf nice as i thought it would be.Comr on LA!!! This place is a major attraction you can do a better job in keeping it up to attract more visitors and ask tour operators not to be pushy or get fined,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterTravelAdvisor
30,bit of a tourist trap,"We visited the walk of fame as it felt llike we couldn't visit LA without going and felt that it was quite disappointing. There are lots of people trying to sell tours and lots of tacky souvenir shops which are all pretty much the same. The Chinese theatre was closed for a premiere the day we were there so we weren't able to visit. I'm not sure what I expected but it just felt a bit of a let down, I would still recommend a visit though even just to find your favourtie stars along the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noddy99
20,Eh,"I envisioned this being more fun. It was kind of lame to just walk staring at our feet, which is pretty much all we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahC2348JE
30,Star Struck,Had a really good time doing the walk of the stars and checking out the major landmarks on this strip as well as all the people this place attracts. Have to do it once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tuldge
30,""" Money...Money... Money..""","From those that made Much, who's Stars we walk on to those that have their hands out who have nothing. The Walk of Fame is also a walk of Shame.Interesting to see the Names and Hand prints at the Chinese Theatre, but not to be continually hounded by offers of photos with second rate look a likes and to have CDs thrust in your face by so called musicians. A very tired, and sad place that represents what was once great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rusty3350
50,Exciting the first time,"Great photo oppotunities with stars names mixing in the area with impersonators, dancers, singers and musicians. An experience not to be missed on your trip covers a large area so bring your walking shoes and some great shops on the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dallasc947
40,It's a must see,The walk of fame is a must see it's a cool long walk but at the same Time is quite overly commercial. Only really stores around are souvenir stores. And the homeless population in the area is quite staggering and many of them are on drugs of some kind. They usually keep to themselves but be aware that some of them aren't stable and can be unpredictable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G6413NGjackb
30,A bit of fun.,"Want to kill a bit of time & be a tourist. Then the Hollywood walk of Fame is right up your alley.I have never been harrassed by people touting for business so much. Some are very rude & persistent, others are a bit of fun.Plenty to see & do.Be a tourist, relax & enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philk346
10,"Tick off, but don't return","We were very keen to see Hollywood and the Walk of Stars, but it's a massive letdown.Streets are pretty untidy and we constantly got bothered by people trying to sell us a tour.It doesn't feel the safest place in the world, even in daylight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/853tomr

50,Great way to spend a day,"We kept looking for names we knew, it was so much fun when we recognized names on the sidewalk. The souvenir shops on the side of the sidewalk are a great way to shop for knick knacks. we picked our lots of little memorabilia during our walk that day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriyaV1
10,Very Disappointing,It is so sad that LA has let Hollywood deteriorate so bad. The Walk of Fame is dirty and smells of urine. The businesses are very run down and it feels dangerous to walk the streets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HawaiiOno
50,Interesting street,"Historical and star-studded venue, lots of opportunities for photography enthusiast. Many souvenir shops and food stalls around the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRBriones
30,Have a heart,"I've lived in Los Angeles my whole life. I've seen many people come from around the world, thinking they have the perfect idea of this place, thinking that it's all fancy and nice.Nothing, could be further from the truth.Although there are nice shops, and cool places to check out and night and many different kinds of performers with music and talents, there are also many homeless people and people looking for drugs and trouble. I personally do not condone the things some people do for drugs or trouble here, but my heart goes out for the homeless people out here, some of them have some pretty messed up stories. I've listened to their stories, eaten with them and have gotten to know some by a first name basis, and believe me when I tell you that they are regular people just like you and I. The only difference, was that the never got the last paycheck.If you come here, there are many things to do, and in truth there are some wonderful and pretty places to check out here, but if you really want to see the most beautiful thing here, come on a Friday night, between 8:30pm to 9pm. There, at Hollywood/Highland, you will see a table, with people wearing green shirts that say ""Oasis"". These people have diligently served the streets, feeding anyone in need, praying for anyone who needs comfort in their hearts, and giving clothes to those in need, regardless if you're homeless or not. (Their main aim is to help people who are in DIRE NEED.)I served with them for 6 months and it was some of the best times of my life.So wherever you come from, if you come here, make sure to stop by a Friday night, and see visit my friends at the table. If you have a heart, bring whatever you think would be great to give out: food, water, clothes, gifts, etc. They truly ensure that everyone who is in need gets help.Have a heart, and don't just come here for your enjoyment, but come to help others who are in need.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fistoflight
50,Everyone has to do it once,Go down to the walk of fame occasionally to meet up with friends. Fun to see all the starts names. And then Graumans Chinese Theater is a must see. Some of those stars had really small hands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcapps111
30,Pretty dirty,It was fun seeing all the stars but it was very dirty lots of people asking for money and photos for money also trying to sell their CDs. I enjoyed going to see it but I wouldn't go back if I was in LA again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alannap10
30,"Fun to see the stars, but area run down",I had not been to see the stars on the walk of fame since I was a little kid. But the neighborhood is run down and does not feel safe to walk around at night on nights when not so many people are around. Its a shame since I was hoping it would be in better shape but it was fun to see names like Schwarzenegger and Stallone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VegasKhan
40,Can you even say you went to Hollywood if you dont go here.?,"You see these on TV a lot but a visit puts it all into perspective. Amusing crowd of people here for people watching.

40,Hollywood Nostalgia and Glitz!!,"If you want to be a part of a exciting happening, GO check out Hollywood Blvd and all it offers. There is the Imax Chinese Theater which has all the footprints and handprints of long ago and current movie star legends. There are numerous restaurants and bars to stop in for a meal and a drink. My favorite: Musso and Frank's Grill. Absolutely the best martini I've ever had. Not to mention the ambience of old world Hollywood inside. Just walking and looking at all the characters and other people is a sight to see. Check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/825debram
10,Disappointing,"Don't believe the pictures on telly. Whilst the stars are filled with famous names the truth is you can't actually see them that well due to the amount of people on the sidewalk. Also beware of ""characters "" dressed up posing for photos then demanding cash. There is no guide to where your favourite star is so you'll walk up and down for hours and be frustrated and shattered. Spend your money on a homes of the stars tour it's worth it. Make sure it covers Mullholland Drive though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevejV8219HL
20,Too crowded,There was too many shady people walking and hanging around. Too many performers crammed together. Too crowded and i live in vegas and have no problem with the crowd on the strip. If u are going to do the walk of fame than do it early morning. Parking is a nightmare. Not worth it for just the walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevingW2341NS
30,Disappointed,"The stars go for miles down both sides of the Blvd. Sadly many of the older ones are in a state of disrepair. Everyone has heard of the Walk of Fame and for me no visit to LA would have been complete without walking the walk.I came across many that brought back memories of the artist and especially went in search for fellow Kiwi's star, Sir Peter Jackson. Fortunately I thought to google it first - a good website hwof.com and you can find out where your star's star is located.It's quite hard to put a time frame on this attraction, because you'll do other things at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiKerry53

40,Its a great place to have your photo taken with the stars.,"We went and saw all the Hollywood Stars on the Walk of Fame. We are huge movie fans, so this was quite exciting, and we spent hours looking at and getting excited to find our favourites. Its worth the visit, not very hard to find, just outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre. Have your photo taken sitting next to your favourite. Lots of people and lots of locals dressed up as characters and actors, fun!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kyliet13

Boring stuff is that tons of peoples on the street trying to sell you tour tickets and other merchandise.If you are visiting Hollywood you just have to see this, but no more then half and hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aleksarad
50,Must visit,"Not only to see the celebrities stars, but all the attractions along the walk of fame Blvd. Too much going on there to explain. Must be there if you visit L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesusenmochis
20,Very disspaointed,"If your expecting Hollywood to be the glitz and glamour that everyone expects I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. as me and my partner were. Our taxi driver dropped us at the end of the walk of fame and I can honestly say in my 3 week venture to the states covering 3 different states and 4 cities that this was he only time I felt uneasy. I felt as though we had literally just been dropped in the back end streets of downtown la. There was nothing glamorous about it at all. Most of the shops were boarded up and there was a fair few homeless people laying around in shop doorways. We walked up a little further and came to the main attractions (stars, Chinese theatre, madam tussuads etc) it was ok but nothing to brag home about , too many people trying to sell you tour tickets and lots of men (rappers) trying to push there home made CDs in your hands. The other side of the road was like it should have been in a different street . We stayed for all of an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aieshao
20,Guess You Have to do it ONCE !!,"Disappointed, not at all what I expected, you know a bit glam, clean !! no, no, no not at all, dirty, mainly scruffy, tacky & thats just in the daylight hours, in the evening, along the Chinese Theatre bit (which is the busiest & touristy bit) are some odd looking wannabees dressed up to take photos & your money, many people trying to flog c.ds, tours, either side of this it goes down hill DRAMATICALLY & is a bit unnerving as soon as it gets dark (6pm), druggies dealing & shops with windows full of knives, made everything a bit uncomfortable.You should go to say you have been, but don't have high expectations, because they probably won't be met !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieG487
40,Lots of Fun,Our accommodation (Hollywood Orchid Suites) was situated the block behind the Chinese Theater so we walked straight out onto the Hollywood walk. We walked onto a bustling part of the street but it was great to walk down the street and check out the stars. We walked into entry hall of the Oscars Theater. Lots of characters and buskers about added to the atmosphere. We came back at night and the performers were in full swing.Well worth a visit if only to get a feel for Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrantS670
30,World Landmark best kept on the silver screen,"We've all seen the walk of fame and the famous stars on the floor on the news and in movies.What you don't see is how tacky it is. How dirty it is and how often you are flogged a CD by some unknown rapper.It is very unclean, there are loads of homeless people begging for moneyYou can't walk 10ft without someone offering you a tour of stars homes.I would recommend you see it if you haven't been to Hollywood before but once you've seen it, you won't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zacarooni
50,Take a tour,"We took the TMZ guided tour the female Jamaican was very good and a great laugh, didn't see any stars but heyho that's life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phillowman
30,Cool to visit,"I guess you have to visit once in your life, there are to many stars but most famous artists are near the Chinese theater FYI",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monijv
20,Visit if you must!,"We cannot understand why the walk has been described as interesting and fun. The best bit was the initial excitement that we were somewhere of interest but this soon wore off. We were surprised to find that the street is a little tatty and apart from some people dressed in goofy outfits there's nothing to it. The shops are mainly fancy dress costume stores. The Chinese Theatre had adverts hanging off it so spoilt even that ambience. Okay, so there are stone stars imposed along the walk way but most we had never heard of the names. I think it may have been special many years ago but its very over rated now. If you have a few hours spare then its a tick on a list but if you have somewhere else to go then go there. Hollywood, do something to make it more inviting and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brit-xpat
30,Free time in hollywood,"I was disappointed with the walk of fame as I feel I was not Expecting the reality of la. It was enjoyable however the best thing was to walk up to the second walkway to photograph the Hollywood sign the first walkway isn't quite high enough. There is a little coffee shop on the second level where you can buy a good sandwich and coffee.Missed my Australian coffee whilst we were out on day tours. Don't talks anything from anyone or have your picture taken with them as they will chase you for payment. There is a lot of homeless on the streets but I feel that some enjoy the carefree life. (That is my opinion) don't expect anything cheap from guess, sephoras or Victoria secrets in this part of town try the outlets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/438dorothyh
30,OK!,"Like others have said, it's a pavement (sidewalk) with stars on it. We just came across it while driving, quite glad didn't make a special trip there! The people dressed as characters and lookalikes I guess are just trying to make money but they didn't make me feel like I wanted to hang around for long. It's a bit strange, but then it's LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moosey41
50,Walk with the stars,"Hollywood is an odd place, no more than the Walk of Fame. I did not recognise many of the stars, who were either too old or too American. Even so, it''s fun picking out your favourites. It's part of the magic of Hollywood Bvd. I even had a pic taken with Catwoman.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/619jeffry
50,Love me some stars,"It was so exciting seeing the stars names and seeing hand/ foot prints. There is a lot of action going on down there. You have to be careful and don't accept cd from strangers, because they want money and they will try to push them into your hand. Also lots of people dressed up in costumes wanting money as well. Just be alert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/811stacys
10,Seedy,I felt very uneasy walking along this street. There appeared to be a lot of down and outers. Too many people trying to peddle marijuana.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/889andrewa
30,enjoy it in all it's Hollywood tackiness!,"It's fun to check out the names, love it more when u walk into Mann's and see actual handprints of star. Enjoy Hollywood in all it's tackiness. It's not clean and glam, rather, you will see the hollywood wannabes trying to make extra bucks by dressing up as famous characters, the usual souvenir shops etc. It's fun and a you definitely have to stop in just to say you were here. Stop into Mel's diner across for a milkshake (they were in a ton of movies) or step into Musso & Franks for a good classic martini to round up your walk :) And it's literally at the Highland hollywood train station!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/selinav
30,No big deal,"So, I've seen it. Feels like a bit of inflation of stars lately. You should visit, but there are lots of stars not to get excited about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenas193
40,This is quite a memorial!,The walk of fame is an incredible monument! You can find stars hear from every imaginable every type of entertainment… How about movie stars? Recording stars? You name it and you will find them here… Embedded in the sidewalk is a beautifully engineered bronze star with a name and a symbol of what they're famous for… It's pretty cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daveholden
20,Urgh!,"You have to go if your here just so you've been!!. I went for 10 minutes I read on trip advisor before I went to read reviews and it was described perfectly. It's just a commercial dirty street with everyone asking for money , there are characters dressed as characters such as Spider-Man to captain America they all ask if you want a photo then want money ( obviously) there are also many African Americans putting CDs they've made themselves into your hand for a donation they actually put in right in your hand if your not careful and they get into you for money ... I didn't feel unsafe but you have to just ignore them all and get in and out quick",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/835vickyh
40,Very interesting,"Was very excited to be there. Fun looking at all the names and looking for favorites. But was a little disappointed in the upkeep. Very old, some actually cracked and broken. A lot of street performers, of course if you stop be prepared to pay something. We took a bus tour around Beverly Hills and saw the ""Stars"" houses. The souvenirs were all the same and very dated. After supper at the Hard Rock Cafe, it was like a different place. After 8pm, all of a sudden it was homeless people begging and drug deals going down, we left then as it wasn't for the tourists then it was for the locals. Interesting place though. Very different from where we are from! Would like to go back some day and see more of LA.(This was Sept 2011)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresatg
30,Worth a visit so you can say you have been there,"The celebrity stars are not terribly interesting in themselves, but the street they are lining (Hollywood Blvd) has some character, with older style high-risers that reminded me of New York. This makes it quite different from other parts of LA. I was surprised to see how many relatively un-famous American celebrities that got their own star! You have to be born and raised in the US to be familiar with most of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Family_business
50,Long walk full of stars!,"Greaat way to walk around L.A. You will get to see all the famous star's names. You will enjoy the weather and the people passing by. Also, you can take a lot of pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isra_lm
30,Busy!,Very busy with the cartoon/actor dress ups as well as street performances and preachers.. but it's an experience! Remember to lift your head off the stars occasionally to ensure you don't run into other like minded people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClaireKing92
30,Sleazy part of town!,"Everyone wants to go to the Hollywood Walk of fame and while it is interesting to see the stara on the sidewalk it is in a very sleazy part of town. It is dirty, run down and houses lots of homeless. The only good things are El Capitan, home od Jimmy Kimmel, the Dolby theatre, home of the Oscars, the shopping plaza with a view of the Hollywood Sign and the Hard Rock Cafe. Interesting place to visit but reminds me of Times Square in the 80's before it was cleaned of the smut.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShirleyC184
40,Not what we imagined!,"We arrived in LA after a grueling flight from Australia and after checking into our lovely hotel that was just around the corner, we decided to soak up some Hollywood atmosphere. It did not help that the weather was SCORCHING! We made it to Hollywood blvd and while we loved seeing all the iconic landmarks like the Chinese Theatre, Madame Tussaud's and of course the walk of fame, we were hugely disappointed by the people trying to sell you stuff on the street. We wanted to stop to read some of the stars, but by the end we were put off because if we stopped we were approached by people trying to tell us they were famous singers, or to tell us where to shop. We did not need that hassle at all and it put a damper on our visit. One guy thrust a CD into my husband's hand and then claimed he had to pay $5 for it as he was 'famous'. By the end of our visit we had to walk with our hands in our pockets and eyes down so we would not make eye contact with any of them. We loved going into the tourist shops though, there we could browse in the cool and not get hassled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SVKaz
40,Worth the trip but beware of characters and music cds,It is definitely worth the trip to see the walk of fame. Fun to take pictures in front of the stars you love. Just note that the costume clad people will charge you to take pictures with them and the people autographing CDs only want your money. Beware.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LOVEtoTRAVEL55555
10,See the Homeless Spiderman of Hollywood,"Want to see a big pile of vomit and a homeless man with his pants down on top of your favorite stars star on Hollywood Blvd!? Well your in the right place! You can also meet some very out of work actors and crack addicted people dressed as your favorite super-heroes! Watch out they want money! They are not part of Hollywood official! Watch out homeless Spider-man smells like pee-pee! Meet fat Captain America too! Post Menopausal Marilyn is my fav! Also, fat-drunk-chain-smoking-African-American-Wonder-Woman-with-glasses! ""Don't bother me kid I'm having a smoke break! Classic Americana!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z2807NSmarks
30,Eh.... don't make this the highlight of your trip,Its almost a shame to see the differences along he strip - the gleaming well kept stars in the main sections in front of larger stores to the more unkempt 'forgotten' ones in between sections of (badly) repaired path with tarmac.I was just happy that I found Peter Falk's star... which was the only one I truly wanted to see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drawdoow
20,Pretty underwhelming,Well I've seen it.. But really not all that great. It's literally a pavement.. A dirty pavement littered with people trying to sell you everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/802matthewa
40,The Stars Names are in Concrete on Hollywood Blvd,"Hollywood Bld from Highland to Vine has the names of entertainers who have made their fame in Hollywood imortalized in the sidewalk and viewed by millions of tourists who walk this famous street. The Dolby Theatre is near Highland and the W Hotel is at Vine and in between are all kinds of touristy shops and fast food spots and bars and theatres. The Dolby Theatre is newest theatre with the latest technical advancements. I saw Iris by Cirque du Solei there in 2012 and it was excellent. The W Hotel is outstanding as well, has a rooftop pool, and a club that is popular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomrT3113SC
30,Only in Hollywood!,This is something to see if in Hollywood. It is fun finding the stars you like but unfortunately many of the stars are in need of repair and the pavements are dirty. This is a shame as it is a tourist spot. We hated being hassled all the time by people selling c.d's and tours. Seen it once and that is enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4444Anna4444
10,Just a sidewalk.,It's not worth a special trip just to see this. Mildly interesting to check out if you are there for something else. Street is full of weird costumed characters and people trying to sell you tours and trinkets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/461barbt
50,What's not to love about Hollywood Blvd? Must go!,"No matter what time day or night this place is interesting. People watching is awesome. Loved the walk and seeing the ""stars"" on the ground. Fun to pick out your favorites. Nice seeing Robin Williams star near the Dolby Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anniedutch13
30,Not what I expected.,"I didn't expect that this walk of fame is on the side walk. Maybe I see lots of TV and expected too much. I was quite disappointed to find these stars on a dirty sidewalk. I thought this is a place with respect to honor the celebrities for doing a great job but my oh my, you can spit on them. It's very different how they show this on tv and on the magazines. My expectation of Hollywood in general went from score 10 to 1. Sorry folks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StellaR527
40,Feel the stars,"The place to feel the power of Hollywood. Watching the street shows and getting a selfi with ""movie's hero"".The lights and the crowd gives you the energy to feel as a movie star. Remember that it is all append at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aidenberg
30,Place to visit,If you visit LA the walk of fame is visit you have to do just be careful because people approach you offering their cds or their services and they are very insisting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lully7710
40,hollywood,"went there and crowded, all tourist on the street and specially all super hero there too. nice place to take a picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buncit
40,A must see in Hollywood,"It's a tourist trap in dirty Hollywood, but you've got to do it at least once. Find a map online first or you'll spend a lot of time searching for a specific star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Millerstime
40,Must go,"Went there and maybe spent 2-3 hours. This is a must go, even if it is just for 1 hour, you have to see all those stars and some that your kids will look at you and ask: who is this? Even though that will make you feel old, will bring back some memories!!! And the good thing, there are some where you can say I know who it is but that was way before my time :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dominicp180
30,Stars on the ground,It was ok. If you spend 30 mins there your there too long. The strip of stars are long. But that's about it. You can see everything on the two SHORT blocks. This is where you would sign up for the tours and take pictures with the characters and buy expensive souvenirs. This was a quick check off the bucket list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamaMck
40,"Interesting, but crowded of course!","It was interesting to see the names of all the greats of music, showbiz and the movies! There are about 2 500 stars to be seen, which is quite a challenge to make....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Szomi
30,Ok to pass up,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is cool to see but I think it could be given a miss if you have other things you'd rather do. It's neat seeing the stars' names in the walk but it doesn't really mean anything to me. For those who are more easily star struck or are young and it's their first time seeing the Walk it might be worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9leannes
40,Fun but not all that exciting,"Visited here last weekend, it was about an hour at the most then we left. Its fun to walk around and see the sites, but its literally about one block of excitement. If you blink you miss it. I thought this whole thing was a gigantic piece of the pie but in reality, it was just a simple walk up and down both sides of the road. Zero ""wow"" factor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dackp
40,Iconic experience,"Saturday night, and we are walking down Hollywood Blvd, looking for a restaurant, when we realized we were treading on the Stars. Even with the large number of people doing the same, reading the various names brought back great memories. I don't know the distance from start to finish, but it seemed to be a half mile, and on both sides of the blvd. Whether you start on the East or West, some starts will be facing you and some away, but take your time and relive and revive your memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petetom
40,Fun!,"This is a fun walk. You can look through all the stars and look for your favorite person, see their star and also go to the cement section with the hand prints.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/699MichelH
30,Bit overrated but still worth a look,Its a bit of a tourist trap but still if you are in LA its something that you should check out and get some picsBeware of all the touts looking to milk tourists of their cash though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dodgy-Davey
20,"Not incredible, but must see it if you are in LA for the 1st time","Not as grand and impressive as you'd imagine. Tons of traffic, parking issues....But had to take a guest from overseas here since it is one of the things to do as a tourist/visitor in LA. Fun trying to find your favorite actors stars although being constantly hassled by people trying to get you to eat in their restaurants or sell you tickets to their guided tours spoils to fun a bit. After about 30 mins I was bored of the whole thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cyrilp679
50,Roamimg,We stopped here to walk along and just browse at the stars names and take pics of certain celebrities. I enjoyed our walk it was relaxing as not too many people about later in the evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hebe_7
50,A long long street,"Get sunblock, good shoes and ur cammera.Long walk along thie walk of fame.Suggestion search before where are the stars of your favorite stars or you must walk a long distance",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorisG1
40,Is a star with your name here?,"The famous Hollywood Blvd walk of fame is literally star studded. We played the game of find a star with ""your"" name in it but it's a fascinating tribute to real icons of entertainment that stretches quite some way along the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/837derekw
40,place to be - once,Had one day to repent in LA so I decided to go there. In the end nothing special there. Just those famous stars on the street.But: LA without having seen tose is not LA trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/910karlh
30,Once I found out.......,"I was always very excited to see the stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; then I learned the truth. These stars can be bought. I think that the original stars were really earned, but for awhile now, a good publicist can merely purchase them for their clients. It doesn't mean as much to me as it used it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shirleybeth11
30,It's longer than you think.,"Seemed to walk for ages and kept being harassed by peddlers on the street trying to sell their CD,s - too aggressive. Apart from out site the TCL Chinese Theatre a lot of the walk was grubby and stars damaged. Check out the stars, hand prints outside the TCL Theatre but give the walk for blocks and blocks a miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/57nathanj
20,Eh! Go but lower your expectations WAAAAY down,Just a dirty street with battered stars. See for yourself to say you've been but lower your expectations so you aren't stunned by the many homeless and filth. Looks like there are some cool places but somewhat overshadowed by atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/274kimberlyg

40,"Longer than expected, interesting",A must do for anyone visiting Hollywood. We noticed after walking along for awhile that a couple of celebrities seemed to have more than one star but it was an interesting walk down the Boulevard looking at all of the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Essa13
30,Worth a visit,I was very surprised at how many Stars were on the Walk of Fame. It was great to see.We went very early in the morning as it gets very busy.As they are on a pavement it was quite dirty with the normal spilt drinks etc. There has been no rain for a while to wash the sidewalks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ravenhouse
30,Once in lifetime must see attraction - not a full day activity!,Definitely worth visiting while in LA although i wouldn't plan to spend too long there. Not as grand and impressive as you'd imagine for the somewhere hosting the most glamorous film premières. Fun trying to find your favourite actors/musicians stars although being constantly hassled by people trying to get you to eat in their restaurants or sell you tickets to their guided tours spoils to fun a bit. The Dolby and Chinese theatres are impressive and a must see attraction. The Hard Rock Cafe would be my recommendation for somewhere to eat and look round at all the memorabilia on the walls.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joecB3952MZ
50,Neat,"It was neat checking out the stars on the walk of fame, it was really quite interesting. I did this actually in sept but it will not let me choose that option. I think we should be able to write reviews for places we visited even prior to a year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716carolynb
30,Only souvenir shops,"The whole walk of fame are only stars with names, souvenir shops, a lot of travelers. Nothing special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gggkso

50,Another tick off of the bucket list,"It is exactly how you expect it to be. A street with stars on the pavement.It gave me goose bumps just being there as this is Hollywood, this is the walk of fame and it is iconic.You must visit here when in LA. We were only there for 30 mins as part of a tour - I think I saw what I needed to see. Trying to locate the exact star of your favourite star would just take you away from other cool sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VoucherVera
10,Trap,Worst touristic attraction ever. I cant say a nice word about it. There is nothing special about it. The surrounding area is ugly and full of crooks. Do yourself a favor and stay away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eduardoq90
40,Nice to walk through the Hollywood hall of fame,"The walk through the Hollywood hall of fame is always interesting as to walk past the tiles laid the famous personalities whom we have been watching them all our lives,either on television or in theatres or watching them performing live plus looking out for the new additions,thereby coming to know who we have missed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deepakkalra9

40,Enjoyable as it wasn't too busy,"Like most tourists, we visited as this is just something you have to do when in Rome, or indeed Hollywood. We visited on a Tuesday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. We were able to photograph the stars we wanted to. The area was cleaner than we expected and although there were people trying to sell tours etc it was easy to avoid them. Plenty of places to eat nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pip-F1
30,Worth a visit,"Worth a day trip to see it but I wouldn't spend any more than a day there.Lots of drug abusers and beggars roaming the streets.

40,Trip down memory lane,"Fun thing to go do. Seeing all the names of different actors, musicians, entertainers is a personal trip down memory lane. You think about people that you haven't thought about in a long time, and your personal experiences that go along with that ""Star"". It really was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LanceP519
30,Iconic but Grubby,There is nothing more iconic than the walk of fame. Like all things in Hollywood you can see the extremes of wealth and poverty.

40,Don't stand on Tom Cruise,"'Don't step on Tom Cruise' the tourist shouted.....it may only be a paving stone but there is a strange fascination with staring down at the floor with names you know and some you don't looking back. A few of them could do with cleaning but it has certainly proved popular over the years as the names stretch out for a considerable distance. When in LA......Go on, walk the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sky051

50,Great fun for movie & tv buffs,"Walking down Hollywood Boulevard, you'll see many of your favourite stars & artists at the Hollywood Walk of Fame. There are many look a likes there ready to take photos with the tourists too, for a small fee. A fun adventure whilst in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404AnneS404
50,Worth the Visit,The walk of fame runs a good length of Hollywood Blvd and lets you walk right in front of some impressive landmarks like the Dolby Theatre. There is a parking structure nearby that for $10 you can park all day. Well worth it. You can stop and take pics with all your favorite stars! Lots of good eats nearby too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billmoffatt
30,Dissappointment,"Honestly, the city of Hollywood isn't that great, but this is still a big tourist destination if you're in LA. As a Californian the Hollywood Walk of Fame is a huge disappointment. But if you aren't from California I highly suggest you check it out. There are some cool LA tours, stores, the Chinese Theater, and shops. Overall the city of Hollywood looks a bit run down and sketchy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/836staceyh

30,The stars are yours and only yours at 7 AM,"Had a long layover at LAX and thought that we should see some of LA. Took a taxi to the walk of fame (which cost us 60 bucks...). At 7 AM on a Sunday, this place is dead. Not a sound or movement, apart from a few drunken people on their way home, the occasional dog owner and some homeless persons. It rained. Everything was closed. It was a bit chilly. But we had the stars to ourself. Well, even though we went at a bad hour, we could easily spot that this might not be the most excating place in LA. Should have gone to the Santa Monica pier instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdwardNLN

Symbols of the field of entertainment are on each star by the name. Example: phonograph for music, tv film camera for acting, etc.Out of towners wait to get to the ""walk of fame."" it is hilarious entertainment for the local to take them to the walk and as you pass all the cheezy souvenir stands, very affordable, though, they keep waiting to see the dazzling Walk of Fame. After a few blocks, they ask how close they are! This is after you have been pointing out the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mollyh620
40,One major attraction in Los Angeles,"This is Hollywood, if you are a movie fan, it's a must and funWe live in Los Angeles county for over 30 years and often bring friends or relatives there.

40,Tourist Attraction,You want to meet Spiderman and friends (outside the Studios) that's the place to go. You also can walk the famous stairs where the Oscar Show is every year. Lots of Tourist shops around there.(what you expect?) and a wide variety of Restaurants. Its ok to stroll around for 2 hours but then its enough. You also can visit some Museums if you're interested in or take a guided Bus Tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andy1807
30,A must see but not as exciting as you might think,"Everyone that goes to LA goes to the Walk of Fame, so its a must see experience; however after awhile you get bored because once you've seen one star, you've seen them all! I wouldn't go walking beyond the main strip, because then the area starts to feel dodgy and unsafe, especially when you are on your own. Beware of the people spruiking their CDs..... they will try and give you one and then try to sign it, but they are just after money. Let's face it, the music wont be great so just keep walking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belweckert
20,"A crowded, tacky schlock fest","I took my kids here because they wanted to see the walk and the Hollywood sign, so we checked that off the list. The stars' names are embedded in the sidewalk at random from various eras, so luminaries from the 1930s show up next to modern celebrities.As we expected, our visit in summer featured huge crowds of fellow tourists and scarce, expensive parking. We were also accosted by aggressive hawkers waving placards to herd us into countless souvenir stores and aspiring music promoters trying to press their CDs into our hands.The souvenir shops were, as expected, packed with tacky, cheaply made but expensive badges, posters, stickers, t shirts and coffee mugs. We did see the Hollywood sign, from a great distance from the atrium of a multi story mall.My 14 year old son said, ""Wow, Hollywood is not glamorous at all.""My sentiments exactly. Skip the Walk of Fame. We much preferred our Warner Brothers studio tour , Hollywood Bowl concert, Zuma and Santa Monica beaches and the spectacular Getty Center and Getty Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/selmer
40,Worth a visit,Our hotel was the omni hotel on downtown but I do wish we chose a hotel near here as it was much more lively and busy. We drove here and as usual parking around LA wasn't too difficult to find. Many souvenir shops and places to eat. Worth a wee visit for pics and stuff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glasgowho
30,"Fun to walk, but highly overrated","For $5,000 you too could buy a star. It is fun to see all of the old actor names, but the neighborhood is also dirty and full of transient and homeless. Today any actor, or public figure can buy a star. So the fame game is bogus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
30,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"Good to see, however you get a little tired of potential rap artists trying to sell you there dodgy cds, when you get them home there is nothing much on them, silly me. It is smaller than what I imagined and the actors and characters alone the way are wearing rather shabby outfits, like they made them themselves, still had fun though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerrys380
30,Something to do on the way to something else,It's always cool to see the different Hollywood stars and their names under your feet knowing they've stood where you are.

Beware of vagrants and hustlers in that neighbourhood!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrynnC_12
50,A must if you're from out of town,"If you're not from Los Angeles then you must've decided to come visit it for all the glitz and glam that Hollywood is known for. Well there is no better way then to ""walk"" through time then walking along the stars of yesteryear. Forget the new ""stars"" look for the golden age of Hollywood stars. Look for Michael Jackson, Lucille Ball, etc. -real stars! You won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrBalan11
30,Fun but very crowded.,The walk of fame was cool to see after seeing it on TV for many years. Very crowded but cool. Only giving it three stars because there's no crowd control and seemed a bit dirty for The Hollywood Walk of Fame. Please enjoy the pix.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjbgreenroyd

40,Slice of Hollywood History that Shouldn't be Missed,"You have to take in at least part of the walk of fame. You don't understand how huge the area is until you begin walking it. Part of the fun is just popping up on a random star that you've forgotten about. If you have a famous one in mind, do a little search in advance so you know where its located and you can get your photo op or even leave a flower or card. I've even got photos of my pooches on Rin Tin Tin and Lassie's stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smackie66
30,It will not be what you expect.,"It's a sidewalk people. Not meaning that to be degrading...but it's on Hollywood Blvd. filled to the brim with tourists, transients, and venders selling souvenirs at exhorbatant prices. Sure the area boasts Graumans Chinese Theatre which is a grand Golden Era Hollywood palace, which is worthy. As is The Rosevelt hotel. There is not a shortage of tour companies touting their wares, and there are wax museums, and Ripplys but the sidewalk...whilst fun to see your favorite stars name and get your picture taken,.. well don't venture too far off this beaten ""path"". Six blocks safety to the east at the most. It starts getting (and smelling) a bit dodgy after that. Also, not a place to visit on a sweltering summer day. Live in L.A., work in the motion picture industry and hadn't been back there for twenty-five years. Went back on a whim. My husband and I both agree, we can wait another twenty-five.Just an after...really wish our city would clean it up, it does have such potential for a lasting good tourist memory, just in my opinion, not as it is now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heathersmist

20,Disappointing,"Going to Hollywood area isn't my favorite thing to do.... Tons of traffic, parking issues....But had to take a guest from overseas here since it is one of the things to do as a tourist/visitor in LA. We walked up and down the street and recognized the names of Hollywood stars. There is a place you can also see some foot and hand prints. The best of this experience was seeing Shirley Temple's cute little prints. I really hope Hollywood had better things to offer.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WandererSun
20,Overrated not sure what the appeal is.,"This review is from the point of view of a local resident. I have worked in this area for many years and just don't get the appeal. Tourist flock to see the various stars on the boulevard.Here's what I see...tourist sitting, touching, even kissing the stars on the Walk of Fame. What they don't know is that those very same stars are urinated on, spit on etc by the homeless and drunk crowd that generally congregate in this area after hours.If you wish to visit do so but please DON'T TOUCH!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damyd
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a terrific walk that will take you down memory lane with all of the great movie stars that are honored there. While on the walk be certain to visit the Chinese Theater...this will add a lot to what the walk did for you. enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerrykritzman
30,Tourist trap,"Every city has at least one area that is designated for tourists or people who live in the area. I lived in the area and know it well. There are a handful of good restaurants in the area but quite honestly, I don't see the attraction. There are so many other areas in Los Angeles to go to. Walking around looking at a bunch of bricks with people's names on them isn't the most exciting way to spend the day. Just one person's opinion. The Hollywood area has a lot to offer even if you never stop by Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StationToStation
40,Fun and Interesting,"It was good fun walking passed the stars on the hunt for actors you know; there'll be plenty you don't!It's free, there's food about, and everyone else is stopping in the middle of the path for a photo so you don't need to feel guilty doing it too.Worth a night trip for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P6219WTmichaelh
20,Not what I expected,I was pretty disapointed. I expected it to be in a nicer or prettier spot I suppose. All these cheap touristy shops that sell ashtrays and tshirts line the street. I was standing there admiring a star and a robbery happened ten feet in front of me. A girl took off with a bottle of alcohol. The stars themselves were nice but I just thought itd be abit fancier of a spot. Would I go again? No thank you. But at least i can now say I went.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natasha00176
30,Certainly overrated...,"Using cropping and other tricks, what you see is definitely not what you expect to see after how they've shown this place to us over the years.

30,stars on the ground,"If you like looking at names in stars on the ground, this is for you.

50,"If your are tourist, this is excellent","The famous Hollywood Walk of fame, pardon the pun, is a great tourist attraction, but ignore the dirty streets, the homeless, the traffic, and the hustlers. Find your favorite artists' star and take great photos to show your friends. Plan for about 1 hour to do this. Plenty of gift shops. Oh, and if you like music, the best walk of fame is in front of Guitar Center on Sunset. A much better option and less crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trekkerFrank

After about 30 mins I was bored of the whole thing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertpannell

30,Meh,"Truth is Hollywood Walk of Fame is overrated and overhyped.

20,"Oy, what a zoo","We were on a business trip and found some time to be touristy and wound up on one of the cheesy ""see the celebrity's houses"" tours which includes some time walking the Hollywood Walk of Fame.The cast of characters runs deeper than the ones portrayed by the celebrities honored with stars.The heart of the main stretch was overrun with people; literally no room for people to walk on the sidewalks. Each person wanting to take pics in from of their favorite celebrity's star, which of course makes pedestrian traffic a mess.Everything is hyper-commercialized and the quality of most of what's for sale is poor at best.But, it certainly lives up to the hype.Was a fun place to see.

50,Cross another off my bucket list: Hollywood Walk of Fame,"Cross another one off my bucket list! Who does not dream of one day going to Hollywood and walking down the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the hopes of seeing the names of their favorite movie stars, movie directors, and other personalities? It's also fun to shop the souvenir shops along the way so that one can bring back some Hollywood memorabilia, much of which is reasonably priced. I bought Hollywood Walk of Fame coasters and a Walk of Fame magnet for my refrigerator. My cousin bought herself a Walk of Fame coffee mug. Of course, one can also spend big bucks on some of the hard-to-get movie theater posters. Be aware that as you walk down the sidewalk, you will encounter people playing gambling games on the sidewalk in an attempt to con you out of your money; some people abhor this; I took it for what it was: The full Hollywood experience :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltoforeignlands

I was back a couple of week ago to see an excellent Second City comedy show, but my wife and daughter were disappointed by how seedy this areas still is. The footprints in front of the Chinese theater are interesting if you know old movie stars, and at least one of the tour companies is supposed to give fun bus tours, but I recommend taking the tours of Sony, Paramount and Warner Bros. studios instead of hanging out on Hollywood Blvd. There is (or was?) a Disney soda fountain/Sandwich shop next to the El Capitan, and you can take a subway right into the heart of the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/533TomS
40,Popular With Tourists and D-Listers,"This feature of sidewalks in the Hollywood area has kind of gotten out of hand. It is spread out all over the place, and some of the areas in which you can find stars in the sidewalks are places I would be wary of going to.

30,Not so Special,"It is just a street with Hollywood star signature, not sure why people go mad here and click hundreds of photographs. If you are visiting this area just for this street, then better not; there are better places in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imhuzefa
30,Its part of the experience,"How can you say I went to Hollywood or LA or CA without walking the stars? Yeah - its a little boring after 30 seconds, so pick your favorite star of all time, google the stars address, get you picture in next to your favorite, check it off your list of ""yes i went there's"" in your life. Anyone who frowns at the legendary aspects and significance of a star just doesn't get it and should not go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tripking07
30,Be Cautious and Enjoy,"I have mixed feelings on my opinion in this area of Los Angeles. On the one hand it is very historical and very interesting. There are old hotels, Grauman's Chinese Theater, Ripley's Believe it or not, and Madame Tussauds. The stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are fascinating to read from one to the next. Is really so much to do its hard to take it all in and one day if you're very thorough about it. Allow a couple of days. There are also some really good guitar players along the way that you can enjoy and drop a little money into their collection boxes. The one thing to be cautious about is that there are some somewhat strange people loitering about the street. They will call out to you. Be careful and keep your hands on your kids.On a serious note, there is a parking garage across from the Roosevelt Hotel. If you park there try to get to the roof. Because from the roof you can watch the live music that is filmed for the Jimmy Kimmel show. That is a really cool experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/893cyndyb
20,Boring,Nothing to do appart to se stupids stars on the floor.I recommend that tour to the common tourist who only want to take selfies for his friends... because thath place is not interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/390andr_sm
40,Neck ache,"You'll have neck ache reading all the stars names, some you'll recognise, others you won't but the Walk of Fame is actually on both sides of Hollywood Boulevard and goes on for about half a mile either side of Manns Chinese theatre so get ready for lots of walking. Everybody else is doing the same thing so you won't be alone! The main bit, where the hand and foot prints are is right in front of the theatre",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CordonGordon
40,"Walk Down Hollywood Blvd and view the names of Movie, TV and Radio Stars.","Walking down Hollywood Blvd is an experience you will enjoy. View the names of Movie, TV and Radio Stars. Hollywood Blvd has become a major tourist attraction for Los Angeles. Many shops and unique experiences along the way. A nice place to spend a few hours. The ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" show broadcasts from a studio located on Hollywood Blvd just west of Highland Ave. If you can get tickets, a nice way to view a TV broadcast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisz282
40,Busy but fun,"Its just as you'd expect it to be really - sidewalks full of stars : ) Its fun to walk down and see who you know - but it is a busy busy place and you have to be ready for lots of people to be there!! We spent half an hour looking at them, then on we went. Glad we saw them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyKaf
30,A different world,"Coming from a small town... spending a afternoon/evening walking on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was an experience of a lifetime. Different people, languages and so much history. It was hard not to be in awe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seldom_travel70
30,Wear good shoes; the place smells like Urine,"While walking up and down the street looking at Hollywood stars, we were struck by how much the sidewalks smelled like urine. So, if you plan to visit Hollywood, wear good shoes. You never know what you will be walking through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Old-Socialist
20,Not as expected,Good place to visit but put in mind this things:-1-alot of people will approach you selling their musics.2- alot of people will shout at you inviting you to go in places like shops etc.3- alot of rude people will block your move just to take photo.4- very small street to walk in. I just didnt like the place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corleoney
40,Do this to make it personal ...,There are just a few things that you have to do in Hollywood - look at the Hollywood sign for real and walk down the Walk of Fame. There will be loads of names you'll recognise and it'll make the next time you see it on TV more personal. You'll probably have to be patient to get any photos without other people's feet in the shot!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardaL1371CF
40,Interesting experience,"Interesting experience, was fun looking at these although lots of people there.. Lots of photo opportunities!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leecurlywurly1
50,Fun!,"Make sure you wear comfortable shoes and go explore - it does get busy and crowded, but it is worth it. Loved the atmosphere there. Legendary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilanaGirl
40,Good sight-seeing moments,"Star-studded sidewalks spanned the entire Hollywood neighborhood and was good fun to see - tracking down your fav stars, marveling at names you recognize. Good fun to just keep your eyes on the sidewalk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/930minnam
30,A bit disappointing,"Great to see the famous Hollywood stars in the pavement, but we were surprised what a cheap and touristy area this is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Potomac_11
50,So much to see!,You just won't get to see everthing! There should be a map 😊 but it's so much fun to just walk recognizing the stars and remembering why they deserve (or not) a star,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/e125angel
40,Walk the fame ignore the dirty shops,Worth the walk because it goes by some iconic sights that bring good movie memories. It is however surrounded by tourist gift traps and sleazy stores you don't expect. I am sure some stars are ashamed to have their star close to such dirty shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dicksmith24
50,Loved it!,Awesome to see all of the Hollywood stars immortalized like this. Could spend hours walking up and down the street checking out who has a star and where it is!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Piggysangel
40,It's American lt's crazy but fun,"Looking at the stars, remembering some of those great movies, seeing other people reminisce it's all fun. Looking at the impersonators the cars the the people the atmosphere it's all good natured fun. There's plenty of places to eat and drink for the family or adults. Just be a little careful like any major tourist destination some people are not so nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kierran2
30,Not that glamourous,"We visited here early in the day, around 9.30am and it was not very busy then. It gets much more crowded around lunchtime (we came back through here then). There are many more hawkers and peddlers around at that time trying to get you on tours and sell you things. Yes, there are also lots of homeless, but they keep to themselves. The stars on the walk of fame for me were a slight let down. They give out so many that it seemed to decrease the impact of it. There were some big stars, although they seem to be located more in the Chinese Theater across the road from the Roosevelt Hotel. To get a star, the person (or animal), as well as paying $30,000 for the privilege, has to be famous for at least five years in one of the entertainment industries i.e. movies, television, radio, live theater or music. Reality TV stars are excluded (what a shame - NOT!). So whilst Kim K misses out, the great Rin Tin Tin, Lassie, Kermit the Frog and Mickey Mouse all get stars - there is some justice in the world after all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
30,Cool but crowded,Seeing the stars is cool because they're so iconic but it's a little anticlimactic. It's also very crowded. Worth a visit but you probably won't spend much time there looking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rachelrowe14
40,Spand an hour here if you've made the trip to Hollywood.,Nice way to spend an hour - posing nest to the stars of your favourite celebrities. Interesting to hear from a local the amount they pay to get their name there and the process of star unveiling.No need to walk the whole route....and watch out for the guys handing out CD's of their music. Some got grumpy when the kids said no.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lexibrat
50,Star gazing,Its interesting walking along the broadwalk and seeing all the hollywood stars on the ground and having a photo with your favourite one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraceyQLD
40,Vine Street Walk of Fame,"It was good to see stars but I could only find the olden time actors and actresses, there is no signage to say where the rest of the stars were located. True there is homeless staying in that area, 99% are harmless who don't bother you. Vine Street is clean and there are supermarkets like Walgreen and some very nice restaurants nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EileenKumar
50,HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD BUZZ!!,"We visited this famous Hollywood attraction with the RASTA BUS tour and have to say that it was the highlight of the day. Great buzz and action all about the streets with people from all around the world eagerly searching out their Hollywood Stars, handprints and footprints outside the TCL Chinese Theatre. Would like to have had more time there to explore the area in greater detail, so will just have to go back I guess. Well worth experiencing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patricko653
40,Find Your Favorite,And enjoy the crowds and sights. There are many eateries and inexpensive souvenir shops. The Jimmy Kimmel show is right there too. If you love to people watch.... this is your place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JEFFREYG430
30,Hollywood Walk of Shame.,"Really disappointed, not with The Walk of Fame itself, but the way its been neglected. You go to see Glitz & Glamour but find it needs cleaning up somewhat, We called into MacDonalds, it was disgusting, young girl in toilet, high on drugs, she could have only been about 14yrs of age & the interior was really dirty & neglected & that,s being polite. The down & outs just lying on the roadside. The people walk past without a second glance its obviously an everyday occurrence, even acceptable, so sad. Surely a place as of Fame as Hollywood should be cleaned up .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/758sheilag
40,Fun but a little over-crowded,"We had fun on this visit, we came with our tour group with Quality Tours of Las Vegas. Definitely something to keep you entertained for a good hour or so. Lots of interesting people walking around in funny costumes, a little over-crowded, seems like a very popular tourist area. Good shopping, good photo opportunities, make sure you check out the Hollywood Sign view from the 3rd floor of the Highland Center, fun day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/195waynef
30,Cool and Historic,"It was Cool and Historic BUT......Homeless all over, people in costumes trying to grab at you to take your picture with them and then charge you. Everyone smokes pot openly. All the food establishments expensive. People handing out leaflets because they run the best Hollywood stars tours. It was Cool but real dirty, I went once. Once was enough. Don't bring your kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doreenl835
40,Busy,liked being able to drive up the road and see all the star signs on the road and the Chinese theatre. Wasnt sure about parking so didnt stop as had been before but if you know the places to park go for it!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Northcotequine2013
40,Busy!,"Very, very busy. But it doesn't matter. You see some amazing people, from all walks of life. I took a photo of Betty White's star, and two seconds later someone was grabbing me to read my palm, but then RIGHT after that, I was holding a full grown albino boa constrictor, and we took a selfie together. I walked up from near the Scientology Center to Madame Tussauds and back, and it was very much an adventure. Not recommended for anyone who has anxiety or crowd issues though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/12jessn
30,"Nice to see, but really, I think we could have made better use of our limited time.","It's fun to walk the street and see all the stars names, but really it wasn't as big of a deal as I thought it would be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B7930QHruthb
40,"Crowded, yes! Hot, yes! Worth it, yes!","I did a LA tour that stopped off here for an hour. I loved the experience - walking up and down looking at the stars, getting a photo with the Hollywood sign in the background, shopping for tacky souvenirs - perfect for a tourist!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malomax
40,Great to see,It's one of the world's iconic things to see - walking down Hollywood Blvd seeing who's names you recognise. Worth doing when in Hollywood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beardo-and-lindbags

40,Interesting Walk,The Hollywood Walk of Fame goes on for blocks on bothe side of the street. It is very hard to find the star you are looking for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110ellenb
40,Unexpected Fun!,"I was walking around Hollywood on my last night in LA, and ran into the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was fun to see all of the stars, although my young coworker made me feel quite old because she didn't recognize any name from before 2000. A fun part of our short trip through Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SororSalsa
50,A must do ...,"You cannot go to Hollywood without walking along the Walk of Fame! From one end to the other! It is need to see your favorite stars and celebrities right there. They were there, they stilled right where you're standing looking at that store. You want to take pictures of 90% of the ones you pass by. It's great to do at least once. And then to see the look alikes standing there, you almost feel like you're in Vegas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovelife2015
50,Great CA tourist outting,"Visited LA area for a wedding. Enjoyed seeing the Walk Of Fame, foot/hand prints of the stars, famous buildings in Hollywood. Only viewed the HOLLYWOOD Sign from afar. Saw the famous Mel's Drive-In. While walking down the main street, I was pulled over and sandwiched between 2 females in pirates costumes, held onto my arm til my husband took a picture, then wanted a fee. I was startled due to the aggressiveness of some of those panhandlers!! We discovered some good food, some expensive, some reasonable priced. Lots of Hollywood memorabilia to be purchased in the many shops. We enjoyed the day site seeing in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adlinem2015
30,Hollywood Mixed Walk of Fame,"We passed through during the day and then at night, but must say if we had planned a specific trip it may have left us disappointed. In the kind hand great to see such star names embodied bad celebrated but the area could do with a spruce. As was full of homeless people and people annoying you trying to sell you something. Not very well signposted. Worth a visit but only if passing through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSA84
20,Such a busy street!,"Although it is great to name spot, it is a much longer road than you would anticipate. At night, with all the lights, cars and people, it can be a little overwhelming and blooming obvious that you are tourists because you are constantly staring at the ground!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimd162
40,Must see,Cld spend hours just looking at famous people's stars. Covers vast area. Best to visit day time or early evening. Bit of run down area. Not very safe at night,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/889inasanderson
50,awesome place,"is so beutiful at night, so much colors n lights, cheaper clothes, ppls dress up like the famous , u can take a pic with them, some will do it for free other u can just give them a little tips , is a free shows at night there , if you have kids they will love it is a lot characters there , they can take a pic with them, i was expecting this place was a little more clean because the stars, but nop , is a really fun experience i will do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sasharussel

40,Must see for tourists!,"Good experience and a must see for all tourists. There is a lot of wannabe hip hop artists handing our their CD's hassling you to take them and then ask you for money for them etc which can be annoying, but other than that I found it good, great to see the stars, once is enough :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/734emman
40,One-time Fun,"The Walk of Fame is a one-time attraction--in other words, one need not return after going for the first time. Throbs of tourists line the street and gawk at the stars on the ground. It was nice to have been there to see the walk, but there is not much else to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KU90
50,You have to see this when in Hollywood!,This is a given when in Hollywood! Lots of stars and lots of history! Make sure you go on the side streets so you can see all of the stars! So cool!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorip849
30,Always a crowd around most famous,There were more celebrities on the walk than expected and the whole thing takes up that whole streetPretty cool to walk downBe sure to go to the starting status to learn more about the walk and its ideasBe aware most famous will attract most tourists so might get caught up in people trying to take picturesBe cautious of those dressed up in costumes to take pictures with you - they expect to be tippedGuys handing out 'free' mix tapes expect you to give them some money too and can get quite rude and pushy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cj0c
50,Clean :),"A lot of friends were telling me that the walk of fame is dirty street with a bunch of homeless people. Well, I guess we hit it on a day that they cleaned the streets xD it was a fun nice experience to walk around and find stars of celebrities that we know, taking pictures and exploring. It's definitely in my top 5 to see from LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnitaK0sta
40,Hollywood Hype,"Kids got a thrill to see their famous pink stars and the traditional walt disney on the pavement. Very tourist focussed, you can take a photo with various characters but you'll need to tip, its a must see if you're a fan of all the hollywood hype, grungy and a bit trashy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theleigh1
40,Wear comfortable footwear you will need it,It is so iconic that you forget that they are just names on the pavement but you cannot help ponging out the names as you find them. Even if you only walk a few yards you will soon get caught up in the search for the big names that are all here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6003AQjohnm
10,"A waste of time to do a ""must""","We've done it during daytime. It was very hot, that's not the issue( who can control weather?!) , the dodginess of the place is unbelievable, bad smells from everywhere, the shops (OMG!!!!) hold your children close and make sure you'll find your car on the way back.We didn't do whole of it, we had enough only on one side: beggers, agressive tour agents...; maybe that's way people suggest to do it in the evening or night time: not to see the dirt, or dodginess... just the pretty lights.....Awful side walk with stars , with names on it between dodgy shops and a road",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariaB767

20,Disappointed,We were excited to see this area and were dussapointed with the dirtiness in the street. A lot of homeless people. Did not stay long .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Martismomma
20,Very touristy,It was cool to see this famous landmark. We went expecting it to be cheesy and it was. Had to see it once but nothing spectacular. It's a typical tourist trap. As soon as you get away from the Dolby theatre it goes down hill with closed window fronts and cleanliness is not the greatest. I would still recommend you go but it won't be the highlight of your trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathieH828
40,Walking with the Stars,"This is a must visit, if you happen to be in LA. To many people it's just a side walk. But to many others it's experiencing Hollywood. Walking along the names of some great artists whom many of us admire on the big screen. Getting your picture clicked with the name of your favorite celebrity.I happened to visit the place soon after Robin William's death. A heartwarming gesture was displayed by the fans by placing flowers on his named star. Which just showed how much people admired him. So it would be correct to say that this is a monumental place.Next to the walk of fame is the TCL Chinese theater and in front of it is the hand-prints, footprints and autographs of 200 celebrities. Which is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/572aasthag
30,More Hype than the real experience,It has been hyped more than the real experience. It is good only if you are big fan of any Hollywood Star and crazy to have your pic with the star of his name. There are many other attractive place to visit then Hollywood Walk of Fame. Hollywood Walk of Fame should be the last option to visit in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CocoGoel

30,Dirty and damage,"I visited this place for the first time 20 years ago. I return to show it to some friends and we found it really dirty, many of the stars broken or damaged.

30,Average place. you should go there for the sake of it but that's it,Average place. you should go there for the sake of it but that's it. plan to walk at least 2 hours if you wish to see all the stars. go to wikipedia and find addresses for all the famous starts you want to check out and then map your walk before you go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sallo45

30,Meh! Could take it or leave it.,"Unless you really want to see a particular star, this area is very crowded with people hawking wares and tons of crowds and weirdos.

50,Hollywood blvd stroll,"It was our second time to Los Angeles and this time around we did a Hollywood tour (well worth it) and took a walk down Hollywood blvd from the location of the tour up to the Kodak center. It was awesome, some shady people and surprisingly no police officers visible. I was with my mom and dad and my three year old. It was the middle of the day. I would not go at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferpU7116QZ
30,Hot Day,What a hot day it was. An average attraction with some people dress in super heroes customes. I just like the quite big souvenir shop at the corner. You can buy a mini Oscar statue for everyone from your loved ones to employees etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelwozniak
30,"One time ""must see""","Tacky, loud, smelly. Bunch of poorly dressed impersonators asking for tips, guys selling cd's and LA tours.

Too busy and too hot during the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jets3t5r11
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,This is a fun walk. There are lots of museums and places of interest along it. I would suggest you see it both in daytime and evening hours. Hollywood does not do daytime well as far as looks go. Bright lights make such a difference. But walk the walk and find your entertainment favorites. Just enjoy!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMackey

20,Is it required??,"As I write this I am conflicted .... Is it required to visit the walk of Fame when in Hollywood? I have visited the area on several occasions not the nicest area of Hollywood infact its very dirty//kinda trashy nasty even during the day. The stars themselves are kinda cool but finding ""FAMOUS"" people you want to see is dumb luck~ I think they have a chart where all the stars are placed if you are looking for one in particular . I would recommend to visit only if you are a true ""tourist"" enthusiast so you can say you did.I would do it before *10am so you can check out the STARS otherwise its crowded with impersonators and pushy people. Not a good place at night with kids in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bornfabulous
20,Whats the point?,"A ubiquitous part of Hollywood and in some cultures I'm told you put the names or likenesses of people you don't like in the pavement so you can walk on them? Become a star so people can walk on you one day! When you closely examine the lives of these ""stars of Hollywood"" that's not far from the truth either. I've walked up and down the walk of fame with its dirty streets and cheap t-shirt shops and abundant Thai restaurants for years and all I feel is sorry for those people who in many cases sold their souls for 15 minutes of fame. BTW avoid the cracks or you will break your mother's back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/845terrye

50,Expensive,"exciting looking at the names of the stars not far from Melrose and Fabulous shops. Very expensive place to be . bought a bottle of after shave and have it locked in a security box- it was so expensive.......... somebody told me that they saw my name on the pavement ,I think its grafity and not in Hollywood .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/97diarmuid
50,The Stars,"Well worth seeing, but you need to have a comfortable pair of walking shoes on. The distance is so vast to see all of it so the best thing to do is buy the Celebrity Star Directory which gives you all the info on where to find your favourite stars on the hall of fame. It costs just a couple of dollars and well worth it as you will then have a little keep sake for ever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneGash
20,A bit scary at night,"I wouldn't recommend visiting the walk fo fame at night, especially near the Chinese Theater. Lots of people begging for money, and being very rude about it. Won't leave you alone even if you say no. One was shouting ""I'll kill you"" at someone, and when police showed up, even started shouting with them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christophercB7504LW
30,It's a nice walk,"We walked once late night and once during the day, during our visit to LA. It was a nice walk and felt a little strange walking over the names of celebrities. But would say it was okay. Didn't spot any celebrity and feel it's all over hyped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AGeeKay
20,Ehh.,"Wouldn't have gone if i weren't in the area already. I'm glad I've been, but would not go back, nor recommend it unless you're really interested in celebrity culture. It's busy, very crowded, highly commercialised and there's people trying to scam, pickpocket or beg you every other step. Avoid unless it's a high priority for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/155willm
40,It looks better in real life,Nice and crowded. There is always something happening here. It was nice to see stars of my favorite showbiz people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timoteoc907
20,It's a pity,"I stayed near here for nearly a week and I visited the stars at different times of the day hoping that they would be different. Unfortunately it didn't matter matter what time of the day I visited, they were always the same. As many other people mentioned they were dirty, there were strange people around and it was smelly.It's definitely not how I imagined it.Saying that, I would still advise people to see it and to seek out the stars of your favourite actor/ director or whoever because it's still cool to see their name, know that they have been there at some point and to take a photo to keep forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMD83
50,A must see! Great picture opportunities.,What an amazing place! The walk of fame is definitely worth a visit when you visit LA and from there you can also see the Hollywood Sign. Absolutely loved LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/402amyb52

40,See the stars.,"Lots of stores, stars and performers. Come out at night and you are sure to have an eye opening experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/medix12
30,It was okay,"Didn't realism the distance this spans so didn't walk the entire length. Enjoyed finding some of our favorites. However we were constantly accosted by homeless begging , people selling things, and people soliciting services to the point it got just too much. It was also hard to stop at some of the stars as there were lots of people everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/527mechellem
10,Walk of Urine Odor,"That whole street needs a renewal. It was very disappointing. The street is dirty and stinky, there were strange hooligans around picking cigarette stub from trash. In every 2 seconds there were people stopping and inviting us for tourist bus.I´m from a country where I saw such things many times, I have no big problem with it, but it is not what I expected from Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Millefoli
40,Saw what I needed to see,This was a good way to pass a bit of time when waiting for a tour. I was looking for Bryan adams' star and I found it with a bit of pre-studying via Google with minimal fuss. Saw a lot of other cool and familiar names along the way too. Some celebs have 5 stars to their name (there's 5 categories).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/feonagh
50,Stars in my eyes,We are native Californian's and never went to the Walk of Fame until we moved to Arizona! Lots to see and if you go early in the day you will miss the crowds. We also went to the Chinese theater. They give you a 45 minute guided tour. The guide knows so much and the theater is incredible! Lots of costumes and interesting facts while on the tour. We were very pleased we went and had a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindamD8112ZW
30,I guess worth it to see once,"It was really cool to see one time, but I can't ever imagine myself going there again (unless it's to see the love of my life, Paul Rudd's star).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erin122
20,Grubby and tired.,"Was expecting more, grubby and tired, we did not stay as long as we had planned, the area had more than its share of homeless folk, i understand why as it is a tourist trap and I sympathize but it did put Hollywood in general in to some real perspective for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barlotti57
50,Walk of Fame,I took the bus tour around the Walk of Fame and Beverly Hills. It was great to see and view the houses of the rich and famous. The tour bus guy was very friendly and fun to guide us around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ylnsie
30,honeymoon/travelling,I was a bit let down by this if I'm honest thought it was going to be a lot better then it was. its nice to see everyone's famous name in starts and look for it but its not well kept and you feel like your getting in peoples way as its on the streets,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kellypartridge
40,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"Great to see but It was very busy once you see it, not sure if I would do it again. Stars in the pavement are very cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conniea664
20,No More Than An Hour Required,"To be honest you may even find it difficult to spend an hour of your time here but we did venture into the Ghirardelli ice cream shop for a break from all of the impersonators.As soon as we got off the metro the tackiness was immediately in your face, I honestly thought we were in the wrong place.We walked along the road to glimpse at the stars, or at least try to, there was that much dirt and trash. Every other minute we were harassed by people in cheap mostly damaged fancy dress costumes wanting to charge us to take a picture with them or people thrusting celebrity homes maps in our faces pushing to sell all sorts of celeb themed tours which was of no interest to us.We didn't even look like tourists so I think they target everyone.The only peace we had was by entering the small outdoor mall next to the Chinese Theatre, from the bridges here you can see the Hollywood Sign.All in all I am glad we visited here, weren't impressed by the stars but the hand prints where fun to view on the theatre floor. I wouldn't come here again but would recommend it as a quick stop on the way somewhere else, we were on our way to the Laker's Game (they lost...disappointing day).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PurpleBeach5
40,Walk of Fame,"Tourist trap but oh well, if you are a tourist you might as well be trapped! Outdoors walk so it will be hot in the summer. Maybe in the afternoon would be a better time to visit. Always packed. If you want to see a specific star, google it first beacuse it can take you all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cascarita
30,Do it once,"If you have time, go see the Walk of Fame. It's busy and crowded and mainly bars and I love LA type tourist shops. Do it once but it's not somewhere that you would want to stay all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mandyb192
20,Ten minutes and you're done,"Growing up I always dreamed of walking down this street and seeing all of the names in the stars. Unfortunately, this experience was so different from what I expected.This area has very little restriction on what you can and cannot do, and because of this you see everything (mostly bad). You will walk past urine smells, people coming straight up to you and hitting on you, and even people changing all of their clothes right in front of you.Looking down at the names on the stars is cool for a few minutes, but be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkono
30,You have to go at least once,"If you are going to Los Angeles for the first time it definitely is a must but its gotten so touristy with people dressing up as characters and charging for pictures with them. I enjoyed the hand prints of the old actors and actresses. My kids had no clue who most of them were its a sign of the times gone by. Lots of traffic so be patient,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/takemeaway50

30,nice to see but keep hold of your stuff and reseach first,"Average for what you think it will be like, nice to see the stars but it's not the best street to walk down. Hollywood Blvd is one of those streets you want to keep a hold of your bag / possession. There are loads so if you have specific ones you want to see I suggest doing a little research first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mypixietravels
30,Too big,"need to see, but there is a lot of stars, so make a plan from home who you want to see.It is really big",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathrineChristian
50,Star feeling.,Best time to visit Hollywood walk of fame is after sun down and will enjoy the lights and carry creature's act so you feel like you're having good time with star fame. Best place to spend time to add milestone in your travel vacation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogendrar740
30,Could be better!,Well... For such a touristy boulevard I have to say it is not clean at all. It smells bad and the streets are not clean. You see a lot of people asking for money and a lot of tour sellers that literally almost attack you cuz they want you to buy them some tours. Wouldn´t do it again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabrielaGtzB
50,Fun and quick,The walk of fame is actually spread over several blocks! We went around the area next to the Chinese theater. It was fun but very crowded. Worth a stop if it's your first or only time in Los Angeles so you can mark it off your bucket list!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2JenL
30,Overrated experience,"I don't think this is as amazing experience as they are advertising it. There is a small area with few nice shops and restorants around it, but most of the surroundings are old cars resellers and other things not even remotely related to the Hollywood topic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N6779IXmartinb
40,Find your favourite,I found this surprisingly interested trying to put faces to the name. We were lucky as it was not busy and had time to linger,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TOMinRedcar
30,Not The Highlight of My Trip,"Okay, so it is worth seeing once in your life, even rather like a game trying to find the stars on the pavement for your favorite celebrities. However, the charm wears away quickly in the massive crowds, as strangers shove CD's in your face and ask you to take one, only to then harass you for money that you took what they were literally forcing on you. Having said that, don't take any CD's.The other trick is the people who dress up like celebrities, only to ask if you want a picture made with them. Again, caution, they don't tell you in advance, but this isn't a community free service. They will then start asking for money since you took a picture.Overall, find the stars on the sidewalk, enjoy the visual stimulation, but keep walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaSparks5005
20,Eek!,"Found it quite shabby. Be on the look out for aggressive mentally ill persons. We got accosted twice. It's fun finding your favourites on the walk of fame, but that's about it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betho598
30,Look up your favorites!,"It's fun to spot all the people you know from the stars, maybe just on the way to the store. Walk of Fame is a pretty iconic part of Hollywood and you can't really miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tuyazh
20,Don't be surprised to be underwhelmed by the experience,"If you're looking for a specific celebrity star, you're a superfan or obsessed in some way, then it is certainly worth it. If you happen to have to walk down this stretch of sidewalk, it is also worth the trip. I would not recommend going out your way just to see the Walk of Fame. It has a Times Square feel, but not in the good way...in the characters and street performers, people handing out CD's, some just asking for money outright.I enjoyed some of the other typically 'tourist' stuff in the area, but I didn't find anything special about the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niclydon
10,Not what I expected,"Really, it's just what is says.You walk over a pavement with some names on it.Expected more of it.There are even too much to see them all and remember the first one at the end",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mennov783
50,Awesome,"Busy as you would expect but what a buzz! Loved it!Things to watch out for, you'll have to pay to take pictures with the look alikes on the side walks.Be sure to stop by the Chinese theatre!Also there is a building you can go up to see the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lightchild
50,Nostalgic and a great time for movie buffs.,"Walking the walk of fame is simply a great time while in Los Angeles. Seeing names of famous people inscribed simply brings a smile to your face. Be sure to visit the Chinese theatre where you'll find more actors personal greetings and people dressed up as movie characters, be be forewarned, be sure to tip them as a courtesy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/torresconsultinggrof
20,Certainly Not the Good Old Days!,"A trip to the Los Angeles area must be very exciting for first time visitors. After all it is a land with incredible weather most of the time and the birthplace of our movie industry. Celebrities we have seen and favored on-screen seem to come alive when we walk in their footsteps. Stars of the stars adorn many of the sidewalks in this unique community.What they don’t tell you is that the Hollywood walk of fame is more like a “walk of shame”. Instead of seeing and historic perspective with glamour and celebrity, we experience in many cases the dregs of society. Dirty streets, rambunctious crowds and a few pickpockets seem to dominate many of the published attractions. Instead of the celebration of yesteryear, the historic significance of many of our screen stars are lost within the buildings made famous because of their industry.In all fairness however, the minibus tour of celebrity homes in Beverly Hills and Hollywood as well as some of the historic buildings and places frequented by actors in the past was quite interesting. It was enjoyable to see the homes and reflect back on what it must have been when Hollywood was a shining star.Now the star is heavily tarnished and like spoiled milk and rotten potatoes the Hollywood Walk of Fame has a new infamy, one of obtuse moral behavior. My recommendation: Take the kids to Universal Studios and unless you are looking for examples of a society in degradation, skipped the “Walk”.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinMan760
30,Boring and average,Its not what you expect it's just a cracked up dirty footpath. Yes there is famous names vut don't expect glamour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jojacon
30,Tourist trap.,Nothing to get excited about unless your a film nut.Would not go again myself as the weather was too hot and area too crowded but if that's your scene go for it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArferUk
30,A must but a disappointment,"I guess it is a must see if in LA, but some of the stars were broken and the commerse along the road made parts of the walk feel shabby. With all the tourists coming to LA you would thing the city could hand out free maps of where you could find different celebrities stars, but no.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agd2015
40,A must visit place when you are in LA,We had the opportunity to visit Hollywood Walk of Fame during our stay in Los Angeles. My kids were very excited to see the Hollywood. We walked around on the STARS on the floor with actors names engraved. We took open mini van tour of Hollywood and Beverly hills area. Very good and informative trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rookie8155
10,Nope!,Really do not waste your time. Its dirty! Its boring! No good shops! Homeless people lined along the sidewalks asking for money. I do not recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zipdip1212

50,cool!,It is pretty cool. I love that there are random people hanging out in costume waiting for you to take a picture with them. I love that there are street artists and creative people. It is a good place for people watching,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/313basmab
20,Hollywood Walk of Shame,"Unfortunately, this was not as glamorous as it is made out to be. The streets are dirty, the city isn't that clean, and it just does not have the Hollywood feel to it. Very disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/disneyland255
40,"Must see, but crowdy","Perhaps the most obvious reason for people to come to LA is this walk. Starts from 1 km above at hollywood blvrd, has parts in the surrounding streets as well. You have 3 museums: Guiness world records, Ripley's and Mme Thussaud's.What really is annoying is the people hunting you for their bus tour to the celebtities home. Do not do it, it is a waste of time and money. You will barely see anything of those homes.Hint: begin your visit at Capitol records building. You will have the Beatles there. The real centre of the walk is at TCL Chinese theatre and Dolby Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/becseyz
50,Very interesting!,"Very interesting. Go early! We went at 0600am and had the Walk to ourselves. Cannot move by 1000am for the crowds. Much, much longer than I thought it would be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenmW1323BX
50,I walked among the STARS!,"I escaped Hungary in 1970 and came as a refugee to the US that same year after a stint in the refugee camps of Italy. So my heart goes out to the refugees now streaming through Hungary these days. The government should remember how the West helped then the refugees of Hungary. Today Hungary is part of the West, so pay it forward!!!I first visited Los Angeles in 1972 and liked it so much that I made the city my home. I previously wrote about many attraction you can find here. Hollywood Blvd. has many tourist attractions and my favorite one is the Walk of Fame. I spent many hours with my boys here, reading the names, remembering the great ones. This years we talked about Robin Williams one of the most talented comedian of all times. My boys 13 and 11 love his One Night at the Met show and know many of his jokes.We are all unique and different on this Blue Planet, but we all have someone close to our heart embedded in concrete in one of those stars. Walk it, remember them, but don't forget the many other attractions. Almost every block has a memory just around the corner...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hanyecz

30,It's a classic - but for out-of-towners not exactly what you'd expect!,"First-timers coming to L.A. feel seeing this reputed stretch on Sunset Blvd. a must but tourists need to be warned a bit: the costumed characters are kind of tacky for the most part and not ""Hollywood!"" like most people expect. Seeing the ""Stars"" on the street and the footprints at Grauman's Chinese Theatre is a thrill but that's about it. Local street performers can add to the fun and just being on Sunset Blvd (!) is neat but don't plan to spend a lot of time here. It can get crowded and a little much, although you'll have a laugh or two and can take a cool photo as a souvenir.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TaliR8
30,The tourist attraction.,The Hollywood Walk of Fame will most likely be crowded. The names of the stars aren't in any particular order so you will probably find the name just by walking by it. It's nice to see for the experience. Be cautious when taking young children. They get bored easily. I parked on the street and paid the meter. The Hollywood Walk of Fame isn't an actual place where you can park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/antoniat390

40,Nice Walk,You will love to see all the names of the celebrities along the walkway. Really pretty neat to see the famous names. They are on both sides of the road so make sure you walk down one way and up on the other side of the road to get as many in as possible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobbyGilbert

50,Should Be Seen Once,"I always take first time to LA guests to see this. It is very entertaining and a must.You can get a great photo of the Hollywood sign from a stairwell in the Kodak center.The Kodak Theater is the new home of the Oscars. The Roosevelt Hotel has beenrestored by a great team and is worth seeing. The Wynn is underwhelming. Musso and Frank's has the best martini in LA and is a totally retro experience in dining. Everything is cooked as it should be, but it is not California cuisine--it is more 1950's. You can get tickets to the Jimmy Kimmel show which is lots of fun. There is some great shopping, too. It is certainly worth seeing and can be combined, via a Metroride, with a trip to Olvera Street and downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRB2144
50,Worth a visit,If you're in LA this shouldn't be missed. A great sense of history. Across the road you can see a stone 'casting couch' which makes for a great photo opportunity as the Hollywood sign is in the background,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annj684
30,Overrated by far,Sounds like a fun thing to do in theory but it's not all it's cracked up to be. The area was a bit shabby and there are a lot of street peddlers all the way up and down which gets on your nerves after a while. Was a lot dirtier than it looks in photos too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kirstalina

50,Best place for nightlife experience while in LA,"A must place to visit during evening with artists performing in real, fake duplicates that might surprise you, take a view of Hollywood sign, great choice of restaurants and not to be missed looking for your favorite star during your long walk both sides. Madame Tussads, Wax Museum, Ripleys believe it or not are some of attractions you would not like to miss. Take a Metro to Hollywood Vine or Hollywood highland to reach there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deepak1708

Some of the area smell like urine.some of the stars are all over the place and upside down.overall if you like to walk a lot this is a great place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anayellel
50,Street freaks,I could sit there all day and watch the street freaks I was so amazed by the unique people on that street .I ended up going to a patio and sat there drinking 2 for 1 drinks for hours. Then it led Into beer pong at the place. Once I had a good glow and the moon was out more people came out . I could go there everyday and get a good laugh lol.......also enjoyed seeing my favorite people stars on the walk of fame. I went on a huge mission to find Ellen Degeneres star. I looked and looked .. but thanks to someone on the street they said you can Google the stars and find the location lol highly recommend that,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExploringGipsy44
40,Fun!,"Walking down Hollywood Blvd is just FUN! I never thought I'd get caught up in seeing the stars on the walk, but it's fun to find stars for the people you've watched on TV and in the movies. The area is crowded and definitely has character. People would dress up as some of the stars and stand next to the square for photographs. No one was pushy, just friendly, interesting, and entertaining. Thistle was a different and new experience for me and I really enjoyed it. I would have actually liked to have stayed around a little bit longer, butter we had places to go and things to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgtg23
30,"Meh...guess I was expecting more, even though I wasn't sure what","From somebody who doesn't gush over celebrities, maybe this is a little biased, but I can honestly say I have no desire to ever come back here. Maybe you can come just to say you were here, but really, there are so many other awesome places to visit in LA, really wouldn't put this on the top.Crowded, not much to see (other than the obvious), and really more run down than I thought.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevieG350

40,Interesting,The walk of fame is something all tourists will see in Hollywood and take pics of their favorite stars. Take the time to look at the foot/hand prints outside the theatre too.

50,Truly loved the experience,I had the pleasure of finally seeing the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame on the Official Hollywood Tour. It was really amazing at the stars seems to never end. I walked a good hour or so and apparently it goes on for miles and miles. What a great experience. So thankful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R2949FSscotth
40,OK - been there.,"Hollywood blvd. was way below expectations.I saw the stars and moved on.Nothing more, nothing less.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidM644
20,"""The Stars have lost their shine - utter disappointment """,I was really looking forward to visiting the walk of fame but could not believe my eyes when I saw what it truly looked like. The reality is certainly an eye opener from all the television hype. Some parts of the area looks quite run down. But if you go it is merely so you can say you have been. It us nothing to write home about. Perhaps it looks better at night?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciadT5063II
50,Sooooo much fun!!!!!,"Apart from being there and touching the hand prints of do many beloved icons who kept us entertained for years, this place put a smile in our hearts with so many street performers that are simply amazing.It is a colorful experience that lifts your spirit. You have to walk the street, play with them and have a little top ready to help them keep the atmosphere magic. It will be rewarding. At least we had a lot of fun. Great memories!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prolunanuevac
30,Good,"4 blocks, stars with famous names on the floor, Chinese theatre (where the Oscar take place) and too much sale-men offering you infinite kinds of things and souvenirs. I recommend you to take 30 minutes to walk it, take a picture and leave. There are lots of parking spots that are cheap.Get into the dolby theatre to take a picture of the Hollywood sign.That's all.If you miss it, is not for crying. There are much more interesting thing to do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andresd1085
20,Not worth the stars,"When you decide to come to this attraction. Don't. Unlike what the movies show it's a basic slum, unless you are on the Hollywood and Vine section and then you have construction. It was a huge upset from what we would have though. The stars were faded and at Night it's so crowded with people dressed up in costumes charging for pictures and drunks, it wasn't worth it. If we would have known, we would've done other things. So heads up, it's not all it's cracked up to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justinb980
20,Nothing special,Just a bunch of stars on the ground and most of them are dirty. You really have no choice but to see it if you walk around but don't spend too much time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfar89
30,Tourist trap,"It's a must see but it's mobbed and a bit seedy - under dressed ""cops"" vying for attention against two competing Michael jacksons as well several Disney princesses - only in Hollywood! Parking in Hollywood & highland was easy enough but seeing some shady characters about we didn't stay for dinner and felt really uncomfortable when we took a wrong turn and got a little lost. Glad I went but probably wouldn't go back - definitely not at night! You expect to be glamour out but pretty woman was set there for a reason!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barley3487
30,Visiting once is enough!,My partner and I visited the Hollywood Walk of Fame during our short visit in LA. I was really looking forward to it after everything I have seen on the television and read regarding it! I can say it was lovely to see but was slightly disappointed as once you've seen them the once you would not need to go back and see it again. Definitely just a once in a life visit! People are in all the street corners trying to sell you stuff and make you buy CDS when all you want to do it simply take a nice stroll looking at all the stars! Would definitely recommend visiting first thing in the morning as when we arrived at around 3 in the afternoon in August heat it soon becomes slightly sweaty!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbbieG167
30,Do It Once,"If you are in LA you should visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame once. The street, as you might imagine, is very busy. It is also very long and for some reason some people have more than one star. It's worth mentioning that there are a thousand souvenir shops and ridiculously expensive parking ($20 for just over an hour anyone?!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/873AmyB873
20,Still Seedy and ruined by Con Artists,"The idea of a sidewalk with stars names on it is a great concept but unfortunately it has become a haven for every tout and con merchant in the area. If you must go there then don't talk to anyone, take anything and avoid eye contact with anyone. These people are not your friends they are simply there to make money from you through the shortest route and easiest way possible.The shame is that there is still some real history along the walk but you need to do your homework first and know where you are going.If want Hollywood then I suggest you stay in the Hollywood and Highland centre where you are mostly protected from the tourist vultures, can see the iconic Hollywood sign and enjoy the shops and theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/746philipe
40,Good way to pass time,"I am not really sure why would you want to go there. I decided to go as I had nothing better to do while in LA over one weekend, and I wanted to check this ""attraction"" off the list of places I visited. Someone here on TripAdvisor had suggested parking behind CVS and that was a very good suggestion. You can park for almost all day for $8 which is a great bargain. Once there, I just went with the flow and walked on the walk of fame. It is nice to be in the company of so many people who are all in good mood. I had sundae at Ghirardeli's which was more than sufficient for my lunch (highly recommended). It was nice to watch all those people dressed as movie characters. I walked through the Dolby Theater and the mall. Overall, I spent a good couple of hours here; did not do anything but did not get bored either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodman1
20,Fairly overrated,"It is what you would expect, a long strip of celebrities names on the ground. What you wouldn't expect is how dirty Hollywood blvd is and that you will be harassed walking down the Walk of Fame by people trying to sell you things, offer you tours, are homeless and want money and just generally it is constantly busy and overcrowded. It is cool to see all the names however the most popular names always have a million people around them so you can hardly get a look let alone a photo and also some of the stars need to be repaired as they have become dirtied which is sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckay92
30,"Very crowded, constant bombardment by street peddlers","It's tough to get here due to traffic, somewhat difficult to park, and the sidewalk is very crowded. Also, it is very difficult to find a particular star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrperkins3
30,"A place to visit, but...","Don't get me wrong, it's good; it's a place to knock off your list of places to visit. However, it is what it is, and that's a street with stars printed on the pavement. It is worth noting that I was very disappointed to find Marilyn outside McDonalds! - however, Mohammad Ali is worth seeking out - his is the only star that is not on the floor - it's on the wall of the Kodak Theatre.You can get a good view of the Hollywood sign - but it's a long way off making photos tricky - especially 'selfies' for the solo travellers amongst you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N2059VItomh
10,Would not recommend for families,"Would not recommend for families as very seedy, dirty area, Police should do more patrols of this area to keep tourists safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katrinawehipeihana
50,Interesting,"Visited the Hollywood Walk of Fame in August 2015. The ""stars of the stars "" were actually spread out over several blocks. The area is typically urban and an interesting mix of people are all over..we enjoyed the sightseeing trip to the homes of the stars up Mullholland Dr..LA is fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdenhen
50,Exciting,"I walked the wall of fame for half a day, trying to read as many as possible famous names on the stars. It's exciting. Very long walk in Los Angeles. From the road you can see the Hollywood sign uphill. The walk is a big sidewalk full of shops and entertainments. Amazing and very famous place in LA👍👍",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giuseppecincin
20,Go once then never again.,"I've been to this spot twice in my life. Once as a college student on a weekend getaway with my father. I barely remember it as we passed by so quickly. This time, we took our 10 and 13 year old boys to see it just as quickly. In other words, we parked for just a half hour before taking off for Griffith Park Observatory. It was such a hot day. Many people were dressed in costume (i.e. spiderman, Mickey Mouse) getting paid to have their photos taken. Others were throwing Music Cds at my boys who had no idea what to do. A couple even yelled at them for not accepting their cds ""because they were black"". My boys were pretty scared by the time they got back to the car. But, honestly, the hollywood walk of fame is a must see (even for a few minutes) for every first time visitor. Maybe go very early in the morning for a more relaxied outing?? It certainly was an experience my boys will never forget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megan_Bocean
20,DANGEROUS! See it BUT Stay Aware,"I love Hollywood, it's history, colorful atmosphere and fun places to go BUT this is a really DANGEROUS place. Hoods, criminals, robbers and evildoers of all descriptions flock to Hollywood Blvd. to prey upon the hoards of tourists. All you need to do is look at crimemapping and check out Hollywood and Highland area for a few weeks back and see the multitudes of robberies at gunpoint and knifepoint, strong arm robberies, assaults with a deadly weapon, rapes, murders etc. that happen day in and day out on that very corner, to come to the reality of the danger of this area. There is so much to see here and it is truly fascinating and I think anyone here to see Hollywood should see the Walk of Fame HOWEVER, this is not Disneyland ok? Even though it looks like an amusement park it is not. There are predators on these streets who's sole purpose for being here is to rob and assault tourists. And no it's not just pickpockets. People get robbed, raped, assaulted and killed regularly in this area. I would NOT go here past sunset. Watch where you are walking. Don't be oblivious to who is around you. Don't be focused on selfies and staring at your phone when you are walking down the Boulevard. You have to use the same caution you would in Times Square in NYC. I tell my friends from out of town, go during the day, see what you want to see then drive west. Stay aware, always be looking in all directions. Protect your kids. Don't let your kids walk too far away from you and once you have seen what you came to see, GET OUT OF THIS AREA!!! Go west to West Hollywood, Beverly Hills or Santa Monica and eat there. The food in the tourist areas is bad anyway so just be careful and I totally recommend not walking here after sunset. Have fun, but stay aware. Hollywood is a jungle and the criminals are just waiting for unsuspecting vacationers who are not paying attention, or who think it is safe here, to prey upon. Staying aware and getting in and getting out and not hanging around this vicinity too long is the key.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollywoodLexx
30,It was ok...,Try to visit during the day of you w a want to bring the family. The night scene is for the clubs and bars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calimart
50,Walking with your head down,"Must see attraction for a visit in Los Angeles. It sends you to a place of your dreams.I really appreciated waving a stroll with my head looking to the ground trying to find the stars of who I really admired , music , cinema, tv there is something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PedTrigo
30,Enjoyed it,We enjoyed walking along here and seeing some of our favorites and taking pictures. It is very long and goes quite a few blocks. We went aug 2013 but site wouldn't let me post the actual date.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grapeape428
30,Ehhh,"Nothing really special. I wasn't really impressed. Huge tourist gimmick. It's crowded, dirty, and loud. The times square of California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nrkelly
50,Excellent place to go,This place is attract people attention because there are a lot of name of famous people that we are look up to. I love this place and I will definitely go there even more ! XO,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sajeegarn
50,Love it and so many stars.,"It was great to walk with the Stars, down memory lane. No cost and right at your footsteps.amazing day and fun for all. All part of our Hollywood tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/238bonniew
40,Lots To See On This Walk,"Its well worth seeing once, and taking the must have photos with your favourite celebrity stars but the walk is somewhat grimy but interesting. I have done this a number of times and the first was by far the best. Parking is always an issue- there isn't any. I always take to the back streets but the restrictions i.e. 'resident or parking permits only' has increased, so park safely so you are not towed- Read the signs!! You can wonder during the day or the evening, but the evenings is when you seem to see some interesting characters. Most of the shops are souvenir type shops, tattoo shops, whacky clothing, dress up and herbal type shops .All interesting to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AucklandWiz
30,Not as I expected,"It was okay to see but watching people laying on the sidewalk to take a picture next to a star, yuck! Especially when you walked down to the older end of town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katbrn
30,Highs and Lows of the Walk of Fame,"The Walk of Fame is like a trip back in time. It is something that everybody who loves movies or music should see, but it is a little disappointing. The area is crawling with panhandlers and opportunists looking to make a buck off of tourists. They dress up in costumes and ask if you want a photo with them, and then they shake you down for money when you used YOUR OWN CAMERA!! My suggestion is stay away from anyone in a costume.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnnyD68
40,Fun time but be careful,The walk is great to look at ad take pictures of your favorite entertainers stars. It also allows you to see and visit some hot spots along the streets of Hollywood and good restaurants. Unfortunately it also goes through some not so nice areas where businesses are closed and boarded up. Just be careful where you go and perhaps get a map to find the stars of the entertainers you really want to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricR4444
50,Be careful!,"Crowded, but worth the trouble. It's almost like walking and texting as you are looking down at the stars on the sidewalk the entire time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronem2015
50,Mixed feelings..,"I was actually a bit underwhelmed with this attraction. The names of course are amazing and the history it holds, but i didn't realise that it was a real road and that the Stars weren't in a pedestrianised area. So i was a little disappointed that commuters and LA residents were just walking all over them and there didn't seemed to be that wow factor surrounding them. We also felt that the area is was quite unsafe, we tried going in the evening and it felt like there was drug dealers everywhere so we tried again the next day in daylight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KellyandSeb
50,nostalgic,Seeing the stars belonging to Michael Jackson and Robbin Williams was really sad... in general it was pretty cool knowing all those stars were there at some point,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharmilaJay
30,"One of those things you have to do, but not really a big deal","Not much to say about it. You walk along and there's stars in the sidewalk with peoples names on them. Some you recognize, many you've never heard of. There are some shops and businesses around so that you can combine it with some shopping. Like I said in the title it's one of those things you have to do just to say you've done it, but once you've done it you realize is not that big of a deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maikai_hoaloha
50,Very cool,"This is a very cool place to walk and look at all the stars. Never knew the stars pay $36,000 for the star's upkeep. Walk along and see how many you recognize. I liked the spot in front of The Chinese Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justmyimpression
30,Not as exciting as expected,The Hollywood walk for Stars was not as exciting in person as I anticipated. It looks much cooler on TV than in person. If you have a particular star that you want to take a pic of yourself and the star then this is right up your alley.I don't think I'll be doing this again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamaicanj
30,Ok,"Go early as you'll avoid the crowds. There really isn't anything special about it. You get to see the stars but it can also be a very long walk as the stars go far down the strip. Avoid the guys handing out there ""music"" ""rap"" CDs. They are not FREE!! This is an old scam that happens here in New York also. It's ""artist"" trying to promote there music. They tell you to take the CD but in return they do want money. Just avoid it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JandL4
40,Great Time Filler Between Attractions,"The Walk of Fame is a must see for the Los Angeles area, but it's better to pair it with another attraction since just looking at stars on the sidewalk can be a little boring after a while. There are dozens and dozens of stars, so if you're looking for someone specific, look up where their star is ahead of time. However there are lots of shops and restaurants in the area, so groups have their pick of what to experience while they walk among the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmericanRuby
50,Touristy but a must!,"The walk of fame is known for being touristy but it's worth it. It's so much fun to walk along and read all the stars names, take some photos and enjoy the energy in the area. There are many names I knew, some I'd never heard of but there is definitely something for everyone.Parking in this area is crazy expensive and hard to find but, it's probably the best way to get there and enjoy your day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbug0909
30,Good to see but nothing special,"Worth a visit if you're in the area. Lots of stars and was fun to find some of my favourites, but at the end of the day it was just a very crowded sidewalk and between the thousands of pedestrians and the harsh sunlight was difficult to take any pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulesW891
40,Hollywood must see,"You cant visit Hollywood without getting a photo of you sitting next to your favourite ""star""Located in the heart of Hollywood.. it is surrounded by restaurants, shopping and museums.The best way to get here.. if you are staying in downtown LA.. take the Redline metro subway.. it's cheap and faster and easier than dealing with the LA traffic on the freeways. The redline metro has a stop right into the heart of Hollywood Boulevard.... right there you will be where the shopping is..as well as the Chinese Theatre... etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tobina928
40,An interesting evening stroll,"We went on a very warm Thursday evening in late August, so it wasn't over crowded. The pace was a little too fast and sometimes a little too dark to read every single name, but of those I could read (80%) I recognized over half of the names and identify their notiriety quickly in my mind. Some of the stars were dirty, and frequently people would stop to take selfies. The sidewalk is lined with souvenir shops, bars, and eateries. It's a nice stroll at night but if you want to read all of the names it's best to come during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/113rl
50,Getting amongst it all,Very crowded but was to be expected. Great police presence so wasn't worried about safety. Lots to see and lots to do although now we have visited we can explore other places next time but very enjoyable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieFyfe
40,The heart of Hollywood,"Worth a visit as Hollywood is famous for its walk of fame. I couldn't believe just how many stars there are on the street - hundreds if not thousands. Unfortunately, after the first visit you don't notice the stars on the street. This is where all the action is and the Times Square of LA.There are many different characters ranging from chewbacca to Marilyn Monroe to take your photo with. Beware of the guys trying to sell you their music CDs. They're very convincing but our starline tour guide informed us the CDs are usually blank.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NevinA843
40,Great to finally see,Went here yesterday and today to see the prints of famous celebrities. I found a few that I admired a lot such as Bruce Lee and Marilyn Monroe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jordansbulls
30,Good to see but nothing exciting,Now that I've seen it I'm satisfied but don't need to see it again. One city block was enough. It was quite crowded and we had to be careful when stopping at a star so as not to be bumped into by pedestrians who have no interest in what is below their feet and merely want to get to where they're going.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/742artf
20,Such a small Area.,I love the individuals who played such an important role in getting a star. I was disappointed at how dirty the city was and felt that there should have been greater care in the beautification of such a popular city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwkelley
30,Afternoon at the Walk of fame,"If you have never been there it is worth to go so you can see the walk of fame, there is parking available if you have your car and doesn't take that long to walk around and take some pictures :); you can also stop by the Hard Rock Cafe to get your collectors pin if you are into this.There is a lot of people asking for money on the street and it doesn't look like the place is taking care ot doesn't look clean anymore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JVDreamBig

40,A Walk Amongst The Stars.,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame runs through 1.3 miles on both sides of the Hollywood Boulevard and comprises of more than 2,500 embedded terrazzo five-point stars rimmed with brass. Also on the western border of the Walk of Fame stand the Four Ladies upon a small triangular island. The gazebo is an Art Deco structure. The stars are awarded to honour those who have contributed to the entertainment industry in the fields of motion pictures, television, music, radio, theatre and live performances. The name of the honoree is inlaid in the upper portion of the star and below on the lower half of the inscription, a round emblem indicating the category of the honoree’s contribution mentioned. They are permanent monuments and is administered by the The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and maintained by the Hollywood Trust. There is also a special category of stars awarded to contributions by corporates, service organisations and special honorees and these stars displays emblems unique to those honorees. You cannot visit Hollywood and NOT visit the Walk of Fame. There are many other attractions situated on either side of the boulevard. We were very fortunate to be present at the award ceremony of the star being awarded to John Denver posthumously, which was received by his daughter. The crowd went wild singing “Country Roads” amidst popping flashbulbs – an experience to treasure. And the best part - since it is basically a sidewalk – no entrance fee!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jp
10,prepare to be harrassed,I was really looking forward to coming here and ignored anything bad that people had told me - but they were right!The place was run down and full of people trying to sell us things.We were followed by people trying to sell us their homemade CDs and told us they were free - so obviously we took one to get rid of him - for him to then ask for a contribution!? We only had cards on us so he snatched it back from us. Then another bloke tried his luck seconds later with the same 'its free' rubbish.. then upon telling him we had no money (wasn't falling for it this time) he shouted and made a scene!Tour guides trying to sell us tickets - when politely telling them no thank you - weve already done one (we hadn't again this was to get rid of them) they followed and pestered us ''do another one!!!''All we wanted to do was have a stroll down and take pictures with the stars and all of the other attractions / shops along the blvd. But we decided to leave within 20 mins or so.So disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EROSE89
50,Don't Miss It!,"you can't see it all in one day. Actually, it takes years to see all of the stars. And when you finally look up from the sidewalk, who knows what you will see!

30,Busy! Busy! Busy!,"""Bus tours!"" If I hear those two words one more time. I swear.....! ;)I mean, it's great. You have to do it. You go and hunt for your favourite celebs (Jimi Hendrix for me!) And get your photo taken. It's not the cleanest of streets but with that amount of people there im not sure you can expect that.Graumans is fantastic but get there early because it gets ridiculously packed and what with the sun beating down you wont be able to get good photos (unless you want photos of other people's shadows!)Head over to Hooters across the road for some yummy hot wings and an ice cold corona.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhiannonM_13
40,A nice place,A very famous place.. a nice one to be.. but i didn't feel the place deserves a five star..Its a must to see though.. with plenty of clubs .. bars.. eating places.. and lots of shops ..The Kodak theater area is a nice place to hang outWould recommend going to see this place since its been in lots of movies and because of its fame,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mujahid_Dhaif
40,A must do in Hollywood,"Definitely a must do if in Los Angeles as it is such a recognised attraction, however I wasn't impressed with the stars as much as the atmosphere in the area. There are plenty of souvenir stores around and mascots/dress up stars that you can take a photo with (at a price). I wouldn't plan the entire day, but coupled with a trip to the Griffith Observatory it makes for a nice day out in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shakaka
50,Enjoyable,Though you don't really DO anything except walk. It was so much fun to look for names and see the shops and eateries along the way. I am glad we did it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brinastew
20,You won't need a lot of tme here,"Tie it around your normal Hollywood Stuff, the Chinese Theater, Dolby Theater, etc. Or locate your favorite celeb's star and just go there.Hollywood is dirty, the parking is a hassle and you'll be harassed to death by homeless people. ""Spiderman"" and ""Cat Woman"" (she is definitely worth seeing) will be happy to charge you to take a picture with them.You'll wear out your tennis shoes if you try to see all of the Walk of Fame..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaydeef2015
30,beware of street performers!,"a lot of hype about this place, but this is more a tourist trap than a worthwhile attraction. my friend and i got accosted by 2 street performers when stepping out of the metro station, which was quite annoying. the street was also crowded with tourists, and there really isn't anything special about this place except the Grauman's Chinese Theater. my advice is go only if you are Hollywood-crazy, otherwise just head to Universal Studios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriasoly
30,Not exciting,"I expected maybe too much of the walk of fame. In the end it are a lot of starts with names of movie, television and music starts in the pavements across a part of Hollywood Blvd, all with a lot of restaurants and shops, just like it could be in other major cities across the world that do not yet have large malls that took away down town areas. I would not come to LA for this specific Hollywood icon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DdeKerf
40,Walking on the Famous,"This is a great place for movie buffs and children of all ages. It is fun to walk the blocks looking down, seeing the stars of personalities from the past to the present honored on the streets of Hollywood Blvd. Whether it is looking for your favorite star or reminiscing about movies they were associated with, this is a fun free way to spend some time.Cons: Walking can be difficult sometimes because people often stop and look and take pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858marca
30,Go have a look then leave,"Nothing fantastic about this place, definitely recommend going to have a look around but the place is rather dirty with a lot of annoying people trying to sell you stuff and some get very angry when you decline.

50,excellent location for once in lifetime visit,This is one of the best places and must be in your bucket list.

40,Clean and interesting,"The Walk of Fame is a very long paved street with stars and names as you have probably seen many times in pictures. It is interesting to see so many familiar names though personally I'm not into having my picture taken by those stars on pavements, clearly a lot of people enjoy doing just that.It is very clean and this area in Hollywood by the Chinese Theatre is 'buzzing' with street performers that may sing or dance, or dressed as 'look a likes' and lots of tourists. Enjoyed the area so much that we returned to stay nearby at the end of our trip too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adeweston
40,Star spotting,A great introduction to Hollywood is to walk down the boulevard star spotting. Sometimes you will spot the same star more than once!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Russ1470
30,Lives on its reputation rather than quality,A bit seedy in places but still worth seeing. Try not to stray too far from the main area as it gets a little dodgy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greghP2836RL
50,Visit at least once.,They are all over the place. I didn't realize that. The best place to make your way to is the Chinese theater. That end of the street has more going on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadaviaD
40,Stars in abundance,Could spend hours walking on each side of the road looking at the stars and finding your favourites but as it was so busy we found it difficult to view the hand and footprints of the stars at Graumans Chinese theatre. Lots of Characters around for photo opportunities but be warned they look for around $5 for this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cath66_12
50,Fun for everybody...,We had a lot of fun looking for our favorite artists and taking pictures. We were there on a Tuesday morning and it was not crowded at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pituphinna
40,Evokes memories of your favourite song or movie,We spent an afternoon strolling and reading the names of famous persons and reminiscing about movies they played in and popular songs.I found a star of a singer with my first name and blocked out her surname and got a photo taken pointing at the name and smiling.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pajeh
40,Great Feeling Walking on the same steps as celebrities Walked on!,"Lovely place to spend a day. Good entertainment place and to do some shopping at great deals. Many shops there have souvenirs at good bargained prices. Some Street entertainers were good to watch. Except some tricksters and fraudsters to be cautious of, like some who claims to be recording artist and will try to sell their CDS.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/647sanjay
40,Morning Walk with Stars,I am staying at the HGI in Hollywood and before work a took a walk about 1.2 miles away and walked the stars around 7 am. I say grab a cup of coffee from one of the many Starbucks around and stroll down the stars when there aren't many people out and about and tou can get great pics. Always fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawnjh
50,Walk the Walk,"I'm a movie buff, so this short side trip was a lot of fun. I went inside the terrace area outside Mann's theater and saw handprints of some of my favorite performers including Sidney Portier and Whoopi Goldberg. This was probably the highlight of my trip. I also took pictures of stars for contributors who have entertained me through the years including John Singleton and Robin Williams. This a must see for a movie buff!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharronH379

40,Put on Your Walking Shoes!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame was a super neat and super fun place to be. Fun, unique shops, restaurants and people line the walk in downtown Hollywood.

If you're doing the whole walk be prepared to be walking for several hours and a few miles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmypie88
50,"Great to see, lots of people trying to sell things!","I've ticked it off the bucket list and don't need to go back again.

Lots of tourists, but hey, what do you expect?!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imiaj
20,Simply not worth it,We visited the walk of fame as part of our recent LA vacation. We paid $25 for parking. It was a Sunday morning and pretty crowded. Mostly tourists from other countries. There are a bunch of wannabe actors in dirty costumes of characters who want to charge you for pictures with them. There are people begging for money. The stars on the sidewalk are really a disappointment in the end because of all the sideshow activities. We left after about 25 minutes. I would not recommend this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike_W_0771

40,Leisurely stroll down The Walk of Fame,"Our hotel was a block from the Walk Of Fame. We spent a lot of time on the strip, always discovering new names as we wandered up and down the street. I had read it was dirty eat - but the streets appear clean and well maintained. We did some research and knew about the Characters dressed up, who will happily pose for photos then expect payments- so we warned the kids about this. However my husband was caught with a guy handing out CDs, he signed it then expected my husband to pay $10. We ended up just saying no thanks to every person who approached us. Still an interesting walk down the street to look for your favourite stars! Don't try and walk down the street on a weekend - it is packed! A weekday is much better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mel_Cat75

50,A great Iconic path way of greats in the industry,"OMG it was so awesome to finally walk the streets and see the stars of the greats in music, television, movies and stage. I have to say it was one experience I will never forget! Great for the entire familyI recommend not using a map just walk and take it in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCBrock
30,A must stop when in LA!,Often crowded place. But cool to see all your favorite stars. There are so many - need to walk up and down to see them all. Be careful though it is not a great neighborhood. Protect your belongings! Be sure to stop by the Chinese Theater where there are hand/foot prints and signatures of famous stars!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LLaury
30,Interesting but not the neighborhood,"It is neat to walk along and see the stars, some from a very long time ago. It is also fun to look at the people, it's a great people watching place. But Hollywood boulevard has some really sketchy sections and people, so it is not a place I have any desire to go back to. The area around Hollywood and highland is very nice though. Crowded sidewalks, hard to do any photography even though there is some interesting architecture from years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adnill
20,"Been there now, probably for the last time.","My wife's cousin lives nearby, so we thought why not,since were close. After our afternoon, it's checked off the list, and someplace I can't imagine I'll visit again. Positives first: The handprint/footprints in the cement and the stars on the walk of fame are interesting, but that wore off quickly. I was able to replace a pair of cheap sunglasses with an even cheaper pair from one of the many souvenir shops. I did have to wait for my checker to finish eating in front of me before she could be bothered to take my few dollars. That brings me to the negatives: It was extremely crowded, and full as street ""performers"" who took posed for pictures for tips before complaining how hot their costumes were. When on break, they's just break character and remove their masks to the disappointment of more than a few kids. Be warned that there are more than a few ""up and coming"" rap artists who will expect $20 for autographing a cd you really don't want in the first place.The place seems dirty, and makes the fame aspect of Hollywood seem cheap and dirtier than I expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ruib1
40,That's it !,"Everybody dreams to go there one day, at least to see it ! It's nothing out of this world but I was there already !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NunoMSousa
30,OK to do once in your life...,"... for the sake of knowing what it is about - which is, frankly speaking, not much. A crowded sidewalk with the famous ""stars"" in the pavement. Avoid weekends and keep valuables in zipped pockets. In the afternoon and evening, there are quite a few street artists coming out and some of them are quite good. That was the only enjoyable part for me. You can also watch them from the mall's upper floor since they seem to congregate just outside of the mall. The visibility is much better from up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claireb980
30,Worth a brief visit,"The stars were interesting but, the streets were so full of people trying to get you to buy their ""tours"" and homeless (sometimes unnervingly drugged up) people. I felt rather uncomfortable here and it was somewhat smelly and dirty. It is worth a look around but, go knowing what to expect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erindoors54

30,Know the stars you want to see ahead of time!,Really try and figure out where the stars are located beforehand. There are so many people walking that half the time you cant look down at the stars because you're trying to make sure you're not bumping into anyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandah62
50,Bit of a let down,"Went here September 2014, it's just ok & to be frank I was pretty underwhelmed. It's pretty off putting seeing beggars everywhere too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/countyrich
30,Interesting the first time around,"If this is your first time in LA, you'll spend more time looking down rather than up. But once the magic has faded away and you take in the surroundings, it's unlikely that you will have the same enthusiasm towards the walk of fame. The novelty wears off pretty quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nicolas_Kar
30,Walk of fame on dirty pavement,"I was not impressed at all as the pavements are mostly dirty, no flowers anywhere to underline it's something worthy and even no enough lights during the night except the very central area around the Chinese Theatre.The most of the buildings are old and sick and the souvenir shops full of very cheap quality. The area is very neglected and miseable. Even the symbol of the place , that is , at No. 7000, the group of 4 statues with Marilyn on top is also left at its own luck alone.It seems as if there is no Mayor in this part of the City.Anyway, if you are an Elvis Fan like me just go to this complex of statues to see the King's star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/argyrok595
20,Great Place But Bad People,"This place is really amazing because it has the stars of famous actors and actresses. But the main problem and safety hazard is these people in costumes they are theifs first they can't charge for taking a picture with them which is not worth it because their costumes are trash and I think their costumes are 50,000 years old. Second I think this place is full of theifs. Third this place really feels unsafe it makes Los Angeles one of the greatest cities look like garbage. This place is one of the most unsafe, nasty, dirty, place I have ever seen. This place is not worth wasting your time on a place that may get you end up robbed. BE CAREFUL OF THIS HORRIBLE TERRIBLE PLACE",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/231rajus

40,Essential when in Hollywood,"There are so many stars on the Walk of Fame its best to Google where the stars you want to see are located, and just go see those ones. Lots of tourist shops nearby, too. This is something you would only do once, but is a fun experience the first time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyCheekyMonkey
40,Fun!,If you want to have a picture with a star of your favorite Hollywood star you should come prepared. It is not that easy to spot it if you don't know where it is. There is so many stars on both sides of the walkway that it is never possible for me to see them all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6378WFannag
20,"Went once, would never go again","We had to stop and check out the walk of fame, but overall this place is awful. They should really block off the street because it is so crowded that you have to walk in the street to get through and the traffic and tour buses is claustriphobic. A lot of cheap souvenir shops; some restaurants, but I just thought it was cheap and dirty. You will not see celebrities here so don't think you will. It is a tourist trap and there are a lot of weird people dressed up in silly and outrageous costumes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamarob1

20,Stras on a pavement in a run down area,"Staying on Los Angeles so did the Walk of Fame what can i say, it could be any run down street in any rough area, total let down. Went in the day luckily as didn't feel safe in the day so can't imagine what its like at night. Stars a lot of them cracked and wrote on with sticky spilled beer all over them. (at least i think it was beer!!!!)People trying to pull you into shops homeless begging for money and there are a lot of homeless. Tacky shops 99c etc pubs with drunks outside all in all a total let down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cornwalldreamer56

I enjoyed watching the guys dressed up like superheroes taking pictures with the tourists. I also enjoyed walking the Hollywood Walk of Fame. There is a souvenir shop called La La Land on the Blvd. It has every type of souvenir imaginable. The next time I watch Jimmy Kimmel and he goes live to Hollywood Blvd., I can say, I've been there. There is a shopping mall there and if you go up to the 2 floor you can see the Hollywood Sign in the distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/671vagirl

Rather than get a list of where people's stars are located, we just walked up and down the street. Some of the people we have never hear of, but we were lucky to pass a few stars of people my niece knew. She was so excited that I got excited to.

50,Lots of walking history and awesome architechtual Art Deco buildings!!,"I really enjoyed coming here. I've been to LA so many times but never here. What stood out most for me was the architecture of the buildings on Hollywood Blvd. It has so much history. The art deco era buildings were so much fun to look at. I also enjoyed all the hand prints of the Hollywood Legends such as Monroe, Hudson, Heston, Harlow, Crawford and many, many more. It gave me a closer perspective of who they were instead of just looking at a star with their name. I'm a big classic movie fan so for me, seeing this was just fantastic. Best starting point would either be on the Jimmy Kimmel end or at the beginning of the W Hotel. Parking can get pricey, but a flat fee of $20 for the whole day is located where folks line up for the Kimmel show.Until then, Cheers! ~ :p",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwin_sfbay

Its a must-do if you're a movie fan but pretty disappointing...,"Nighttime is the worst it brings out people who are urinating in darkened doorways, day time should be your only visit and walking if you want to see it. AVOID at all costs nighttime unless you use valet service at the restaurants. Its work famous but that attracts the ugliness of this society and its like visiting a human zoo, especially at night.

40,A Must See--But It Doesn't Live Up to It's Hype,"If you visit Hollywood, you probably should stop to see the walk of fame. Unfortunately, it is a little disappointing, and some of the walk is in a not-so-nice part of Hollywood Boulevard, but your friends will be impressed with the photos! Thankfully, the Walk of Fame is near other popular Hollywood attractions, so it's not like you are really going out of your way to see it. Your favorite stars may even be in front of other attractions you are visiting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/783garyz

Some shady people out and about but I still felt safe there with two teenagers and a 10 year old. One of those places you hear so much about.... but I thought it was just ok. My 16 year old sister LOvED it though. It goes on forever, so we only walked a few blocks. My favorite part was walking past the Chinese Theater and taking pics in front, along with checking out the various handprints on the ground there. I don't see myself going back, but if that's your thing... you WILL find tons of Hollywood souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beatrice_RN

10,"Dirty, uninteresting, and crowded.","If you love dirty streets, being accosted by people wanting your money (handing you CDs then hassling you if you just don't care about them, badly dressing up as characters for photos and coming up to you if you dare to stand still or are taking a photo of something..), and love having people just stop right in front of you because they saw a star with a name on it.... This is the place to be! Think Times Square but a billion times less interesting and a trillion times dirtier.It isn't glamourous, the rich and famous wouldn't be seen dead here. The streets smell of urine and probably get cleaned once every 6 months. There are decent places to eat and drink once you get away from the ""centre"" (seriously, the names go on for ages but people all congregate around one place??), but these places get individual reviews and aren't included on this. Seriously, look up, the surroundings are a lot more interesting than those names.Maybe it's just me, but a piece of chipped stone with a star and a name isn't my idea of a place to take a photo.If you fancy walking it, if for some reason names on the floor interest you, come between 7am and 8am.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stoofdawg

30,Fun but over hyped,It is fun to search those stars on the pavements. The walk of fame require approx 2 hours of walking if you want to look for every star.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/213rajdeepc
40,History on the sidewalk,"All along Hollywood Blvd , you can see ""stars"" old and new,each with a rich history. As thousands walk past ( and on) , take time to see who you recognize in the fields of film, TV, recording, radio and theatre. Some artists have multiple awards. A great walk through history",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wdee2013
50,Walk on down,"The fact that you are walking on the Walk of fame means you made it to the City of Angels. A brilliant ode to our past present and future, you will literally stop still in your tracks looking at all those stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LXO
30,Really a walk of shame once you know how the stars get there!,"Hollywood Blvd., has seen generations of people walk the street and it used to be OK to walk slow and look at the names of the famous people most nowadays have never heard of! Nowadays however, with the crowds and people using their cellphones as they walk, you risk getting bumped and pushed especially on crowded week-ends and the touristy summer days.Recently heard that you have to pay $40,000.00 to get your name and star on the boulevard which somehow takes away the sense that that person was popular and famous and instead it is likely their agents call to see what space is still available and finding out the costs based on location, location, location!Because it has been written about for years, and Hollywood Blvd. seems to draw the crowds who think they may see movie stars, they will instead find people dressed in costumes offering to take their picture with you for a fee. They are not anybody famous of course, and just were able to afford the costume and stake their spot where the crowds are the thickest!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385eileenz
30,"If you are impressed by reading names of entertainers, then this might be for you!","There are those who were great entertainers, and gave us some memorable moments in life. But what does that have to do with seeing their names on the street pavement where thousands upon thousands walk on them every hour?! I don't find that very exciting. What is it, a memory check list? You just want to see if you remember some of the names? Well, good for you, so go ahead and visit for that reason or for another. Just don't get stock on buying all those throw away gadgets that are made in China, and cost an arm and a leg, because the store keepers, know that you are excited, and can't buy this crap in you own home town. Do you know why? Because the people there are smart, but when they get here, something happens to their brain! The place and the Blvd, is a great one for people watching ,as you will see all makes and all sizes. There is a lot of cheap, when I say cheap, I mean cheap food, but if you take the time and stray just few blocks away, you can find real good food to eat. The Kodak theater is there, and few so called Museums, I call them easy $$$ takers. There is the historical Chinese theater with the hands and some feet imprints of some of the mostly passed away stars. Fantasy land it is, buthttps://m.facebook.com/story.php? if you are looking for something that might improve your life, go somewhere else and find something useful to do with your money, or just give it away to a good charity that you like, were some humans or animals could be helped. Have fun any way what ever you decide to do, its just my views on watching our societies get virtually more worried about how to take money from each other than our collective well being as a society and a country.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barry684
30,Packed,"The place is very touristic. You should not expect a peaceful stroll along the Hollywood walk of fame. Being one of the most popular and famous places it was packed with tourists. Aren't we all.I liked the Chinese theatre and Hard Rock Cafe. If you are looking for a tour to the stars homes, there are a lot of outdoor sales persons offering those tours. It is very safe. Carry some change if you want to be photographed with ""Superman"" or ""Batman"". It is better to visit the place in the morning rather than evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alex-e7sas
40,Go ! But not with expectations -,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame can be a super fun way to 'touch base' with some stars, both present and of yesteryear, and if taken at face value it can be one of the highlights of your trip to Los Angeles but know that Hollywood Blvd, although far better than it used to be, leans toward seedy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mickk19
30,Showing out-of-towners the sights,"It's always fun to stroll down Hollywood Blvd. to admire the imbedded stars of those in the entertainment industry being recognized for both their popularity and achievement. Unfortunately, it turns into a circus of crazies in front of the Chinese Theatre. Beware of those wearing movie character costumes as they can be ruthless in scamming you (picture-taking, autographs, handshakes, etc.). By all means, do not interact with them...even if it disappoints your children. The same applies to those offering CDs or sightseeing services.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmelang
50,"must see, as always!",World famous and i am an L.A. local... going there always gives me an excitement like a tourist all the time. I even had the chance to witness Orlando Bloom get his star which makes every visit to this place even more special. A must see whenever you go to Los Angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandarin_mom
20,There is nothing to see!,"If you're in Hollywood & you're walking around, then you can look down & see the names of actors & other entertainment industry people engraved on little plaques embedded in the sidewalk. That's it. That's all there is. Hey, if seeing ""Mr. T"" engraved in a star floats your boat, then go for it. I say, don't waste your time. (I do love Mr. T, though!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/539marleneh
50,Interesting place with so much history,"Do I really want to give a review for this? This is an iconic place where everyone looks for the stars. Always busy and sometimes it's hard to access due to so many tourists. The whole street is packed full of entertainers. Also enjoy the Chinese theater, the Kodak theater. It's really a fun place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcj220
20,Crowded,"I'm not much of a fan of tourist trap locations and whatnot... The Walk of Fame is riddled with the names of past and present stars in Hollywood, obviously, but without having at least a handprint or manufactured signature along with the concrete star it is just another tourist trap. You can pay to go inside the 'Rock Walk of Fame' to see the handprints of AC/DC but even my boyfriend who is undoubtedly one of their biggest fans didn't care to see that. What is neat about the Walk of Fame is not what's on the concrete sidewalk but everything else around it. For instance, The Roosevelt Hotel and The Church of Scientology. I'm glad we went but mostly just so I can cross it off my list and not feel like I missed out on something. Oh and traffic is hysterical.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872emilye
20,Family vacation,It was alright not to much to see we couldn't stop and take pictures because of the people walking by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rfjgvkls
50,This is a Hollywood Classic Must Do!,"How can you not want to see this???? This is a Hollywood Classic Must Do!Just like you should buy a map to the stars homes and drive around and find a few. It is a riot. As someone else pointed out, the stars can get a little tedious, but the freaks on the street are crazy entertaining. Do not engage with them, though. By the time you assess normal street person from serious mental health issues, it is too late......you are in too deep. So do not look them in the eyes and you will do fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliebooboo
30,Neat but packed,"While its very cool to be able to see all the stars names on the sidewalk, its very difficult to get pictures with the high amount of people that are trying to walk over the stars to get somewhere. I would suggest going early in the day to hopefully avoid the majority of the crowds that gather and stay as the day goes on.Also! Tons of people dressed up as characters all over the place! Some of them are so accurate its amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaySwift
30,Very touristy and crowded during the day,"Safe during the day and you are a walking $$$ symbol. people will sell you $45 ""tours to universal studios when you could easily catch the redline train. A must see, but not a place I frequent in particular. I live in east hollywood two streets south of the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/320prestonc
40,Famous stars and memories.,If in LA must visit walk of fame where stars come together. It's next to the mall and famous restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hpaulb
30,Crazy --,Had not been to Hollywood for years -- now I know why...it's crazy busy. Crowded!!! I had my small dog with me I was afraid people would step on him. A must do for visitors coming to this area. Enjoy!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraveledKat
40,Great place for a walk down memory lane.,"Great day in H'wood. Love the live impersonators and Charlie Chaplin is my favorite. There are a lot of side bar places to visit, eat, shop & buy a coffee. If you look carefully you can find the opening in the mall area with a great photo op to the HOLLYWOOD sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamC608
30,A bit on the gritty side,"If you're looking to see the stars on the floor in Hollywood, then you're in for a surprise. The street is dirty and ridden with transients and tons of other tourists, especially near the Chinese Mann Theater. Lots of tourists, lots of superheroes, hello kitty, Hollywood characters like Disney's Captain Jack Sparrow, Transformers and various artists wanting to make a buck near the Walk of Fame. It is chaotic and be wary of the rapper guys who want to hand out their duplicate copies of CDs wanting to make a quick buck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindymE7824LG
30,Tourist Mecca,Not my first visit but first with family. It is a must on the list and for half an hour it is diverting to spot who has a star in the pavement but don't hang around as the place is beset by every kind of conmen etc trying to get your money. Go into Hollywood and Highland for a coffee and look up at the sign. Don't waste time trying to drive to it as you can't,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philipm424
50,A Must Do,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame was my most enthused about attraction before leaving and it definitely did not let me down. It was so neat to finally see the stars in person and take a selfie with stars of your favorite people! I also really enjoyed going into some of the shops that are located right on the strip. My only recommendation is to bring comfortable shoes with you if you intend to walk the entire strip, which I recommend you do. It is quite long. My only complaint is all the sales people that will approach you on the street and try to sell tours to you. My family and I were approached by at least a dozen different salesmen, all which cut eat other's throat and tried to offer us the best deal. Some were respectful and backed off after we said no, but others just wouldn't shut up. One even offered to let half our group on the tour for free if the other half paid full price. Talk about desperate? Other than that part, you will enjoy every moment you spend on the Walk of Fame. You never who you are going to come across next or find out what celebrity has a star that you didn't even know about. After spend a few hours exploring it and taking tons of pictures, you yourself will feel like you are a star!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/talex2012
20,Disappointing - desperately in need of a good spring clean,"I expected much more. The crowded Walk of Fame seems to go on for ever and the stars of some celebrities appeared several times, but the lasting impression was one of tackiness, dodgy characters, filthy sidewalks, an unpleasant stench. It could and should be so much better......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JOGLEWALK
40,Fun,It is very fun to see the walk of fame and see all the stars. Its a great experience though can be crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F7660ETjamesm
20,Hollywood walk of lame,The area is not attractive nor particularly clean. It seems to attract some of the city's needy. Don't put this on your must see list,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larryinboca
30,Not what i expected,"It was OK, but the streets were so crowded, I was hardly able to take note of the stars I wanted to photograph.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorrily2000
40,Crowded but interesting,"Very crowded and hard to get photos with the stars as their are so many people doing the same thing, worth the effort all the same. It is sad to see that it is not all in good condition, it needs a little work. Interesting to walk along and see Superman and other stars that will let you have a photo with them for a fee. Good food and drink outlets. Really great to see it in person. Worth going to see I think it is a ""not to be missed"" attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/320mrsw
40,A Must see if in LA,"It has been 13 years since I last visited and the block around the Mann's Theatre (Hand Prints / Footprints) is really good, spotless and very classy.. It is now filled with star look-a-likes and this adds to the experience (Tip them for a photo)But, once you go a block away the stars fade, footpath not so nice...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulMD12
40,Crowded and a must do,"After you like at a few stars in the ground it gets boring reading the rest . However you will be entertained by so many street entertainers , looking for your money and the buzz in this walk of fame and other attractions are amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reviewermen
30,A MUST DO,"nothing fancy about walking down a street but this is a must do to soak in the whole idea you are in Hollywood. Stand and look around, you will see many familiar streets and buildings from movies you have watched.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noraf168
20,This is worth skipping,"If you like the circus. The streetgigs, cruisin' sales, the smell of overdone food... Then you might like it. Offcourse there's a lot of stars for stars...... And that is worth skipping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxHubner
40,Great Photo Spot,"This is a great way to kill time and snap some memorable pics while in Hollywood. Nothing is more exciting that searching for your favorite celeb's star on the walk of fame, and snapping pics next to it. This is a definite tourist must stop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodie788
30,Crowded but fun going over the stars,At 1st we were so disappointed that it was just a side walk with stars. I think we expected it to be a secluded area. Twas sooo much fun going over the stars...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kavataj
50,Really Good Place,I went to visit the famous place and was delighted . Many stars of important people . Good places to buy cheap. It is a good place to visit with family .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nathalliesb
40,What Fun walk!,We had a super fun time trying to find on our favorite celebrities as we walked up and down Hollywood Boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoonSunSky
40,"Stars, Stars",We found several stars that we looked for. It's interesting looking to see what stars are there. It's interesting to see Canadian artists who have Stars there. You may be lucky enough to see real Stars while there for movie premiers 😀,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anna3
40,A must to visit in Los Angeles,It is a very happening place and should not be missed . Evenings at this place are very lively and the entire atmosphere is electrifying . There are a lot of restaurants and shopping places around. Of course the walk of fame has the names and photos of famous Hollywood stars on the path is nice way to remember old stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KamleishD
30,High Expectations,"if you have never been to LA, you should experience the Walk of Fame. It was OK, but I think we were expecting more. Bottom line - it is a sidewalk with stars names. I think we were even more disenchanted when we found out a ""star"" could be purchased for $30,000 and an approval process. My kids thought it was cool to see where Jimmy Kimmel records his shows. We moved through the walk fairly quickly and that was enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennE1101
30,Not comfortable place to be at night,"This was my 2nd visit here. 1st time with a tour during the day and this time as part of a full day universal , LA night tour. The people dressed up to make money felt intimidating and it was dirty and unsafe . So many people it was impossible to see stars on walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindielips
30,"Go there, get your picture, and then leave.","I'm not saying anything new, but don't waste anymore then 15 minutes here. Go get your picture next to the Erik Estrada star and move on. Or whoever c lister you crave. The largest impression is the disparagy on who makes this list. It really wasn't that difficult to park a few blocks away for free (around Hollywood high school) and walk the few blocks. Now that I've done it, I can check it off my bucket list. Yippee!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjpgh
30,Tourist hot spot that is a must do,"If you can do this in a morning then do before the afternoon masses arrive. Later in the day it is very difficult to take photos or see what you want to. Lots of people also trying to get money from you in the afternoon, costume people, people offering cd's, bums and others so be careful. Also keep your bags and pockets covered, easy pickings for some.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joep735
20,"Stars, Street Performers & Begging","These streets are covered by stars of celebrities, I'd recommend Googling the stars, to find out where ones you'd want to see are located.Obviously these streets are busy with tourists and packed with street performers that are dressed up as charecters (the Mickey and Minnie Mouse ones are some of the worst I have seen).And where there's lots of tourists there's also lots of people begging for money, don't worry about them just say ""no"" unless you're feeling generous.Overall smelly dirty streets, too many tourists and street performers who need to know there charecters better, but the stars are quite fun unique.Thanks",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MogsEvs
40,Must Do!,Loved being on the walk of fame. It is a must do if you are in the area. Was fun for all ages from my children to my parents!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snuggs99
40,Hollywood Stars,"I would highly recommend being prepared to deal with the people selling ""Hollywood Tours"" because they will sort of hound you (or they did us -- we were there in July). We loved looking at all the stars, but the best part is the section directly in front of the famous TCL Chinese Theater. You can take photos of your hand or foot in comparison to the prints of the famous.We wish we had googled where to park beforehand, and so I recommend you do that as parking may change.Enjoy the shops along the way, but don't be eager to purchase as you can find all kinds of deals on your way back to the car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/just1beth
40,Nice but..,Nice place but a lot of tourists and homeless. I felt sorry for the homeless. Many shops selling crap.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annelT3063JE
30,Walking And Talking,"Spent the morning walking amongst the stars...brought our 15yr old daughter to see Hollywood so our first stop was the walk of fame. For 2 hours we walked and talked about all the names below our feet...our favorites, our parents favorites, our grandparents favorites and our daughters favorites...and as we walked 10 or so blocks the history unfurled and we all laughed, reminisced, and learned some stuff. Sure the guys every 10 feet trying to sell you a bus tour and the big tour groups are cluttering the sindewalks, but you just ignore them and keep moving. And yeah there are some interesting characters and smells along the way, but this is in the middle of a city...not a theme park.Very glad we brought our daughter, and we made fantastic family memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Destination806767
40,Seeing Stars,"Visiting Hollywood is all about paying homage to movies and movie stars. So you have to visit the Walk of Fame. It is cool to walk around and find the names of your favorites. You can even get a picture of you and your own star (um, well, photoshopped of course).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/122sherig
30,Must Do Tourist Trap,Total tourist trap but that's unsurprising. The walk is spread across blocks of overpriced stores and attractions but its a must do to really get the full Hollywood experience. It is also the HQ for Starline Tours which has excellent options for touring the area. Go and take your pictures with the stars and their footprints at the Chinese Theatre but prepare for the Times Square type cheese that comes along with these types of venues.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HankW80
30,A nice trip but not if it's all you're doing,"Well the title says it all. Hollywood is a bit of a let down as you drive in. The Walk Of Fame is no different. Basically you are looking at names carved into side walk. Unless you appreciate the historical value of it, it's a loss. Even then you'll be better off parking behind the CVS (it's $8) and going to the hand imprints at the Chinese Theatre. The Walk of Fame is cute just make sure you have other things planned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jager97
20,Disappointing.,Somehow i expected more glamour from the place and from Hollywood as a whole. The whole place and the stars looked shabby and old. There was no glamour or elegance in Hollywood and definitely i don't recommend anyone visiting LA to stay here. It's too crowded for nothing. Stay at Universal city or Santa Monica better and way more elegant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nada1612
40,Walking with the Stars!,If you go to Hollywood this a must on your things to do list! Depends on when you go whether it will be crowded or not. It's one of those places that it's cool to say you have been and if you are movie/actor enthusiast then it's a lot of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heatherbme1977
50,The mid of action,"It is a must ... no one can visit Hollywood without visiting that place and find your favorite celebrity name and take some pictures with thier name or thier own hand writing and hand print engraved on the floor infront of the famous Chinese Theater. The place is very crowded with many visitors and some people dresses in famous characters costumes ... sometimes in a funny way. You can find some fat spidermen, many Marlene Monroe, Minions, characters from the movie frozen, ... and many many more. You can also enjoy sitting around the fountain nearly at the eastern side which is for some reason attracting kids to play and jump through it. Also from that area you can find many offers for a tour around Hollywood, celebrity houses area, the famous Hollywood sign. The place has many stores, restaurants, and supermarkets and you will be able to find all your needs there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Um-Salman
30,Mixed feeling,"The stars in the ground themselves are really cool and you get to find you're own idol, but damn, tourists and those vendors with their Hollywood trips really ruins the experience. Every two steps there is somebody trying to make you buy a guided tour around Hollywood. It's really just too bad. The shops and the stars are okay though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941madsb
30,Don't Build Your Hopes Up,"The Walk of Fame isn't what I was expecting at all. It's pretty grotty and sleazy with a constant chain of people trying to sell things.As expected, the Walk of Fame is one of the busiest parts of LA. You can't even see most of the stars on the floor because of how busy it is but it does go on for quite awhile where you can find some sections that are less crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewjcg
20,Not that fancy,Shurly a must see while you are staying in LA. But don't expect to much... The place is not that amazing. Arrond the Kodak Theater it's clean but if you walk a bit on hollywood boulevard it becomes more and more dirty and not that amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FabianA426
40,Interesting,"A very interesting walk that seems to go on for ever, you need to give your self plenty of time and hopefully there will not be too big a crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gideon2013
50,Busy with good reason!,There is so much history to this area with many great buildings to see while spotting celebrity names! Yes there is a lot of people here taking selfies and people trying to sell you tours but its not so bad - Times square is much busier! Also there is quite a few people in costumes and street performers which i quite enjoy and think it adds to the novelty - but if you feel intimidated by a man dressed as zoro or people asking if you want a tour you best be prepared :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LukeNickels
50,Hollywood walk of fame,"Nice venue in the city of Los Angeles,events offered in city close Mann's theatre, famous names,picturesque place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReneeModern
40,I enjoyed it,Well it was quite impressive the fact rather when the taxi left us there I was stepping over my favorite stars! Apart from that outside of the wax museum there are about a dozen of character Mimos who are ready to take a photo with you! I really enjoyed it! It was like entering the films I liked,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FOULITSA79
30,Nice to see stars.,"It's just a sidewalk. See the stars, take a few pics. Nothing major, but cool to see. One of those iconic things to do while in LA. I didn't plan to see it, just actually stumbled on it and took a few pics. Didn't take much time to do. Was like oh look at this one, oh look at that one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrs_Montanez
20,Gone but not forgotten,"This part of the walk of fame has been hosed down. It is usually covered with squashed cigarette buts and french fry bags. Go early in the morning to be able to see the granite stars honoring movie stars with their name on them. Hollywood is an idea which now lives on in old photograph books. It is now unattractive and run down with a crime problem,gangs and bad vibes. People go to see the legend and never find it,but keep trying,because you might find one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7453DTmarkk
30,Disappointing experience,"Glad we have been, but would not go back. Area did not live up to the hype - lots of tourists but not that exciting at all. Parking is available at Hollywood & Hyde close by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melaniemayb
20,Expected more,"In the movies they show this place as something fenomenal... It was kind of boring, not much happens... Thought it was going to be more as the vibe in times square, NY. Lots of begging people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933karlisg
50,USA Tour,"Its an privilage to be able to see the hand, foot prints, signatures of celebrities who have touched our lives in so many ways. Most of them i love admire & look for inspiration as human beings not just as star but for their personality & way of life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snehajai
30,Disappointing,"Walking down the pavement and reading the names of the stars, some of which you would recognise but many you won't, is good fun. However, the street is run down with lots of touts and dodgy bars giving it a generally unpleasant feel. Overall, a disappointing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calvin40
30,Good to see but crowded,It was fun to look for the stars we wanted to see but we went on a Saturday and it was hard to find anything because of the amount of people out there. Maybe th de weekday would be better,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinlbr
20,So disappointing,"We had just finished a really good tour with Ultimate Hollywood tours and decided to walk along to see the walk of fame. It was not what I expected. Not a nice area, adult stores, dirty streets, lots of homeless, people bothering you and trying to sell you tours, CDs. People in bad costumes looking to pose for a picture. The Smurfs in particular were the worst costumes I'd ever seen! My teenage daughter was frightened by the area and could not wait to leave. I wanted to see the stars names and now I've seen them but Yuk! Don't ever want to go back there again. Do the tour, much safer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/250charlottep
40,"Fun place to visit with lots of ""interesting people"".","It's free!!! Yipee!! We enjoyed looking at the different names, seeing the star wars stuff at the theater and people watching.

20,Nothing too special,Couldn't say I was amazed by it. It was a fun walk with many things to see but nothing extraordinary. In my opinion it lost its charm over the years.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nukito
30,Intetesting,"It was Intetesting and fun to go and look at the Hollywood walk of fame although I didn't realise how spread out it was. We went in the evening as it's available to go and see 24/7 and our days had been packed with other fun stuff. Our visit was spoiled a little by people handing out stuff and then trying to drag you of with them to go and look at it or to charge you for it, this made the area feel a little unsafe and as we had the kids with us we didn't stay long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirstie20152015
30,A sidewalk...,"It is nice to walk down the Walk of Fame, and it is free!. However, it is ""only"" a sidewalk with a lot of soliciting, people pretending to ""give"" away their CD´s etc. Hollywood & Highland (shopping center) is a good place to park and a good starting point for exploring the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ole4442015
20,Once is enough,Visiting LA was probably a once in a lifetime opportunity for us so we had to do the walk of fame. First of all I recommend getting there early as parking is easier and there are less crowds. The actual sidewalk was filthy littered with rubbish and the odd pile of vomit. Many a gift shop selling the same things but the absolute worst part about this is the amount of people trying to get you on bus tours. There are only so many times you can say no during a 2 hour stroll! Lots of history about Hollywood though and I'm happy to have only done it once in my life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erinlouthorne
50,WOW!,The perfect walk to explore and learn more about the world's most famous celebrities !Its beautiful at night as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NourSaeed
50,Seeing the names on the Stars,Its great to walk and look at the names on the Stars but you have pushy people wanting you to do tours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/odonga
30,Typical Tourist Attraction,It was a fun thing to do but far from being one of my favorite LA sites. Spent maybe an hour in the area & felt it was more then enough. Way too crowded & noisy for my taste. If you are a huge fan of the Hollywood hype then this may be a fun place to go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/934debbys
40,Lots of Famous!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame has names/dates of stars going back more than forty years. It is fun and crowded to go looking for your favorite star, old and popular stars, etc. Men and women who made Hollywood are honored by each having a star and their dates of life and death. Walking along the Walk of Fame is quite an education.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleElyseLesser
20,Worse that the most downmarket of holiday resorts,"My goodness, although this was a ""must see"", it's worse that the most downmarket of holiday resorts. The Walk of Fame is lined with cheap gift shops and is so busy that it takes 5 minutes to walk 100 yards. If you pause to take a photo of a star, you feel as though you're blocking the sidewalk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/985RichardL
40,Center of the action - Reminiscent of Times Square,"We saw the Walk of Fame as part of a bicycle tour organised by Bikes and Hikes. At its center of gravity on Hollywood and Highland, Hollywood Boulevard and the Walk of Fame are reminiscent of Times Square in New York. And of course the names of the stars are indeed engraved in the sidewalk, including the Apollo 11 astronauts - was the first man on the moon staged in Hollywood after all??",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hermes_NL
40,A must see but be prepared,"Hollywood must see but be aware it is very busy. Lots of people in costume hoping to be photographed with you-at a price,don't be intimidated. Shops and restaurants near the Dolby Theatre. Parking nearby, get ticket validated to reduce the cost. May be difficult for wheelchair users.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimwN6991QI
10,Less than impressed,"Streets are filled with hustlers, street sellers, can't blame people for trying to make a buck or two but irritating. Keep your mind on your wallet while looking for stars or you may lose it !! Very disappointing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barca92red
30,A must visit,"This a must visit as it is so famous. Unfortunately, it is located in a tacky tourist trap, which can get extremely busy. Go early,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peter_ChristineH
30,Not what you'd expect,"It is neat to see all the stars names but it is very dirty. Watch out for the look a like stars and comic book charictors, they want you to take a picture but for a tip. We found the walk of fame dirty and rundown. Still worth a look if your in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GummyStewart
50,Your day with the stars,"Firstly, before you go, or even planning your trip, check out online for any upcoming Hollywood Walk of Fame Star reveals. It is your chance to see some of the worlds biggest stars up close and personal as they receive their Star on the Walk of Fame. We planned our trip to co-inside with one and it was truly just that touch of Hollywood to complete the journey.For the Walk of fame itself, well they are everywhere and all over the place. But the bigger stars are located around the W Hotel district and also near Chinese Theatre, so check them out if you want to see the stars. But I can assure you once your have seen a few, suddenly it dawns on you that your getting excited to see someones name on the ground, vs actually seeing a star.A great walking area though, se the home of the Oscars, Chinese Theatre, Hollywood and Vine and of course the Hollywood sign. A nice few hours amongst the 1000's that had the same idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theeditionw
50,It is Fun and Free,From downtown I took the subway going towards North Hollywood. It was a short train ride. Went there late afternoon . There was a lot of people. It was fun . You can see all those names of Hollywood stars. It is free enjoy it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AikenJoshAndrew
30,Probably better during the daytime,"We went around 9 pm. At first it was cool and gave me a glimpse of what NY would probably be like at night. There were street preformers, music, dance battles and lots of shopping and food options. When it hit close to 11 pm places started closing and the homeless started taking over. Overall it was pretty dirty on the ground so where close toe shoes and it's a lot of walking to see stuff so tennis shoes would probably be the best to wear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashmea11
20,Grungy area - just a bunch of plaques with names,"This is in a grungy area and you will be solicited to buy CDs or pose with dressed up people. Just a bunch of plaques with stars names in the sidewalk. Much better is Grauman's Chinese theatre which has actual writings and signatures from the stars in the concrete, in their own handwriting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoFL-LovetoTravel
40,"No money for picture with caracters but they expect tips, good naming to avoid income tax","It is known as must to see, it is nice to see especially people's reaction when they find the names they are looking, it is difficult walk in harmony because of people who are trying to take picture or posing. You may see name of some caracters beside names of artist, actor and actrisses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aydinkerim
50,Cool to see,"It's cool to see all the people on The Walk but it's crazy around there. Lots of people, lots of fake characters asking for money to take pics with them. Lots of action because this area is where all the tours depart. There is a great pizza place there next to one of the tour places. It was huge and delicious. Lots of cheap souvenir places. It was great and the best part you can take the metro there. They also have cheap parking near the Loews hotel. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luv2Smitty
30,Don't expect much,"Not the worlds greatest, you can do this in about an hour or 2, nip in to the shopping centre next to Chinese theater go two floors up and you can snaek a reasonable pciture with the Hollywood Sign in background",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RevRoss
30,Good for film buffs,I enjoyed it seeing all the names from the past but my children were less impressed. Some stars are actually repeated on each side of the street but worth a wander and a visit to the chinese theatre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/graemeb649
40,See the Stars!,"Take your time and look at the stars that made it to the big time! It's your favourites that you will seek out; the ultra famous that get the attention and undoubtedly the ones that get photographed most often. That fame with time however is also fleeting. The ones that I was also interested in were the names that I didn't recognize. What was their history, and their contributions to the movie industry? I was also told by a guide to also always look up as along the Blvd on lampposts there are signs pointing out areas of historical significance. Plus when you are not just concentrating staring at a star down on the sidewalk you just might see one walking unnoticed on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/768grantb
30,You have to see it if you are in LA,"What can I say, it looks more impressive and big on the films and news that it really is. We were early in the morning, so not many people which was nice and easy to walk. But again is a must if you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jehidymoya
50,Star spotting,Lots of stars to spot. Bit hard on the feet but worth the effort. Wear sensible shoes and take plenty of water and of course your camera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/646edithw
40,Very cool,It was very cool to see all the names. I had a lot of fun looking and seeing how many I knew and the people I didn't. It was very cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petter2254
10,"Crowded, dirty sidewalks.","Was totally disappointed. The sidewalks were dirty and really crowded. Maybe I expected too much, having seen it one too many times on TV.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Obiora
30,Not what I expected,"Caught metro to Hollywood/ Vine to see walk of fame stars.On my way! Factor really, streets were dirty and didn't really know half of them anyway.Went for miles so depending on who you were interested in seeing was a case of hit and miss",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaz2907
30,Make sure to find location brochure before going,"""Everyone"" has to see the walk of fame if going to LA. I agree with that statement completely, but it was a little disappointing. There are homeless everywhere. Many sections of stars are filthy and unfit to take your picture there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyM291
40,Fun for family or couples only,I did this with just my wife and then with the kids a year later. It was a nice visit both times. The kids enjoyed it as much as we did. Do not plan on spending too much time with the kids there however.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julio6925
30,Media influence,The plance to visit if you are in L.A. but do not expect too much of it. A lot of fake starts trying to get your money and the hollywood sign is really far away. It's just not as huge and glamorous as the media tells you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lebenstaumler
40,stars all the way,a great walk. you can take you time or rush along. just watch for the people having their photos taken with a star. reminisce of the famous star of yester year or now,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pamikki
50,See anyone famous today.,We walked the famous strip of stars for a bit. Some of the areas are now a little more seedy than when they were unveiled all those years ago. Still well worth checking out to see if you can spot someone really famous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TOPPROFILE
30,Walk of shame,"Honestly seeing what I assume are aspiring actors all holding signs for stores broke my little heart a bit. It sort of seemed like where dreams go to die. The star walk was cool but I caught a ""live gameshow"" and the host was either on drugs or a recovering drug addict and was not all there. He shook quite a bit and made a few comments about some of the younger contestants that I didn't find appropriate. You should go and take a photo but this is not what I had expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/things_u_should_do
30,Um... Okay... sure...,"Honestly, this is not something I was terribly excited to see, nor was it something anyone had raved about. And rightly so.A lot of the stars are in disrepair - including Charlie Chaplin's which seems a crime, somehow - they're cracked, pitted or otherwise looking worse for wear. You'll see a lot of famous names here, but thern again, a lot of people whose stars collapsed in on themselves after a short half-life. Chris O'Donnell? Come on.The shops and area along the walk of fame are/is a mixture of run-down and high-fallutin', but in a higgledy-piggledy fashion. I suppose it's just important to say that you have been?Well, I've been and frankly: meh.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Narsfweasels
50,Fun for the kids!,fun for everyone especially with kids. See how many stars that you know and trying to find them is so fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/561vanessaw
50,To See is to Wonder ....Now move on your holding up the traffic !!!,Please look but pick your Days as the foot traffic is crazy and if there is more then 2 people having someone acting as Lookout person you will be bumped into its a lot of people,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waynefur555
30,Famous walk of fame,"I was expecting more from this walk of fame. Of course it is a good place, with many clubs and stores. It will be ok for those who love nightlife. But it is also dirty with a lot of homeless people and frauds. Be careful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SergeySemendyaev
30,Go across the street to the Chinese Theater!,"Ok you now you have seen it. Don't waste time with the stars on the walk of fame. Any ""star "" can purchase a star, now for $30,000. Go across the street to the Chinese Theater! Take the 1/2 hour tour of the Chinese Theater, go there 1st, the tours are every 1/2 hr on the hour or the half. Gets you away from the crowds and you get to see the beauty of the theater, hear the history and see a short IMAX film. Definitely worth it. See the real footprints and handprints. Stars have to be asked, so it is a real honor. Watch out for the characters trying to pose w/ you . We got off cheap, w/ superman & wonder womanat $3.00, though they asked for more. Check out the Roosevelt hotel also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/downhillskier17
20,Whatever,"I really don't get what the big whoop is. Yes, we've seen it in movies, but everything looks different (read: better) in the movies.Crowded, dirty (the least they could do was brush the sidewalk from time to time), and rather dull.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VoyagingBookworm
30,"Good to see, expected more","You have a certain amount of expectations when going to Hollywood. The walk of fame was good in the sense that it's easy to navigate and I found my favorite stars (Walt Disney, Julie Andrews, Fleetwood Mac). Graumans (sorry, TCL) Chinese Theatre is iconic and hosts the famous handprints. Otherwise, the shops along the boulevard are dated (and not in a ""vintage Hollywood"" kind of way) and the whole area looks like it's seen better days. It doesn't exactly have the tourist vibe down like Broadway or similar places in NYC. Glad that I went but I'm not waiting to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648nickd
30,We can say we've been now!,"Dirty and tacky but if you are staying close or can stop off for a bit it's worth the visit. DS (12) and DD (10) enjoyed it. DH didn't think much of it - he was still thinking it would be all glamorous even thought I told him it wouldn't be. A lot of the characters walking around were in pretty cheap and nasty outfits but some were really good. We didn't feel worried by them but we were warned to keep an eye on the kids, especially at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3123IBlisah
50,Not to be missed!,Do. Not. Skip.this. So much fun and lots of colorful characters. Careful though of people dressed up - they want money for pics you take. Also saw people handing out CD'S and demanding money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ftworth456
30,Walk of shame,"We have all seen this in many films and documentaries, I was so looking forward to this. Well it was crowded but that was to be expected, it goes on for mile and very hard to find people. Full of street artists everyone after your last dollar. Homeless people everywhere. Glad I've been, wont be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/318HelenM
10,Rip off artists abound - warn your teens,"If you have Hollywood crazed folks in your group then, yes, go to the Walk of Fame but be forewarned. A teen in our group was ripped off when street actors dressed in costumes ran up beside her and posed for a quick photo, then afterward claimed they had told her it would cost $20. They never mentioned money beforehand, plus it all happened so fast we didn't have time to think ""Why are they being so friendly?""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lulamama
30,My old stomping grounds,"Having grown up in Hollywood, going along the walk of fame was like old home week. I have to admit Hollywood is a lot nicer than it was in the past but there are still lots of people all over the place. It reminded me of other places like the Las Vegas strip when you will find street vendors and tons of shops selling tourist trinkets. It's nice to see and to go the Chinese Theater to see all the footprints but it really is just another tourist trap. It is worth to see but I doubt if many visitors make a second trip to the Hollywood strip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BOBBYGHollywood

30,It is what it sounds like...,"It is what it sounds like... Turist hell, but og you haven't been there you ned to stop by to see it your self.

30,A little anti-climatic but still a must see.,"A nice looong stroll. As you see names from the past it brings back fond memories. You do have to trudge through 2-3 guys wanting to take you on a Hollywood tour on every block. We went on a Thursday and it wasn't too packed with people, parking was easy. Also learned a good tip: you don't have to return to your parking meter to add time, you can just punch in your space # and pay at any meter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K4981IFmichellel

50,Ignore the bad reviews and just have fun!,"No, there aren’t any roller coasters, bungee jumps or anything else that will get your heart pumping. Yes, a struggling artist will ask you to purchase a CD and Spiderman and Spiderwoman will want you to take a pic with them and hope to get some food money. So What? This is Hollywood and you’re on Hollywood Blvd and if you want to take a picture of your favorite stars’ star that is enshrined on the Walk of Fame, go for it. This is what you do here and it was my wife’s dream so we came and we had a blast. I’ve been here before but never really cared about it but I’m older now and want to make my wife happy so we cruised the street, which is very long, and we took all the pictures we wanted to take. Do the same, walk up and down the street, find your stars and act as silly as you want! There aren't any fees so why not?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
30,Need to do it!,"I was looking forward to visiting the Walk of Fame in Hollywood and chosen which Stars I wanted to locate.

50,A walk through the Walk of Fame,"If you are visiting Los Angeles, you should inlcude a visit to Hollywood Walk of Fame. You could find a Star dedicated to your favour star.

It is a good walk through the Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanghatr
30,It goes on and on.,The Hollywood walk of fame goes on and on? For blocks and blocks. The one tip I would give is to watch where you are walking as people often stop without warning to admire a star they have just recognised.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCantrill13
40,Interesting...to say the least...,"There were all sorts of characters (literally and figuratively) out. Some were quite entertaining. :-)There were sooooo many people out, that you had to really look to see any of the stars. Mostly shopping to do there....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlyingAwayTogether
40,Just keep walking,Most people tend to gather in one particular section of the Walk and this is a shame since it actually extends for quite a distance with some famous names located further along.I found the antics of some of the tourists to be as entertaining as the Walk itself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinj205
40,Great attraction to visit,"Was great to visit the famous Walk of Fame. Probably thought it was going to be more glamorous than what it was. The people trying to sell you stuff, like CD's and those with superhero costumes that just came up and expected you to pay them for being in your photos, was very annoying. It would be great just to have a look and not to have hawkers in your face. Took away from this tourist attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Binhar

Warning if you photograph them they expect a tip.Tip If you are looking for your favorite star use your phone to Google the location of it.Several tour companies leave from here on tours of Hollywood sign, Beverly Hills, Star homes.

""Why does this guy have a star?"" ""Who the heck is ____?"" If you go with young kids, be watchful of the wacko street ""performers"" in their ""just short of copyright infringement"" costumes..they can be aggressive and annoying but usually they're ok with kids. Watch out for the folks that like to stop on a dime and suddenly look down at the star under their feet ( oblivious to the 5 people behind them).

There is no where to park along the street it's too busy. Many characters walking around for sure, and some parts very dirty. Lots of tourists walking around as well. The best you can do is take a 2 hour open bus tour of Hollywood. You could never drive everywhere to see everything. We paid 20 per person. There are little stand everywhere selling tours. Don't pay more than 20 or 25. And 2 hours is plenty. We went everywhere, and stopped at the top of Mulholland Dr. and what a view. You also get to see so much more that way. Half a day is more than enough. And watch out for ppl. walking around in costumes. It's fun to take a picture with them until they harass you for a tip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dm670

We were BUMMED that we did not find John Wayne & Clint Eastwood, so do your homework and find online where the ones really want to see are! I looked up John Wayne AFTER on our way home and he was on a SIDE STREET(Vine st). We did see then stars going down a couple of side streets but decided to stick to going forward. Lesson learned!

30,Ok if you like this sort of thing,"The only reason I came here was because my wife wanted to see the stars, along with the Chinese Theater footprint thing. If you are excited by seeing the name of a ""star"" on a sidewalk, I guess you would enjoy this. Be sure to pick up an index to the stars, for free, at the information booth close to the Chinese Theater. It can save a lot of walking if you only want to see a few special stars! I have seen other reviewers talking about it being dirty, but I didn't notice that it was any dirtier than any other high use area. Nor did the costumed characters bother me much. I think my grandson took some pictures of some of them and never was pressured into paying anything.

The stars are on both sides of the street, so you get to walk the length of Hollywood Boulevard without even realising it. Recommend going all the way to the end of the West side, as there's a nice monument featuring four actresses as pillars.Obviously as it was the main hub for tourists and things to see, it was crowded when we were there. The foot and hand prints outside the Grauman's Chinese Theatre is well worth a look, as is the cinema tour inside, as you get a sense of the history of the place.Madame Tussauds next door is worth a look as is the shopping mall complex on the other side.Be warned when walking about on the 'Walk Of Fame', lots of people dressed up as classic characters but if you want a picture they ask for money. Same goes for people trying to give you things.

Walking with my head down for such a distance made me dizzy, and I felt vulnerable knowing my attention was diverted.

One side of the street (where the chinese theater is) is fairly clean with lots of nice shops. The opposite side of the street is not so clean with many homeless sleeping or asking for money.

There are lots of cool shops (including a Ghirardelli shop ;) and places to eat, but the place was packed with people dressed up as characters. Do NOT take a picture with them. They expect a very generous tip for a simple picture and will bother you about it unless you pay them. Also, do NOT accept any handouts such as CD's or anything. Those are also expected to be paid for. And avoid the Scientology recruiting ladies! Otherwise, the people are friendly and I was so in awe of all of the stars! Definitely a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashlenclaireee

It was something I'm interested in, and I'm glad I got to see it, but really it doesn't take a full 4 hours. Unless shopping all day is your thing, you can see all of the stars in about 2 if that.

I am happy to oblige but I brought some very close friends here recently and I was shocked to see the demise of Hollywood Blvd. It was almost overrun with people dressed up as characters and they EXPECT a generous tip if you want a photo with them. I understand this is probably how they generate income but I saw some of them being downright rude about it. Also, I am sorry to say there have been numerous shooting and altercations here recently and people lost their lives.

50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"Enjoyment depends on how much of a HOLLYWOOD buff or fan you are, I guess. I thought it was fun to stroll along and REMEMBER some of the actors, entertainers that we 'forgotten about,' if only briefly. It was also fun to walk around trying to 'find' some stars in particular, like Marilyn Monroe and others. I enjoyed seeing other categories that people got stars for that I wouldn't have thought of as reasons to earn stars, like Max Factor, for example, for his work in ""Make-Up."" Fun times strolling, remembering, watching other people experiencing the same thing, as well as taking pictures of their favorite ""STARS!""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Magnotism

Though it does have nothing more than a sidewalk with stars and some tiles with hand and footprints, the place has a whole lot of colorful crowd and association with the entertainment industry you would not want to miss, especially on your first visit to LA.Since couple of hours are more than sufficient here, you can park at the Hollywood and Highlands parking and pay $2 for 2 hrs with validation, which can be done for free at the visitor center right at the dolby theatre entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rahulahuja1980

But this one guy was a jerk. He was down by The Beatles star and he kept asking and asking. Then he got right in my face asking if I was Russian. I guess because I was just saying no and basically ignoring him. He got in my face and when he didn't that I got rude. There should be some kind of law against this.

40,A must do in Los Angeles.,"You cannot go to LA without seeing the Walk of Fame. The area is for tourist. A large shopping/entertainment complex ""Hollywood and Highland"" stands tall above the street. It's filled with chain restaurants, shops and a theater. I believe parking is free in their garage. The chinese theater is on this section of the boulevard. This is where you'll find the footprints in cement. Jimmy Kimmel's theater is located on the opposite side. There are souvenir shops, small restaurants and the Hard Rock. On the sidewalk you pass many costume characters wanting tips for photo ops. During the day, vendors are selling tours. At night the area is fully lit with all the signs from the businesses. There are so many people walking it's hard to actually see the stars on the sidewalk. I found the area to be very clean and safe. When you walk a couple blocks from the main area, its gets a little older looking. You can't go to Hollywood without seeing this area, however; once can be enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sightseesylviaP

Make this part of your visit to the Chinese Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellerTokyo6058
30,See Star of favorite actors,"Neat to see, but you need to make sure you research where the stars you want to see are. We were there on the 4th of July, so it was very busy, but it allowed for some great people watching and fun pictures of people on the blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runnergirl112
50,"Great breakfast, for less","We skipped Starbucks, and had breakfast at The Coffee Bean on Hollywood Boulevard. They make steel cut oatmeal to order, with your choice of fresh toppings. It was delicious, the service was good, and 4 of us ate breakfast for less than $30, which isn't bad for LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/285elissac
40,Walk of fame,Great fun trying to find your personal favouritesVery busy thought difficult to try and find stars plus avoiding the crowdLots of impersonator can be too muchWanting to take photo with you for a donationBe aware of guy wanting to give you free cdIt's a catch as soon as you take it they insist on payment avoid them as far as possible,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmeliavdBerg
20,Pay to play under foot,"I grew up in the Hollywood area, and used to really enjoy seeing my favorite musiciansand actors immortalized in brass at my feet.That is until I found out that anyone with even the most insignificant notoriety and$25,000 could get a star.It's still a novelty, albeit cheapened by therelative ease of getting one.So have a look,take a picture, on your way to any otherattraction. Just don't make it the reason fora trip to a very crowded part of town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrentW493
50,Adventures on the Walk of fame!,"The Hollywood walk of fame might not be what it use to be but it's a definite do! I would say the best day is Sunday! That's when tourist from all walks of life, from all over the world are there, which in my opinion is pretty cool in and of itself! Of course there are the famous stars all along the sidewalk. Then of course there the open air and topless tour busses. There's are also the footprints and hand prints of the famous at the Chinese theatre. I would have to say that my most favorite thing of all are all of the Characters walking up and down Hollywood Blvd. they let you take a picture with them for a small gratuity of one dollar or two!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/candyr739
20,Boring and a bit gross.,"Any time someone is visiting town and mentions they are plan to visit the walk of fame I cringe a bit. I guess its one of those things on the typical check list, and sometimes the stars are interesting to see, but don't make it the destination. Make some great restaurant the destination and check out the stars as you walk from your car to the place you'll eat. Or go to the Pantages and see them outside there. But the street itself is crowded with tourists and folks in costume, its kinda dirty, and its not that exciting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcharlotte
40,Check it out,"Fun to walk along seeing all the famous names. Don't go down any sides streets as there are homeless and beggers. Don't accept any ""Free"" CD's or pose for photos as nothing is free. There is an awesome ""Everything only $5"" gift shop which we thought might be a scam but turned out to be awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beagle2428
40,Evercise and Film/TV History,We walked this area and look at each star. We do it with the grandkids just to see how many that cannot identify. It I a hoot! I heard that these stars or fans spend up to 5k on each star. Look for the ones with tribute flowers on them. Interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patron175
30,Disappointing,This was a very disappointing site. The area and the people in the area were very dirty. I won't go back anytime soon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sawbo101
20,Such a disappointment.,"There were our favorite artists' stars, in front of stripper clothes shops and head shops. Hollywood Blvd was a total dive and we must've had at least 5 people try to push us to buy bus tours. It was like Market St in San Francisco-not somewhere you want to be alone or after dark, yet there were the famous stars. If they could see their stars now, they'd roll over in their graves...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110bonniem
50,Hollywood Stars,"It's very interesting to know about who likes whom. Lot of people gethered around some stars and sometimes you don't see anyone on other ones. I liked the most star of the stars is Mohmmad Ali, which was not placed on the road but on the wall. What I heard by my guide Mr. Harry of LA Platinum Tours Co that Mohmmad Ali was not agreed to place his star on the road. Organizers decided to place on the Wall and he agreed on it. WoW!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/593rajj
40,Must see!,Soooooooo cool. Nothing more fun than to see all of your favourite stars. Find your idols and get your photo taken is what this strip is all about. Very interesting indeed and another must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/879cathyl
30,Done it. Seen it. Won't do it again!,It wasn't really that glam. Extremely busy and as a tourist felt unsafe. Very dirty streets. Not a good impression of downtown Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussieguy71
50,A fine tribute to famous people,"Must see in Los Angeles! There are so many stars that not all able to look at, but great to find a well-known celebrity stars. We stayed at the Coral Sands Motel (good value for money), and it was a little walk to the Walk of Fame. Also, the metro was useful. Some of the streets are quiet, but the center was much more crowded. There were also peddlers to watch out for, offer something for free and then demanding money. Well-known stars have a lot of people taking photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/278anttis
50,STARS N BUSKERS!!!!,Really enjoyed looking at the stars but the annoying Buskers in costumes were just that ANNOYING!!! A Fat short Asian Elvis - NA! Watch out for the guys trying to give you CDs.

50,Amazing. and unforgettable memories.......,"busy street..... lots of people moving around...interesting to see the names of celebrities you know..... travellers takes photos near their hero names.... people dress like famous characters like spiderman, pirates of carribean etc. They also entertain people esp... kids... taking photos and playing music and dance with kids.when u visit walk of fame, u can also visit madame Tussauds was museum there.it is worth seeing it. To visit madame tussuads u will have to pay a fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/venkatesananh
40,A star attraction,This is great to wander along just to see who you know or remember. It is better than I thought it would be as there are so many stars to read.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Photoguy2910
40,Kid with the green shirt,"We couldn't really find stars of people we knew. I am sure there is a a map or something so find one! The highlight of our walk, as we took in red carpet prep, was my son getting interviewed by Jimmy Kimmel. Once in a lifetime...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lukesmom330
40,Great for Out of Town Guests,"Most of the time the Hollywood Walk of Fame is a bit crowded, but it's amazing to see all the names there. You can find your favorite person and take a picture of yourself with that person's star. We took cousins from Norway and they absolutely loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoofamily
10,Just to many tourists to see anything - complete wate of time,When we arrive the walk of fame was crammed. It is full of souvenir / tat shops.I was looking forward to seeing this but was so underwhelmed. Go if you can find a time when there is space for you to see the walk of fame and look at the stars. If not don’t bother a complete waste of time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/82eh
10,Disappointing,"We came here expecting some grand blvd, but when we arrived it turned out to be in a run down part of town. the boardwalk was small and literally disgusting, everything was full of rubbish and smelled of urine.the famous theatres looked rly small and arent really worth looking for.overall this was a huge disappointment, dont waste your time here, instead go to santa monica, rodeo or the observatory, at least its clean there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philipp2207

30,Not Much to See,The stars are neat but its crowded and dirty in places. You have to see it if you're in the area but I wouldn't make a special trip for it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenD754
30,More hype than reality,"Possibly the Walk of Fame is like the movies that they produced, the expectation is far better than the reality. Lots of people like seeing foot and hand prints in cement, personally they didn't do a great deal for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidofWatford
40,Worth the time to see the stars,It was very interesting seeing the walk of fame. Its crowded around that area with many people selling things or performing besides looking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IllinoisCookie
30,Iconic must see.....ONCE,"Glad that we saw this, and our next trip to LA, we will not go here again. Of course its fun to look for famous names, but the area is so touristy and overrun that it is something we will only do once in our life and no desire to go back.Parking at Hollywood and Highland was a joke also. We bought hats at Lids, and they couldn't validate our ticket so we bought coffee, and they said they validated our ticket but we still had to pay $11 for 2 hours!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katsong
40,walk of memories,"a walk of nostalgia so very many good memories , a trip of music film etc There s something for everyoone",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb21162

10,Totally overrated,"We stayed in a place nearby so we hit the walk of fame almiat every day. Yes, there are stars on yhe pavement and tourists but that's about it. The shops and restaurants are barely appealing and certainly not glamorous. The best thing on the Walk: the Vegas seafood buffet (excellent balue for money)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeJo111
40,Got to see,"It's a got to see and by the Chinese theatre the hand prints also ,beware of people offering CDs because you don't get ought for nought !!! But well worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coolclosie
40,The who and who of hollywood,"this is the place to visit if you want to know about Hollywood. Easily one of the most busiest place in Los Angeles. This is where you find the famous hand prints of all the major celebrities of HW and all famous theaters which host various Hollywood functions and ceremonies.Parking will be hard to find and mostly paid as huge as $25, same goes for eating services which are costly as compared to other places. During holiday season traffic is too slow to move forward causing jams.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kumar_nitin
50,"Must see, once","I passed this area several times. It was really cool the first time you see it. All these celebrities and after a while you start looking for your favorite singer or actor.After passing this area, you kinda looked down a few times to see if you can spot any new names, but it's not that overwhelming as the first time you visit it.It is a must do though, but if I'm ever in Hollywood again, I would probably not go back here just for the Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielHenrysson
20,Not impressed,Was very excited but not impressed at allAlmost 2 miles long with main stars congregated around the graans Chinese theater/Dolby theater areaBut almost 100 of star empty .Visit it once on your tour and forget it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/318arung
50,A fun place to visit.,What a fun place! We spent a long time identifying the stars and reminiscing on their fame. It is a lively city and many and varied characters flaunting themselves and their wares!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethy641
40,Fun 'scavenger hunt'!,"Well, I'm sure you have your favorite stars / icons like I do... Looking for them was so much fun! And along the way, you get to discover so many others that make you go whoah! Gotta do when in LA :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ROSSAtravels
30,Memories,"For what it is, I found some of the streets footpaths to be very dirty and an insult to to all the stars who have their names there. The shop owners should do their part in keeping the stars clean and presentable, as they are the ones making money from the tourists. Besides that, I did enjoy star spotting and some of the names brought back fond memories of the past. Be prepared for impersonators and bring the camera as you will get some good photos. You will need at least 2 hours if you want to see all the stars. A bit of advice, do not accept any CD's from anyone as the people trying to sell them get very aggressive if you don't buy them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Larnel
50,A Must See When Touring Hollywood,"A nice way to get in touch with some of our favorite starts of today and yesteryear. Take the time to walk and see some of the stars on the walk, you won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/h0wiek
30,Okay,Stopped and let grandchildren walk while we drove around. Found a nearby Starbucks. After about 20 minutes they phoned and we picked them up. Not as bad as some reviews here. They enjoyed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9378FXjohng
20,Why? Why do people like this?!,"All you have to do is pay for a star to be put down. If you like awful tchotchkies that say ""I <3 LA"" or various hats and t-shirts that you shouldn't wear... ever, then this is the place for you. This is the street for people with Birkenstocks with socks, fanny packs, and prodigy.net accounts. Do yourself a favor and go literally anywhere else in the city. The bars are too expensive, the food is too expensive AND not good, and there are crusty jugglers all about!No, thank you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Definitely_EricD
30,Good to spend an evening !!,"As it says, this place is filled with the stars of top celebrities. Apart from this, there nothing for people who don't enjoy the theater. We didn't find parking on the street so ended up parking in a close by public parking spot ($10.00). We walked along the stars and took pictures at our favorite celebrities. Down the road on Hollywood Blvd and Vine St, there are a couple of places where you can buy good souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ranjithkoppu
40,"It is fun to find your favorite stars' names, but sad to see the disrepair.",I'm wondering if there is an organization that is raising money to repair the chipped and broken tiles in the Walk of Fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wildat50
30,Really not a big deal,"I know this is sooooo famous & historic, but there is nothing to see! It's a sidewalk with people's names on a tiny plaque; who cares?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/539marleneh
10,"Awful, Cheesy, Tacky, Devoid of any charm.","I recently travelled the whole of the west coast US. This place? was the absolute worst.It has no charm... it's just tacky, cliché shops everywhere. A lot of cheap, nasty movie memorabilia, it's packed full of people so you can barely move. The theatre is meh, it's nothing really to look at. Walking along looking at stars on the ground with famous names on them? BIG F'IN DEAL!!!You also get mobbed by morons in cartoon outfit who really are quite forceful in taking your camera, snapping a pic of you with them in it and demanding money.You also have a lot of ""rappers"" aka little unemployed boys offering you their cds and then demanding money.The place is just plain nasty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C1174PTjamesb
40,Another tourist attraction!,"Too many movies stars to list! Many interesting cartoon characters waiting to take photos, some weird ones too. I think there were at least 5 Spider-Mans today....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tten05
30,A Different Place,"Was nice to see all of the stars names. Brought back a lot of memories. The place is VERY crowded in the Summer. A lot of strange people. However, it seems safe during the day. Lots of junk shops",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hunza37093
30,Cool for a once in a lifetime day trip,"It's fun to see the names of all the stars from past and present from film, tv, art, music, etc... Be prepare for sleazy shops and homeless. It's just not as glamorous as you may expect. Avoid going at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thegreathawaiian
30,Iconic but stressful,"Very iconic and fun, but it gets way too busy and stressful with tourists and the interesting Hollywood fauna.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McJuls
40,Gotta See it to Believe It!,"Be prepared for LOTS of people, however ... it is a long block from LaBrea to Vine (and also down Vine a bit), but be aware that it is also home to the famous Grauman's Chinese Theater (with the hand- and foot-prints), as well as several hotels, a meeting center, and a cool outdoor shopping mall (from which to view the Hollywood sign - go all the way back by Starbuck's). Be prepared for impersonators galore and bring the camera ... you'll be able to check off several of your ""Hollywood Must-sees"" in one stop! Parking is plentiful, but go a block or two off of Hollywood Blvd to find it easily. You can also use the LA Metro ... use the REd Line and hop off at the Hollywood/Vine stop.Leave at least an hour for this stop, and as much as an afternoon if you're in for checking out the shops, etc. For a great map of the stars' locations, check out this map at http://hwof.com/about/finding/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ad709
50,Touristy but love it,"Nothing screams tourist like being in this section of LA but it's still very fun. For whatever reason, it is fun to walk the sidewalk and see the names of your favorite stars. The Chinese theater is in this area as well and it does get crowded. I've done this walk several times and it never gets old. There's always people out on the sidewalk in costume also so you have a chance to get some fun vacation photos but they do ask for a few bucks for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rduinc
40,Walk amongst the stars!!,Enjoyed seeing the stars from the past and all in person instead in the news and entertainment magazines. Lots of history and memories of entertainers frompast years.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/809kathyw
30,Too crowded street to go through,"The place is nice but you may not be able to see all the names there. The street is mostly crowded and keep your heads up while walking or you may bump into someone :)The path is however filled with look-alikes of some of famous Hollywood actors. You may buy some souvenirs from some of the road-side shops.You can also find some tour operators who will take you on a tour in the city. Though they say the price to the tour is fixed, you can bargain if you are more than two people in the group. I see this as one way of travelling around LA with nice view of the places around without bothering about the traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaviBandari
30,Not very glamorous.,"I was there on a weekday - and I honestly thought that I had gone to the wrong place - I did not realize that there were so many unknown ""stars"" in the US so I had doubts about the authenticity of ""the walk of fame "" but it's true enough, just not interesting. But you obviously got to be an American before before you think it is something special.I would rate this attraction to: been there, done that - Now let's go to the real experiences..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Claus_Krogsgaard
20,Actually it's a little tacky,"We were surprised at how many celebs were recognised, it's quite a walk to try and read them all.But, the surrounding area has tacky tourist traps and is generally a bit grubby.Nice to tick off your list of things to do in LA though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMLDJ

30,"Tourist street with bunch of famous theatres, wax museums and gift shops","Coming out of the Hollywood Highlands metro station, it was pleasant to see happy people walking around and stuff going on. A nice place to shortly visit once or twice. I took from the walk of fame a local bus to Farmers Market and the Grove, very convenient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eerot96
50,A fun day with family and friends.,"We saw the walk of fame a lot of stars, liked the attractions near it, the museum, people dressed like favorite characters and all the stuff nearby. Alot of nice shops nearby and the Mexican area for tourists is nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaP26444
20,Not what we expected,"For an area that is in every guide book and tourist map, I expected something grand. It's just a few short blocks, packed with people, and with nothing substantial to see or do. The stars in the sidewalk are nice to see, but there's no background information or interesting tidbits, some were covered in grime and chewing gum, and it felt very superficial. We took the obligatory photos in front of the Chinese theatre, wandered through the shopping centres, had lunch and that was enough. Wax museums, Ripley's, etc., can be seen anywhere, so why bother here? We wandered one block down and the surrounding area is really grubby. Overall, disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BDKR
40,"Fun, but long and dumpy.","It's definitely something you have to see when you go to L.A. I do wish there was a better way of figuring out the names you wanted to see, what section they're in and stuff.Also if you have children or are not used to large cities, be careful. There are a lot of shift characters around here waiting to prey on tourists. Keep your wits and you're fine but don't be dumb.You don't have to spend all day here - I spent an hour and was content with that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beaadventurouslife
30,Great Place if You like Crowds,I had an awful experience making my way to Walk of Fame... First off the traffic and drivers are chaotic. Next the parking signs purposely are confusing to throw people off with what it really stipulated. Got a ticket even though sign clearly stated parking between time... I experienced the people are rude and inconsiderateI was even told to SHUT UP by a gentlemen all because while waiting in line they forgot my order o was before him and tried to get in between me and my party....Now really right!!!!

40,Bringing Back Memories of Wonderful Past and Today,"Los Angeles is exciting shopping, theatre, and character impersonators in this area of Hollywood with many different types of shops and as you stroll though both sides of the street it is fun to check down and see all the names of both present celebs and those from days gone by in this famous walk of fame. It will bring back some pleasant memories of the big movie boom when TV didn't exist if you are older. For those younger than that you will recognize some of the famous people during your youth up to present day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabers86
50,A fun hunt to take down Hollywood's most famouse boulevard,"Stars line the streets down Hollywood Boulevard. As a California resident, I am constantly surprised to find names of stars from the past along the streets. The stars begin at Grauman's Theater - where you can see Clark Gable and other famous stars hand and foot prints. To see all the stars along the boulevard would be a very long hike, but you can see some famous names in the blocks front Vine street to Highland. Definitely a fun touristy thing to do when you visit Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123DRDEAN
30,a must at least once in a while,"Fun to walk around for a few blocks and visit this touristic spot in LA, no too much tine needed though.If you are a fist time LA visitor, go for it or if you didn't visit it for a while.

I gave him 10, which i already regret when walking away. Then the next guy pushed me a cd in my hand, unbelieveable. It is so crowded and so much tourism i really didnt like it. Guys everywhere in costuums waiting to get a picture for money and people to drag you in to the giftshop or star tours. The street is very short en noisy and i paid 15 dollars for parking. Maybe a must see, but ill never go there ever again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/t0c0s86

Take the metro to the Hollywood and Highland stop and save on parking : )If you need to park get your parking validated by one of the merchants and you will only have to pay $2 or for two or four hours of parking.

50,Walk of stars,"Another must see place, i must have spend quite a bit of time looking for prints of my fav stars. Next time, Selfie !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReccaHuang
50,Great for Movie Buffs,It was fun and educational at the same time. You might think a star is known for one thing but was honored for another media. You can see old as well as new. Definitely a must for old movies buffs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elisnv
50,fun history to see,"its always a must see when we go, fun to walk the sidewalks and see all the stars old and new! It was a first for our son and he enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/685tammyc
10,Walk of Shame,"Really the low point of the trip. Tacky and rundown area. We were given far more time than we actually required.Although the stars and footprints handprints etc were interesting to view, the location of them all is very seedy. Guess that goes to show what Hollywood is all about. The magic.June 2012",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatyGKnaresborough
30,Over touristy and bombarded with hawkers,"Pros: seeing the hand prints and signatures of stars were neat. Tour of Kodak theatre was insightful.Cons: the whole area is over ""touristy"". Every minute there'll be a street hawker trying to sell something. Don't take anything from them, even if you think it's free. I accidentally took something that was handed to me (auto-response) and was stopped and told it's a DVD and asked for a donation.Overall, it's one of those places you have to tick off your list but once is enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenn_Happy_Travel
30,Walk it once and then be done.,"Have you ever seen on TV when someone is getting their star and it looks so glamorous? Fast forward to today, reality. Smell the stench of urine, walk by all the cheap souvenir shops, avoid the characters, salesmen and homeless and try, just try to enjoy it. Many of the stars are damaged. If there is a star you want to take a pic with, look online for the location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Williamsland
40,A Day in LA,"A day was spent with my former officemate who is already based in US, we visited the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame, and was amazed by the many people visiting the place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globetrotter620701
40,Fun place,Hollywood's walk of fame is a fun place. It's free and you can take pictures with the stars of your favorite artist :) It can be crowded at times but it's still fun to explore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saadya
50,Really fun to see!,"The Walk of Fame was really neat to see! In addition to seeing actors and singers ""stars"", the actual experience of literally walking down Hollywood Blvd was quite intriguing and fascinating as well. Quite the variety of people and shops/stores to see and visit. All in all, I had a great time experiencing such an ""iconic"" landmark!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelaY361IK
20,Stars in the pavement,"I really don't see the point apart from saying you have seen it, stars in the sidewalk or pavement, so what.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haltoi01
30,Hollywood experience,"Ok, but a bit over-hyped, was expecting more from experience but when in Holllywood it has to be on the list of sights to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sm0
50,Old Hollywood,"A must see.. nothing ""special"" but if you are in Hollywood, CA.. this is the thing to do! It is across the street from the famous El Capitan Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alohakoa
50,Must See,"If you are visiting LA you need to make sure to walk down Hollywood and Vine. The area is very interesting with lots of people. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes and plan your trip. You will find all the stars there and so much history of the past. There are plenty of options for parking, you can even take the train or bus depending on where you are starting from. Lots of places to eat, grab coffee, souvenirs, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistyK_12
30,Expensive pavement,"The walk of fame is important for the celebrities, but to me it is merely expensive pavement that is over-crowded with tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlanetOz
20,Meh,It's just a place where celebrities can pay to have their name etched into the sidewalk. Not worth the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tigzmom
40,Between the stars,"One of the most famous and crowded promenade of the world. If you go around 10 am you can walk easily between not so many people and appreciate all the stars, the multicoloured shop selling everything. Also many interesting point like the famous Hard Rock Cafè, the Chinese Theater, Madame Tussauds building etc etc, but most of all you can meet the weirdest people of the world, try to promoting their music, their art or simply expressing their personality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M4rc0_77
40,Have to walk the walk.,Surprised to hear that the stars actually pay to have their names on the walk on the stars. I think the feet and handprints are actually free to the stars and they are invited to make their mark. Fun to compare yourself with a stars imprints.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunshineAsha
10,HOLLYWOOD WALK OF SHAME,"Whether you are on the street, at a bar or restaurant this place is filthy. It's overpriced and you will be harassed constantly. All for what....to see names of unimportant people engraved in the street. What an embarrassment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7066VSlisas
40,Lots to see,"This was my first time to LA (and the USA in general) so i had to come here first! I didnt actually do the whole walk. But visited about 5 times the whole trip. I loved going here to walk, eat, sight see, always something to see and do. We booked some of our tours from here. And i found Mel's Diner just off Hollywood, became one of my favourite places to eat!One day we were lucky and the Mad Max premiere was on, got to see a few famous faces!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderinglyse
40,A must see attraction,"From history to recent, you can find them all in Walk of fame in Hollywood. Musical, dances, artists and many other activities will make you happy and visit the place more than one time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sirwan80
40,Search for the Stars!,See your favorite stars' Star on the Iconic Walk of Fame. Can see many stars close to Chinese Theater. Be sure to visit the El Capitan Theater and the Ghirardelli Soda Fountain next door.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Largenoggin69
50,StarStruck!!,"Wow, went here when i was a teenager and was totally amazed, so much street life happening around you, a true Hollywood experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peachy28nz
50,"I don't care what they say, wear comfortable shoes","The first time we came here in 2008, I had mistakenly worn ballet flats. Big mistake honey. HUGE. If you're going to do it right, wear your joggers proudly and spend an hour or two really going from one end to the other. So much fun. Take your photo with a star (literally) Ignore the tour guides who still try to sell you CD's and bus tours etc. Leave most of the pathetic lookalikes alone, they are fleecing you for cash and they don't even look alike (Captain Jack Sparrow excluded - he was AWESOME). Never miss this when we are in town - 5/5",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aussiedisney
40,Walk of Fame,Becareful with many cosplay characters roaming along this street posing to take photos. They will demand for tips after photo has been taken.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaw002
40,Great place to visit!,My family and I enjoyed our visit to the walk of fame. It was neat seeing all of the stars and looking for different stars you have seen on TV. The main area to visit is by the Chinese theater where you can view all of the stones with autographs on it. There is also plenty of people on the streets trying to give you free CDs and plenty of gift shops to view as well. Nice to stroll down the walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kdawg282
50,Practically grew up on the Blvd. .,"If you are a first timer to LA and Hollywood, you have to take a walk on the wild side. Very cool, and fun . you see anything and everything on the walk of fame, not just the stars , but the stars. The people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nudie
30,Prepare to Walk,Lots of walking but really fun. My kids probably new one in every twenty names while I recognized about a third of the names. It seems to go on and on and on and on (get it?). So you might want to have a plan to end your walk before you walk endlessly like we did!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFBayMommy
10,Disappointment!,"I was so excited to see the Walk of Fames first time in my life,but it was a huge disappointment. The area is disgusting. We did not feel secure walking there. The area is full of homeless people and junkies, and someone stops you every 2 minutes to try to sell you some tours. It is so annoying. The streets are filthy and smell of urine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindsssay
50,Take a picture and keep walking!,"Stars and more stars..all around you..Keep walking in order to discover all the names,all the stardom and all your favourite artists!Don't forget your camera as you will definitely want to take as many pictures as possible!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/George19802013
30,Worth seeing what you have always heard about,"Glad we checked it out. Seeing the stars on the footpath was great. It is really busy and easy to miss lots but if there is one you really want to see, go for it. I liked the area around the Chinese Theatre. You do get stopped and harrassed a bit by the the next new rapper "" giving away a CD"" don't fall for that. Photo opportunities are everywhere with a celebrity but take note they are not free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/299bethm
20,Disappointed,Expected the walk of fame to be something special but it full of shops selling junk and you get harrissed by people trying to rip you off with a blank CD or pay to have you photo taken with them in costume .....We cut our stay by one day as it was so bad.Sort it out City of LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laz65
50,"NOT disappointing, if you know what you are looking for","Some reviewers said it was a disappointment, but if you realize it's just a couple thousand gold stars on the sidewalk, and that's what you are looking for, then it's fun. We didn't look at all of them, but I found a few that I was specifically looking for (Chuck Norris, Bruce Lee, Winnie the Pooh), and found some others that were interesting. Took a few pics. It's a fun way to kill time while waiting in lines or walking from one place to another.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoingForCoffee
20,Great disappointment,Actually there's nothing here worth seeing. The glamour that we see on TV is really only on TV. Live Hollywood Walk of Fame is a real disappointment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vasco_Vieira
10,disappointing,"there's literally not much you could do or enjoy on the walk of fame. the street is far from being clean, always crowded. Also, the area did not seem very safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shinysimo
50,Fantastic!!!,Costs nothing to see except for all the other attractions here that lure you in. You need a whole day here to see some of the amazing things. Check out both sides of the road and then decide your priorites they are all amazing.... Lots of cheap souvenirs here too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albertaandharryz
50,Perfect evening walk,wonderful experience walking the street with the walk of fames with all famous personalities name engraved in it... It's worth the visit there..😊,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArunM04
20,Glorified Business Cards,"Filthy. Needs to be hosed down. The amount of food spilled, mud and probably human excrement... it's terrible. The price to get a star is $30,000.00 and they can't clean it? gross.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DearlyDeparted
30,Good place for tourists AND locals!,"We visited with a friend of our teenage daughter's and we all enjoyed it. Los Angeles does not have a lot of notable landmarks and this is definitely a draw for visitors. Lots of things going on at all times, a worthwhile venture for both young and old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawnCA
50,Absolutely Awesome !!!,"If you are a Hollywood movies lover, this is the place to visit. Its a long walk if you cover the whole street, so preserve all the energy till you reach there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/singhashwini12
40,Twinkling Memories,"For any movie buff this is a must see if you are in Hollywood. If you've been around for a while, coming across the honoring of a past (or present) star can trigger a lot of memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ray-n-Sol
20,Hollywood Walk of Weird,"If you have a tight schedule, I'd skip this place. The street is dirty, really a shamebecause it is supposed to be a ""memorial"" of sorts to the distinctive careersof notable people in film and theater. Instead it is somewhat of a ""side-show"" of weirdpeople, constantly vying for your attention. I'd understand if a person receiving a ""star"" on the Walk of Fame were to pass on coming to the ceremony. Definitely disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saberan5
30,"Would not really call it an ""attraction""","As we stayed in LA we found this when wandering about, but I would not purposely plan a trip around it. Fun to see a few of the fave names and the imprints around the big theatre, but really, it's Just a footpath with names on it in the end",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LFC79
30,Grubby! sprinklers almost worse than those on Bali,What to say? The walk of fame is just a long stretch of dirty road. The council needs to clean up the area and polish up the poor stars. Strip was also full of cheap n nasty Made in China souvineer shops. Worth a visit for only 1 hour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beryl_be
10,Dissapointment,"This is a disappointment, especially since Hollywood is always described as glamorous. The streets are dirty, imposters are everywhere trying to scam tourists, buildings along the streets are messy and run downs, junkies here and there. should have rested in hotel room instead of wasting my time here. Never go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hcze

20,Dirty,You sort of expect the walk of fame to be so grand and amazing when in reality it is so dirty and un well maintained! There are people in costumes harassing you the entire time and tour buses. Glad I've seen it but would never waste time going back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ligeha
50,A must do when in LA,This Hollywood Walk of Fame is a must do when in LA. Even if it is just to say you have done it. You get to see the Hollywood Sign which is also a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnW947
10,Watch out I'm trying to take a picture of Kevin Spacey's star!!,The walk of fame is one of the biggest hypes of Hollywood. Films and TV shows show the walk of fame to be clean and well looked after. What of load of shishkabab!!! People were walking all over the names and walking in your we when your trying to look at one of the stars. Jackie Chan's name appeared to be Jacie can when I read it because of bits of cigarettes have been squashed over the letters. And when I was trying to take pictures of the stars the people around me walking up and down the street we so disrespectful and ignorant. They could clearly see what I was doing and yet they walk straight into my line of (camera) fire and bumped me. Terrible!!! Tut-tut-tut!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693keiranh
30,"Been there, done that, messed around",It's probably on your bucket list. So you will visit it anyway. Don't raise your expectation too high and you won't be disappointed.!Attention - highly touristic fair-alike area!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThatGrumbler
30,Great time locating stars,My daughter was very excited to find and get her picture with lots of the stars. Sometimes a little crowded but not to bad. Marilynn Monroes was partially under some construction. We had a good time finding them though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peggyg849
30,Fun for first time vistors to LA,"I used to live in LA and am therefore aware that Hollywood is not a desirable neighborhood to visit. My wife, however, has never seen the walk of fame and wanted to visit. We visited on a weekday morning and found metered parking on a side street.It is fun to find stars for people you enjoy watching on screen.The shops and restaurants on Hollywood Blvd are best avoided. There is a Sizzler on Highland Avenue south of Hollywood Blvd that has cheap and decent lunches and it is just a five minute drive from Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SwedeAbroad
40,Always entertaining,"Walk of Fame is great. It's free, and great for exercise. I still haven't seen all of the stars, but one day I will. They offer bus tours, which if you bargain right, can be talked down from $40 + to about $20 per person. If you are a tourist, do some research before visiting. I do it all the time, and Trip Advisor is a great place to start :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/658tanayr
30,Big name small outcome,Hollywood Walk of Fame is the main attraction in Los Angeles where visitors first select to visit but usually depress because nothing special is found except gathering. Small area where people take pictures and book tours. Only special attraction is Hard Rock Restaurant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kausarwali
30,"A ""been there done that""","Everybody thinks of the Hollywood stars when they go to LA but after a couple blocks it truly felt like ""been there done that"". The one block by the subway station has most of the current stars. Many names of the other names are old and repeated. After all, somebody just needs to pay for the honor.Beware the area is pretty sketchy so make sure to go during the day. I'm sorry to say it but it is not as spectacular as it is made out to be..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelling_Trio111

50,Really cool!,Lots of sites to see for free. Great characters in costume to take pictures of or with. Cool shopping also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greytab
40,Worth the price of admission,"Although not top of the list, we did have it on our list of attractions to see while in Hollywood. If the price hadn't been free, I think I would have been disappointed.The Stars were turned different ways so it was hard to walk and easily see the various names. I was surprised how many were broken. I get it's not easy to keep them clean - but I didn't expect broken stars.It was fun seeing some of the names and remembering childhood shows/movies.Definitely worth 4 star rating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BritnerS
40,Hands Down the Feet Have It !!,"My mother-in-law was a Huge Norma Shearer fan..so now she has a photo of her hands and footprints.. & I have More Brownie Points in the Bank :)It just Is the case that walking along the Walk of Fame brings all sorts of memories and faces to mind.. some more obscure and so many happy memories of characters and personalities who brought their craft and skills to our conciousness and with it Happy, sad, scary, awesome memories of roles and Films from Way back as well as quite recent memory.Yes its a bit cliche to come up to Hollywood Blvd and 'walk the walk'.. but hey.. Happy memories are golden and bring back times and places and especially people.. Gotta say though..my wife did seem a little flushed in front of George Clooney's imprints.. heh",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyDryden
30,Neat Place but Very Busy,"This is a neat landmark to see because of all the celebrity's stars. However, it was very busy when I was there with tourists walking everywhere. There were also many cheesy tourist shops all along the street and tons of street performers. Not my favourite attraction in L.A. but neat to see if there.In summary:Cool place but prepare to be around a bunch of tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globetrotting_Lolo
40,Walk of Fame,One of the things that are on the list of things to do in Hollywood. Nice to see best go early as gets mega busy. Place could do with a good wash. Not the cleanest one of the main attractions so wash surprised.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davglafferty
30,over rated,this is just a busy road..with the star of fame on the pavements on either side.all the big tour busses pick up tourists for tours from here.we took our tour for famous celebrity houses from a small mall at the end of walk of fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/882Divya
50,Lots happening in the area,"The area around the Chinese theatre is the walk of fame. This has handprints and footprints of famous stars like madonna, Johnny depp, Tom hanks, vin diesel, Sandra bullock, etc etc. there is Michael Jackson but it's not real as it was put after his death. Along with this, the real action is in the area around the theatre. People dressed up as batman, superman, sponge bob etc stand there and u can get a photo clicked with them (and give them a dollar tip). There are kids who are singing and dancing for tips. Lots of touristy shops. Basically a nice place to spend the evening and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VivekK866
50,Crowded but fun finding your favorite star,"A little crowded but it was fun. Seeing all the stars that have been taken from us was sad but just seeing their names and taking a picture including shriek, Mickey Mouse and Godzilla. It's fun looking for your favorite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/286dianew
30,Surprisingly unremarcable,"Definitely worth the visit for it's own sake, but to me did not lived up to the hype and fame. And celebrity home tours are just creepy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rolandd949
30,Over the top with commercialism,"This World-famous site is somewhat of a disappointment. The entire area is not well maintained and there are ""hawkers"" everywhere trying to sell something. You can not travel 50 feet without someone bothering you and pushing something. Everything on this strip is expensive, starting with parking at $25.00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dallastraveler49
30,Sadly Neglected,"For something so iconic as the Walk of Fame , Hollywood has failed miserably. The streets no longer are paved with gold , rather with remnants of gum, food and what I can only assume is human spirit. Although this is suppose to be where dreams are made, the Walk of Fame is dirty, full of transient people of an evening, so I would not suggest a stroll after dark on this famous street. The street itself lends itself to a variety of gift sores, the Chinese theatre and liquor stores. For something so famous as the strip I was sadly disappointed. Obviously because this attraction does not cost money it is left to self decay. It is still fun to wander and look at the names of so many famous people and take your pictures, But it would be a lot nicer if they cleaned it and brought it back to it former glory. It would make people want to stay longer, browse the stores and eat at some of the may restaurants that are along the street,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annetteb271

30,Busy but Enjoyable!!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame does not look like this picture! It was so annoying to walk the WOF without dodging and ducking tourists that were taking pictures.You could not walk four steps without people on your heels or tripping over someone bending down taking pictures. I thought the tiles would be nice and shiny as shown in the picture, but it was just a long dusty, dull sidewalk. You can pick up a guide that tells you where your favorite star is listed. WOF is on a busy busy strip in the heart of Hollywood but the further one walks down, the less touristy it becomes. There are plenty of stores and eateries on both sides of the street. There was never a dull moment on the WOF day or night, but it becomes all the way live at night! You may see celebrity look-a-likes, musicians, or your favorite cartoon character. Overall, it was lots of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngieW7
40,Fan moment realised,"Its everywhere, too many people stars too many place. My advice would be google which stars you would want to see and go to the place.

30,Family trip with teens and young kids,The stars were neat. The sketchy people dressed in spiderman costumes and other kids characters were not cool. They only will take pictures for tips and I did not appreciate how they kept trying to get my 7 year old sons attention. I felt uneasy the entire time we were there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juleeannrivera
30,Out of this world!,"Where in the world can you find such freedom of expression without being thrown into jail or mental asylum. Any and every day you find people dressed up like your superheroes, Walt Disney characters, pop stars, villians, cops and yes even minions.You can even see a shade of the Harlem a Globe Trotters, Hare Krisna troupers and even a Obama look alike.Certainly a 'must do' thing if you are only in LA. The stars on the long sidewalk offers less appeal than the live action on the street concentrated mainly around the Dolby Theatre area. Amidst all the glitzy sides, you ll see some homeless people up the street and hustlers offering tour to Hollywood stars home. Welcome to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Highadventurer
30,A Hollywood Must,"Whilst in Hollywood I had to see the walk of fame and was excited to see the stars of my favorite actors and Hollywood legends. There's part of the boulevard that is just a regular shop-lined street and is fairly old and unimpressive, but heading towards the Chinese and Dolby theaters and the glitzy lights, it is a lot more 'Hollywood'. The boulevard can be very crowded with tourists and street performers but it's all part of the experience. Get amongst it and soak up the atmosphere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megang989
30,Punishing. Too many crazies.,"What a punishing experience this was. On top of all the annoying salesmen offering you their hollywood tours you have another 10 or so duo's pushing their rap mix tapes on you and telling you to visit their soundcloud. It becomes a mission to walk around the Hollywood walk of Fame, A mission of avoiding all the above people. It's really not worth the trouble unless you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bennis91
40,A GREAT EXPERIENCE,"I mean this is the Hollywood Walk of Fame!!!!!! This is the Place we all sit back in dowdy England and watch on, our TVs, read in the newspapers, or watch the Hollywood movies that these very same stars have graced this famous strip.Yes it was ""a little"" congested, but not to the point where you were restricted to move, and to be fair surely this is expected to be a little congested with visiters at such a iconic place!!iconic place!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jojo7292
30,Walk of fame,"Went down here a couple of times, got excited at first and went ""naah"" for the rest of the times.Hollywood walk of fame in Hollywood Blvd is one of the most busiest street around LA, so if you're driving expect traffic.Quite a lot of interesting shop to see and easy to reach by taking a red line LA Metro subway from Union Station",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ERgh
30,A must see but could be better maintained.,If you come to Hollywood then of course you have to do the Walk of Fame. It was good to see the names on the multitude of stars. Great to have a photo taken with Michael Jackson's star. There were many names I didn't recognise and quite a few blank stars.What I found most disappointing was that some stars looked tatty and I also got bored walking along and seeing names repeated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cranbourne
30,Congested and unavoidable,Our apartment was on the Hollywood walk of fame which was a blessing and a curse. The entertainers will insist on taking photos with you and then demand a tip (we do not operate like this in the UK) and the walk of fame is merely just a long narrow street with stars on it and everyone shoving things in your face. You have to walk past it to get into the shopping centre which is annoying. Will not be returning anytime soon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Apriljle
40,It was OK,"We were there while a premier was being prepped... it was good to say we have been there. Not sure if I would go back, but pleased we took the kids there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brentling
20,Not what I expected,"I expected a clean sidewalk with those golden stars of celebrities of film and stage proudly displayed. Instead, it's mostly a seedy area of town and the sidewalk is filthy. There are also creepy peddlers and bums lining the busy streets. There needs to be a police presence in this area. It could be so much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H7956FAlisaw
30,GO AND BE SURPRISED,"when you think of the hollywood walk you idealize it and it is nothing more than a sidewalk with different tiles with names imprinted. The biggest treasure will be to go to the chinese theather and see the signatures of footprints of BIG stars, that is worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/telmomom
20,overrated,Found walking along a main street looking at names of famous people rather unexciting. Being a tourist attraction the usual people were about trying to obtain some money. If you are in LA you may enjoy the experience more than I did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108Jean
30,Overcrowded,"I knew this would be a busy place, but it was very crowded. There are many people there, asking you to take tours, listen to their CD, give them money,etc... That was a little uncomfortable for us...especially the kids. You learn to just look straight ahead and ignore them, but the constant badgering gets a little old. We were glad to finally leave the street and go to one of the malls in the area. It is hard to see all the stars, as again there are tons of people walking. Many want to take pictures, you are also constantly trying not to run into them or get in their pictures. It is great people watching and something you should see...just be prepared for all the people walking and approaching you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amym904
50,So much fun!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame was so much fun. Everyone loved seeing all of the stars and characters walking around. If you are traveling with small children, there's a good chance they will want to take pictures with the people dressed as characters walking along the walk of fame. If you allow your child to take pictures with the characters, the characters will most likely want money afterwards. Make sure to bring some money(singles), baby wipes, and hand sanitizer. There were also many shops along the Walk of Fame. I especially loved stopping at Ghirardelli but some of the other members of our party liked the Disney Store better. You have to visit the Walk of Fame if you visit LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/le0l0vest0travel
30,"Neat Place, worth checking out....","Park away from it and walk too it .... it was busier than all hell while we were there on Tuesday at about noon ( I know, I know ... get use to it, its LA!! ). We checked out the Chinese theater and the Ripley's, believe it or not. alot of fun but its fast moving and lots of people",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaronn410
30,Had to see,"Let's face it, this is one place most people want to see. See the names and stars on the ground, see how many you know. Have a photo taken next to your favourite star. Problem is the area around it isn't that great or clean and there are so many other people wanting to do the same thing, it is hard to get a good photo of anything. Glad we went there but would not need to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariofionag
50,Hollywood walk of fame !!!,This is just amazing !! Walk down Boukevard and see all the famous names !!!!!fabukous experience !!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaHaywood134
40,Dirty bustling broads and hawkers trying to make a buck or two...,"Hollywood was just as I expected it to be ...busy, hot, full of traffic, tacky souvenirs and even tackier people. Nothing is for free , even the free cd s handed to you by hawkers then snatched back when you refuse to tip ...even Superman asking if you d like a photo iS working on tips , Minnie Mouse turned her back when I tried to take a photo. Its awful and wonderful at the same time but my wife and child felt really nervous and I watched my wallet like a hawk....On the day we were there, they were setting up for the premiere of Inside Out -a kids film which was interesting to see and later on , loads of the films stars turned up.Hollywood and Highland shopping centre is an air cooled oasis of decent shops , restaurants but after an hour we were ready to leave...Hurray for Hollywood or Dirty ol town ?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CornishMorgans
50,Walk of fame.,Be prepared to pay for any photos taken with persons in character roles. They are everywhere looking to make money. Lots of fun and plenty of famous stars to have your picture taken with. Souvenir shops a plenty and lots of cafes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggieo429
40,Dream come true!!,I've dreamed of going and seeing this for years and years so it was very exciting for that dream to come true :) It's very hard to get good pictures though with soooo many people there. We went back early in the morning and there wasn't many around so managed to get great photos. Really needs to be a map so you can find certain stars as we left disappointed that we couldn't find a few. If you haven't been to Hollywood before be aware it is a little scary if you wonder too far down the strip. Some people are very confronting and full on trying to get money from you. Don't let that stop you from going though as it's amazing to see :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greciangoddess
40,Wow gotta see the Hollywood walk of fame,"Its a nice spot to vist wen in Hollywood even tho its abit run down and could use a facelift lol. Theres alot of ppl trying to sell you things tho best thing to do is just ignored them.. The chinese and dolby theatre is awesome + the only good things here is the star names on ground, dolby and chinese theatre :p. So wen in Hollywood come check it out for yourself",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaymondG1318
30,A star is born!,"There are some shady characters on the street so be careful for your belongings and keep a watch on the children but it is fun to walk around and people watch. Of course, when you happen to find your favorite star be sure you dont stop while there are people walking right behind you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yeseniaa885
30,Great to see,"Was a once in life time thing to see, and experience. Only down sides were no one was willing to help unless you paid them. And all the people ment to be helping just sent you to over priced tour companys which we didnt want to talk. If you find a star you want to take a photo of you need to be quick and determined as people will walk infront of you or push you out the way but after 1-2 stars you learn how to get a photo :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zerhara
50,Hollywood walk of fame,"Amazing place, beautiful weather and so much nice thing to see. Shops are close to each other and there's no need to take a ride.all those beautiful places we've only seen on TV came to reality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/62lettys
50,Great to See all the Stars,If you are familiar with the Hollywood (who isn't?) this is a great place to check out; you can see the stars of almost all the popular Hollywood stars which is cool. All the wannabe stars who wants to sell their CDs and what not are a hassle though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sachinthag2018
40,Way Longer Stretch Of Stars Than We Ever Thought,It's an interesting stretch of a few blocks of walkway with the Stars showing names of celebrities. They don't seem to be in any order. While walking along you will be accosted by 'wanna-be-actor-lookalikes' that try to entice you to take their picture and then they demand payment.....so be aware ! It's one of those attractions that you must experience at least once in your lifetime !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonandMarusia
40,Wow but sidewalks arent the best,"Had to visit here once came to LA, loved taking pics off all the stars names on sidewalks tho they would need cleaned it up abit since its meant to be Hollywood walk of fame. Did run down tbh. But its well worth visting :D",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhla
50,Excellent if you're from out of town.,"Holywood & Highland is somewhere I always take friends from out of town that have never experienced Hollywood. There are performers that dress as popular movie characters (some better than others of course) and lots of famous Hollywood sites. Don't expect a free photo from the characters, they are there working on tips.It's a cool spot, but there's a lot to do in the area, so if you're not with kids that truly appreciate the performers; get in, see the sights, and get out, you have lots more to see. If you have a few days then maybe consider one of the Hollywood Tours of the celebrity homes, I did it once and it was actually pretty fun.If I want to hit the highlights, I usually take my out of town guests by Rodeo Drive, the Beverly Hills Hotel, Sunset Blvd, Robertson, through 3rd street or WeHo, to Hollywood, up to Burbank (I love the WB water tower) then through downtown to the 10 where you can head to Santa Monica or the Getty and complete the circle.If your with kids and your M.O. is Hollywood, then do Hollywood, spend some time and then tell your kids you'll take them to Universal if they behave and let you escape for a night to the Roosevelt, Beverly Hills Hotel, Sky Bar, or one of the many fun surrounding hot spots. Try to finagle a pass to the Magic Castle if you can :) it's always a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justinsena
10,The armpit of California,"Talk about not being what I expected. California tourism sure does a good job of making Hollywood out to be all glitz and glamour. I should've read the reviews on here because I never would've gone here. Besides traffic being horrible, the area is a dump! Don't waste your time or money going here. Plug in the old laptop. google map the street, and enjoy the ""stars"" that way. I've always wanted to go to California, and now that I have, I can say I will NEVER go back. California is definitely the armpit of the nation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimZ738
20,Anti-climatic,"What i think many of us forget is that when you walk on the Hollywood walk of fame, you're walking on a regular pavement (sidewalk) with fancy stars on it. It also spans really far, with names of celebrities of the yesteryear, and the further away you go, the worse the upkeep of the stars.The main ones seem to be extremely busy, and you are constantly pestered by 'street performers' who are looking for cash, and a mixtape.if you love touristy stuff, then you'll love it. If you're half sane, you'll be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jBuckee
40,Be wary,"Went there a week ago, great places to eat nearby but extremely busy and a lot of people in costumes that try to get you take pictures then charge you, had fun there though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chickaboo01
40,Beautiful place with lovely people,"If you are in the area then go to the Hollywood Walk of Fame.You do get hassled there but just act dumb and pretend you can’t speak English. Its great looking at the stars on the floor and saying to yourself 'Wow these people were actually here' and for that matter so were you.The restaurants are lovely and clean and the people are full of energy and enthusiasm.Great service everywhere I went, and I know I gained many pound eating whilst I was there - Hollywood walk of fame I give you 8/10",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenmaoudis
30,Love the stars but area is rough,"It would have been more enjoyable, if people weren't trying to take pics with our 17 yr old and in crazy costumes or try and sell us a cd. The area has so much history to it, and its sad it looks like it does. Homeless are all over the area also. Theres shops for souvenirs but we were so ready to get out of the area, we didnt go in any of them. If theres a certain actor, or actress you are looking for, cheat like we did and google ""where is... star on the hollywood walk"" and web sites will give you an easy way to find your favorite ones your looking for. It helped us a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jweith
30,An interesting and fun walk!,"Loved having my photo taken with my favorite ""stars""! It is a long walk if you do the whole thing but with nice weather it's fun. There is a listing available in Hollywood that will tell you everyone who has a star and where it is. I found this to be very helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kittykat610
30,Meh...,Was super excited to see this but as it is in a very busy area it can be hard to read/take photos of the ones you want. Also it would be nice if there was some kind of map as it can be hard to find the names you want. Still cool to see it though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/is0bel77
10,Walk away,Such a waste of time. Period.We had one night in LA on our road trip and stayed near Hollywood blvd.The walk of fame was lame.Just a bunch of stars on the floor. Totally over rated. The area itself is a bit dodgy at night. During the day there are a few shopping areas and nice places for dinner but most of the places are touristic bars and shops.Do make other plans if you can.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelove365
40,Fun!,Its always fun to walk in Hollywood to look at the stars on the walk of fame. I've gone to many of the inductees when they got their stars and its fun as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sworrels
10,Dirty waste of money and time.,Don't bother going to this place. It is filthy with rubbish everywhere and bins overflowing. There are street performers that are constantly in your face that don't take no for an answer. The people that do the tours are ruthless when they try to push their business on you. Skip this place and LA totally as there are plenty of nicer place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Letnic
20,I'm sure it was nice in the glamour days of Hollywood,"My friend who lives in California warned me ""The Walk of Fame isn't going to be as nice as you imagine"". I admit it was 'cool' to see the stars names, but the blocks of stars in the Hollywood area is just a dirty, sloppy area. Tons of homeless people, constantly having tour pamphlets shoved in your face, dirty sidewalks and streets. I think of the glamour that once was Hollywood and then see what I did upon visiting and think how sad. Glad to say I've 'been there, done that' but sadly have to say I would never recommend anyone going here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kitteakat
40,Overall fun!,"Fun to walk through and see, but keep a your eyes open as everyone is trying to sell something. Not as dirty as everyone thought it was in previous reviews, and a great outdoor mall!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zbuxton
40,Worth The Visit,"If you are in LA you have to come and see here, it does what you expect. It's very interesting and kept clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghotchkies
40,A must see while in Hollywood!,"This is what I was looking forward to seeing while in LA. The Walk of Fame is pretty cool and just like I imagined it to be. Yes of course, you have the weirdos dressed in creepy costumes that want a $1 from you, but it is still unique, cool and so much entertaining to walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRainville99
30,Nice,I guess my expectations were so high that it was not what I expected. I did enjoy it it is a nice little walk but it is a bit dirty in the area just be prepared but I think everyone should still go check it out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/survivor5804
30,One for the bucket list,"It is fun to look at the stars, but you must do so with many other tourists and panhandlers. We checked out the hand prints and footprints at the Chinese Theater as well as a couple of blocks of the Stars. The area is a little cheesy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKKelley3368
20,Tourist central in hollyweird,I guess you have to see it when you come to LA. But be warned there are herds and herds of tourists everywhere. Find your favourite celebrities if you must but you don't need to send too much time there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andymarriott90
50,Walk down memory lane,"Oh you MUST visit this attraction. I felt bad for some of the older stars of Old Hollywood winding up in such bad parts but it was wonderful! Just don't be bullied by everyone selling their CD's and wares. Don't listen to what they say, keep walking and have a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BreathingAloha
40,Taste of Hollywood,Looking at those stars' name was like a dream come true! Your LA trip would not be complete without this!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelleW247
30,Walking among the Stars,"Definitely something to do, but beware that on a crowded day you may trip over character's and kids. I actually enjoyed walking the stars, but then opted to take a few specific pictures. I like how you can drive right to the location of your favorite star. This saves time and street parking is available for quick pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlot
40,Walk of Fame shopping,"Great tourist shop right on the corner when coming down from the star tour bus attraction and next to the theatre. $5 for everything in store, so good!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/210jessc
30,Had to go,"This is something you ""have to go"" see if you're in Hollywood. However, even though I very much felt happy to be there, it was more so because its one of those things ""everyone"" has on their bucket list.It's warm and crowded, so dress appropriately and keep your belongings with you. There's a very nice pizza restaurant around the middle which you also might want to go eat at!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bedusken
50,A Must!,"Playing tourist is my faviote hobby, so while visiting LA the Walk of Fame was a must stop. yes some areas seem a lil shadier and distance than others passed the Chinese Theater, but you can google who you are looking for or just stroll the Walk of Fame and check out all the stars!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atastefortravels
50,Excellent visit,It was for the first time I visited Walk of Fame and it was an amazing experience. I found it most happening place in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/229varunb
30,Did the touristy thing,"Can't really stop to see each one due to being on a busy sidewalk. Found out ""stars"" purchase these themselves. Interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hawkins30102
30,Its amazing but not too much...,"Yes, some people might find it very exciting but I'm probably too old! Sometimes over crowded but great atmosphere, street character from the movies, great fun for kids. Parking may get hectic at times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mahib_Islam
40,Stars as far as you can walk,"Everyone has got to see this, at least once in their adult life. The Hollywood Walk of Fame has 2,538 five-pointed terrazzo and brass stars (as of 2014) flush with the sidewalk. We only went from the start along Hollywood Boulevard toward the Chinese Theatre up to the mall area. Something so Hollywood, so California, so LA, you just have to go. One criticism-some of them are SO very dirty (gum, tar and general shmutz). The city should either find the money to clean them regularly or start an ""Adopt a Star"" program. A real must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angela3950
50,Hollywood walk of fame should not be missed. History of films under your feet.,"I lived in Hollywood for four years and it was quite a place. a bit nutty at times but go see the homes of the stars,if a studio is open for tours go as they are going away and becoming houses in their place. Too bad. Go to Muesso and Franks on Hollywood Blvd. good food,old fashionedbest wait staff ever. walk of fame is great and not to be missed.everyone you know from the movies is shown here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barryn680

40,A day among the stars!,"The Walk of Fame, and finding my favorite star was fun! Try to go on a Sunday morning the area is less crowded. Otherwise, with so many people; street characters, and vendors walking around you may get run over trying to take pictures! The area is upbeat, and appears safe during the day. The Dolby Mall?? is also an excellent place to eat, and shop. Have fun, but be careful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelbtravelin99
50,A little bit of fun,"My mother, sister and I took a 9 long hour drive just to see what this strip is all about. It was a fun and quick place to see. We took some pictures walking on it. We also took a tour around the area and saw a bunch of houses where famous people supposedly live. The tour took about two hours. We also visited China Town and before you knew it, it was already dark and time to go. It was an over all good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahannlees
40,Take a walk among the stars!,"It is really fun to walk along the Walk of Fame and read the names on all those stars. I liked how there was a symbol on each one, like a movie camera for actors, a phonograph for musicians, etc. Definitely worth a walk along all those stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sailorgirl461
50,great to see,"fun trying to find all your favourite stars. Watch outvfor free CD, they will pester you for money once you take their cd. The athmoshere here is great, you can spend hours enjoying watching people finding their favourite star",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbertA1948
30,Hmmm not so special without the celebrities,"Maybe when actual celebs are present and their stars are unveiled it could be worth a look see. Rest of the time give it a miss or check it out on google so that you don't have to experience another yucky, dirty street in LA. Now here's a thought move it to a nicer part of the US , anywhere but LA please.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Birt1964

50,Memory lane at its finest.,"Amazing how much history is on these grounds. Don't forget that this area is not glitzy due to the space it is in. Narrow street with old style surroundings, but to be a star on here one has to have a lot of accomplishments to get here, and that alone is beautiful. There is a website that tells the magnificent hardship these ""Stars"" had to go through in order to be here. It is worth the reading. It also has free event information as well. Anyone who is near this place needs to see it just because of the historic value. Don't let the area discourage you. Walk on the street and see for yourself what is on the ground. You will indeed be thrilled when you recognize the name of someone you enjoyed entertaining you for many years. So ... Here is that official website. WalkOfFame.com. Read it and then come visit this site. I brought my kids here a long time ago and they learned a lot of details back then about this place. Now, so many more stars added and yet the walk on these streets never seems too old or outdated. Expect nothing and you will receive a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeataBallo

30,Average,Not very fascinating to be honest. It's just a spot one wants to say they have been at. Isn't very well kept. Not very clean either - had stains and dirt. Could be kept better given its a tourist attraction,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/711sadias
30,Disappointing but cross it off your list...,"It looks much more glamorous in the movies. Everyone is disappointed when they see the walk and the seedy tourist trap shops lining the sidewalk next to them BUT if you are in LA, you should probably see them once just to walk over them and see how many names you recognize.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culinary-widow
50,You Gotta Visit This Landmark,"Being a native of Los Angeles, I spent a lot of time in Hollywood and around the the city in my teens and early twenties.It was quiet, filled with tourist and alright to visit. We always took with out of town guests. Now I let my guests use my car and they go on their own. I had not been to th Walk of Fame and vicinity in many years. Two weekends ago I took my 13 year old grand daughter to see Tomorrowland at a Disney theater on Hollywood Blvd. which houses the Walk of Fame and it was WILD! There were so many people. The "" street performers "" are all over the place. Some are good some ridiculous. Crowded cannot describe how many people were there. There are now numerous eateries, shops and sights to see. The stars on the walkway almost get lost. Although it is crowded, crazy, and loud, you cannot visit L.A. with going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1gr8dancer
10,Tourists Beware!,"When rude people like Melissa McCarthy can buy their own star on the Walk of Fame, you know the shark has been jumped. I've personally seen McCarthy snap at fans and get extras fired from one of her movies. A Non-Union extra, I might add, that McCarthy's production had taken great pains to film their dismal project out of state just so they could hire locals on the cheap! Nit-picking aside, you risk becoming a crime stat due to all the crackheads dressed up as ""superheroes"" who will stab you if you don't pay them to take a photo with you. Hollywood & Vine is not a nice area, so certainly don't be caught there after dark. Stop by any Walgreens or CVS to pick up your cheap trinkets for the kids back home and save a few $ while you're at it. Trust me on this one, folks... TOURIST BEWARE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/egtact
20,Not worth the time,"Maybe it's because I'm a local, but I just don't see the point of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It's just names on stars embedded in the sidewalk! Overall I find Hollywood overcrowded and dingy. There are WAY better places to visit in LA if you are from out of town. It's one thing to see them as you walk towards a show at The Pantages etc but definitely not something to make a day out of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMT504
50,Bit of fun trying to find your favorite stars,"The walk of fame cant be missed if your in Hollywood, finding the names of your favorite stars and getting a quick photo with their star is great fun. There are also some great shops around the walk of fame. I wouldn't go to far from the main area around the Chinese theater though as the area deteriorates quite quickly. A word of warning there place is full of scammers and if you talk to anyone or get a photo with anyone in costumes they will expect you to pay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bernardg747

50,Famous all over the world and simply amazing to walk,"This iconic symbol of Hollywood is amazing to see. It gathers tourist from all places speaking all languages but with one common interest... who the heck are these people? Some you will know because of their fame, but others are still a mystery to me. But you simply have to come and check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDwalkerSOCAL
30,Star-struck Foolery...,"This is a place you only need to visit one time. If you like the traffic, congestion, pollution, and the stench of dried urine, you are in the right place. There are no stars in Hollywood, but there are lots of cheap gifts to lavish your friends with. Tell them what a great place it was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/355dhl
50,Always A Treat For Hollywood Tourists,Walk down this street to see how many names you recognize or remember! Take a picture with your favorites! Never gets old!

50,A must for film buffs,"The Walk of Fame on Hollywood Blvd spans the sidewalk from La Brea Ave to Vine Street. Paving stones dedicated to stars continue up and down Vine St,as far Sunset, and dotted about elsewhere. For Radio and Film buffs this is heaven as you discover the long forgotten stars of the Silent Screen and Early Radio. There is a lost of Hollywood history on this part of the boulevard, Pantages Theatre being the most notable",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310GeorgeH
30,Way too crowded,"The walk of fame is not a great place but it's worth a visit because of its popularity . What was was my impression it was that : it doesn't reflect the perception . It has deteriorated and has become too commercialised to the extend that you see homeless people and all kind cheap shops in a not clean streets . Few companies offer a helicopter or bus tours in the area . The only very good think in the boulevard was a Mexican restaurant ,rated one of the top 10 in LA by a local newspaper , and it was worth .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/209melinab

10,Bad,"We went to California last summer and wanted to go to Hollywood , for what it was it was cool to see all the sights but that place was gross everyone is dressed up and tells you to take a pic with them then demands you give them cash or people are trying to sell you CDs that you don't want",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carnage720
10,I wouldn't want my star there,"It is dirty and they have so many people trying to hock stuff that it makes it uncomfortable to walk ,so if I were a star I wouldn't want a bunch of people walking and what looked like urination, and garbage on my starYou can see that they are trying to gentrifi the place,but they should have started years agoDon't waste your time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizandme
40,"It's a ""must see"" that's very easy to do","The old Grauman theater is a Hollywood Icon, and from there the Walk of Fame stretches for quite a distance. I'm not sure why it's so enjoyable, but it is. You search out the stars (and foot-hand prints) of stars (some of the oldies you've not heard of), stop in at the $10 souvenir store (EVERYTHING TODAY is just $5!), pay a buck to Edward Scissorhands, Transformer, Jack Sparrow, etc. to get your photo with them...it's all good fun and a great way to spend an hour or so. We've taken a theater tour, seen a film there, and have made a pop decision to join a Hollywood bus tour on the spot... and have not regretted a minute of it. It's close to other points of interest, so you can easily spend more than an hour in the neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sleepycat69
50,A must do in Hollywood,"If you do not go here you will be haunted by ""didn't you go and see the stars.,"" so just go! It's cool to see the names of all your fabourite entertainers and Hollywood legends and take some photos. The stars go on for ages and it's busy, especially outside the TCL Chinese Theatre. Street performers line the walk and there are people to get photos with. It's one of those things that you have to do if in Hollywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lwhittaker1
30,Good to check out,"Hollywood Blvd is one of those things you should check out if you haven't done it before. I enjoyed walking along the street looking at the stars and visiting the shops.This place would be a lot better if you didn't have as many people dressed up wanting you to include them in your photos and asking for a tip (fee) afterwards, or the people handing you a signed copy of a CD saying it's free but you still need to tip them. Most of them hang out in front of the Chinese Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C5824GPjasons
30,Go there if you want. But that's just about it - Traveled February 2014,"Too crowded. But a nice feeling though, just for the sake of being there. Go there if you want. But that's just about it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanachuchayh
20,What a grubby street,"We went into Holywood early on a Sunday morning to have a wander around before the crowds. We particularly wanted to see the Walk of Fame with all the stars on the pavements. The streets were dirty and needed a good clean. There was the ambient smell of urine around, and sadly what should have been a great experience was sadly let down by the grubby appearance of everything. The paw and hoof prints of some of the stars outside the Chinese Theatre were also in need of a good clean up. By about midday the place was heaving with tourists and people plying their trades and dressed up as famous actors hoping you would pay to have photos taken with them. This added to the general congestion of the place. Sharp exit left to the car park and a fast ride out of there. If you do wish to visit the best advice is to get in early before the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Al-Shumba
40,You have to at least see it,"Although a bit carney it still is something you should take the time to see - I could not believe the amount of people dressed up as movie stars or characters.Pretty cool seeing them names of all the stars, directors and musicians - take the time to at least walk the area and while you are there visit 25 degrees for a hamburger at the Roosevelt hotel - you won't be disappointed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CIAOMARYEH
40,Walk of Fame - not to be missed,"The Walk of Fame is great to wander along, looking at the stars. Most could use a good wash, but that would be a hard job with 24/7 activity going on. The harrassment from tour guides wanting to take us to ""Ellens place"" to party was a bit annoying, as were the CD sellers trying to promote themselves. Still, once you block them out and concentrate on the stars, it's a fantastic walk down memory lane.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganb530
40,How do you rate the walk of fame!!!,"So much fun! Just being there looking at the stars on the walk and then their hand and footprints...so cool. A lot of hype of course goes with it, but why woul you NOT want to go there if you're in LA?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramonar531
40,Visit here at least once!,"Love it, hate it, or something in between, Everyone who visits Los Angeles should stroll along the Hollywood Walk of Fame at least once!Tips:1. Do a little homework beforehand and locate the street addresses of those sidewalk Stars you want to see. Pick up a Free Official Hollywood Walk of Fame brochure at Hollywood & Highland visitor's center and make your plans. You can also find the locations of sidewalk Stars by searching for them on Google. Plan accordingly.2. Wear comfortable shoes and bring water. Keep in mind that there are literally thousands of stars covering a 3 mile area. Pace yourself.3. Go early in the morning to avoid crowds and shadows in your photographs.4. If you become tired of looking at all the sidewalk Stars [at some point they all begin to look alike], take a break and enjoy watching everyone else having fun. There are also costumed characters near TCL willing to pose [for a ""fee""] in your photos or you can stand back and watch them from afar.5. As stated in other reviews, there are people soliciting your financial support for their CDs. A polite ""No"" is all that is needed to avoid any transaction.Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/46Lil
30,One and done,"Have been to LA before, but never got to the walk of fame or Grauman's Chinese theater. It's a really seedy area. It was nice to see all the stars on the sidewalk and the hand/footprints, but do not need to go back to that particular area of Hollywood and Highland again(except to see Jimmy Kimmel).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lolabridgada
40,Not as glamorous as expected.,"The Walk of Fame has been poorly maintained, both the walk itself and the neighborhood. The theater side of the street (Hollywood Boulevard) is doing OK, but just across the street the shops and businesses are old and disheveled. Clearly all about the money and not the glamour. The walk itself needs repairs that have clearly been neglected for a while.Still, it is The Walk of Fame. Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheriff88
40,Yeah!!,Ok! You go and keep walking but you don't know if you should read every name on the stars or focus on where you are walking so you don't get hit on your shoulders by someone walking against your side!! :$,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mohammed_88
50,Great to see!,"The Hollywood Walk Of Fame is great to see. It can be extremely busy, so it's best to visit early morning. Disneys soda fountain is a great place to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scottishcouple16
40,lots of stars,"My favourite stars were Motley Crue and The Doors. Jay Leno's was up their, too. Some parts of the sidewalk need repairing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidson168
50,Very fun,"What's better than seeing names on stars and remembering old movies, songs, TV shows. The constant tour guides wanting you to go on their tour can get annoying but everyone is trying to make a living. Many picture opportunities and La La Land has great souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uki_guy
10,Awful place,This place is so busy and it's not even good looking...of course it is a famous place and so it is a must to at least jump out of the car and take a picture but personally I would never go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/677marketav
30,Not one of the best attractions near the Los Angeles area,"It is very exciting to see such a popular tourist attraction near the Los Angeles area in California, but this famous attraction could be a lot better. Walking around Times Square in NYC was so much better than walking around Hollywood Boulevard and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Someone should really take care of how dirty the streets are and the poor people sleeping on the streets. Driving to the Hollywood sign view is a must and there are no GPS directions to get there. Overall okay experience just to say that we have been to Hollywood, CA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlac326
50,Lots of stars to see on the floor,"there are a lot of people dressed up on the strip, be prepared to pay a tip if you want a photo taken with any of them. There are also a lot of people selling copies of their music on the strip, don't be fooled into thinking they are giving them to you. Best to say no if you don't want to get caught up in it all. There are also lots of companies that do the hollywood tours make sure you get an open one to maximise your viewing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebBurne
40,3.5 stars,"I think it's one of those places to go to but the ""celebrities"" or ""superheroes"" you see; some are really bad. We've seen better people dressed up at the London Comic Con and I'm sure the main Comic con in the U.S would surpass that. My point is, not worth taking your photo with them. You can compare the different Spiderman's as there were about 3 each time we happened to walk past on a different day and since you can compare them they looked so bad together.The walk itself is nice and the celebrities who have their prints at the Chinese theatre was interesting.You can get a nice view of the Hollywood Sign when you go between the Metro station and the Dolby Theatre. Walk to the back and walk up the stairs. You see the elephant statue which is high up and when you get to the right place you'll see the sign.This place can be done in an hour maybe two unless you plan on going to any of the museums etc. Depends on how many celebrity names you want to spot on the walk of fame. We weren't too bothered about stopping and looking and just walked and glanced quickly instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meeshlee
50,Stars Stars everywhere. is a Star,"This is one of the must see places in California to see . If you miss one of the best place to be at then you was not in California, we all nee to see this place and who knows. You might run into a Star of your own. So much to see and to do one of many places i enjoyed. Seeing. Have FUN",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neicey217
40,Walk of Stars !!,So many stars to see not to mention the places for souvenirs. We had a wonderful time. You can spend the whole day and still not see every thing that's offered!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valeriemb852
40,Up one side & down the other,"I have seen the ""Hollywood Walk of Fame"" on TV all my life! What a great experience to finally see it for myself. I walked up one side & down the other. Take the time to enjoy the vibe & be in the moment. You can easily be in this location for several hours just reading the names, browsing in the shops, sitting in the restaurants and watching the fabulous street entertainment. There is so much going on that you can see & do. The street entertainment is wonderful & free so take the time to stop & watch it. Some of the street entertainment was so popular that you ended up having to walk on the road to get around the crowds of people. Also in some instances it was very noisy/loud but that's all about being in this popular world famous location. Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leannamarie63
30,Overrated,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is not a glamorous as it seems. The streets where the stars are are very crowded, normal for a big city. But the dirty streets and the fast-moving crowds impede one from stopping and enjoying the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abigailt563
30,Interesting,"While the walk of fame is definitely something that everyone should see at least once in their life, I'm disappointed in the condition of some of the older stars and the stars that are in a more heavy foot traffic area. It was wonderful to see stars of some that have been long forgotten!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurieP441
30,Lots almost to much to see,"The stars were everywhere, we did not set out to find any specific one but I thought there would be more emphasis on the cool ones, they were all kind of random out there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeyhuppert
20,Waste of Time,"The stars used to be given to really big stars but now a days, it seems anyone can get a star. This attraction is a total waste of time. Use your time here to frequent another attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R9730WAdanielh
20,Too many to count,We spent quite a long time walking up and down looking for people that we admire and respect both past and present. There are far more stars on the pavement than we had ever imagined and it was quite good fun searching even though there were dozens of people doing exactly the same. A great way to spend anhour or so ..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peter_x_godden
40,Not to be missed.,Seen and heard about this place all my life. What a fun walk to remember all the stars of today and yesterday. Too many t-shirt shops but you don't have to go in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/625garyc
50,Nice piece of history and movie magic.,"It was really fun to see all of the names. What a nice piece of Hollywood history. I wanted to walk around and see more, but time restraints kept me from it.I definitely want to go back with the family!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacation_Commander
40,Fun and exciting,"Just dropped by before going back home too short, coming back soon for the tour! Very good breakfast at the diner! Kids got overwhelmed! Went to the hollywood farmer's market too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjello98
20,"Dirty, scrufy place","was dirty, unkept and not what I was expecting. There's homeless people all over Hollywood and It felt really uneasy at night, not a place to take young families. People dressed up trying to sell you stuff you don't want and force CD's on you or get pictures with dressed up superhero's then charge you for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommytucker01
30,Tourist trap but worth a visit,I visited the walk of fame in May. It was busy with tourists buses and picture takers. It is worth going but realize that it will be crowded. Parking was easy to get on Hollywood and Highland. Turn down Orange drive to find this parking. You just have to buy something and they validate you for 2 hours.The walk is good for taking some pictures of stars. The Chinese theatre was interesting as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baldgiraffe
50,great fun,We enjoyed our time here all the characters dressed up was great fun. We enjoyed some shopping here also.It was fascinating seeing the Chinese theater and hand prints and footprints.We also had great fun looking at the stars picking out ones we knew we only got to see a small section of them as there is hundreds and would be lucky if you managed to see the all in one day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlisonC621
30,Nice to tick off,"Well.. there is not much to see, but if you are stuck at LAX for few hours and have nothing to do, I think it is worth visiting this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WNiroshan
50,Always a nice place to visit.,"The only thing I do not liked, to many people walking on the place and not easy to see all the stars and other details.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albertm10
30,Too Darn Busy,"If you really want to enjoy a nice stroll along the walk of fame looking at all the names and getting a few photos of your favorite stars, think again.It is busy all the time! And if you think you are going to get an unobstructed picture of any of the big names, then you better pack your lunch. You will be waiting a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2298YTpaulh
40,tourist hangout,"Guess no visit to LA can be complete without a visit to this part of town. Don't expect a glitzy sidewalk though; in fact it is pretty ordinary and usually overrun with tourists. If you don't set your expectations too high, then you can enjoy walking down the street watching the sights- the dolby theater, the Chinese theater or the wax museum as well as all the street artistes in their garish costumes. You can also amuse yourself looking for your favorite stars or identifying the names on the others",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HaKG
50,Great evening!,Drove to hollywood for a day trip before driving back home to san diego. Went for a 2 block walk then went on a tour around beverly hills. It was great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MzMaryG
50,Fabulous Hollywood!,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a great way to spend the day. You can also visit Mann's Chinese Theater and see all the famous hand and foot prints. Lots of places to shop and eat and you can catch a great view of the famous Hollywood sign too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N4624VIjohns
20,See the stars and crowds,A definite stop on your tour of the city but be aware of the level of crowds your going to encounter. Lots of people walking and sometimes difficult if you want to snap a picture of a star. The street costume performers are fun if you want to take a picture with them and several shops sell cheesy souvenirs on the cheap so it's a great place to pick up a load of stuff for family/friends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/191joshg
50,Must see!!,"I stayed not far from the walk of fame and it is a must see when in LA! We walked from one side to the other and so many stars to see when here, from Michael Jackson to robin williams. It is a great attraction and you can do it while just walking down the street. It becomes very busy to take photographs because it is on the Main Street in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayleighh2013
50,Wow,"A must visit place, always filled up in the evening. I personally took 3 trips to see each and every star. Madam tousad museum is nearby. Batman superman Michael jackson and all other stars and superheros are always ready for a photograph with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/939akibs
30,Shorter walk than I thought,"It was only a short walk from my hotel to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I followed the stars looking for favourites, ducking and diving round others doing the same, trying to keep out of thier photos. I was there when BB King passed away, it was lovely to see that a tribute was put up at his star as a show of respect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lois233
30,Tourist trap that you HAVE to go to,"It would be like going to NYC without a visit to Times Square.Very touristy with expensive over priced souvenir shops. It's best to go with a tour guide so you can get the full information on the sights. Beware of those people dressed in costume. They expect a big tip ($20) if you take a picture with them. There have been several incidents of tourists being beaten up by angry characters who didn't get a tip ! Be careful ! And watch your pockets ! There is not a strong enough police presense for my comfort level , and I am from the NY area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jontomsam
30,find your hero !!!,"not much to do here....just a pavement with stars and names printed on .....the nicest thing is the weird people standing all day between chinese theater and hollywood and highland center. All souvenirs shops sell the same old stuff made in china, overpriced...no matter the get 5 pay half policy. Sometimes you come across movie stars walking their dogs around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/filippog816
30,Interesting,"We went through the area a number of times, and it was always different. Sometimes it was totally deserted, and yet other times it was a seething mass of humanity and rip off artists dressed up in costumes trying to get you to give them $5 for a photo. I turned my back on my son for 2 seconds and when I turned back some dude was trying to make him buy his free Rap CD. Once I finished giving the my new best friend his CD back we decided that we had had enough, and departed.We did get to stand on Steven Spielberg's star, which was very exciting, but I still haven't figured out what the whole point is. It was a lot like Times Square. Only not as good. But it did have a lot of shops selling bondage gear. THAT a was big contributor to our family vacation...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elwood_Seattle

20,Not for families,The stars are nice and interesting to see all the celebrity impersonators but the stores along the walk of fame are really atrocious. many shops for romance paraphernalia and these are all visible from the streets! I just can't believe that walking through a supposed tourist place I had to subject my grandchildren to the sight of countless mannequins wearing s&m costumes and toys.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosec551
20,Tacky and over-rated,"I returned to this district of LA after 25years. It was worse than I remember, with 2nd rate individuals harassing and intimidating us for 'free' records or money for photos. I wouldn't ever return",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lino144
50,Fun and Nostalgic,Our teenage boys loved this - spotting all the famous names they know and did not know. It has become quite touristy but checking out the stars was fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/624karenr
30,Very Interesting Historic Site on Famous Hollywood Blvd.,"The brass/bronze STARS imbedded in the charcoal and pink terrazzo is pretty impressive, going back many, many decades.There is an upscale, glitzy mall and Ghirardelli Ice Cream Parlor on Hollywood Blvd where the Walk is, but yes there are bums sleeping in quite a few doorways similar to what Times Square was like 30 years or 40 years ago.And yes, many of the storefronts are seedy shops selling tacky souvenirs. I was warned about this and was not really surprised except for the NUMBER of homeless in the area. The city should really move these people to shelters to give tourists some room. You don't really want young kids/teenagers seeing this (or even me!)Putting the Pluses and Minuses together, I came up with an AVERAGE rating. If they got rid of the bums (and couples) in sleeping bags and blankets, as well as cutting down on the tacky shops, I would definitely boost the Walk of Fame up a notch or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Domino1969
40,Fun and historical,"Walked on vine and Hollywood while in town for concert. Fun to see Judy Garland and other memorable stars. Always wanted to do it, glad we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HikingHonu
20,Unimpressed,"What an utter disappointment! We expected something glitzy and upscale. Instead, what we found was like Times Square was 20 years ago, only 10 times worse. This stretch of Hollywood Blvd. is grungy, lined with seedy storefronts selling tacky souvenirs, and dotted with hawkers trying to sell cheesy tours. The stars in the sidewalk are totally unimpressive. I expected more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwg51357

30,Needs a clean up!,"Big disappointment here. This area has become really run down and seedy. What a shame for a memorial to the people who entertained us on film, tv and music over the many years to become so grotty. Get your act together city of Hollywood and make this a beautiful site to visit. On the positive side the buskers can be entertaining along the Boulevard and fun so see how many of the stars on the walk you recognise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Perizada
40,Fun spot to visit,"Seeing hollywood is great and the walk of fame is a great way to top it off. For me the main attraction wasn't the names on the ground but just the atmosphere when visiting at night, i found it be much more lively, as there are street preformers and celebrity look alikes roaming the streets. There were also people dressed in cartoon character outfits that you or the kids can snap a pic with. Music, dancing, bright lights and people everywhich way you turn. For me it was a very fun experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/232terellr
30,If you dont mind a very busy street,Everyone knows the walk of fame and i am sure everyone wants to see it in LA. We were a little disappointed. The street was very crowded with locals and very dirty. It was nothing like the way it was always portraid on TV. It is very long so if you are trying to find a certain star by any chance do look up the location first,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/No0osho

40,A Must See if you visit Hollywood,Although it is a tourist trap and you will be stopped by countless characters to take your picture the walk of fame is history you cannot find. The cement handprints of old and new hollywood stars is worth wading through the crowds. We have done it many times now but we always find a new star on the walk and hand and footprints we missed before. You just have to do it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryK126
50,Stars,"Great place to stop by if you are planning on visiting Los Angeles. It's free, and it's exciting to read the names of some of the people you have looked up to your entire life.

30,I actually enjoyed it.,"Let me start by saying I am not a big fan of L.A., or of movies for that matter. But I certainly enjoyed seeing the names of some of the people I grew up watching, and even found the star of my 3rd cousin, Cary Grant. (not his real name) And while I somehow pictured the corner of Hollywood and Vine being in a nicer neighborhood, it was fun reliving the past for a while sprinkled with a little of the present. And my younger wife enjoyed seeing the stars of the not-so-distant past that she is more familiar with. It is nice stroll down memory lane for those of us in the twilight of our lives.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinwcollier

You never know what you will run into on the Walk of Fame!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trvl4theluvofit
30,Looks can be deceiving,"It seems glamorous but Hollywood Blvd is kinda on the dingy side. There's so much to see and tons of traffic. Some sketchy people too. Can be very unpredictable. Whilst attempting to cross the street, there was a police chase. The perp was crossing the street opposite of us and the cop stopped in the middle of the street and pulled his gun. I grabbed my kids and ducked behind a tree. It's cool to see the stars but I wouldn't make a trip around it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H2833KAsaraa
40,Even You Can Buy a Star Here,"I enjoy the Walk of Fame. I enjoy most things Hollywood. I can't imagine coming across the world to see the Walk of Fame, though. You won't see many Americans on the Walk of Fame. The ones you will see are possibly mentally ill, homeless, dangerous, on drugs, and/or hooking. It is a filthy street, reeking of urine, with a possible palpable menace in the air. Most of the local color won't harass you though. Leave that to the Scientologists who are buying up every building in town. They harass you everywhere you go. You are savvy travellers, so you know how to deal with them. All in all, you can walk the walk in about an hour, coming and going, working both sides of the streets. Just keep an eye on your wallet or purse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bSirius
50,Walk the Walk of Fame,"If you are planning on a trip to Los Angeles, California make sure you check out all the stars on Hollywood Blvd. They have totally renovated the area and you will enjoy the history of Hollywood as you stroll down the street and find your favorite entertainers star. Also, have a bite to eat at the Roosevelt Hotel coffee shop with all its rich movie history. It is right across the street from Grumman's Chinese Theater and the Hollywood Wax Museum. There is so much to see and do that will impress your friends back home when they see how much fun you had among the Stars of Hollywood! Next time you watch the Academy Awards or other film premiers taking place on TV, you can say ""I know that place!!! I was there too"". Be your own celebrity back home as you show them all the fun you had on Hollywoods Walk of Fame!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamR800

20,Smelly,Smells like pee. It's ok for your first time but put some Vic's vapo rub under you nose! It smells horrible from all the homeless people peeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaR818
40,In other's footsteps :),"One hears so much when it's Hollywood that being there outside Dolby Studios and the Chinese Theater was like a dream come true. Amid milling tourists posing for pictures on the Walk of Fame, were Mickey and Minnie, Spiderman, Elvis Presley and other fictional characters. A great experience, especially when the sun shines",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/500sudiptab
40,Walk of Fame,"I live in the area, so I walk the Hollywood Walk of Fame quite often. Besides the stars on the sidewalk there are a lot of ""characters"" that are dressed up as well as homeless people and bums. The dressed up ""characters"" expect you to pay them money if you take their picture. Just be careful and watch your wallet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jet7777
40,Walk the Walk,"If in Hollywood.... A must see I suppose, anyone who is or was anyone in Hollywood has a star, some of them long forgotten others whose fame was fleeting, others you haven't heard of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clembo1957
30,Worth a look,"it's worth a look and doesn't take long to see, I was expecting something more grand and well kept but it's generally pretty grubby. Lots of steet sellers and people trying to give away 'free cd's'! Just don't take one as they will expect a tip for the cd!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pppmacca43
20,Initially interesting then the homeless and hustlers ruin it.,"For a very short time seeing the stars names in the sidewalk was fun. Then you realize you're surrounded by homeless people, street hustlers and religious zealots that ruin it. Don't get me wrong, there are a few neat places to see and visit here but why in the world they don't do something about these people in the middle of their tourist area is beyond me. Sad costumed street people hustling for money for a picture with a very poor rendition of a super hero or famous star. Dirty, faded costumes and even an overweight Superman or Spiderman can be found here. Some of these people are downright creepy. Some are just plain crazy. This is one of those places you can say been there, done that and never need to go to again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coastermeister
40,Must do when you visit LA,Definitely something you need to do while in LA. The walk of fame is in Hollywood and the road is lined with shops and restaurants. Great place to spend time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rajeshkk
40,Iconic Hollywood,Think Hollywood and the stars on the walk of fame as representative of everything we see on TV. There is just so much to see with photo opportunities galore. Heaps of small well priced shops selling souvenirs etc and lots of places to grab a bite to eat. It's fun looking at each of the stars to see how many names are instantly recognisable.Be careful about the movie 'characters' that are standing around offering photo opportunities as everything comes at a price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/739careym
40,Walk a life of Lifes,"I am not a movie buff so my reviews might not be enchanting nor would it reflect the excitement an average reader might expect. But surely I love travelling and I am so happy I could walk on the fame tablets. I did notice a couple of them , the most celebrated and strikingly crowded was...any guesses..tada..MJ the magic. Yes there were flowers and prayer placards at his tablet.Worth the walk. Please choose odd hours so you can escape the ebbing crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yoosafinpace
30,Worth a short visit,We visited on a Saturday afternoon which ended up being fairly busy. This meant there were a lot of tourists and security/police which was reassuring with the amount of people in the street trying to sell products and services.There were not too many people on the street to stop us from taking photos of the stars so was pleased that we could get some shots.Visit the Disney Store to get a Ghirardelli treat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/munchkin1150
20,Say you've been there at least.,"I knew that the Walk of Fame had issues, but I went anyway just to say I've been. You should probably do the same. In fact, just drive by it unless you like five hundred screaming homeless people running around you. The Walk is also much smaller than one would expect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/65mattm
40,Walk of fame is a bucket list item isn't it?,"It's busy. It's touristy. It's hollywoods must visit location. U will see where the stars come to celebrate their movies, and their success. I even saw a star get their star when I was there. U never know what will be going on!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agibbins
20,Like Times Square only less cool,"I had read reviews that the Walk of Fame was a giant tourist trap but was worth at least driving by. Those reviews were right.First off, the pictures make the walk of fame look like it is made of marble or some sort of fancy stone - its not. The walk itself is made of a rubbery material (which actually feels good to walk on).Second, the walk goes through a very sketchy and rough section of Hollywood Blvd. We were there in the middle of the day on a Saturday and saw some guys on the street get into a fight that had to be broken up by the police. In front of the Dolby Theater is best seen on Oscar night on TV.Third, the actual street is very very crowded with people taking pictures and videos. The street is also lined with people in character costumes and people trying to get you to go on bus tours. My rule is generally to stay away from places are near a ""Madam Tussaud's"" and a ""Ripley's Believe it or Not"" (both of which are along the Walk of Fame) because they are generally terrible places with lots of tourists and the typical baggage that comes along with tourist traps.Lastly, we parallel parked on Sunset and walked the two blocks to Hollywood to see the Walk to try to avoid crowds and high parking prices. We were at the walk for an hour and that was all I'll need in this lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikeyt90
40,Gotta see it if you haven't,"We stayed on Hollywood blvd. Took lots of photos. While we were here on vacation they were pouring Melissa McCarthy's star. It was pretty cool. We'll still be here for official dedication on Tuesday. Also was here to pay tribute to B.B. Kings star during his recent passing. Be prepared for lots of tourists, vendors, rappers selling CDs, and folks dressed as famous stars. REMEMBER -don't take anything handed to you, pose, or give your name, otherwise you probably just bought something, like an autographed rappers cd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricovaldez
10,Avoid,"This was such a letdown. Pretty run down area and constant aggressive hassling from street sellers trying to market their sightseeing tours. As a young woman, I was made seriously uneasy by a man holding me by the arm and repeatedly shouting in my face ""buy my cd. 10 dollars. You not like black guys? I'll call you out as racist, buy my cd"". It was honestly awful. Some were polite but many just wouldn't take no for an answer. Go elsewhere! A walk up to the griffith observatory for views of LA and the hollywood sign is far more enjoyable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rockadelick88
40,A block of stars,"I have heard it would take around 2hrs to walk the whole block, I only walk a section, it is interesting a bit grubby, and quite a few touts selling tours, or wanting to show you tricks or have a photo taken, it is quite funny watching them work, quite a few homeless, but it would be fun if you were looking for a few stars, there are some nice shops/buildings ect. It is the best area to catch the hop on hop off buses and loads of other tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belinda1203
20,Your time can be better spent elsewhere,"If you're walking in the area it is fun to identity the names. However, it isn't really much better than reading a list of names on a web page.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alan304
40,Cleaned up and looking quite good!,I tired going here 6 years ago. The area in front of Gruman's was OK but the whole neighborhood was fairly quiet with a lot of empty storefronts. It has since been cleaned up and businesses are opening left and right. The far more festive atmosphere bring back dignity and awe at the names inscribed on the sidewalks. Definitely worth the time to take your picture near your favorite celebrity's star.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kuvakas
30,OK,It's one of those places you have to visit but I have to say it was slightly disappointing. We were stopped by dozens of guides trying to persuade us to go on guided tours as we walked along the street which became very annoying. All in all I think there are better things to see in LA ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaiofherts
40,Was fun to find all the Stars for famous people,I think it's 3 or 4 blocks of stars placed randomly. The more famous ones are in front of the Chinese Theatre and Dolbe Theatre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smity11
30,So many Chinese tourists. Not even exaggerating :(,Really not much to see. I would argue the number of Chinese tourists surrounding the stars of Jackie Chan and Jet Li and Bruce Li are more an attraction that the Hollywood Walk itself. It's quite laughable!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/genesisinvain
30,Has much more potential,"As somebody visiting California, I wanted to do this at least once. It's really different from how I imagined it, and it was a bit of a let down to be honest; the movies really sensationalize how amazing it is. While I enjoyed the walk moderately, I only did it to cross it off my list. The sidewalks and most of the buildings looked horrible and did not complement the Walk of Fame at all. Considering how this brings in so many tourism dollars, you'd think the government would maintain it a little better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415tylerm
40,Worth seeing......,"This is once in a lifetime attrection,surreal looking @ your favorite stars,you have seen in the movies etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gina483
50,"Memories in a differenet ""Memory Lane""","There are a lot of 'fun' things to do in Southern California, but strolling down Hollywood Boulevard and looking down to the names of the famous, brings back memories and stories. Doris Day - I remember my favorite show ..., Danny Thomas - he used to be so funny when ... this is truly some great entertainment at NO COST.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Staywme
30,A nice walk,"Although it is interesting to see whose names have made the Walk, I could think of better ways to spend my time. The best part of the walk for me was the Chinese Theater where some of the greats have foot and hand prints in concrete.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drjas1958
30,Fun for a While,"We walked up and down the walk of fame and looked at the stars and took some photos. Found a nice spot for lunch, see review for Mel's Diner, and that was it. This is one of those tourist must-sees but don't plan to spend a ton of time, in my opinion, there is so much more to see and do. Tip: if there is someone 's star you really want to see then look up location before going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrsms
30,Something you have to do,Something you feel you have to do and probably should. We were last here 11 years ago and returned now our daughter who is now 12 could see and remember LA. She enjoyed it but it is a lot worse than I remember. Crazy angry people everywhere. The area is not really very well maintained and is surrounded by people and souvenir shops trying to make a quick buck including Marilyn Munroe who of course only allows pictures for the obligatory tip. Whatever you want it costs along with the tour reps selling their trips every few steps. Saying that our daughter loved it so worth it to see her have fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngieG169
40,iconic,"its a must-do on your trip to LA. its a little grubbier than you expect and beware the costume characters trying to get photos with you, they can be aggressive-make sure you dont include them in your photos or they will want money. couple of good souvenir shops along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcgirlau
10,"Too crowded and too noisy, too many street sellers","Being in LA one time, you must have seen this - I thought. But it was terribky crowded and noisy. Even halfway the evening a clustering up of people occurred time and over, a lot of noise, many street salesmen (-women) that try to get your attention or some money. Inside the mcDonalds it was relatively quiet, and that almost tells it all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IWNoordergraaf
20,dissapointing,Dont know what i was expecting really but it was a let down. Dirty grubby part of town with loads of tacky tourist stalls. One of those things you have to see but dont expect much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eamo293
40,Stars and Pressed Pennies,"Walked down a good stretch of this today. The area really is run down and is some ways represents the true America, warts and all. The stars are not particularly well kept in parts of the walk. The predominant feature of the strip is the el cheapo shops selling t-shirts (mostly 3 for $9.99) and assorted souvenirs. It hasnt changed much - been there done that on a trip 10 years ago so best avoided for me. But plenty else to look at with Madame Tausauds and Roosevelt Hotel at one end and Capitol Records at the other.For me I got my souvenirs from the Pressed Penny machines (see photos). There were half a dozen places with machines and a nice selection available for 51 cents each.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albywon
30,Just put a Tick,You have seen it on TV but sadly in real life the expectations are not as high. Yes it is great to see our favourite stars but dodging the guys asking you for tours every 10meters (yards) is annoying and BEWARE don't grab anything you are offered e.g. CD's they will hit you up for money. And a lot of the time (from other sources) the CD's are blank. Just say NO Thanks and move on.But that said if you want to find your favourite star download the app(whatever your poison iPhone or Android) and go on the search.Have a look once and then put a tick in the box!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carneyman71
40,Walk with your favourite Stars,"This is as touristy as it gets. Explore the dreamy, unabashed child in you when you spot the ""Stars"" of your favourite stars and go wild clicking their snaps. This is the original, which has since been replicated in many other parts of the world.Who knows whether you will meet Tom Cruise or Travolta or be floored by the roundhouse kicks of Chuck Norris or Jackie Chan or be a part of the whodunnit with Hitchcock.#KeepWalking folks and if you get tired, step into the amazing restaurants on each side. Who knows you might bump into your favourite stars round the corner? I met Mr. Gladiator Crowe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaunakGhosh
40,Another bucket list checkoff,"Enjoyed all of the variety of stars, but had a difficult time viewing them all with the crowd and all of those guys trying to shove stuff in my hands and face. I guess you need to go early in the morning when not so crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellejoycreek
40,It's not what I expected,"Been expecting the Holywood area and the walk of fame like on the movies or TV, but not. It was Ok... Worth to visit just to know how it is...Many interesting place though around the area... But not really amazing...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null
20,"Nothing special ""Dirty""","I grew up in Encino and have never been star crazed. Nonetheless I appreciate the walk of fame and the artists. However, this entire area is dirty and disgusting. Nothing but homeless people littered about threatening tourists and companies trying to scam people for money.If you are visiting I highly recommend finding s local to show you around and not paying a lot if money for nothing. It really is not as amazing as people think. The last time I walked through a homeless person was defacating in public and another was starting a fire.Hollywood has lost a lot of nostalgia. Save your money and just go to Universal Studios or L.A. Live. Hollywood can be done in 10 minutes if you really want to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pokerdan123
10,"Thugs, pickpockets, and drug addicts...","I was hit by a pickpocket today on Hollywood and Highland as I was standing in front of the large complex on Hollywood Blvd. I'm a local Angeleno and I never go to this area of LA because I know how dirty and disgusting this place is. I was attacked from behind with a punch to the middle of my back which I did not see coming. I yelled out due to the pain and my girlfriend was in shock. It happened very fast, because I immediately turned around and the thug was taunting me due to the fact that my wallet was in my front pocket and he didn't get anything. He circled me a couple of times as I looked for a cop in which there were not any in sight. Stay away from this place, it's full of thugs, thieves, and drug addicts. Too dangerous to take a chance when there are so many other safe places to visit in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6th-Street-Cowboy
20,Disappointed,After having seen the Hollywood Walk of Fame portrayed in pics and on TV I had high expectations. Sadly I was disappointed. The streets are run down and dirty. There are homeless people sleeping and hanging out along the boulevard. I don't recommend this at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/286cherieb
40,"Really you want to do this""",I have walked ALL of the streets that hold the stars. It is part of my Business. I study property in Hollywood. So I am a bit jaded. But if there is someone you really want to see then certainly go for it. There are maps you can get that show you where they all are. But if you just want explore then be ready for more that you do not know that you do know. But it can be very very educational if you google the names of the ones you do not know.. and should do that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266jerryp
40,Always worth a visit.,You can't visit LA without going to the Walk of Fame !! On the day we visited Sofia Vegaro was presented with her star...we didn't see her but saw the spanking new star that afternoon. To be honest..this part of Hollywood is pretty grotty and dirty..but you are not there for the hygiene ! Plenty to see...lots of crazy's...If you get your photo taken with someone on the street dressed up as a movie star they will expect payment....with 10+ stars around at any one time it can get expensive.Great souvenirs and plenty of photo opportunities without snapping any of the wannabees !!!A must !!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888jacquelyn
20,Spring Break,"I must say I was disappointed with this location. I found it very dirty and a bit tired. Loads of ""super heroes"" trying to get you to have photos. The stars on the street are good to see. But you just walk along with your head down, probably better as the stores and homeless are not much to look at. Makes you think though !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnS35
30,Lots of homeless,The Hollywood walk of fame was disappointing. Lots of homeless people felt a bit unsafe. Nearly got attacked at an atm. Police need to be seen to be doing more,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349lachland
40,Worth visiting to see all the stars!,"Check out the old Chinese theater and all of the hand and foot prints in the concrete out front! See the stars of the stars in the sidewalk!

Who knows, you might see Mickey or Minne having lunch...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prdx2222
40,Have to see once,"OK this is really tacky but you have to walk it once to see all your favorites. I feel sorry for Annette Bening on whose star people just stand to take a picture with Michael Jackson's star. Curiously, the Ed O'Neill (Dad in Married with Children, now is Modern Family) is right in front of a shoe store. Coincidence? I think not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dandyone
20,Dirty and annoying people on the street,Went to see the walk of fame and we were accosted by people dressed in costume trying to get you to take a picture with them so they could charge you for it. Would like to be able to stroll the walk of fame with out the stress! Surprised this is allowed to take place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Debbie2012
40,Down the Walk of Fame...This is Why Hollywood Feels Glam!!,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame starting right at the intersection from Madame Tussauds up to the Shopping Mall is all about that picture with you walking down the Walk Of Fame! This street is what you must have seen a dozen times other people do it, or watched it on television and for once you had that angst - admit it!! Well at least I will never have it anymore.....I did it!! So must you!The place is overcrowded with look-alikes of every possible Hollywood star or cartoon character and people rushing to take photos. In the conundrum, the real reason why people are there is lost! So take your time and whenever you get the opportunity check out who all have their names inscribed....its quite nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobeDiaries
30,A must for a tourist,"It is a very popular area and a good marketing strategy. Therefore it is a must for the tourists to have a walk there and trying the find the artists, filmmakers, producers etc. names on the floor. Be careful do not hit someone! Moreover some parts of the streets do not fit the ''Hollywood'' perception, there are street sellers everywhere, offering you Hollywood tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iremse

50,Downtown Hollywood CA,"Found all the stars I was looking for. They are downtown Hollywood lots of shops, eating places you might even see a movie star.... It is a very busy area.... Parking is a little high I found it is easier to pay for parking at the LA Tours lot behind the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolynp743
50,What a walk!,We strolled the Hollywood walk of fame with a trepidation and anticipation. To be honest walking here with young kids is stressful. The area attracts ALL SORTSbut in saying that we kept a close eye and we were glad to have the experience over. Last time we were accosted by a cookie monster character. ... This time we were met by lapd police on Special Detail. Hats off to them they were fantastic posing for our photos. To be honest the stars were lost on the kids but the area is a must do for the photo opportunities. Go enjoy and stay safe!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeMayo
30,Kind of trashy area but you have to do it.,It's interesting thing to see it. It's hard to find a place to park the area is past it's prime but the city is trying to change that. There are a lot of bums and Cartoon characters bumming for money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmesaaz
30,Nice but Over rated,"just names on the street, felt it's a bit overrated but you can't go to LA and miss it, you will catch also the theaters and the area about it so overall it's nice",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moh424
30,Must Do One Time,"My husband and I were staying at the W Hollywood Hotel nearby, so we walked along Hollywood Blvd to see the stars on the Walk of Fame. We'd been here once before, about 10 years ago, and I must say that this is one of those sights you need to do once - and only once. It's fun to see the famous stars on the sidewalk but the street is full of kitschy dress up characters and homeless people so it kind of detracts from the enjoyment. The stars go on for a long way so after a while, you've seen enough.Still, it's a famous landmark that is nice to see if you are in the area. It's fun to watch people take photos of their favorite famous person's star. And there are blank ones so you can pretend that yours is ready for your name!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steamboat323
40,Hooray for Hollywood!,"No trip to Los Angeles would be complete without a strut down legendary and infamous Hollywood Boulevard, to see which of your favorite star's star you can spot. The buzz in the air is palpable as you walk shoulder to shoulder with costumed characters (willing to pose with you for a nominal fee), street performers, tourists from all over the world, wannabe actors and harmless thugs and pugs. There are ample restaurants to choose from and what better way to see a first-run blockbuster movie than inside the elegant TCL Chinese Theatre (formerly Mann Chinese Theater), or the beautifully restored El Capitan Theatre. 15 minutes of fame, baby!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wilkinsk2013
30,Interesting,"It was nice to see all the famous names on various streets, including Hollywood Blvd as well as other sider streets. I was disappointed, however, in Hollywood Blvd sidewalks as they were very dirty and smelled of urine. The area has a !arge population of homeless people but I did not feel at risk. There were the various entertainers on the streer especially around the Highland Centre. Nevertheless i enjoyed the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimmieddd
40,Had to be done,The area is pretty grotty and grubby which is hardly a surprise given the footfall over a relatively small area and the number of fast food outlets. - however a trip to LA would not be complete without a visit to Hollywood. The shopping mall offers a great view of the Hollywood sign up on the hill so great for a photo opportunity. I have to say the Chinese Theatre was a little disappointing and the hustle and bustle made it virtually impossible to take any decent photographs. There are lookalikes everywhere and for $2 or so they will willing pose with you. Great fun if you have always fancied getting up close and personal with Jack Sparrow!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sidequeen
40,Fun walk down Hollywood Blvd,"Fun to see all the hand/foot prints of the stars. Great people watching and street performers. Beware of folks handing out ""free"" CDs. Lots of shopping and sight seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattihrn
30,Do it once just to say you did it,"This is one of those things that you are almost obligated to do if you go to Hollywood. This covers A LOT of distance and between the crowds and business doors it is not some place that you just take a leisurely stroll and take in all of the names you are walking over. Think miles of really chaotic city sidewalks and you are trying to inspect the sidewalk. I would suggest that if you are a really big fan of any particular individual or act, look them up on the website before you go and write down where they are located. Trust me, you will thank me for this suggestion! In the end, it really isn't anything overly spectacular but, as I said, it is worth checking out at least a block of it just to be able to say you have been.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akasha3030

40,Another must see...then move on,"There's a lot of excitement here. Many people looking for specific actors, singers...my wife was very happy to see Winnie the Pooh. That alone made the visit worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/226glenns
40,Something to be seen in person,"It's a culture shock, for sure, to be in downtown Hollywood! Lots of weirdos walking around, plenty of people dressed in costume wanting you to take their picture with your kid (for a fee of course), homeless people asking for handouts, tour companies wanting you to take a tour, souvenir shops begging you to come in, as well as tourists from around the world walking around looking at all of the names on the stars. Be sure to go to the big open air plaza where you can get a bite to eat and get a glimpse of the famous HOLLYWOOD sign. Parking is tough, but we found an underground valet company for $10 that led up right in the middle of the strip. Fun experience, but now I'm satisfied and don't need to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabi_kansas
40,Fun during the daytime but too many undesirables,"Our family had a lot of fun spotting and recognizing a lot of the names on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. But there are quite a few undesirables loitering around this area, especially at night. We were very wary of taking our children to this area. It is a shame that such an iconic area is tainted by the beggars, tacky impersonators and hawkers trying to get you to buy their CD's with a ""tip"". Definitely would not go there again at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Verkco
30,Ticked the box,"Ok seen it...ticked the box....Just too commercial for me.Sure, seeing all the names is great , but what else.?Not very clean.So many street sellers and agents that it was almost uncomfortable to walk the walk and try to enjoy the place.If you spend more than 30 minutes here, you are wasting valuable holiday timeNothing to write home about !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F5504UYianw
20,Walk of Shame,"This was a terribly disappointing experience. I was looking forward to the Walk ofFame but aside from the stars themselves the whole area was rundown, dirty and far from inspiring. Almost all of the shops were seedy or tacky. I really expected more from Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParisFifi

20,Very disappointing,"The area is cheap and tacky. There are impersonators trying to take your money for having a photo with them, hawkers trying to get you to buy DVDs, Cds, balloons. Neither the pavement where the stars are or area immediately to front of Chinese theatre where hand and foot prints are were clean. The Chinese Theatre itself had a gaudy poster hanging over its entrance. Valet parking at the Waxworks was $10 for all day which was good value. Restaurants looked cheap. This area was dirty, crowded but then again are you going to do LA and not come here ?! - it's kind of a must see but you don't need long here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillh333
30,Your Walk of Fame,"Yes true, a bit crazy there. Was a bit dirty around there for a major tourist spot.Best go during the day, I would not recommend too late at night. Also true with the wanna be rappers trying to put music cd's in your hand, then wanting money towards it. Friend I know ended up with a blank cd!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agooner5
40,amazing experience,"Get your camera ready and with full battery, because you are going to take hundreds of photos walking around this avenue!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boojua
40,Nice walk,"A nice walk in Hollywood Blvd with all the name of the movie stars on the street around you, a lot of souvenir shops and restaurants around",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Islam_Fathy74
50,Among the stars,It is very much crowded which doesn't help if you want to click some good individual pictures. It is spread across the block so you have to walk across couple of streets to look at all the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GGupta83
20,Was not worht the time or effort,"I was so looking forward to seeing the Hollywood walk of fame. It was so dirty, crowded with hecklers everywhere. Locals trying to get money from you would yell and insult people.Lots of people bumping into you. Did not feel safe at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shsca
30,LOVE THE WALK OF FAME!,"Its crazy busy down there all day! There are so many impersonators. Remember if you want to take a picture with them. Make sure you have tip money! I gave them few dollars and was on my way. Watch out for the ""wanna be rappers"" they will put a music CD in your hand and expect $$. Walk away! We enjoyed taking pictures next to the star names. Just mind your own business and you will have a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Veronica-Adrian
50,Got to visit,Great place to go. Seeing all the stars with famous names is great. With over 3000 there I managed to see the majority of them. Only problem that got to me was people trying to make you buy things from them. The common one was a guy will hand you a CD and say it's free. When you take the cd off him he will then ask for a donation of $10. So just be careful with these people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/844shaunp
50,SO GOOD!!!,"I literally loved walking along and spotting different celebrity's stars and taking photos. It just has this whole sense of showbiz!! It takes ages to walk the whole thing, allow a couple of hours so as to not rush it! There is a lot of hassling from tour guides, lots of souvenier shops, places to eat, etc. We had amazingly yummy pizza along here! Also, got to see a movie premiere one afternoon! HOW COOL!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJ87
50,Great Sight seeing,The place was packed full and had a great experience with friends. Lots of shopping and dining places.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnandBalan
30,so many stars to see,"We walked along Hollywood BLVD for blocks earlier in APR. I just checked Google - there are over 2,500 stars....way too many to see. Took some pictures of our favorites. Many places to eat along the way (small local restaurants), a few chains (McDonald's for example).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonT540
40,Once In a lifetime... Once.,"Everyone who visits Hollywood, or SoCal in general, needs to check out the Walk of Fame. Once is honestly enough. Expect tons of tourist traps, tee shirt shops, walk-in ""clinics"" next door to adult stores and more. Beware of street performers and Elmo, Batman, and Elvis... They want your money after taking photos with them. Don't fall victim to the dumb ""star tours"" or ""star maps"". Just get there super early since parking and traffic is a nightmare. You can go online and research where your favorite star's ""star"" is in the neighborhood so you're not wandering aimlessly for hours on end. My opinion: spend 30 mins to an hour MAX here and move on. You'll enjoy some of the sights, sounds, and freaks but just beware this isn't exactly a family friendly location. Tons of people watching and laughs in store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/816brianl
10,Names on the ground,"Yep, its names on the ground. with homeless people trying to sell you a tour of them... not worth your time even if you are there. Better to just look at IMDB.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abaconianst
40,Walk of History,"Was a very interesting experience seeing all the artists, actors, creators who have been placed on the Walk of Fame. As I walked and saw the names, I couldn't help but to think of the songs or films in which I was able to experience the gifts of these individuals. Definitely a must see when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaSensei
30,"Glad we went, but....","We were really excited to go to The Hollywood Walk of Fame and had been following the website in case there was an unveiling whilst we we there (unfortunately not but seem quite regular). We got the Metro which drops you off right amongst it. What a shock!, Knew it would be busy, but somehow all the weird and not so wonderful seemed to be hanging around there.People dressed in normal fancy dress clothing, posing for pictures (and wanting paid), people handing out CD's, people asking for money, asking if you if wanted to be on TV (really?) and more than enough scary looking people to be extras in any horror film. Lots of tourists obviously all tripping over each other when taking photos next to their favourite stars. Grauman's Chinese Theatre looked impressive but we didn't go inside. Pleased to say we managed to find many our favourite stars but left pretty soon after.Tip: stay close together, accept nothing and watch your purses/wallets etc.Not what we expected at all, but please we went this once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliewils

10,"Hollywood Walk of Fame - yeah, but....","Don't get me wrong, I'm a movie buff and have been to Hollywood Boulevard many times, but the walk of fame just leaves me cold. So what, it's a star on the sidewalk with someone's name on it. Many more interesting things on Hollywood Boulevard: Grauman's for real Hollywood history; the display cabinets in El Capitan; The Egyptian; the walking tour that one of the tour guide companies provides; time going so you can stand on the sidewalk for a premiere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJTSmith
40,Cool to see at least once...,"This was pretty cool.Seeing the stars on the walk of fame was neat, though I found the sidewalks really dirty which kind of took something away from the experience. Some were so dirty I had hard time seeing who they belonged to.But, it was still pretty cool. I didn't like being asked to go on yet another ""tour"" every five seconds, but I get that these guys are just trying to get money to live. No foul.Go once, say you've been. It's worth at least that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TACensorship
30,"Must do for movie fans, but...","You have to do this as a movie / old media fan - including the Grumman's Chinese Theatre and its amazing cement celebrity hand/foot prints, and to see the Dolby theatre, El Capitan, etc. but the aggressive hawkers and characters, and the crowds! Hold on to your wallet and family, don't take anything from anyone, and soak it all in. Plan 1 hour max. We parked at the Hollywood and Highland Center, a somewhat oasis with watchful security.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CollectingRocks
30,Have to See it Once,"My wife had never been here, and wanted to see it. We were here on a Monday afternoon. It was still relatively crowded. It is interesting picking out all the people you know and your favorites.However, the touts shoving stuff in your face and trying to sell you stuff are overwhelming. Don't go off the beaten path or you will trip over the homeless laying on the pavements.I guess you have to see it once. Been there, done that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OziDiver
30,Underwhelming and average,"I would definitely recommend if there was a star in particular you are trying to find, to look up in advanced where they are on the walk. Otherwise the walk can be quite long (in between people trying to sell you CD's, homeless people asking you for money, the overwhelming smell of pot and people trying to sell you crack) and it really takes away from the experience. I would not spend very long here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dede21189
40,Walk of Fame experience,"My wife and i visited Los Angeles and stayed in the wonderful Beverley Garland Hotel, which i must say was excellent! The walk of Fame was just marvellous, we walked from end to end finally getting a pic with Robin Williams star and a Marilyn Monroe statue. The walk of Fame is a must for all who travel to Los Angeles. We are back in L.A again in October and cant wait....have a great time on your visit and dont forget downtown L.A for cheaper goods such as caps and souvenirs....have fun :))",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teddyboy63
40,Interesting,"The walk was enjoyable. Could have used less people trying to sell us tours, but that's expected. I enjoyed seeing the stars and the street was buzzing on both sides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/268dwightd
40,The good and the bad,"Stepping out of the car onto the Hollywood strip is and experience in itself! We walked the majority of the stars, however we did find the further we walked the more homeless people there was asking for money, weed and crack!! and the smell of id hate to think what was quite overpowering in some places, I found it quite sad actually!! With that aside it was fun looking at all the names and finding the famous people we wanted to take photos of, and people were very friendly!! Hint to other visitors: Do not accept a CD off anyone (people claiming to be rappers), before you know it they have signed your name on it and you owe them $30!! We were lucky enough to be warned of this before hand, but seen many people get done by them!!Overall it is a experience that shouldn't be missed!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsAnthony
50,Quick visit,"Stopped here while on a tour, interesting place could spend a day here looking at all the stars names etc! AVOID the street sellers is good advice! Don't take the CD they trust into your hand because they want paid for it! Great place to visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelfastDee
30,Weird,Very dirty homeless sleeps on sidewalk other that entertainment with all the people with costume on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flora197
30,Crowded Attraction,"We visited Hollywood on a Tuesday morning, and it was so crowded that finding stars became a chore. Taking pictures was really difficult. The neighborhood is a bit seedy. If that were the only reason to see Hollywood, I probably would not bother.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/653debrab
30,Needs a Good Clean,"Been there now, grossly overrated and needs a good clean. No one ever thought of foot traffic flow when they started this. Should be to one side of the sidewalk, too many other distractions with other people pushing stuff that takes up room on the side walk. Very strange little things left on some stairs. Michael Jackson had a rocket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotg20
40,Something to experience at least one time!,"I live near Boston, MA and have experienced throngs of tourists, street performers and people trying to sell their wares in Harvard Square, Faneuil Hall or Boston Common. The craziness of the Hollywood Walk of Fame makes these places in Boston seem quite mundane. Walking on Hollywood Walk of Fame on a Saturday, the actual stars on the walk of fame are almost unnoticeable due to the constant moving crowds, large gatherings of observers to street performers and totally insistent wannabe ""musicians"" who actually put their CD in your hand and demand payment. It's too funny to imagine without experiencing the real push. The most common photo ops were people kneeling at Michael Jackson's star and people cleaning off the star on the sidewalk. Kinda crazy, but interesting and a definite experience not to be missed if you have the opportunity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/263clom
20,Ho hum,"Walking up and down a street with 2500 stars, flanked by tacky shops and tour hawkers...not much to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/444eva

10,Over-rated,"This is so over-rated it's ridiculous. There are too many tourists and beware of the people who are selling their ""autographed"" CDs. It's a shady area with not much to offer. I suppose it's cool to say you've seen it but once is enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cangirl44
30,Crowded,"I was curious on how this place looks like so my friend took me here and the place is crowded, all people walking in all directions taking photos of the sidewalk.

30,Overrated,"Today's stars pay to have their stars placed in the sidewalk. Look for the classics, the older stars who were actually invited. Nowadays any Tom, Dick or Harry can buy their fame from the Hollywood Chamber. Baxter wants to buy a star!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RioAngelina
30,People everywhere,"So many people doing the same thing, and people trying to sell you tours or goods. It gets really annoying very quickly.Only real good thing is that it doesn't cost anything!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DBH_15
20,Too many people accosting tourists for money.,"Literally from the minute we got out of the taxi, a costumed character was coming up to us. Some woman who was dressed as Minnie Mouse or Hello Kitty was in my face as I got out of the cab saying hello and trying to beat the other characters to us. They want to take a photo with you and then shake you down for money.They were so aggressive and you could not walk a foot without someone blocking your path. This continued with some rappers. Being from New York, I am used to saying no and walking fast but my daughter is not as street smart. I heard her talkng to someone and a rapper had asked her name, autographed a CD cover, shoved it into her hand and them demanded a donation. I was furious and did no want to open my wallet on the street but felt very intimidated. I gave him two dollars to go away but apparently he wanted five and kept following us. We were trying to find the meeting place for our bus tour, but the area was a nightmare on a sunny day. People were taking photos of the stars on the sidewalk, but would get mad if you walked into their shot. Completely overcrowded and chaotic area that is no longer enjoyable",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzyd43
30,"See it once, and check it off your list","We stayed in a beautiful 2 bedroom condo, through airbnb, right on the walk of fame. This section of Hollywood Blvd has the stars, famous landmarks, a ton of tourists, and a lot of rather sleezy other stuff (think similar to 42nd street in NYC). Our most entertaining moment was when the fire alarm when off in our building at 1:45am. We evactuated, and the scene on Hollywood Blvd at that hour was homeless sleeping in the street, drunks pouring out of bars, and the like. It still felt perfectly safe, just nasty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBXPatB
50,Nostalgic,Interesting walkExciting street great souvenir shoppingAnd people watching. Certainly a must visitIn LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moishe47
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"If you have the time to saunter along Hollywood Blvd., you'll be pleased that there are some exciting names who will journey along with you. What I like best is that the most popular names are not on some obscure corner. The star you seek will more than likely be within a short walk from Hollywood and Highland. What is even nicer is that Hollywood Blvd. has been cleaned up and notwithstanding the occasional masked superhero looking to score a few bucks taking photographs with tourists, I find that the area is safe for families. Whenever I have been there with my family, we had a fabulous time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PastorVJ
20,ugly,"Its really ugly there. There is a part with lots of shops and people with costumes which reminded me to times square, but I would only go to make shopping, the walk of fame itself is not nice (dirty streets and ugly buildings)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriac892
40,Stars for Miles,Wear your walking shoes cause you have about a total of 3 miles if you are going to walk and see every star. Recommended to go later in the day when the sun starts going down. I was looking in to the sun most of the day and it was hot. Many of my pictures didn't turn out good because of shadows from the sun. I will have to go again cause I missed a few of the side streets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swardrn
40,A Can't Miss Hollywood Landmark,"Were talking plaques on the sidewalk folks, along some heavily foot traveled and often funky seeming streets. For the uninitiated this may seem like the kind of neighborhood you might avoid at home, but it is in reality a safe, fun walkable adventure that you have to see.Especially fun are the tributes to older stars, but for some youngsters probably just bore. There's plenty to see and take in all around you and recent developments near Hollywood and Highland are very nice and upscale. If you avoid touristy venues, this might be one to skip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tweston
40,A must see--it is tradition,"So many stars to see. You just walk along and look at them. Fun to do on a nice sunny day. The area itself is quite seedy, but no problem during day time hours and it is a definite Hollywood must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannetravel

20,"Dirty, pushy, crowded, beautiful architecture, shopping and as more Hollyweirdos than you can count","If you are looking for the armpit of Los Angeles - here it is. Wind your way through the throngs of tourists from all over the world snapping photos of feet and sidewalk and hoping to be discovered.You CAN find some unique shopping here, bargains on shoes, biker gear, incense, and lingerie one you're a block or more East from the Chinese theater & tourist traps. Lots of Tee shirts, and souveniers mixed in with a few thrift shops and smoke shops. Watch where you step, trash is everywhere, as are people sitting, standing and playing instruments or smoking in doorways.The terrazzo sidewalks are a color of black that never looks clean - even when it's powerwashed. If you are walking and looking at the names in the stars, that's fun, but beware that everyone is doing the same thing and people abruptly stop right in front of you with no warning. The selfie sticks get dangerous around the block of the Chinese Theater and also Disney El Capitan across the street. Star tours and TMZ tour floggers harass you every ten feet and shove brochures in your hand. This adds to the trash on the sidewalks. Beware of pick pockets like any crowded place.Hollyweirdos are people who dress up as characters or celebrities and take pictures with tourists for tips. I actually like these people as they actually add to the people watching charm of Hollywood and give the starving tourists something to see without having to shell out a ton of money for the inanimate displays in a wax museum or other tourist spots. A few characters have had brawls and been arrested, but all in all they're pretty fun personalities and for the dollar photo will go away on to the next tourist.While most people are looking down, few people like me, look up. And if you do, you will be treated to the beauty of what remains of the REAL old Hollywood architecture. Some of the buildings look like stone lace, the trim painted and details remain on many of them from the 20's, 30's and 40's. One of my favorite buildings is the Roosevelt and I love what they've done to restore it.Nevermind the first floor cheap clothing stores, generic mall stores and costume shops on Hollywood Boulevard - that's not what you came to see. Imagining how old Hollywood was, touching the hands and autographs in the cement and feeling the spirit of what was Hollywood glamour is what you can glimpse if you look hard and ignore the chaos and grotesque mix of incense, hot dogs, garlic and street. The best time is dusk when the lights come up and the sun is not quite down but burning gold red and purple on the boulevard - the magic time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/concettah667
20,"Unless you have a huge passion with a particular star, this really isn't that great",This is a typical tourist site with lots of people snarling sidewalk traffic to stop and take a photo of themselves with their favorite stars. The people watching is quite amusing but just about everything else on this street leaves a lot to be desired.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2dtrav
30,"Fun to see, but kinda gross.","You hear about it, and see it on TV, and you can't wait. But, actually it is in kind of a bad area. Where we walked you could smell Pee from people urinating in the streets. It was dirty, and kinda gross.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/952judiec
40,A little more romantic in your mind's eye....,"Lots of history here and it is fun walking on the legendary stars on Hollywood Boulevard... but for the most part, the stars are looking a bit grungy and Hollywood Boulevard, while on the upswing, had definitely seen better days. Manage your expectations a little bit.... but you really can't visit Hollywood without walking down this street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsTravelJones
30,Walk of fame,"A bit disappointed looked full of glitz and glamour on tv, but still wort a visit. The sightseeing tour of the hollywood sign and beverlyhills mansions was good( although the place they bring you to see the sign now is very far away but still enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cazz69
40,When in Hollywood...,"A definite must-do when in Hollywood. It is lots of fun to see all the stars and walk where so many famous actors have walked before.

Also, you are then in Hollywood Boulevard where all the theatres and numerous other attractions are...so enjoy it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jan-SteynP
50,Fun to see all of the start under your feet!,"You could spend a lot of time walking around comparing your hand and foot prints to the stars on Hollywood Blvd. It's actually a lot of fun to do so! You'll see names you probably haven't thought of in years! You'll also find lots of stores to go into, and beautiful theaters such as the El Captian. Lots of fun on Hollywood Blvd.!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamaduck131

30,A fun novelty,"It's worth having a look if you're in the area already or have something else to come for. There are a lot of people who have stars - I'm not sure I'd call them stars though, but it's fun to stroll along and spot your favourites.Tip 1: Go earlier than 10am and you'll feel like you have the sidewalk to yourself.Tip 2: The star for Muhammad Ali is actually on the wall just inside the Dolby Theatre entrance, and the stars for Elvis and the Beatles are at the west-most end, away from the usual foot-traffic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeStrachan

30,Overrated and uncomfortable,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is the biggest disappointment in my years of travelling. . .

30,only for actors fans,I would not go there specially to see it. It is a very commercial and artificial place. But I understand why some tourist go there.It is 1.7 km long; has 2538 stars. It is manager by the Chamber of Commerce.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sipivu

There are so many distractions along that stretch of road , pick pockets have a field day . We had someone unzip my back pack , while someone else distracted me .

40,Crowded but worth it.,There was a group of about 20 of us that visited. We had a great time and enjoyed searching for certain stars. The sidewalks were very busy with people.I especially enjoyed seeing people dressed as Transformers and Halo. Ha,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/435michelew
30,A bit overrated,I thought walking the Hollywood walk of fame would be a pretty nice afternoon tour but sadly there were a lot of people. Did I mention the crazies there who would go in a costume asking to take a picture with them and all those aspiring hip-hop artists forcing you to buy their demos? No thanks. But nonetheless it was pretty nice seeing the stars of your favorite artists and musicians down that walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattMarquez
30,Stars on the sidewalk !!!,"I believe I like stars in the sky .. Or atleast on TV ... Rather than on sidewalk . It didn't live up to the hype . Lots of homeless on the streets , many adult stores .. Not something I want my little kids to stare at . May be it is something for people who are really into idolizing the stars . Or if u are in LA , just mark it off from the list of places to visit . Otherwise ... Not a place forfamily fun .it does look a lot better on Tv during the oscars .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sruj
30,Not what I expected,"If your in LA, then I guess seeing this (at least once is a must) but the area was nothing like I expected. I expected polished and glamorous. The area is one giant gift shop. Nearly every store on this block, is for souvenirs, or to take a tour of the city, etc. I guess now I know why they ""cover"" the store fronts for the Academy Awards, etc. Makes this are look very run down.

20,Overrated,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is nothing special unless you're there on a day a celebrity gets her/his star.

50,Fun to walk around and find your favourites,"This is a lot smaller than we expected as the stars aren't everywhere, just a few streets but it really is fun watching people get so excited about their stars names on the floor.

They took a few pictures next to those that interested them but many it was just too busy - especially near the Chinese Theatre. They were disappointed Leonardo Di Caprio wasn't there. All the guys trying to sell you a tour of famous homes is a pain in the you know what, but you have to just ignore them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tiger70SH
30,Fun to see!,Definitely was fun to see all the celebrity stars but definitely download the app (official Hollywood walk of fame) if you are looking to find anyone specific!I thought the Chinese theater along the strip was more fun because of the interaction!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allyoopw
20,A 'Must see' that dissapoints,"As most of the studios, except Paramount, have moved out of Hollywood the area has lost its focus and feels quite run down and tatty. The Walk of Fame is much longer than I realised (we didnt see all of it) but we wandered down it looking at the stars to spot famous names. It is worth going as far as the Chinese Theatre which is where the pavement has many celebrities foot/hand prints and signatures. Not much else to say about the area, there are tourist tat shops and touts trying to sell tours, not much ambiance. We felt we 'ticked it off our list' but there isn't much need to spend more than an hour here really. Street parking on meters is easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotties00
40,Interesting walk,One needs to take time to be able to read the names on the stars . I would say that this is a must when visiting Hollywood. This area attracts hoards of people and it also entails a bit of walking but I suggest that you take your time and just enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayVeeCee1940
30,"Seedy area, but good within certain areas","I loved walking along and spotting the tributes to some of my favorite stars! However, hawkers and street vendors come with the territory, and I found myself turned off by their frequent attempts to lure customers into neighboring shops. The Walk itself is cool to see once, but I don't think it's worth the hassle of returning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventuringBlog
50,Amazing array of Hollywood stars,"No trip to Hollywood would be complete without a visit to the walk of fame, get your picture with your favourite star and with so many available, there is sure to be one for you! Make sure you also visit Chinese Mann theatre while your on this road as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8Aussietravellers8
30,More about the people watching,"If you want your photo taken with Freddie Kruger, Jack Sparrow or Shrek, this is the place to be! However, you need to be prepared to pay a few dollars to do so. You may also get conned into buying a cd if you are unaware.To be honest, I didn't read the stars, but others may have been as I kept walking into folk !Hot dogs for sale, shops, buskers, superheroes? So much more than stars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/769lesleyw

50,Gotta Love It!,"The Walk of Fame is, well, famous. Even if you live in L.A. you've got to love it. I dare anyone to walk down the street and not read the names on the stars out loud. I saw a few blank stars. I wonder if Hollywood is waiting for me? Or you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaForster
40,Gotta Do It,Another of those places that you've seen on the TV loads of times. A must see place whilst you're in the area.Recommend to all 👍,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SixtyOne
40,Fun way to spend time,"This was a fun experience for our family. It’s a popular attraction, so the street walks are crowded and it becomes difficult to take a picture with a Star (so be assertive and have fun)!! There is a brochure that lists all Stars and addresses where it can be found. There was construction during our visit (and there always seems to be something going on in this area) some some may not be accessible. If you park in the mall area, it's only $2 for the first two hours, but you'll need to get the ticket validated with a purchase. So go buy yourself some ice cream and enjoy the Walk of Fame. It's fun and almost free! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ttaylor2u2
40,Nice to see the hollywood stars,There are so many of these stars and it takes ages to see them all but it is worth looking at them all. The streets are very busy so need to be quick when taking photos of starts you want.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tracy-A-Scott

30,"Lots of walking, Lots of people","You can see stars in so many places, so to avoid the people, start at Hollywood and Vine - less people, great photos, and the restaurants are less crowded. Once you've seen a block's worth, you feel you've seen them all...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JspencerCO
40,A Fun Walk,"I'm not a big movie fan but who can resist a little chuckle when you happen upon Kermit the Frog's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame? You'll definitely find someone you know of and/or love (OK, maybe like just a little) because there are stars of film, tv, radio, theatre, and music all mixed in along the way. The sidewalk gets pretty crowded when there is a movie premier scheduled for the Chinese Theater or something big is going on at the Dolby Theater. Both were happening when we were there! Still, it's worth the it if you have the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abqtraveler13

50,walk of awe,Do it yourself tour instead of joining a day tour if u have time to handle. You whoosh past so quickly u miss a lot but then u miss the tour narratives too.Interesting hollywood history. Busy area and lots of costume clad superheroes clogging the street photos for a fee . Red carpet pavilion a must visit. Most enjoyable .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenDaveML
40,Walk of Fame,Saw this area in the day and at night. Crazy place and always somethi g happening. Thought the night visit was the best mainly because of all the lights. Street performers were everywhere but dont take their photo unless you are going to tip them as this is their main income. They can get angry if you dont do this. Hard to get photos of the Stars because of the amount of people but well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WendyE997
50,A star for everyone!,"I haven't been here for 30 years but wanted to share the experience with my 20 year old daughter who was in her element and soaked up the atmosphere.The Logies were on in two days time when we were there and there was a real buzz in the air with plenty of security,barricades,red carpet etc.We were staying in an Air bnb granny flat ten minutes walk from here which was ideal.We pre-booked the TMZ tour from home and it leaves in this vicinity.There is a grocery store,banks,shops and there was a lovely pizza/pasta place we ended up eating there twice.You can see the Hollywood sign in the distance from this restaurant.Sushi bar here too.Every tourist finds a star they can relate to and have a photo.I loved the cool dudes selling their own music CD's.I walked past here 4 times as how often does one get to be called ""Hey babe"" and ""sis""certainly not in Australia!I had jet lag and one of the guys said ""I know your Aussies!"" and we hadn't opened our mouths but he wanted us to listen to his music.Then he told me "" I think you are in a bad mood"" when I said""No thank you' They didn't bother us,just alot of fun. One young guy obviously was a DJ by his body movements and did weights and had a nice upper physique and smiled but wasn't pushy in selling his CD's.Snow White was there two days in a row the same beautiful English rose complexion girl.Guys doing tricks.A place to visit when you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorainev861
30,Not as expected,"Good to see the stars names and signatures on the path stones, but area not very appealing. Streets could do with a clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/119melb
50,Cool!,"Loved it! What could be bad about it? You walk along the street, bringing back memories and being surprised at some of the newer ones. Noting some have as many as three different stars - maybe more. Sometimes because they sing, act, dance, direct. Others - who knows? It's really nice to be able to see it. Like it and respect it or not - it is an important part of our history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mary8235

30,Hollywood strip,The strip was a little disappointing. I though it was more to it. The Stars names were hard to find. Parking prices were a ripp off.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ask2106
20,Good but no awesome.,"Its not an amazing place to go but you cant miss it, we went to the fast and furious premier and was very busy, the cops dont close all the street for the premier so you cant see the celebrities very well, they need more than 2 days to plan a huge event like that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JairP8
50,Worth an hour or two out of your day.,"We liked starting at the TCL Chinese Theater, and searched for some of our favorite stars. To make it a longer visit we stayed and had lunch at the mall since there was a variety of places to choose from. It was a perfect tourist thing to do and nice to tack onto the start or end of your stay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shannon2703
40,"You might not love it, but you can't miss it!","You can't really come to LA and not go to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. If it's your first time in the city, GO. Yea, its not the cleanest (it's a street!), there will be people trying to sell you things, it WILL be crowded (i was even pushed while trying to take a picture).. but if you're like me and you grew up watching this on movies or seeing celebrities on TV or in magazines receiving their star.. you'll even get a little nostalgic being there. So, go! Find you're fave celebrity and take a picture!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claudiacvi
40,Furious 7 Red Carpet.,"I visited the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Wednesday, April 1st 2015. It was very busy due to the Furious 7 Red Carpet World Premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre. As busy as it was, it was fun to walk around and see some of the stars arrive. And being that busy I was unable to see a lot of the street performers and hustlers working the walk. And I was unable to see the hand and footprints of the stars in the forecourt. Even so, it was a pleasant visit and now I have plenty of things to see on my next visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iowacityia
40,Fun!,"Hollywood Walk of fame is a must do when you are a tourist and it's fun to see all those stars along the way. There are a lot of people trying to sell tours, CD:s and pictures along the way, but they respect a ""no"" if you're not interested so I don't consider that as a problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malin_o_Jonas
40,FUN...Must see,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a must see because of the fun surrounding this spot. Just go and walk for a few minutes while going to the Chinese Theatre and the Dolby Theatre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garycU290FM
40,Great tourist attraction,"This was as expected. A little dirty, but being an actual street, I didn't expect it to be gleaming. The constant hawkers were a little overwhelming however, couldn't walk 10 feet without being offered some shirt or hat to buy. Was a little off putting but I guess that's how tourist attractions work. I'd go back if I was to go to Los Angeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccak973
30,"Walk of Fame is all good, but....","Watch out for the pushy Characters along the Walk of Fame trying to sell DVDs, and all the others in costume wanting you to take photos with them , as they will extort cash from your wallet. Besides that enjoy the Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Royalcol
40,Thrills on every square,Loved seeing the various stars and seeing my kids faces light up upon name recognition. I got a secret thrill out of seeing Jimmy Kimmel's filming location since I see it several nights on TV. A fun walk and super easy sight to catch while staying at the Magic Castle hotel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hrcompdr
30,Extremely eclectic,"Hollywood walk of fame could also be called the walk for shame, homeless young people sleeping in doorways..walking down Hollywood blvd. is overrated. Go to Chinese Theater is the footprints, but don't walk down with the kids it's a mess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaLColeman
20,An unfortunate must,"If you're going to Hollywood, you have to check this out...(unfortunately). It's iconic so it deserves the visit. However, I felt less annoyed with people at Times Square than I did here. People just stop walking, sit down (on the dirtiest ground I have ever seen - don't wear sandals; my feet were so dirty after walking here), and take pictures of the star of their favorite star. Michael Jackson, Walt Disney, Mickey Mouse, and Bruce Lee seemed to be the most common ones to do this at. The issue is it's so crowded that you can barely move and people walk insanely slow through it. There are also people dressed up as characters. They clearly don't coordinate ahead of time because there were 3 spidermen, 4 Johnny Depps, 2 Catwomen...you get the picture. Also, if someone tries to hand you a CD, don't take it unless you want to give them money and hear all about them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/filinsk
30,Walk of shame,"There were too many homeless & panhandlers. Everywhere we walked, some one was asking for money. Even in McDonalds. At night, many people were sleeping on sidewalks & in building alcoves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/klrmf1982
50,Typical of what you expected,"How can you not check out this block of town if ever come to L.A. I gave it a five star for two reasons.It doesn't matter which direction you come from, subway, rental car, Bus...., and you will know you have arrived party central. The traffic is like 1 mile per hour, the noise could be any kind, the smell maybe food, maybe weed, maybe cigarette and maybe pee, and of course the people, all colors of hair, all colors of skin and all speak different tones...some even not in your typical human flesh (wax)..... Let's never forget of those who makes us truly happy, the street artists and the most yummy frozen treat next to the Disney theater....The other reason is that this location is extremely convenient for the typical tourists. If you live in a hotel in this block of down , you don't really need a car. Among the buses, double buses, and the subway, it have you covered for basically all the attractions. This way saves you money and headaches. No mistaken, driving, parking even getting the rental car from Dollar car rental LAX are all tremendous stressful events in L.A. Don't do it if can have some one else do it for you for a small fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alicekao
40,Hollywood and Highland,"Enjoyed a quick pit stop here whilst doing an organised tour around LA last month, definitely worth coming here and taking in the sights, not sure you would stay here all day, but still I enjoyed my short time here, posing for pictures with the guys in fancy dress (make sure you have some change to tip if you have pics with them) and seeing all the names engraved on the walk of fame itself.Also there's a great viewing point inside the Hollywood and Highland shopping mall of the Hollywood sign make sure to check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamjar1234
30,Starts hard to find!,"went by to see some famous stars, but it was quite hard to find so of them, hard to make pics since a lot of people passing through, it is better to go on Sunday in the morning, you can see less people on the walk of fame and it will be easier to take the pictures you want. Many stars were not very presentable though...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/43priscilas
10,Walk of shame,"Old, dirty and full of hustlers. There were such a high expectation for the area but it was such a big let down. Feel so uneasy and insecure while we were there. The city really should cleaned up the street and modernize the place a lot more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chanskie
30,Good to waste an hour or two,I guess its one of those mandatory sights that your expected to knock of your list. Wasn't particularly interesting. Got a few souvenirs and fridge magnets for my ever growing collection. Seeing the outside of the Kodak theater was cool. Lots of people in movie costumes vying for your money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClickCrazy
40,Downtown Hollywood,"Overall it's a good place to visit if you love film as much as I do. Be forewarned, it is Downtown Hollywood. Everone has their hustle on, it's crowded during the day and my 10 year old saw a junkie nodding out on the street. The allys and sidewalks smell of urine, and people really want your money. The museums and dining are good, and it's all worth it to see the stars and their handprints, footprints and autographs if you're really in to old Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessegl85
50,Must visit,"It's the traditional tourist thing to do if you are in the Hollywood area, it is fun to be in the area where you know so many stars have been and to see all of the fun attractions in the area including the Dolby theater (Oscars) and walk down Hollywood Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/389ValerieP
30,Not so flash,"We visited the walk of fame in the day and were disappointed , we had more people trying to sell us a tour or pose for a picture or grift for $ it spoiled the day , went bak at night and was much better to look at but still to much hassle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stretchj2015
40,Brilliant..!,Now here is one place to sum-up all the names you have craved for. A must see at last once in case you are a Hollywood Movie buff. Also that the area around Dolby Theater (earlier Kodak Theater) is fun to be at. Loads of street performers and mascots of various Disney characters will make your time. Think of spending around an hour unless you are serious about those 'Inside-tours'.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ranupams
50,Must See!,"As cheezy as it may sound, the Walk of Fame is still so iconic that you get excited walking through it, looking for stars you know and wondering who some of them are. We had a fun time just walking and reading the names!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debras660
40,A First Time Must See if you have never been to LA and are into Films and Entertainment,"We walked 5 miles all the way down Sunset up La Brea and back down Hollywood Blvd. There is so much to see and checking out all the Stars on the sidewalk. Sure there are touts and tourist traps but if you can enjoy youself, the walk is free and you will see interesting people and things for sure. A must if your 1st time to Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christK5337IE
30,interesting but not fascinating,"If you are looking for a specific person, try to google first where they may be. This walk stretches over many blocks and is on both sides of the street. Hard to find somebody, but interesting to read as you are walking down the street. This area is FULL of people trying to hand you their CD of music or comedy act, and once you do, they want money for it (even though they will say it's free). Just politely say no thank you to everyone and avoid awkward confrontations. They will stick it right in front of you so instinct is to grab it. Don't touch. Unless you are interested in unknown artists hip hop music (assuming that is actually what is on the CD). There are some stars more on the outskirts that are blank. This was fun for my daughter to take a photo by and we then digitally put her name in the picture with photo edit software as she aspires to be a producer/writer/director someday in Hollywood. It's located in an area very much like Vegas. Lots of crazy characters dressed up willing to take a photo for money. And goes right in front of Chinese Theater where the handprints are. A definite Hollywood must do, but don't give more than a half a day to the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/croppingfool
30,When you walk on the star you feel like you are one of them (celebrities),"The Walk of Fame is really just that, a walk to the several streets where names of famous people (not just movie stars) are imbedded on bronze like metal plates and names are in no specific order. You may or may not recognize the names but when you walk on them you feel like you are a celebrity for the day. It is a distraction in the walk, just like when you are reading your text while walking so be careful not to bump into someone or spill your drink while walking because you are looking down and another distraction is grabbing your attention.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indiana_Jonesse
40,Star struck,"I feel delighted when I see the name/s of my favorite stars. There was a smile in my face everytime I step on their stars . In Hongkong one few names are listed, but in Hollywood you could see them on both sides of the road. I choose the name of Barry manilow for my picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yamv
50,Worth the time spent here!,"My wife and I enjoyed walking along this part of Hollywood Blvd.We were near the Chinese theatre, when my wife commented that she wishedshe could see Keanu Reeves star, then literally 5 steps later there it was.We enjoyed seeing the feet and hand print area in front of the theatre,as well as other stars in the area. The costumed characters were sort of a nice addition, except for the pushy ones trying to get our money for a picture with them. We politelydeclined to be parted with our money so quickly, and just enjoyed walking alongthe street with the other tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HarveyMarshall
20,Spend no more than 5 minutes here,"I have been to the Hollywood Walk of Fame before. We were staying around the corner so decided to get some exercise and walk around a bit. The area is becoming more run down and dirty with numerous cheap tourist shops, lingerie and tatoo parlors. We had to step over several homeless just laying on the streets and in some areas, it smells. Then there is the constant brochures being thrown in our face for celebrity home tours. It was rather annoying. I recommend driving up the street, pop out, take a few pictures and spend your time in other places in LA. Also at the mall attached to the Loews Hotel, a guy tried to mug my husband by deliberately bumping into him. Luckily he doesn't carry a wallet, so the guy got nothing. A friend of ours on the same trip got her phone stolen out of her purse in front of the hotel. It is a tourist area so you have to be very careful and be aware of your surroundings. So bottom line, if you have been there before, don't bother going back. If you have never seen the Walk of Fame and want to see it, limit the time you spend here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AASeattleFlyer

A sidewalk!!Yeah, it's got stars on it, but the truth is I didn't know who many of the 'stars' were... and for many others I thought, ""HE (SHE) has a star???!!! Really???!!!"".But there were other times I saw the star of someone I hadn't thought about in a LONG time. I experienced a flood of memories... and enjoyed a nostalgia for a time many years ago. Movies I haven't seen in many years.

Not a place to go if you don't care for crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NDmaggie
30,"Not what i expected, more like skid row walk of fame.","This was my first time visiting hollywood and unfortunately this is not what I expected.The hollywood & highland mall though is a fantastic outdoor center with tons of shops and restaurants. The walkway on the northern side offers views of the hollywood sign. However, the experience went downhill afterwards. 1. The walk of fame, though interesting when it comes to looking at famous stars names on the concrete looks dated and needs a spruce up; there were cracks and missing concrete in many places. 2. The buildings along hollywood is old and crappy. I thought I was in the ""hood"". 3. The amount of homeless and other shady people were all over, some were begging for money. This is a disgrace for such a place like this. And 4, people were selling tours like they were desperate for business and worst, the black dudes pushing their CD's, many of them forcefully in your face and they are downright rude if you say no or walk pass them. If you see them, bypass them if you can or walk fast. The whole experience was too much. Parking is hard and expensive, but were able to find one at the hollywood & highland center at cheaper rates, just be sure to know your way back to your car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chriswG1194JD

When we were there in November, they were shooting a commercial for Pop Tarts with Shawn Mendes and my daughter and I got to be in it. Unfortunately, I don't think it ever aired :( A very fun and exciting place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/threepowells
30,Overrated,"It was great to visit don't get me wrong, its a must see if you're visiting Hollywood.However I wasn't overwhelmed, I only knew a few of the celebrities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodiek993
30,Not as glamorous as seen on TV!,"Huge difference between Saturday and Sunday night. Saturdays are much busier and hard to see stars as everyone is walking over them. Lots of movie look alike characters, fun to watch. Parking is hard to find and/or expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Machela567
50,Cool!,"What a great at experience! Aside from the people rushing you trying to sign you up on tours or sell their disc, it was a highlight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MollyAW1234
10,Must see but sooooo dirty and scummy,Why does no-one clean the stars? Then you find out the stars actually pay to have a star and it kinda takes the fun out of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeviHarvey
30,Not the most plesant enviroment.,"While it is fun to see the many stars on the sidewalk and to find those you like, the area is packed with tourists and a few people asking for spare change. The streets are busy and finding a place to park is not the easiest thing. I guess it's something that all of us want to see, but it's considerably less wonderful than we had expected. Due to the crowds, it's difficult to stop and look at a specific star and take a photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newengland50
50,Hollywood,It is exactly how it is shown on tv ;) I recommend doing celebrity house tour to make your trip more exciting .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aniazasada
40,Enjoyed it,This is obviously a must when visiting Hollywood. With over 25 stars you are bound yo find your favourite stars there. I was there on the day Will Ferrel hot his star. A lovely ceremony !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/expatEdinburgh
50,Seeing all those names,It brings up so many happy memories to see names of stars from the past and present. Iconic-must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/261LBTW
20,too many pan handlers,"Very difficult to enjoy walk of fame. Constantly bombarded with guys trying to sell you their demo cd's. They are nice and it was difficult to say no, but would have preferred to just walk the sidewalk and photograph the stars. Very busy are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunofabeachStl
40,Must see,Well worth seeing and snapping pics of your favorite stars. I enjoyed comparing feet and hand prints. The many salesman on the strip are annoying but not enough to wart off a visit. I'd recommend a Hollywood tour if for nothing more but to drive you around the major areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/369angelal
20,Nothing but overrated!,"Don't do this, it is really not worth it. We rented a car to get there because we stayed in Venice Beach and we spent 10min around Hollywood decided to just leave. It's nothing special at all. There was nothing fun to see at all. Don't waste your time by going there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SwedishMartin
40,"It does rain, even here!!","The walk of fame, still down the street, even though it was raining! When it rained it poured"" so walked down the street a gashinf at all the names iv seen, some iv heard off,others I hadn't. But very exciting, oh my god I was there! Great fun ,shame the weather was so disappointing, it plenty to see and do",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/May903
20,Dumpy,Hollywood is gross. Most names on the stars you've never even heard of. Not worth it. Just seeing names written down... Whatever.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beachluvr123
30,It was.... just okay!,"I don't exactly know what i was expecting from this experience, but it was a little bit of a let down. Reading all the names on the stars was an okay experience. We got approached by a LOT of people trying to sell us stuff. I know each one of them were just trying to get their name out there, but some were very rude and extremely pushy if we didn't buy their demo CD's. Witnessed a police chase on foot. And the whole strip itself needs a makeover. We spent about an hour there and then waved down the first cab we could find to get us out of there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeeDee1982
50,A must see - especially the museums!,"I visited this strip with my wife. I saw the plaques on the ground which were nice but got over the excitement in about 8 seconds. What's nice on this street are the museums. We went to the wax museum and Ripleys. Really nice and good fun, esp the walk of horror.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlDeDiner2019
30,Not a whole lot,"You've seen it on TV, your favorite movie stars and celebs getting their names embed on the floor. Well... it's nothing like that on regular day. The street is crowded and full of people dressed up like movie stars, especially ""superheros"". I admit they are pretty cool but beware they are ready to charge premium for a service fee if you want to take a picture with them. I get that they're trying to make a living, and cool suits cost money, but some of them are just too pushy. I've had a few actually nudging me and keep saying ""take a picture!"" (of course they didn't mentioned about the ""tip"")All in all, a worthwhile place to spend maybe no more than an hour, so you can check it off your bucket list.Oh and, if you're driving, there's a car park in the mall nearby which has a reasonable pricing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vijcha
40,Enjoyable walk,The walk takes you along hollywood's most famous street. We got a bit nostalgic thinking about all the legendary names we passed by. A lot of photo options along the way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tobias2402
30,Anticlimactic,"The Walk of Fame is nice to cross off of your bucket list. You might run into a celebrity or two but other than that it is just a walkway with souvenir shops and restaurants. Very touristy area, similar to Universal's CityWalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nyexeva
50,Walking in history,Yes it was crowded but people were courteous when someone was on the ground taking a pic with a star. Walking with all the stars brought back fond memories. Don't make a special trip just for this but is something to do while walking from place to place. Parking is horrible. Uber or Lyft or taxi.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodyt977
30,If only it was cleaner...,"It's fun to come look at the stars, but just remember that this place is filthy and filled with crazy angry people, so be prepared!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L5332LBstephaniem
40,Glitzy,The hollywood walk of fame is a glitzy area. It reminds me of Las Vegas in a certain way in that it's very touristy. So you have a lot of activity going on with street entertainment and corny touristy attractions. Good for family with children. I enjoyed visiting the Roosevelt hotel and the restaurant there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0505LiveLife2014
40,a walk with the stars!,It's just a walkway. The fun part of it is looking for someone you like. Some Hotels have a free guide that tells where your idol's star is. Two tips: Merilyn Monroe's star is on front of a Macdonalds! and Michael Jackson's star is close to the Chinese Theater!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Virgulino
20,A bit of a dissapointment,"This wasn't really anything special, just the stars in the ground. We had limited time here so couldnt find people we knew, just lots of random stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/862jakes
50,Be a Star for a moment,"Well I should say for sure that this place is INSANELY CROWDED! I live in Hollywood 3 years now and I go to GYM which is right there. i have to pass masses and crowds in order to get to the gym and I am telling you winter, spring fall or summer geez that place is crowded! So many people all around the world are there every minute! Its only thing that is not a go go thing but hey Mona Lisa has lines in Paris. So yes this place is worth to visit! so many stores, street actors, famous buildings like TCL Chinese Theater or El Capitan Theater and of cuz starz Staaaaars alley!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/570leonardoc
40,Fun!,"I've lived here all my life and just went to the Hollywood Walk of Fame for the first time a month ago! I can't believe I waited so long to see it. It's really fun to see all of the Stars' names on the sidewalk and step on them! I loved it. I reommend it for everyone, especially tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jujubee720
50,Nice.,It was so special. This kind of honor is known in the entire world. You have to pay attention when parking. Each 1 hour is $3 or 4.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brunoo534
20,NOT NOT NOT WHAT YOU THINK,"ok so I guess I was expecting more, and I did view it at night ans not during the day, so please bear in mind during the day maybe a completly different experience.To keep the review short, if I say beggars, homeless people, drunks, meth heads, so called street artists, cheap tacky $1 dollar shops, I think you catch my drift.Im not saying I felt unsafe or worried i was going to get stabbed, it just wasnt what i expected and dont let the movies fool you either..... its a street with stars on it and famous names scribbed in them.....see it, say you done it, move on....QUICK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W3441BPpaula
30,A Unique Stretch of Narcissism,"It is fun to walk down this long stretch of self-congratulatory Hollywood history. Even more fun to watch the masses of oddballs and misfits that congregate there from all over the world. Blocks of cheap, overpriced stores and ""museums"" surround the walk. If you are lucky, you might even see a fist fight between some of the costumed characters that try to ripoff the tourists!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kiddydoc1
40,Great Parking Tip!,"Parking is scarce in this area. As we approached Hollywood Blvd on Orange Street, we saw a parking garage with a free hour offer is you purchase something from Baja Fresh and have your parking slip stamped. Baja Fresh food items cost less than an hour of parking, so was a great deal. We looked at some of the stars, watched a few street acts, and saw the outside of the Chinese Theatre and were back at the car in an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5nn
30,Nothing great but prepare yourself for the struggling artists!,"I was excited to see the Walk of Fame but I walked away feeling just okay about it.The strip was full of a group of tourist trying to compete in a match up game from what I could tell, I found them to be rude and annoying pushing other people out of the way to make sure they could do whatever it is they needed. No big deal but it was annoying.I did enjoy seeing the hand and foot prints that were in the cement of the different actors.Another big thing that really annoyed me is there are people out there literally shoving their mix tapes down your throat. My husband politely declined on several times, some of the people would become angry that we didn't want to take them, there was even one man who mad a racist remark to my husband. I'm sorry but there is just no need for that we weren't interested and we were polite enough to decline.I think we spent more time browsing the gift shops then we did actually seeing the strip.Also a helpful tip for those who don't know that there are people dressed as characters on the strip like Elsa, Mickey, Mini, you have to tip them to have a photograph with them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dodobir
50,Felt like a movie star,Love the walk of fame! Big highlight was Madame Tussaud's wax museum must see it was fantastic. Chinese theatre was great loved looking at all the stars handprints and footprints,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wetzy28
30,Check out while in Hollywood.,"Hollywood Walk of Fame scattered out for many blocks in Hollywood, check it out for your favorite star or performer. Can get quite busy in the middle of the day, go in early morning if you can, if you want to scour the streets without a huge crowd. Souvenoir shops everywhere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyBaltimore_Md
30,Tourist Attraction,"Have heard about this my whole life so was glad I saw in person. Lots of sketchy people trying to get you to take pics, tours, their cds and anything else but I guess that's what you get in the touristy area this was in. It was all in good fun. Enjoyed the cement plaques in front of Graumans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christim840
10,Cheesy place,This place is so cheesy. There is nothing to see around. Instead of seeing that place I would suggest that you can go to Santa Monica Beach or Venice Beach to enjoy the ocean. This was one of the terrible places that I have been in my life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NazliDemet
40,Search for a star,"The Walk of Fame is a must in Hollywood. Looking at the stars, photographing it. There is no rhyme and reason as to the placements. I'm still puzzled as to why few of them have a star and yet more famous people have stars placed rather out of the way. Our kids certainly enjoyed walking up and down the strip looking at the names.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
40,Improved since last LA. Visit,"Pleased to see there has been significant improvements to facilities and stores in the area, big improvement from 12 years ago",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarieElaineB2
40,Do it!,"If you are in Hollywood you have to take the walk of fame at least once. There are lots of interesting things to see and places to eat and pictures to take, as well as all the sidewalk stars of old and new stars. The characters are there in all manners of dress and personality to be observed also. We were there at night in early March and off season so the traffic was light. It's fun and you should do it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnier2015
40,Interesting street,"It is nice go walking at the street and see many actors and characters names engraved on the ground. You need to be careful and look ahead, unless you want to crash with someone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mantos
50,Amazing to See it,"If you are in Hollywood, or the LA area, how can you not come to the Walk of Fame and get a picture with your favourite star, imagine where your own would be and marvel at the amount of talent in the world for TV, Movies, music and broadcasting.The website is really helpful as well, letting you know where you can find particular stars and giving information about the people you might not know so much about.Well worth a visit.Be weary of all the people on Hollywood Blvd though. There are some very annoying folk, who are trying to make a living to be sure, but can really dampen the mood of your day on the Walk of Fame.People that attempt to hand you CDs, or pull you in to take a photo with you (and are dressed as some character) will expect payment. Move on quickly unless you want some of these. There are also many tour operators in the area, they are like vultures, trying to get you to spend money. They will persist even if you tell them you have already purchased your tour for that day. Again, try not to talk to them and move on quickly.Hollywood Blvd is also filmed regularly, watch for the signs that let you know. They are usually in windows and are only about A4 sized. Get involved if you see weird things with Jimmy Kimmel cameras pointed at them, you never know what nice thing that man will do to/for you.There are bathrooms in Hollywood and Highland shopping centre, near the back left on the second and third floors I think.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WaveyCowpar
40,Adventures in Hollywood,"I took the Flyaway bus line to the Walk of Fame. I do not recommend it-one the way there, the driver was a jerk. They only take debit or credit card and he swiped my chip card. I told him it had to be inserted in the reader and he insisted it didn't work. I was stuck having to ask someone with a credit card to take my $10 cash and pay for me with their card. He was rude and drove so badly that a piece of luggage that was stowed in the overhead rack came flying out and nearly landed on the passenger who owned it. Also, this bus is supposed to come at the top and bottom of the hour. I waited an hour and a half for it to show up. Every driver of the other flyaway buses that I asked about the Hollywood bus gave me a different answer. How do they not know the bus schedule for their company's buses?The Walk of Fame itself was okay. The area was practically deserted, save for some street people and a handful of tourists. I was a bit concerned that I was in a sketchy part of town, but aside from one very aggressive tour operator, no one bothered me.I wandered into a shop to see about getting t-shirts to take home and got a real deal-great shirts, 3 for $9.99! Can't beat that deal! I also found a penny press, which is always fun. The Mexican woman running the place was lovely. We had a good chat and she gave me excellent service.I also found a Starbuck's at Hollywood and Vine which was really nice, It's like a home away from home. It was quite busy, but the staff were friendly.There was lots of interesting architecture in this area and I could see the Hollywood sign. There is also the Capitol Records building. Lots of things to photograph. If you are looking for a certain star, go into one of the shops and buy a guide that will help you locate it.The Flyaway bus driver on the way back to the airport could not have been friendlier. I told him about my issue with the other driver scanning my card and he said it was nonsense-he's NEVER had a problem with out of country debit cards. He was a good driver and got us to the airport in record time. I gave him a big tip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lelainial
40,Every tourist must find a star,it is what you do when you go to Hollywood...so do it...you can browse for a star you like or look up its location online,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshW768
40,Welcome To Hollywood!,"My first time in Los Angeles and I loved it. My first stop was the Walk of Fame. I had to make sure that I saw my fave lady, Mariska Hargitay and her mother, Jayne Mansfield. I went very early in the day (8AM) and there wasn't much traffic so I walked up and down the street and took lots of great photos. Yes, I was very much a tourist!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaraM323
30,Once you see one you see them all,The walk of fame is just ok..Not really all that entertaining but my girl friend found some to take pics of. The entire street is people just asking you if you want to do Hollywood tours. People will bug you and try to hang you cds..I have learned in all of my travels to never take anything out of someones hands unless you are giving them money and this stays true on the walk of fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Byrondwyer
10,Walk of shame,"An absolute toilet, so dirty and disgusting we wish we would have skipped it. The walk if covered in filth and many stars a cracked and gross. You are constantly harassed by vendors trying to get you on their Hollywood buss tours topped off by the dressed up opportunists trying to get your money in exchange for a photo. My son told me he didn't want a photo with ""garbage bumblebee"" this place is just yuck! Every shop and restaurant on the walk also looked gross we left to go eat elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarlynB
30,Be careful when and with whom you take with you,"I visited the Hollywood Walk of Fame on a Friday evening after 8:00. There were several entertaining street performers and lots of foot traffic. I have been to many major cities in the evenings and by far, this was the most trashy of all. The smell of alcohol and homeless body odor was very strong everywhere. Fortunately I was traveling with adults, but if I had youngsters with me, I would have been very nervous. Visit during the day if you are bringing children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dixierob
30,walk of ....,We were in LA for a few days so we went to walk along the worlds famous walk of fame. We saw a lot of people taking photos of their favourite STARS. It was annoying though because everyone was just asking if you want to do a tour while walking along the street. Beware of the guys handing out CDs for FREE because you need to tip them. One guy was asking for $10-20 tip for the cd he was giving away. Its worth doing once but no need to do it again in the future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betheljoy
40,Should visit,We went here w our tour and spent about 15-20 min just walking around. It was packed with tourists taking pictures of the stars names and foot prints. We also saw where the oscars take place . Nice to visit but we did not stay for long,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nil00S
40,Must do it once...,"This was on our bucket list. We have been to the area several times, but just never took the time to do the Walk of Fame. It was worth it to do once for sure, but probably no need to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IdahoTravelers
20,"It's a sidewalk, what you expect?",Not the most impressive sight in Hollywood but I was driving past so stopped for ten minutes to have a look. That's all it takes to be fair.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stenkenbaum
40,Everybody has a Star!,"One of my 'must do things' in LA. I wasn't disappointed but I was surprised by how long this 'attraction' went for - we walked blocks and in the end we stopped from tiredness (and time constraints) rather than we came to the end. It's a lot of fun finding your favourite stars but it also did seem to me like you don't have to be all that wonderful to have a star. I would like to see some minimum requirements installed (such as x number of movies, or years in the business) And I would also question the duplication of stars. For example, yes Bob Hope is a star of tv, screen and radio but can't we just have 1 star for him? I don't mean to pick on Bob - he is a true legend, he was simply an example of several duplications I noticed.Anyway - this was fun to do, it's just that it's a little time consuming if you hope (as I had) to see all the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joanne1960
50,Walk of Fame is a must see,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a must do/see when in Hollywood. Grauman's theater is a great place to start or finish This area of Hollywood is so crowded now it's like an amusement park all the time Their are also people dressed in character for picture taking but they do want a tip for the picture Don't stray more than a few blocks east of Hollywood and Highland that area of town gets a little rough Get a huge slice of pizza on the south side of Hollywood west of Highland you won't regret it Park in the huge structure behind Grauman's north of Hollywood off of Orange,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gypsytraveler01
40,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"During the day is almost like any main road anywhere. Throughout the day and night, you can take photos with people who imitate various movie stars - for a cost. Apparently some of them are budding actors. The Michael Jackson impersonator has an amazing likeness. There are plenty of shops and food outlets but nothing to rave about. It is a central area to stay and the train is regular and reasonably priced at around $2.50 per trip. If want to see a movie, there is a nice cinema. Hollywood is a good location to stay but does have a bit of a desperate feel about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rhonny59

30,"Go during the day, get out before the sun goes down!","When one (not familiar with the area) thinks of Hollywood, they're thinking sun, glitz and glamor. Well, ACTUAL Hollywood is sun, crowds, and interesting folks galore (street performers, street walkers, and homeless frequent the area).Do not go without a game plan. My typical tourist round goes down the strip checking out the stars. Stop in at the Guiness Word Record Museum, (you can buy discounted entry to the Wax Museum across the way) then over to said Wax Museum. Further down the strip to the Chinese theatre -- photo ops all along the way.Be prepared to be blasted with flyers for everything from girls, girls, girls to every tour known to man.I like to get in, hit the sights, then get out. Interesting quickly turns into seedy when the sun goes down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968heatherw

My wife and I got tickets for the Chinese theater and when we got out at around 9pm we decided to do some sightseeing, it was raining and we couldn't care less.We will probably be coming back to sightsee some more because we feel there's so much to see. Great experience !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rafaelgJ6035CY

The strecth of stars runs for 2 miles, and while you are walking you will run into everything, from high end luxury store to H&M to McDs and also the homeless people on it.

We were continually pestered by Americans in differing States of inebriation attempting to procure a little money - this is supposed to be 'the land of plenty'. No way! People were dressed as Superman, Spider-Man and various other characters, all stumbling over each other and hindering the view of Stars' prints in cement in front of the dilapidating, famous, but now sordid 'Grauman's Chinese Restaurant'.Not at all what one imagines.

Hollywood walk of fame is very dissatisfied you have people pushing cards and CDs in your face and when you say no the looks you get is just filthy.. I was looking forward on staying here longer but just wanted to leave.. I wld never go back at all the people hanging round sidewalks make you feel uneasy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/783wayneh
30,One and done,"The Walk of Fame is fun for first-timers and not very amazing after. To ensure you have a great time schedule a trip into one of the museums or theaters during your trip. Ripley's, Wax Museum, etc. Be ready for pan-handlers, street performers, and superheros to expect some tips. Think Vegas strip during the daylight in LA! Also, don't pay $20 for parking. Find the meters!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalkid714
10,"Tacky, tacky, tacky","Packed with dozy people who just want to take pictures and get in your way, this s one huge waste of ime. Sadly, it's probably on most tourists' 'tick this box' list. But if your heart's desire is to be snapped with not one, but two Minnie Mice, this is the place for you. There's a useful CVS nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoneWidow
30,Overrated,It was a great day not the walk of fame is overrated and you get harassed by people trying to sell you stuff like there music etc I would not go back,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielj824
50,Movie Geeks Unite,"I really enjoyed this, but I'm a movie junkie.Don't get me wrong, it's a total tourist trap. You will have the opportunity to have your picture made with any number of ""celebrities"" (or some facsimile thereof) for a small tip.But it's so much fun to stroll along and look at the names of so many stars.The Dolby Theater (home to The Oscars) is right there, and the Chinese Theater is not to be missed. (But we only looked at the cement outside.)You gotta do it... At least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzismini
40,Best Street in LA,"It will take you around 2 to 3 hours to see the entire hollywood walk of fame. There are many attractions along the hollywood boulevard like the dolby theatre, madam tussauds wax museum and ripleys believe it or not museum. It is a must see attraction in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aniket91
40,fun,This is a must see as most of us only see it on tv when someone is getting a star! If you're lucky you might be there when this happens! The only drawback is that Hollywood isn't a very safe area and you really need to watch for pickpockets as they love tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Totothewiz
30,"Checked it off of my ""to do"" list","This is a place you hear so much about and when you get to LA, it really is something you should see. But limit the visit to the areas near/around the Chinese Theatre. The walk of fame goes on for a while and there is no reason how the names/stars are spread out (that I could understand). You may see a star of someone really important to you, or you may not. Although worth experiencing, don’t expect it to change your life. And go there before it gets dark.PS I was there in 2013, but the site will not let me go that far back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1519WEdavidk
40,Fun for tourists,"The first time I came to Hollywood Blvd. I was really excited to see the stars on the street, the Chinese Theatre and, at the time, the Kodak Theater. The people that are dressed up as movie icons are fun but can be aggressive if you take a picture with them and don't tip them. I was kind of surprised at how dumpy some of the shops along the Walk of Fame are and how many homeless or just plain crazy people there were there. I love Hollywood and Highland. We live here now and we kind of avoid that area of town because there are always so many tourists, especially in summer. Be prepared if you are bringing small children or ""country bumpkins"" to this area, you will see everything and anything! You need to be cautious about your surroundings and don't wander much past the tourist area of Hollywood and Highland as it turns seedy very quickly down the street near Fredrick's of Hollywood. A definite bucket list thing if you are a movie buff. I also recommend a tour of the stars homes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbbiew
20,Disappointed,"It was great to see the stars on the walk but having someone open my backpack, the smell in parts and the constant tour guides trying to drag you over for $20 bus tours were a pain. Only plus side is I can say I have been here but to be honest I didn't feel comfortable and couldn't wait to get out of the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chris-EF9
30,Glad I got the chance to see it!,"Walk of fame was less than what I expected, I'm not sure if it's because most of the ""star's"" names I wasn't familiar with or flat out never heard of. It was a few stars here and there I got excited to see. Also the whole set up/layout I pictured differently, it wasn't in any particular space or order just spread out going up and down both sides of the street. Oh well, I'm just glad I got to see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eekennaj
20,Not impressed,"I really didn't enjoy very much about our visit to the walk of fame. I guess it is something to see once but I don't think I will be back. Too many tourists, hard to navigate the crowds. Parking is difficult and you are bothered constantly to take a paid celebrity your, listen to someone's music or pay to take pictures with people dressed in costume. Watch out for the $10 boutique. They claim to have a limited time $5 sale and you have to buy their cheap souvenirs NOW or you won't get the sale price but the sale goes on daily.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Winchester99
30,Would be great if you could see it,The walk of fame is ok. It's nice to red the stars on the walk of people you know or recognize however there are so many people there that this is some times a bit difficult.Also beware of people in costume trying to sneak into your pictures for cash as we'll as aspiring artists trying to give you their demo music for 'free',https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckstrike13
30,Must Visit but not Awe inspiring,"If you have traveled all the way to Hollywood from another place in the world, I guess it's almost a must to see the strip of the Walk of Fame. You will find lot's of shops to buy souvenirs and the Wax Museum on the Strip as well. It's not a huge museum but it will be fun. Do visit the Chinese Man Theater located on the same strip. That's fun! You will see the hand prints and foot prints of famous movie stars! Check out Marilyn Monroes feet, they were tiny! Have your cameras ready there's lots you will want to take shots of. Plus there's usually Mimes, Super Heroes and other ""actors"" in costume that will pose with you for a tip if you want a picture with them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Camareb
20,Dirty Stinky City,"Not impressed at all. It was just a big dirty, stinky city with people everywhere trying to get you to take a tour. If you don't head in the right direction the stars aren't even names you will recognize. You have to walk forever unless you know where the names you want to see are. Down in the more recent stars area there are lots of people dressed up hoping you will tip them to take a picture with them. This was not my thing at all and we were glad to leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Milanlan
40,Must see!,It is iconic and a must see. Be prepared it feels like you can walk forever! Have you camera ready. Recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693katiew
50,run on walk of fame,"The walk of fame in very long sidewalk. So, I recommend to ""run it""! It is ideal for your 5K work out after a competition because it works a generative training. Once you can run in high speed due a lot of people stopping and going to take pictures, you is forced to be moderate. Dont forget to turn on in GPS.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vkingeski
50,Stars!,I was surprised at the number of stars along the streets--both sides. It was fun to walk along and read all of them. Just be careful for all the street performers around. They want to charge you for taking a picture of them all dressed in their outfits--managed to sneak in a few without them knowing it. Busy street so be prepared to say 'excuse me' about a million times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suecC4863MA
50,Fabulous,"all i can say u will not regret,lots to see,to do,interesting,just go visit yourself and enjoy 🐸🐸also don't forget we have the big bear mountain,fabulous place to visit only 2 hours away,Palm springs one of my favorite if u like the sun,pool,party,in Santa Monica beach,Venice beach lovely entertaining place to be,music,art and crafts,don't forget the Montana in Santa Monica lovely restaurants,great shopping street,ah please visit silver lake fantastic place for shopping,dining,hiking everywhere Topanga,Malibu,enjoy your stay in sunshine California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roziki
30,Walk of Fame,Walk the stars .. the surrounding area has nothing special... You can find a lot of places to eat and shop though. You may not want to spend more than couple of hours over there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bihadi
20,Very touristy. Very Un-Hollywood!,"Went there early to beat the crowd but there was still a crowd. The only thing famous were the ""stars"", otherwise you have a walkway filled with artists scamming you into buying their ""free"" CD's, grown men dressed in costumes (I had someone grab my hand!), and bums. Very tacky place and I left disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rochels
40,Amazing to know u are in their footprints,For free it's a great experience to know your standing in their footprints and to see the great sights,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alyssssymarie1990
50,Fun area to walk around,"This is a fun area to just walk around, eat and shop..you can park at Hollywood and highland and get your ticket validated by the sweet candy store",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AVChicago2012
10,Avoid at all costs.,"If you are visiting LA, don't waste even one minute here. It's crowded. It's tacky. Parking is a pain in the rear end. Most of the stores are either tourist traps full of snow-globes with the Hollywood sign inside them, plastic mini license plates with names on them, or neon T-shirts that say Hollyood on them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2tough2please
20,Not what I expected,"I was so excited to visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame , but was immediatley disappointed. The are is very tacky, and dirty. The stars are cool to see, but the surrounding area is nothing special. We quickly walked the stars and left. I felt very uncomfortable in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandra74
30,For tourists,"Everyone that is actually looking down at the stars in the walk of fame are tourists. Almost every single local has walked over those stars without ever looking down, just trying to avoid the grown men dressed in costumes all over the boulevard.If you are visiting Los Angeles this should be on your list of things to see since you can see hollywood and highland and the Chinese theater , wax museum, and a lot of other attractions all at once by coming here because they are all right next to each other.They have a section right in front of the Chinese theater that has the hand and foot prints of celebrities in concrete. This in my opinion is the best part. You get to fit your feet and hands (if you want) to the molds.Beautiful but busy setting with confused tourists taking pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562margaritas
20,stars on the street,"Literally, star designed plaques on Hollywood Boulevard sidewalk commemorating those famed of the entertainment world is all it is. Granted it is a sidewalk of fame for L.A. for decades, not a new ""attraction"", and known worldwide. If you want to look at names of those who made it in Hollywood, get a book and look. Hollywood Boulevard of today, and for the past 30+ years ""ain't what it used to be"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anropn
30,"Good for a day time, quick visit for Hollywood fans","We parked along the Walk of Fame, no more than a mile from the Chinese Theatres. We walked up one side of the street to the Theatres then turned around taking in the stars of lots of our favorite actors including Vincent Price, Marilyn Monroe, Pee Wee Herman and Godzilla. Would recommend this activity for Hollywood fans who have never been but warn you that it isn't the glamour you are expecting. The strip is not the cleanest and there are lots and lots of homeless folks along the way, so remain aware of your surroundings at all times. My six year old's takeaway of the day was ""it was cool and now I know how to act like a homeless person: walk around in circles yelling at nothing."" Hmmm, not quite the takeaway I was hoping for LOL.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Missanthropchi
40,"Good but very busy, worth a look tho","Can honestly say this is one of the famous sites in los Angeles, however it has been hyped up a lot...a lot of crowds during the day so getting a good shot can be hard...at night it can be a bit dodgy so look out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/483ravig
30,Walk of stars,"Not impressed, found it a little tacky. Romantic days of hollywood long gone.Nothing to do during the day, night is better with street artists entertaining you. Too many people dressed up trying to make money from getting a photo taken with you.Seen it done it won't do again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suncatcher26
50,A MUST SEE,"I had the best time, walking around looking at all the stars and taking pics of my favorites. My absolute favorites were finding the The Beatles and especially Paul McCartney.!! A must see for any visit to Hollywood...as you walk you pass many iconic buildings and you wonder what it must of been like back in the hey day of Hollywood..!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolk148
10,WALK THAT FAME,"Lovely area which seems clean & tidy. Always buzzing with lots going on in the evening. Possibility of plenty of photo-shots with the ""stars"". If you are looking for someone's name in particular then daytime is less crowded, especially if you want to take a pic of the ""STAR"". I found Rod Stewart's ""star"" just on a general walk-around",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3946GZjeanp
20,Dirty and full of down and outs.,Very disappointed. I have looked forward to going to Hollywood and looking at the stars but it was such a tacky place with down and outs on every street corner!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loubirch
50,So cool,"""Stars"" up and down both sides of the street. Take your pick, can't begin to see them all. Shops everywhere. A must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephnerose
30,No need to visit a second time,Having returned to the Blvd on a number of occasions I can say that any more than once spoils the original experience. The last time we visited the streets were dirty with rubbish and the prices quite expensive. Perhaps we missed this on our first trip due the stars in our eyes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460crashc
40,A must see but not that great,It's one of those staple places you have too see atleast once in your life but make other plans for your day because itll get boring really quick. Find your favorite actor or singer and be on yor way. Plus they start to repeat as the street goes on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kirstink3
30,Set your expectations low.,In a matter of minutes you realize that the whoexperience is underwhelming.There are plenty of stars and you are bound to feel drawn to a few.Tourist trap? Maybe. Validated parking at Dolby theatre makes parking reasonably priced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shriramg2015
10,Its all about the money.,"All you need is some friends on the committee, at minimum D grade talent and at this point 30k for maintenance, not unlike eternal care you pay for when they bury you. This revelation some years ago destroyed part of my childhood memories biking along on the street in the early 70s and thinking how cool it was to see my favorites stars names.Bummer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wimpy_McGhee
30,I guess it's great if you are into movie trivia,Walk the whole thing. You'll know some of the names. But others yeah you'll have to do a search on you mobile phone while you're walking to find out why the person was famous in entertainment to merit a star. Have fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Surprisedtraveler
40,See the world in Hollywood,"There's always something going on here. Public transit makes it easy to get there. Buskers and people modeling movie characters make it lively, and it's always a walk down memory lane.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsonia
20,"Silliest tourist ""attraction"".","1) go to Wikipedia.2) look up a list of Hollywood stars.3) read the list, one name at a time.That's about the amount of fun you'll have on the Walk of Fame. You won't even recognize 1/3 of the names. In the meantime you'll be walking past one store after another that sell t-shirts and posters of James Dean. Don't say I didn't warn you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814charlesz
40,So so cool,"Our trip to LA was great and walking the Hollywood Hall of Fame helped make this experience better.. Walking and looking for our favorite celeb. was exciting.We only saw of a few of our favorites because there are so many, but worth the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natlove007
50,The Hollywood walk of fame is a must do in Los Angeles,"I went here in December with my son. This was my third time at the Hollywood walk of fame in 10 years. Even when you live in Los Angeles, you usually do not go to tourist attractions unless you were showing someone. We enjoyed very much our time here with the big Christmas tree and the festive atmosphere. There are the usual characters on the street and nice places to visit in the shops and surrounding area. Of course you can almost get a good view of the Hollywood sign on a clear day. We took a lot of great pictures and have a good time looking for different stars. This is a short 2 to 3 block area with the main attractions. Some people come to Hollywood expecting it to be a lot of Ritz and glamour and straight out of the movies with him actuality the interesting part is only a few blocks long. You have to remember a lot of people come to Hollywood and don't like it and then we have a lot of surrounding areas that have a lot of Poverty or are run down but on the walk of fame, you can forget that among the stars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wmdalvarez
20,Not a very Impressive Walk!,"This is a totally over-blown tourist attraction. It was just a bunch of pink marble stars imbedded in the sidewalk with just a name of some actor, director, producer, singer, song writer, etc. most of which I've never even heard of. The side walk is lined with 'trinket' shops filled with tons of products 'Made in China' and was usually populated with smelly people dressed up in different comic book character costumes trying to get you to pay to pose for pictures with them. Of all the things I did on my visit to LA, this was the most disappointing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224gregp
20,Let's not and say you did,"Stay away. I used to visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame back when Hollywood was a little seedier, and it was kind of bad then. But now that they've cleaned up Hollywood, it's even worse because it's packed packed packed with tourists, street vendors, people dressed in costumes asking for money. People come here from all over the world to look at the footprints at the Chinese Theater and the stars on the walk of fame, and I feel bad for them that it's so disgusting here. The tourists don't seem to mind, though. I was here last week, and this guy was standing on Arnold Schwarzenegger's footprints, and I overheard him marveling to his friend that he was standing on the same spot that Schwarzenegger had sold. There was a poster of Marilyn Monroe on one of the doors outside the theater, and people were actually posing for pictures in front of it. It's just a poster people. It's not a landmark. Sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VitalSpring
20,Watch it on a movie instead,"Living in Los Angeles it surprises me that so many people still want to see Hollywood. We used to host German students each summer and this was the first thing they wanted to see..and the biggest disappointment. Yes, to those who have already posted these things: it's not safe, it's dirty, and the only time it looks good --and without vagrants-- is when they are filming. Generally, Hollywood should be a miss. There are far better areas to go visit.Note: I was forced to fill the ""when did you visit box"" but in truth, I picked the last available date offered. I generally avoid this area at all costs, despite the fact that the city always boasts they are trying to fix it up. That should say it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeE606
40,Walk of Fame,"This is a must see. Having said that, it does not take very long to do so. You do get a thrill from walking in the footsteps of famous stars. Also nice to see the theatre nearby where the Oscars ceremony is held.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joseph165
20,Fun for 5 minutes...dirty,"Just a warning...I live in Los Angeles and have seen Hollywood grow and morph into what it is since the 80s. At this point, its quite dirty and not very safe after dark. The glamour days and mystique have long since vanished. You have people beginning for money, both homeless and people dressed up in costumes acting like fools.-I would not plan an entire day around this place...Pick your spots wisely to get your pictures, get in/get out and move on to nicer areas.-Yes, if you've never been it is worth a quick visit but don't waste too much of your precious vacation time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnnyP563
20,Hollywood walk of yuck,Hollywood walk of fame area is dirty and not a bit glamorous. Very disappointed. Obviously a lot of cleaning occurs when people get new stars!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julielP4498VP
30,Not everything you expected,"Even though Hollywood has been cleaned up in the past 20 years, there is still much work to do.The walk of fame is a tourist attraction and not that exciting. I just like looking for places to eat along the boulevard, and to/from a show at the Pantages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ferdferd
10,It's a shame,"We had tickets to a show at the Pantages for a 1:00 show. That seems like a safe time to be there, right? We just felt like we were in a very bad part of town. It was dirty, trash all over, many homeless and mentally deranged people talking to no one, tons of smoking and a sense that our purses would be stollen at any moment.For being such a landmark, I expected the city to step up keeping it clean and maybe some police presence.I'll never go back. And, I certainly would not recommend it as a vacation destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLeeP

I guess it's interesting to see the name of famous people on the sidewalks but it gets old quickly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gurami
30,Worth doing once,"It was interesting enough to do one time. The area is a bit of a circus during the day. It is interesting when you stumble on an expected ""star"" when you walk over it. Been there, done that, got the t-shirt kind of place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280caseyc
30,Mixed Feelings,"For the historical Hollywood value, the Walk of Fame is priceless, but it's ruined by the hordes of people crowding Hollywood Blvd, super-hero wannabes posing for pictures for money, and tour guides hawking their tours.

There are crowds of tourists looking at the star makers on the sidewalk. There are tourist shops selling Tshirts and souvenirs of all kinds. There are the impressions in concrete of the hands of famous actors at the Mann Theater. This is a crowd scene that is fun. We had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Varty_10
10,"Top tips for visiting Hollywood Walk of Fame, Los Angeles","- Do not expect too much because it may seem very overwhelming at first but the excitement will die down after you snap a few photos. Most of the glamour stars on the ground will seem like just another 'star' to you in just about 5 minutes after you snapped 100 photos non-stop.- The only attraction was taking photos and more photos of the glitzy celebrities' names on the ground and pretty much nothing else around Hollywood worth checking out.- There are tonnes of look-alike artist trying to sell you package deals to things like Ripley believe it or not, Madame Tussaud and etc. Some will sell you Rodeo drive package to the Hollywood stars homes. We did not buy any package at all because they were all pretty expensive and not worth going. If you want to see where Justin Timberlake or Britney Spears live then by all means, sign up a Hollywood Celebrities tour package.- Every glitzy glamour stuff on the Hollywood Boulevard are very fake, fake artisits, fake cars, fake signs to whatever homes of Will Smith and etc. It is like a public theme park catered for people who are crazy about Hollywood.- Be prepared to be harassed by tonnes of tour group companies. It will cost you up to USD $50 per tour. We saw someone having an argument with a guy selling tour package. You really dont want to be there fighting for your money.- The Forever 21 and H&M shop at the boulevard seem to have a great bargain. I found lots of cheap bargains there. Better than buying a Mansion tour package.- If you are there in Hollywood, why not walk to Beechwood Drive and get a clearer view of the big Hollywood sign? I find Hollywood itself being really peaceful if you walk around from all the main attraction. We enjoyed our walk around Beechwood Drive and took lots of amazing photos. Along the way, we also saw a lot of hikers hiking up the the hill just to catch a better glimpse of Hollywood sign.If you think my reviews have been helpful to you, please click 'Yes' for 'Was this review helpful?'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelQueenie365

50,Touristy but good people watching,"Just walking up & down Hollywood blvd is always a good people watching time. Take the redline metro, go to Hollywood/highland or Hollywood/vine. Not about the stars, but the whole wandering experience.A must 4 all tourists & locals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8kobe24

30,You have to Visit at least Once,"The Walk of Fame is just a sidewalk to most residents, but it is an integral part of Hollywood. Many people enjoy looking down at the stars to read the names as they stroll along, thinking that these are momentos placed in that particular location when that famous entertainment entity (usually a person, living or past) was honored in a ceremony especially focused on their achievement in that area - television, radio, movies, etc. Everyone finds someone that they feel is an icon. My daughter likes finding Donald Duck near the El Capitan theater, where many Disney movies are premiered. My mom got excited to find Dean Martin. It doesn't cost anything, except for the price to pay to find a place to park nearby. There are plenty of eateries around, including the famous Musso and Frank's. People will see many free-lance ""super-heroes"" in costume strolling around, especially near Hollywood & Highland. These ""performers"" will pose in a photo with anyone, but they do expect a gratuity of some kind, so a visitor should be aware of that expectation. It's an inexpensive souvenir and a way to remember that you were in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RangerBobN
50,Entertaining and Exciting!,Come to Hollywood and experience the excitement of the Walk Of Fame and enjoy the many impersonators and their talents which they do freely share!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5197KCcarolb
30,Its alright for locals but other people from different place is good place.,"Lots have change the last time I was in Hollywood. There good names on the walk. But avoid people who ask about tour guide and ask for money for exchange for service. My best advice is.pack light or don't bring a bag hide the camera much as possible. So you be brother and scam you, They detect a tourist from a mile away. Food is expense but all and all is good for first time visitors, I volunteers some time to guide my special is metro travel maps from lax to Los angeles area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iactivenet
40,Get there early,If you arrive there early it is not so crowded and you can take your time looking at the stars and taking pictures. Beware that there are people trying to sell tours. Research online any tours and the further in the higher the prices. I was curious and I got a brochure for a tour and the man was eager to reduce it half price. We were not interested in seeing movie stars home so we passed plus we had gotten free tickets to a show. Walking is best to see everything in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/739ilened
30,Quick trip to see the stars,"We found some on street parking, walked about 4-5 blocks worth of stars, and left. The amount of people trying to get you to take their CD or do a Hollywood tour was kind of annoying. Like the Hollywood sign, it was a nice experience to see the stars in person once in our lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlustfamily17
40,So much History...,"... and so much to see.We loved looking at all the stars and if you search some of the internet sites, it gives you the exact location of stars you might be interested in locating quickly.

40,Sightseeing!,"Had so much fun on the Hollywood walk of fame, there is always something happening. Lots of activities and performances to see. Loved walking around and taking photos of all the stars of my fav celebs. Never a dull moment, there is always something going on. Everyone was always smiling which was awesome to see and be a part of. I would highly recommend checking it out if you're into movies and celebrities or just hollywood in general :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sue-add
40,Never seen a pavement like it,It was great to finally visit something i've seen on so many movies. We were both mesmorised by all the stars in the pavement. It was quite busy to stop and take photos but we managed to take a few. There were lots of people dressed up as cartoon characters which makes the atmosphere interesting. If you have kids they'll love it! We tied the trip in with a visit to Madame Tussauds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KTKate1983
40,Famous 'must do' in Hollywood,"This is a very busy street so it can be difficult to stop at times and read the stars. There are many street vendors and performers and we felt flustered by the hawkers hassling us to buy music CDs. Keep your wits about you! Regardless, we were glad we took the Hollywood Walk of Fame!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeAdelaide
30,OK.,"It's interesting to see the stars' names on the stars, but unless you're a huge fan of some star, or a movie buff, it's probably of no more than passing interest.The big names seem to be dotted around the Hollywood/Highland Metro station. Also dotted around here are endless tourist traps: touts and other pests keep trying to give you flyers, and they can be quite persistent.Be aware that the area isn't particularly nice: souvenir shops, beggars, and apparent drug activity. It seems safe enough, and I had no trouble day or night as a female walking alone in the area. But be careful and alert, especially at the eastern end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Atheoretical
30,Worth a visit,"We went to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in January this year while on holiday in LA. Obviously it is something anyone visiting LA will want to do and I would recommend it. It is good to see the Stars names on the sidewalk and you can walk around and get pictures as you desire. The Chinese Theater is also worth a look. The area itself I admit is not what I thought it would be, crowded, lots of people trying to sell you stuff or handing CD's out then wanting money.This surprised me a bit, however it is safe and certainly not threatening and in hindsight probably adds to the atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BryanC904
30,Good tourist spot,"If you are visiting Hollywood then you need to visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame. However, be prepared to be disappointed.The walk of fame is good for visiting the Chinese Theatre etc, however the rest of the road is filled up with run down shops.Although a world famous attraction, the walk itself has been left to ruin, and looks quite dirty/grubby and not the razzle dazzle of Hollywood that you expect.The strip is full of people trying to sell you and other tourists tours, merch and even people dressed up as famous characters will let you have a photo taken with them. Groups of men selling cd's can be a bit pushy, but just be firm and walk past them.If you are in LA visit the walk of fame, but don't allocate too much time to the walk itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MQ85

20,Awful.. wouldn't stay in that area again!!! Too many Tourists.,"We thought we would stay on Hollywood Blvd this time around thinking it would be fun for the kids.... What a mistake, it was very very crowded, every time we had to get to our hotel which was Loews on Hollywood boulevard we had to Fight the crowds on the street, hollywood blvd was always Crowded with tourists , we could hardly move and even the kids were getting annoyed with the many dressed up characters annoying us to take pic's,we were constantly trying to fight the crowds just walking down the street. I wouldn't recommend staying in that area again especially during holiday season.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanandshane
50,The famous,"The much famous Hollywood walk of fame....You have to try hard to find you favorite actors name on the street. Good place to hang out, be it food, shopping or just buying souvenirs. Madam Tussauds is also situated on the same street, so you can go & visit that too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Divyastransitstory
50,Worth a visit,This is definitely worth a visit if in the LA or Hollywood area. Spans many blocks. Is a must see because it is so legendary.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LBama529
40,"It's fun, but it's wacky too!","It's fun to look at all of the stars along the Hollywood Walk of Fame. My kids and I had a good time seeing if we all knew who was featured along the way. It's wacky just because of the impersonators and characters who are also there, posing for pictures for money, etc. Definitely an experience but not an end-all be-all kind of thing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happymallqueen
50,A chance to see mementoes of your favourite celebrities,"2400 plaques set in the sidewalk of Hollywood Boulevard which are attractively presented and beautifully maintained. Not surprising really when it costs the ""recipient"" $30.000 to be preserved for posterity",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johnandsue2014
30,Don't plan your trip around this,"Yes it's a one-of-a -kind 'thing'. That said, there is SO MUCH MORE to see in our city. If you come to Hollywood Blvd. you can't help but walk on these stars. By the Chinese theater you can even have your own star and picture taken with it for $$. Lots of made-up Hollywood characters who will pose with you, again, for a couple $. Just like in Rome, at the Coliseum. If you are a tourist, have your picture taken, give them a buck or two and you have a memory of your visit. They need a couple bucks. They are doing what they can to entertain you 'and survive'.Many from around the world want to visit and see Hollywood. Please do so but remember much of it is cheesy but safe fun. Check out Universal City or other studio tours to 'really' see the workings of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hal49

20,this is basic and old and has nothing wow about it at all,"The walk of fame is old and dirty and beware some tour operators charge you to take you there when you can simply walk along it free of charge. The footpaths and stars and hand prints etc are dirty and faded and dull and lack any wow about them at all.IF I was there and walked passed you might as well take a look, but if you missed it on your trip, you didn't miss much at all.I definataley wouldn't pay for a tour to it, its nothing special or exciting at all",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BjL461
30,Over rated and avoid at night,"The TV makes this place look glamorous and it couldn't be further from the truth. Its always packed, yes there are lookalikes you can take a picture with and the chinese theatre but having been here twice now I cant help but feel it's sleazy and I would not want to be there at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickic310

20,"""A hive of scum and villany""","After visiting Yosemite and the Monterey area, this 'attraction' is really shown up for what it is - a dirty, boring traipse past tacky shops, with the occasional point of mild interest (""Look, there's the Chinese Theatre."" ""Great. Now let's go somewhere less awful""). Pants, but if you are in LA, is it not compulsory?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StandonZanzibar
40,Alwaya a vibrant place to spend an afternoon,You never know what you will find here. make an stop at the hard rock cafe and buy something. Have wings at hotters accross the street. Pick the place rigth on the window so you can continue looking outside. Go up the stairs at the mall if you want a more formal dinner. Plenty of things to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/139victorg
50,Blocks and blocks,We only walked a few blocks on each side of the road. It kind of takes you back down memory lane seeing stars from time past. A nice stroll. since it was superbowl Sunday I heard the crowd was light and on regular days it's much harder to stop along the way to gaze. It appears they are in no particular order so not sure how you find a particular star you might want to see unless you google it or buy the map.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129michelleh
40,A lot of fun but be ready to be approached...a lot!,"I gave it 4 stars only because this area is swarming with people trying to get you to buy something or give them money. Every 5 steps someone is asking if you want to take a tour or a homeless person asking for help. Your best bet is to just say no. The area is somewhat dirty but with that many people walking around on any given day, it'd be hard to keep up with, I'd imagine.That being said, this is truly great place to visit at least once in your life. There is so much to do that you cannot ever say you were bored. If you're into movies and music, it's cool to see all the stars. If you're into checking out shops, there are a ton. If you want food, a ton of that. You can get everyone you know a Hollywood souvenier on any block of that entire street.We have been twice now and I would absolutely go back. If not for the sites, for the people watching because that is fantastic! Every kind of person there you can imagine. We even got to see a red carpet movie premier take place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeidiD245

40,Interesting place,You need to experience this for yourself. The stars are neat but you will get as much enjoyment from the people. Don't forget to stroll on Vine as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chiefly1
30,Nice to say we were there,"While in the LA area, we thought we would see the Hollywood stars on the walk of fame and all I can really say is that its just ok. I don't regret going there and we were able to take a few pictures of some of the stars - it was cool to get one of Walt Disney. He's one of my middle daughter's favorites (and mine).We had a nice enough time strolling down Hollywood Blvd, but I will say that there is someone on every street corner trying to stop you to buy a guided bus tour of the stars. It got really annoying after a while and you learn to avoid them very quickly. We also parked a fair distance away from the main attractions like the Dolby Theater and Chineese Theater, so it was a bit of a walk but it was easy and inexpensive parking that far out. The down side is that it is not in the greatest area, but was ok since it was daytime when we visited. I guess I'm glad I experienced it, but there is absolutely no reason to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJC313
30,Overrated,"I really think this is overrated. I went when I was young and remember thinking it was awesome. However, I recently went back with my parents and we were there about 5 minutes and left. The majority of what you see are stars with names. The handprints are the coolest part and most of the celebrities I would have wanted to see weren't there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660ericar

30,Not so Hollywood,"We arrived in Hollywood at our hotel and thought we would take a stroll down to the walk of fame and have a look around,i had been told by a few friends that the walk of fame isn't that flash and they were certainly right. Lots of homeless people and the footpath were the stars are is all broken and its really rough looking area. But i must stay it was quite an experience and it didn't ruin my time there at all,just wasn't really what you think it would be being HOLLYWOOD.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/451damiene
10,Don't go!!! Really!!,"Hollywood Blvd probably has the largest collection of creepy people trying to sell tours, give you their music, and rip you off than anywhere else in the world. They were constantly in our group's faces annoying us constantly.Seeing a bunch of stars with people's names on them is really not that exciting. Trust me. It's rather boring.The Chinese Theater is OK, but most of the movie stars have been dead for decades. And that's the location where the greatest concentration of creeps were found.If Hollywood would get rid of the pestering, creepy people, it might be an average place to visit. But in its current state, just stay away. It's not worth the $15 we paid to park our van.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gallascpa

50,Mecca of Pop Culture,A trip to LA would not be complete without a stop at the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

On the weekends the clubs and restaurants take over a lot of the on street parking which is way stupid in my opinion. becareful on the weekends there's been some shootings and fights going on in the streets ( little dangerous) and you will see lots of homeless and strange people. check out the farmers market on Sunday over on Selma and Cosmo lots to see and eat :) enjoy but like I say just stick to an all day parking option rather looking for a parking meter.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/513KimC513

Then, from there, one of our friends really wanted to walk along the Hollywood Walk of Fame to find Ellen Degeneres' star. Little did we know, the ""walk"" goes on for blocks and blocks. We probably went a mile or more before we finally came to the chosen star. Once you get past the hundreds of relentless stalkers begging you to take their tour, you start to get into the more grungy areas filled with seedy looking shops, homeless people and unpleasant smells. The streets were dirty at best and not that interesting. I'd rather reminisce about these old hollywood stars by browsing their IMDb pages than looking at decrepit stars on the ground. Don't waste your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shylamm
50,Great,Loved the visit here in 1980. Such a busy area.The Chinese Theather is close by as well as many shops and restaurants where the stars go from time to time.So exciting to visit where Marilyn Monroe had been.Just fabulous.

10,"Dirty, tacky, noisy street","As a longtime resident of Los Angeles, it has long mystified me why people would spend their hard-earned vacation dollars on a trip to Hollywood. It's just a dirty urban street with way too many tacky souvenir shops and tourist attractions such as Madame Toussaud's and Ripley's Believe It or Not. So there are pink stars on the sidewalk with names of famous people. So what. Also on the same sidewalk are gum wrappers, fast food cups and homeless people. You will never see an actual movie star on Hollywood Boulevard. Yet the people keep coming. The street is packed at night, especially on weekends, with tourists seeking...what? A glimpse of old Hollywood? Never happen. The one thing Hollywood Walk of Fame has is some very good street performers. Otherwise it's like a dirty, tacky version of Las Vegas. Sorry, I completely fail to see the appeal of this place. Visitors to Los Angeles would be much smarter to spend their time elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spicegrrl

50,Don't miss this,"Taking all things into consideration, I would do this again. On the good side, you've seen so much of this in movies and on TV that you'll feel like you already know your way around. There's a lot to see and a lot of history to soak in. On the bad or sad side, the sidewalks are also populated with out-of-work, would-be actors playing dress-up and hoping you'll pay them to take your picture with them. It's quite a freak show. I took a picture of my wife and it happened that Mickey Mouse was walking in the background and he approached me and lectured me that I have no right to use his image without him being compensated.

30,Walk of Fame,"It goes on for ever. Dirty and smelly, if you didnt notice the stars on the ground, you could miss it completely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeresaPhoebe
40,Touristy but worth the memories,"Every city has sites that are tourist traps. It's difficult to visit LA without stopping at least once in Hollywood to experience the Walk of Fame. It's like a walk down memory lane. As you see the Hollywood stars on the sidewalk you recall movies or songs from childhood or more current. Some are unknown and that's the fun of it all - look up those names and find out why they are so important to Hollywood. Then as you approach the Chinese theatre you encounter the famous cement handprints. It doesn't take much time and it can be crowded, but it's worth a visit. There are some incredible artists a part of this space. There are several good restaurants within 3-4 blocks, and you aren't too far from Sunset Blvd if that interests you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssm6
30,Tick the box,If you're in LA and near Hollywood then you'd be hard pushed not to stumble on the Walk of Fame. Nothing hugely special but worth doing as a tourist just once to see who you can find (I claim Henry Winkler as my first star since it was the first one I stood on getting off the tour bus). Don't just stick to the ones around the Chinese Theatre. I suppose if you're really keen then you should get a map of who's star is where.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aldolara
30,Walk of Weird,The Hollywood walk of fame is neat but too many people around to even see which stars you are stepping on! Neat to visit but don't expect to spend much time around here unless you can deal with the crowds. Also- too many people dressed up as impersonators creeped me out...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cndnyogagirl

40,Hollywood Memories forgotten.,"If you are 50+ or a Turner Classic movie fan, this is for you. Your kids won't remember but a few names. I grew up in the area and remember Hollywood Blvd being a fun place. Now it's rundown and sad. The stars on the Blvd. are absent of upkeep. They are dirty and cracked. But hey, it is Old Hollywood. You will have to navigate the street performers, character picture posers and street hustlers begging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurieGearhart
50,Tourist trap but must do,"This area is a total ocean of tourists and locals trying to take advantage of their vacation money. Street performers abound for photo ops. The madam's wax museum is here along with the famous Chinese theater.. And of course the Hollywood star sidewalk. Despite all the cheese, this place is fun! Must see when in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catmalways4ever
30,Sorry I just don't get it...,"I was warned I would be underwhelmed and man was I. I drove past this spot and just took one look and decided I didn't want to get out. Not a nice trip, as others have mentioned you can see you are going to get harassed by hucksters. The stars themselves are just names on the sidewalk, not a whole lot to it. Save the time, drive by and go do something else thats more fun. I guess if you are a huge movie buff its worth stopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomHNJ
30,Very crowded but kind of a must-see,"I think it's worth it to go there at least once, just to see what it's about. Certain areas can get very crowded, though, and I got harassed from all different angles - ""starving artists"" handing out free CDs of their music, a woman on a bullhorn screaming about Jesus, the church of scientology handing out tickets and info, stores handing out coupons, etc. I had to keep smiling politely and saying ""no thank you, no thank you"". And that's not even mentioning all the ""characters"" hanging out - anyone from Elmo to Michael Jackson to Spiderman, although they all left me alone (probably because I had no kids with me). It was nice to see some of the stars, though, but if you want to find a specific star you should find out ahead of time where it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShevaLew
10,Go only if you must,"Yes it's worth a visit to say you have been but that's about it. It's dirty, crowded, constantly getting harassed by your companies and people dressed in smelly costumes.

The walk it self is dirty, run down and in need of a lot of tlc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timbX493ZC
50,Great place to view the Hollywood sign!,"It was very crowded but we first visited the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the afternoon. We paid $30 to park and we stayed about a hour and half. It was very cool to see the Chinese Theater and all the stars on the sidewalk. You don't need a lot of time there at all. We went back to the Hollywood Walk of Fame a second time (this time in the early morning and it was much less crowded) only because we were told that the mall there (Hollywood and Highland Center, 6801 Hollywood Blvd Hollywood, CA 90028) was a great place to view the Hollywood sign. We went to the 3rd level and it was a perfect viewing area! Great photo op! We also parked in the H & H Center's garage and this time it cost us $2! We had to get our parking ticket validated though. ($2 parking for up to 2 hours with validation from participating shops, restaurants and nightclubs) We bought a snow globe from a small vendor in the mall and they validated our parking ticket. I wish we had known about this parking garage a few days earlier! All in all, it is a must do when visiting L.A. I'm glad we did it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferkL2613YE
40,Always something to do,"Hollywood Walk of Fame is a must do when in LA. Fun to watch the hand / feet / star tiles of the famous. But also always something going on in that area. Watch out for the artists that want to take a picture with you. They forget to mention that there is a USD 5 to USD 10 charge to taking a picture with them. Kids will love it, but overpriced to take a picture with a unemployed actor in a costume pretending to be Charly Chaplin, right? Parking in the area is a nightmare, but try parallel streets a block away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DannyR956
30,Visit once and that's it,"Extremely crowded, lots of people attempting to take pictures, vendors trying to sell you random tickets and maps etc. I'd definitely recommend going at least once because it's fun to find your fave. movie star's ""star"" but other than that it's kind of gross around this area in Hollywood. A lot of trash everywhere and it is extremely difficult to find a parking spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiintCraft
10,Avoid!,"While the movies like to make people think this is a place you will see celebrities... It's really a location to avoid at all costs. Overly aggressive panhandlers dressed as movie characters, 3 shootings in the past 3 months, and it's extremely dirty. Unless you're going to a live taping of Jimmy Kimmel Live, you're better off paying extra money and headed to universal studios!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamezn2014

20,Yuck,"Definitely good to go visit it once but wasn't very impressed at all. It is a run down street in the middle of Hollywood with oodles of people and hustlers bugging you for something so you can give them money. Not very glamorous considering the stars it named after. Glad I was staying in Santa Monica not around Hollywood. Seen it once, now won't have to go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristyPan

30,Worth A Quick Visit,A visit to Hollywood would be strange without seeing the walk of fame. But it is very busy with simple masses of people and even more people trying to sell you a CD or a tour. I suggest you go in the morning as it's not as busy as the afternoon or evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GK_10_1972
40,Worth the visit,Miles of stars and all known industry personnel. Worth the walk. Flowers on Elvis Presly is still on. Too many fakes on the road and all wants money.still the glamour is great,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nouzab
40,Nice family day exploring Walk of Fame,"Our Family of 5 with 3 teens had a nice half day on the WOF after taking some pics on the scenice overpass with the Hollywood sign. The WOF was longer then we thought and didnt realize it was on both sides of the street. Lots of characters kind of like times sq. like we had heard from others, so we knew what to expect. Stopped for nice lunch and some great drinks at Cabo Cantina. Nice day to get out and walk around an dtake some pics of the stars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffpags
50,Great walking activity,I picked up a brochure with the stars listed alphabetically along with the street number. This made our walk and search for specific stars really easy! Great if you have favorites you want your pics!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/12jennifera
50,Nostalgia by foot power,"So many stars long gone brought back so many memories of amazing films and TV shows that are also long gone. I hadn't expected to be so caught up in discovering what person I'd find next. The Hollywood Walk of Fame goes on and on for many blocks and both side of the street. I was there during the week between Christmas and New Years and the streets were crowded with people of every type, families, teenagers, adults, children--all having fun finding names they knew. The young people had names common to their life; however nostalgia ruled the day! People were very helpful if you wanted to photograph a name special to you. They gave you space and kept other people from walking over that star. The whole experience was a very nostalgic and delightful one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pineaway
40,Hollywood must see.,"Don't expect too much, the walk of fame is a little tacky but interesting also, we walked the whole thing on a Sunday morning, perfect time, no hassle from street sellers / performers and no crowds, uninterrupted and so peaceful, around 8-9am is the best time, some real interesting sights to see along the Walk of Fame, glad we did it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damof2014
30,disappointed,I thought the walk of fame was a big deal. I found out that a person nominates another person and that person pays a couple of hundred dollars and they get their own star. It was really cool to see the actual foot and hand prints at Grauman's theater. I also recommend their tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jlh475
10,Dissapointed - off the bucket list won't go back again,"We lived in LA for over 20 years and never once visited before. We have lived in NC for over 14 years now and during our visit to LA for the holidays my 15 yr old son asked that we took him to visit the famous walk of fame. Though it was a weekday the place was very crowded and dirty. Lot's of people trying to sell you anything and everything. I even saw someone trying to sell a recorded Rap CD to a foreigner, taking advantage of him not understanding the value of American money. A performer who not only used extreme foul language but sexual gestures as well. Several homeless, drunks and drug dealers. The positive: We did enjoy looking at the different stars and taking pictures of some. OFF THE BUCKET LIST!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tita39
40,"If you're there, worth a stop.","Not as much there as I expected, but I did enjoy both the Terminator 3-D show and the horror make up show.

Definitely not the number one attraction at Universal Studios though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbH886

40,Check it off your bucket list,"I've seen the Walk of Fame three times over the past 25 years, and I'm a bit shocked. Other reviewers are correct. Many of the stars are cracked and in disrepair. And more and more stars honor people who you've never heard of. I'm sure that there is no money for upkeep. I have to wonder how the stars get cracked anyway. But, I still enjoy the Walk of Fame immensely as I do the entire Hollywood & Highland area. I like what one reviewer compared it to. If you don't go here, it's like peanut butter without jam. Nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldhickory5
40,Must be done; surprisingly tacky surroundings :-),"We came here with a mission to photograph David Bowie's star on the ""walk of fame"". Job done, picture taken, can go home now.Well, not quite. It's an iconic sight, and free, and easily accessible via the Metro Red Line to Hollywood and Vine or Hollywood and Highland. Plus you get to see some other attractions (the Chinese Theatre) as you walk. A fairly quick and easy sightseeing option.There are quite a few international brand shops, but also quite a few tacky goods shops and tattoo parlours. If you think about it, it's all part of the Hollywood package.Come, see, enjoy, don't take it too seriously.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjb1001
30,Concrete sidewalk stars,"There really isn't much to say about this. It's a sidewalk, they put stars on it with names. Some you will recognize, most you won't. It really is something to see if you are going from point A to point B, it should not be the only reason to go to Hollywood. Sidewalks are mostly dirty, cracked and littered. There are homeless laying about and hawkers selling ""star"" tours and Scientology. But it is entertainment while walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathym505
50,Must do,I would highly recommend you to do this in the early morning as it will be less crowded then and you will be able to get photos with your favorite star's star.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sj1991
40,No matter - you have to go!,"A visit to LA without going here is like peanut butter without jam. There are the usual ""tacky tourist"" T-shirt and junk shops but also lots to see and many landmarks in the area. We stayed out of the tourist trap museums and stuck to visiting the historical/famous sights along with the Stars embedded in the walkway. Also did some great shopping. A bit crowded but lots of people watching and fun things to see. Would certainly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/847ca
20,Checked it off our list and will never return,"As we were visiting LA, we felt we had to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was a few days after Elvis' birthday and there were flowers from fans all around his star, which I thought was cool. The other highlight was the actual handprints in cement in front of the Chinese Theater, especially seeing Shirley Temple's. Other than that, the walk was a complete tourist trap. Cheap souvenir stores, chain restaurants and stereotypical museums line the way. The whole area was dirty and people accost you constantly to buy things - we counted over 32 people asking us to buy a tour alone. That's not counting the ""characters"", everyone from Thor to Spider-Man, all cheesy and all expecting $ for a picture. It's uncomfrtable watching them vying for attention from tourists. And then the CD's...that they hand you like they are free, then ask for a donation. If you do go, practice saying ""NO"" over and over, because you will have to do so probably have to say it 100 times through the walk....or it will cost you a small fortune.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cc20122013
40,Nice Free Attraction-be ready,"Read the parking signs nearby, and if you are planning to take your time walking make sure you know your cost. Also, be ready to be attacked...yes attacked...by people selling you Hollywood rides. Be aware, ultimately these rides are going to show you hedges. Most of the stars have Privacy Hedges around their place, so you aren't going to see much. Still, for free, this is a fun way to spend time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alh45
40,Fun!,"Yes it's busy and you might miss some names but it's well worth coming and seeing who you can spot! Take an hour, stroll down the boulevard and see some stars :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaraL495
30,A little disappointing if you don't know what to expece,"This is a very dirty, shady part of town. You need to be prepared to be hounded by the people trying to sell you tours and merchandise. Also get ready for crowds of people and lots of traffic. If there is a certain star you want to see, research it first because it is a large area. But, it is something to see at least once. Just be prepared!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzyB818

40,"Fun , Hollywood thing to do","Even if you are not a celebrity worshiper it is interesting to walk down the street looking at the stars . It's easy enough to ignore the beggars , promoters and costumed folk . We wandered around mid afternoon . It was very busy and there were a few police keeping an eye on everything .As I get older it is nice to see some of the entertainers from my youth still get the recognition by having their stars there . Although it makes me wonder why some ""talent"" are able to get a star .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skwiki
40,Keep your expectations realistic!,"I wouldn't go on a vacation to Hollywood with the specific purpose in mind of looking at the Hollywood Walk of Fame. But it is a really nice way to spend some time. Having seen the stars on the television and movies so much, I found it really interesting to have a walkabout.The stars themselves stretch a good way and cover the sidewalk; it gets crowded so I would advise against walking with your head pointing down, however! My advise is to choose an actor or actress that you really like and search out their star. Again, be careful of the crowds. I went in the height of summer and there were a LOT of people. This presents a lot of opportunity for a pickpocket to target you, especially in the heat which disallows you to hide your valuables inside your clothes. I would feel uncomfortable carrying valuables in these crowds. Carry only what you need! However, the crowds rarely became a problem.There are a bunch of other cool things to take a look at. People in costume dot the landscape and I saw a member of the Harlem Globetrotters doing tricks on the street. Particularly impressive was how he signed an autograph for a boy whilst spinning a ball in the same hand.Mann's Chinese Theatre is a must-see for any movie-watcher. You can only really go onto the courtyard but in the floor are the hands and footprints of many incredibly famous and influential people. The courtyard is quite small and if you want pictures of a certain one, you better hope that nobody wanders onto it and spoils your shot, because that happened a good few times.There are a lot of good restaurants nearby and some fun other attractions such as the Ripley's museum or the waxworks down the road.Getting there is easy and there's a lot of parking available. Be aware of safety inside the city though, LA seems to be built really strangely and poor areas rub right up against rich areas. This means we went through some pretty dodgy-looking neighbourhoods on the way in. Nowhere else have I ever seen a mansion next door to government-subsidised housing.Last but not least: It has to be said! This is a tourist trap. Don't go here expecting to see celebrities or experience real LA life. Also be careful for people hawking things at you, especially CDs or guided tours. They cost much more than it's worth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesD485
40,Fun visit - look for your favorites,"Always fun and interesting to walk around, and if you're part of a walking tour, to hear a few stories behind the stars. Who didn't show up, what they have to pay to get a star, etc,Characters abound in a busy, pretty safe atmosphere, and it's free. A way to spend some time, get photo ops,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cands2
40,Interesting and exciting!,"I have to say, I thought after reading so many negative reviews I would have the worst time here, but honestly it's about perspective. There are people who try and sell you CDs or try and get you on their tours and what not, but just ignore it. If you just go there to look at the stars and take it all in then you'll have a great time. You'll see the Chinese theatre also where many actors and actresses have signed their names and foot and hand prints into the cement, it's all part of the experience. It's busy, it's crowded, but it's exciting and a special moment when you find the star of an actor or actress you love.! Expect to be approached on the street but be polite enough to say not today and keep walking. It's not a big deal. Just enjoy where you are.!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmarnich

It was a walk down memory lane that brought back lots of memories of movies and stars we hadn't thought about in years. This history of this place is incredible. Of course there were lots of people, gift shops and all the usual traps you'd expect in Hollywood or any large city, but then that is all part of the experience. We felt safe and welcomed everywhere we went, and for a Midwest family from a town of 1500 this was a bit of a culture shock but still very exciting.

40,Obviously very busy but worth a look!,"Didn't find Katharine Hepburn but saw lots of Hollywood idols, more atmospheric around Graumann's theatre where the hand and foot prints are",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliSparkes
30,Not what I expected,"We toured the Hollywood walk of fame and I realized that it was Rosebowl week there, but there were so many people you couldn't see any of the stars on the sidewalk or in front of the Chinese Theater. Alot of hustlers looking for a quick buck and we were warned about them and pick pocketers. It is old and I do realize the history of it, but I was disappointed that we didn't get the full impact of the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zimabeer
30,Shiny and nice for a walk.,"You sure will see all the amazing stars, actors, actress, producers, musicians and many more while walking on this walk of fame located in Hollywood. It made a unique style to the street. Yes, there will be a lot of tourists and people around, which means that it is really crowded and you might not get to see all of the stars on the street. It was sad that some stars were pretty broken. However it was very fancy walking on this street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jumpjjujumjump
40,It's all about your expectations,"This is one of those iconic locations that a person must see once when traveling to LA.Are there homeless people there? Yes.Are there tons of tour operators constantly approaching you to take their tour? Yes.Is it crowded with tourists? Yes.But I expect that you would find those things at every major tour attraction within a city anywhere in the world.I probably won't hurry back, but I am glad we went once!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m0ml0vest0travel
30,Tourist Mecca,"It's not the greatest but seems most have to make the pilgrimmage, if you've ever watched a movie, TV or bought music. Many kneel to get their happy snap with their favourite ""stars"". The tour buses leave from here, the souvenir shops, the costumed folk, the CD sellers, all good fun. The Metro Highland station is right here also. On a nice Sunday the sidewalks are jammed and overflowing.The old concrete foot and handprints are fun, there's some new shopping mall and after dark the lights come on.For some fictional aspects of the area read Joseph Wambaugh's ""Hollywood *"" series of cop novels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Polsixe
20,I expected for more,I became disappointed with what I had seen in Hollywood. Just small stars with the names of celebrities. It really did not appeal me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/177m_rcioc
20,Don't stay long,"We go to the place just want to take some tourist picture and tick off our checking list. The place is quite messy. there are many homeless people and many street musician trying to sell their album. Once your hand touched their album, you must buy it. And there are many characters on street like superman, they will ask whether you want a picture or not, but you need to pay.So I would suggest just take some pictures and move on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Micro-Young
20,Big deal,"Overrated , crowded , dirty & lots of tacky shopsSo its a series of stars on a footpath with names in them - big dealVisit the Getty Centre instead",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wildcrazygoats
30,Interesting but overrated,"Worth visiting to tick off on your bucket list but move on after a short visit. Can be seedy, but safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesH659
10,Dirty place,What a hole homeless people everywhere dirty properly the worst place I've seen in my life give this place a wide berth.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasons43
20,Busy busy busy,We only visited this attraction for our daughter as she wanted to take some photos with the stars (not sure why). It was overcrowded and overrated. We then bought her something in order to get the parking ticket validated and were still charged the full rate!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katherineh100
30,Not glamorous at all (but still cool),"If you are a foreigner like me you may be under the impression that the walk of fame is all about glamour. After all that is what Hollywood is known for. But reality could not be further from the idea. The place is so crowed you can not even read the stars in the ground. People are constantly asking you for money, being for a local hip-hop cd collection, animal shelter, souvenirs, picture with lookalikes, etc. It can get pretty busy. Be warned!Still, for cinema lovers is a must see. Finding your favorite famous person/band/character name in the walk is a lot of fun. Hollywood Blvd has a lot of shops as well so it is a good spot for shopping clothes and souvenirs. The Chinese Theater is particular beautiful at evening, when the lights are lit. Also, I would suggest to try the street hot-dog. Delicious!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShigueS
40,Find your favs,It was fun looking for your favorite stars. Be prepared to be accosted by many people soliciting tours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoffBChampaign
20,Nothing special,If I compare it with many other sites which I have seen the Walk of Fame is quiet boring with a lot of people around selling many products.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ivana1889
40,A must see !,"Hollywood walk of fame wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be , we did however come out of Hollywood and highland straight into a film premier which was fab ! Be sure to check out all the hand and footprints outside the Chinese theatre !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misskate1985
10,Give the Walk of Fame a miss!,"My family & I visited this much publicized area in Hollywood last week. To our dismay it is a busy, dirty, over-crowded area full of opportunists trying to beg or con money out of you. Felt very unsafe & we were abused when we ignored them, even if you gave them money the day before! Held onto our children's hands for dear life & our wallets. Lots of dodgy people selling dodgy tours - again we got abused when we politely said no thanks. It was a shame as it was the entrance to a lovely shopping centre, movies theatres, Madame Tussades famous wax museum, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/54janinem
30,Fun to see the stars and find your favorites,On our way to dinner we walked the walk of fame and had a fun time looking for our favorite stars. Many we didnt know so maybe we were in the wrong area or it goes much further than where we were looking. There are a number of people dressed up as different characters such as Marilyn Monroe that approach you to take your photo with them for a fee. Funny and hokey. If you are in from out of town and you are in the area it is fun to take a few minutes to check it out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyPeter
30,"Note that it's very long, and not what you see in the movies","Started off at one end of the boulevard, and couldn't even believe where I was. No real tourists, just lots of dodgy people trying to sell you hollywood tours in dodgy trucks around dodgy shops. Do NOT go to that side - never heard of 99% of those 'stars' in my life.But when we drove further down it got more touristy with Ghiradelli's and hard rock cafe etc. and with some stars of actual famous people",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/152stephaniel
40,You will see everything,"It was a lot of walking. Make sure and bring a stroller for the little ones. The kids liked seeing all the stars. We also had a perfect view of the Hollywood sign. My kids saw Spiderman, a Minion and a man buying pot on the corner. Hey, it's Hollywood...just keep walking. And don't come at night with your family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockinMomma
40,Hectic,"We wanted to get here to see the wonderful sites and i have to admit it was very hectic.We only had a few hrs and wanted to see all the most important sites.we were offered a tour that would take us to all the famous homes and sites but turned it down because we didn't have enough time. We were then approached by another fly by night tour that we wished we wouldn't have takin…. I wouldn't waste time touring the streets of the famous homes etc,etc because you can't see them anyways with all the gates and hedges and such. The Walk of Fame was pretty amazing and we found goggling where the stars where that we wanted to see was just as quick and easy as asking. We saw Graumans Theatre from the outside which looked cool,wish we would've had more time to see the inside. I would suggest googling the best place to view the Hollywood sign,because it's very hectic trying to get to it so we missed our shot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mhgaidin
20,walk of fame ....more like walk of shame,"This was one of my must do's in LA like 100% of other tourists.But it was a big let down ,the stars on the floor are cool but walking down the ""walk of fame"" you are constantly bugged by bus tour operators trying to get you on there awful tours of LA. The whole strip is dirty and full of homeless people. biggest let down of my time in LA !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/padz88
50,Where is your star?,"If you come to LA you can't but go to Walk of Fame. We have taken hop on-hop off city guided tour and started at the Walk of Fame. This place attracts many people from all over the world. And not only tourists. Some people in a specific dress and make up offer people to make pictures with them for some money. Life in LA is hectic, Americans say that it is crazy. In the corner there is a large souvenir shop where you can find T-shirts, magnets, calendars, etc. But I would like to mention key rings. You may find some for the members of your family, boss and colleagues, friends and neighbours. When I was in the USA I criticized the quality of food. If you want to have real soup and European meal go the the Central railway station. There in a small restaurant you will come back to European traditions!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlorenceBead
10,"Overrated, crowded with solicitors","The place is filled with solicitors trying to sell you CD's, tours, super hero's trying to pose etc. Once you politely decline they are aggressive, trying to question your decision and being rude. There were like 2 out of the 15 who solicited me, who responded back happily and left me alone. In my humble opinion, please skip this and save time. If you really cannot miss it, then just drive by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/337arung
10,Too Many Solicitors,Everyone on the dang walk of fame is trying to sell you something. You aren't even able to properly enjoy reading the stars because someone is always slipping something into your hand and then asking for money. I hated it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viralj12345
20,Gross and unimpressive,"So many people trying to sell you crap as you walk down the street. It was annoying. If you haven't gone, I'd say go but you can probably just drive by. Not worth getting out of the car unless you want a few souvenirs from one of the shops.There were a lot of homeless people in the area which added a special smell as you walked around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/40Nugget
30,Dirty and busy,"Not impressed at all. Guys on the street pushing their CD's and videos in your face for 'free' then as soon as you engage in any kind of conversation it is $10 minimum for the CD, people everywhere and did not feel overly safe while there with kids. Stars look good, but so many of them that it is hard to find any one in particular you are looking for, unless you pay $5 for a map.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simbec1973
40,The jury is still out on this one,I am really not sure how to rate or describe this place. With all the mixed reviews I wasn't sure what to expect upon reaching. Reminded me instantly of Times Square in NYC. It is obviously a personal experience. I recommend that you go and see for yourself. I got it ticked off my list of things to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammied3000
30,Quick stop and stroll was nice,"The famous sidewalk is worth a visit to see some of the 2500+ celebrity names in stars in the cement. It's easiest to park at Hollywood/Highland parking garage. Be sure to take in the area in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre where they have ceremonies and premiere movies. I enjoyed seeing the older Hollywood names and handprints in front of Grauman's. Also, check out the Dolby Theatre where the Academy Awards are held. The Dolby Theatre tour was closed the day we visited so would like to return for that. Suggest go in the morning before 10am for quick 1 hour stroll to avoid the crowds and get the best pictures. Just like any large city street, there can be large crowds, aggressive street vendors, scam artists, and homeless activity so be mindful of your family and belongings. It was worth a quick morning stroll to experience first-hand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Toby-Likes-Travel
30,"Iconic, but dirty","Obviously the Hollywood Walk of Fame is a must see based on it's rich history from Hollywood's golden age. You can see the Chinese Theater, walk the streets where thousands of premieres have happened, eat at Mel's Drive In, and place your hands in the cement castings of the stars who made Hollywood. But no one tells you about the pan handling, smell of 3day old booze, and the sales people trying to force you to sign up for the next touring departing in 5 minutes.I lived in LA for 3 years, so I visited this spot every time a friend or family member would come out to visit me. I did my fair share of tours and scouting out the souvenir shops. The two things I would recommend are the Madame Tussauds wax museum & the Hop on Hop off Big Bus Tour. The star's home tours you can do yourself in a rented vehicle with a downloaded map, and the Ripley's Believe it or Not is overrated in my opinion.Overall, this is a go to spot. Make sure you bring your camera, and be prepared to tell everyone ""I don't carry cash, sorry.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andivance
20,One of the most over rated,"Skip this. IMHO, Skip downtown LA, but that I leave up to you. When we started walking along the boulevard, the creepyness of the place, the shops and the people on the sidewalk just got to us. And then we finally reached the walk of fame. I am sure at one point of time, the stars would have been proud to have their names there, but I don't think any star would like gum being driven into their stars on a grimy sidewalk now. I am a huge movie buff, so it was great fun searching for each star and finding them, but the dirt and grime just put me off. The worst were the 'costumed characters' in front of the Chinese Theater, just looking to make a quick buck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krishna316
30,When in Hollywood....,We thought we had to do the walk of fame.... It's fantastically tacky. For the Brits think Blackpool on steroids ! Don't expect to experience that Oscar feeling it's a little like walking over grave stones playing dead or alive - and hearing randoms reading out loud when they see a name they recognise becomes a little torturous. But if you take it for what it is Dirty smelly and great for people watching it's a few hours well spent !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CurlyJus

10,Leave your kids home,"This is okay at 8am but by mid-morning it is sleazy, smelly and dirty; by evening it's a dump.?You get hassled at every turn, people trying to sell, have photos (for tips)... It's very busy and uncomfortable. Saw many unsavory things occurring. My advice- just google it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zilhills
50,every cinema fans should see that!,"When you walk in this dream street , full of tourists, you can see name and hand print in concrete .Every body stops near her favorite supper star and think about them. It is an unforgettable experience.you can watch many live concert and have fun in a wonderful atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kokabu
30,Not what we expected...,The place is a bit of a dump in my opinion. The place is not well kept.. But its one of those places you need to visit. Got sick of being harassed to buy stuff as you walk along.... but that's what it is.. Go early in the morning to avoid all the harassment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sssmour
40,My favorite actor is there!,"My all time favorite, Kevin Costner, is on the Hollywood Walk of Fame! Glad to be here in this world famous spot. I used to see it only on tv and the movies. Lucky! There are freebies, too. You get to see costumed artists portraying famous tv and movie characters. You might like to get photographed with them for a small gratuity for their effort to be lavishly dressed that way. Here's one area where you can go around in your favorite high heeled shoes and get dressed fashionably because the walks are well paved and convenient. You can go at your own pace because that's the only way you can read what's on the stars below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mvsobrepena
10,Scammers place,"Spent 5 mins there and can't wait to escape from scammers from the street. Nothing to see and do there, DO NOT WASTE your time there.

There are more exciting places in LA to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thebesteveradvisor
40,Different experience,"Was told by lots if ppl to visit the Walk of Fame. Ending up going there - its pretty different and i found the walk very nice - For a first timer in Hollywood. It was an adventure to me, that whose names will i find there..Please note that there will be heaps of dressed up characters and u will have to tip them if u take photos with them.. However regardless of that there will be ppl trying to sell u cds too.If you visit it at night i feel its a bit dangerous.. I didnt feel safe.. And another thing there arent many eateries on the walk of fame..Overall different experience..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AvishaT

Have a blast dont forget your camera smile:-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28michelle123
50,"Fun day trip, not at night","Do this visit during the day........Visit TLC theater for viewing the stars handprints/ footprints, look at the stars on sidewalk, pick a small souvinir, visit the wax museum, and if looking to take a tour of Hollywood and are visiting friends in California, see if they are signed up on living social.com. If so look for 2 for 1 coupons and you will save a lot of money. Wear comfortable clothes, but don't dress like a tourist. You will be a target. If people dressed as cartoon characters approach you, ignore them. They will try to scam you out of money. This area of Hollywood is not glamorous. It is something to visit during the day and not the evening. Don't wear flashy jewelry, don't carry a lot of credit cards/ cash, beware of your surroundings. If possible visit with people who know the area so you are not a target. Plan your day ahead of time. Research places to eat ahead of time. Visit a AAA office to help plan your trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stmartin1
40,Watch your wallet,"Great fun seeing our favorite stars. They have to be nominated for a star and pay $30,000.00 very busy. Watch your wallet as I'm sure it's easy to get focused on finding your favorite star. Those action figure actors who pose for pictures all want money. Very busy and fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NEILMAC264
30,At least I can say I have done it,"It was good and all, and I like that I have been there and seen/done it but there were too many negatives. The homeless, the characters, the people trying to sell you stuff/get you into their store are just everywhere, every 5 steps. The tour buses of people that block the walk ways and make it impossible to pass. I also had the misfortune of going on a really hot day and they had closed off the street for one of those talk shows (which might have made it worse then what it usually is like) all in all I didn't get to see much of the walk of fame - just a warning in case like me you hate crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charlyf6
40,SMALL,"Walk of Fame is good for the experience of it all and just to say ""I have been there"" next time you see it on telly or a magazine etc. It is very small. I expected something extravagant and glitzy but thats only for when they hold the awards or special events. Not bad but please note that you have to tip those people that are in costume if you take a photo with them. But interesting place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/214pepef
50,Awesome place to be. Too much action all the time.,Such a electric place to be. Too much to do around. Fun place. Must visit for every one coming to Los Angeles. Fun for the whole family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rockybuddy10
40,Up close and personal,"Gotta do it, especially if it's your first time in LA. The names cover all the disciplines and it's a fun way of spending an hour or so. Maps are available if there are ay particular artists you want to find. Watch where you're going so you don't trip over!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdt782
40,Downtown LA must do.....,"Walk the strip awhile then..and yes I thought it would be cheezy but....after doing, I recommend doing a star home tour. Here's why....It gives you a guided tour of alot of the highlights of LA in about 2 hours. We went with Starline tours with their ""no top"" vans. Book them in front of Chinese theatre. Tour guide did a great job describing the history, and other details on the tour!In spite of the large tree that fell across the road 60' in front of our tour van, hitting the wires and causing a fire in the road and a yes a minor detour !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/473craigs
20,Wait a minute,"This is not what ever travel agent had in mind! The stars in the sidewalk are interesting but the inhabitants. of the sidewalk are not. This is not a family friendly walk! I'd take the beach, a tour bus through Hollywood, but not the walk of shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/851karenn
50,When will your Star be on the Strip?,"Everyone knows about the Hollywood walk of fame , all around the world!I often dreamed of having mine on the strip oneday, Never say Never, Right?I do know for sure that my daughter Julia will be on the Walk of Fame sooner than I will.So when you come to Hollywood, a must do is take an afternoon and find all the Satrs you can!Some of my Favorites, John Wayne, Natalie Wood, Robert Redford, Christopher Plummer, on and on... so many over the years that we all love!Things can be a little crazy around the area, so be safe and do this during the daytime hours, be sure to take photos and have a Blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HawaiianIrishgirl
20,Nothing interesting,Nothing interesting except the names of stars on the floor. The walk of fame starts at the Hollywood & Highland Center and go into both direction.I didn't find a what the big fuss is about but it was a tourist thing to do so had to check it off. The best of them all was the sign for Muhammad Ali...The only star who's name is not on the floor due to same name as prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BSurahyo
50,A little walk,"We were on our way to Bora-Bora and we had a 12 hours wait for our next flight of LA X, so we decided to hop in a cab and visit Hollywood. The four of us the walk of fame is full of stars and also want to be cause it's full of people dressed in costume.it was nice to see and all the souvenir shops. We sure got some pictures taken with some off our favorite stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/detteLasalle
30,Hollywood Boulevard is not that great albeit interesting though,"There are just a bunch of stars on the sidewalk with actor and actresses names. When we were there they were setting up for a Christmas parade and it was mayhem. You could barely walk, like traffic on the sidewalk. During the week, the street was not as busy and you could walk more freely. However, there is not much to see except stars names on a sidewalk. Who cares if someones name was written on a sidewalk, how nice are they to others? Do they help the needy, feed the poor? Stars are just people not God.Why would anyone want to take a photo with a non studio authorized cartoon character is beyond me. There will also be folks trying to push CD's into your hands do not take them they will try and force you to buy them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curiouspb
30,Fun to Do,"It's not the first place on my list of things to do in Hollywood - but it can be fun if you have a star you like/follow or ( in my case) a friend of the family with a few stars (each) to follow. Think of it as a pilgrimage, avoid the ""homeless"" and you'll be fine. It's a good/fun thing to do. Iconic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCBH_1
30,Good!,"How can I put this? It's just good to see, because of the history and all. Nothing exciting here. And lots of folks trying to sell stuff and asking for guided tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trexj
50,Exciting,We came here when we were visiting family in Torrance back in 1978. Loved seeing all the stars with so many names of movie stars in them. Would love to revisit and see the additional names that have been added over the years.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dskeens
30,Good visit,Although it was a bit lack luster. The walk of fame was a must see just because of the history. It was a nice walk and neat to see people from all aspects of life. I'm glad we made the walk but nothing spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KellyB991
30,Not glamorous,Yes a place you want to see BUT I thought like many other reviews that it was going to be impressive and glamorous...People were very annoying and creepy on the street. Also there's a lot of homeless people literally laying on some stars. Do you really want to stop and look on the ground? Obviously not! That's how you feel most of the time.Don't get me wrong it's still the heart of the city of entertainment! Probably favorite place was in front of the Chinese Theater and the shopping center next to the Dolby Theater (great places to eat and enjoy the views of the Hollywood sign and LA's downtown on the other side).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1824AHmariab
40,Iconic Landmark do some research in advance,This is one of the iconic landmarks you must see when visiting Los Angeles.There are several blocks with famous Stars and if you want to take a picture with one of your idols I would recommend to use this link for reference:http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Estrellas_del_Paseo_de_la_Fama_de_HollywoodOr you can do your own research in advance for knowing the right location.Even so the walk of fame has plenty of attractions so you may want to walk the main blocks for seen the Chinese Theatre or the Kodak Theatre and some other attractions among a variety of restaurants and gift shops very attractive for the visitor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gus6
20,You really have to all the same,"Hadn't read any reviews of this spot, I mean what's the point, it's a place you have to walk along just for the sake of it and nothing else. Both sides of the street's footpath (sidewalk) are covered with the traditional ""stars"", even those that shouldn't be there 'cause they have made the news for all the wrong reasons. Be forewarned, the tour operator sprukers that lure around the area are worse than anywhere else. We drove ourselves about to get there and would have been very disappointed if we had paid to go there, but you just have to go anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glemonsec
30,OK,"This was an OK visit. Just the name Walk of fame makes us really enthusiastic and wanting to see.There are stars on the path and names after personalities, but its so crowded with so many characters going around dressed up. The Kodak theatre stands in front with its masive door .Good place for a first timer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nithi25
40,Worth a visit,"Good to do if part of a bigger day, like a tour or going to see a show etc etc. It's super touristy but hey that's what we are! It was fun to recognise lots of the people of the stars and there are some characters about so people watching here is great too ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FeeJegs

10,very dissapointing visit,"We took family to see the Hollywood walk of fame, between the characters in costumes and folks selling CDs it really was a terrible place to visit. The streets were not clean it was very crowded we had to hold onto to our children. two of the costume characters began to argue over three feet of space. our kids were shocked to see characters they watch on film act like this. We left as soon as we could. Very dissapointing place to take kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/401rickyj
10,BOOOO!,"What a disappointment! I wish I had not visited this site. What I always imagined it would be like was much better than the real thing. The area is filthy and all of the tourist crap around was disgusting. If I was a star and offered a star on the sidewalk,I would decline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Winterpeg1Winnipeg

30,"Tick it off your list, then move on","This is one of those places you've seen on TV and if you're in the neighbourhood, you visit. Yep, there are stars in the ground, but there are hustlers everywhere else. You will be accosted by several people trying to sell you a tour of the homes of the stars (we were even approached while paying for car parking!) and costumed characters, reminiscent of Las Vegas will hassle you for paid photos.

30,Over rated - don't spend too much time,"We went there on our holiday break.Felt it was bit too over rated and its too over crowded.Its a a tick in the box kind of attraction, not as glamorous as we heard of.The only place that I found interesting was the hand prints near Chinese theater.If you have enough time in your holiday itinerary then visit else you can drop it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/124ashishb
20,Crowded and pushy people,"a real disappointment, lots of badly dressed up people badgering you for pictures.I do not recommend for families, our son found it very frightening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KangoTodd
30,We liked it but a filthy area with drug adicts,"Do not go in the night, it is bit hostile. Lots of homeless and drug addicts.Anyway, this is an average attraction. Just ok to go and have few photos to say that you have been here.The areas is stinky, urine smell everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/virajfernando
30,Crowded and not very interesting,Maybe I'm just not a massive movie buff but being honest the stars in the pavement were fairly dull and you're surrounded by people dressed up (some very good most very poorly) trying to scam pictures of you. Avoid eating around here - over priced and poor quality.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/758ewanw
40,"Not as glamorous as anticipated, but still enjoyable.","It was awesome to see all the stars, and to see the hand prints and footprints of amazing film stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Julie Andrews, and Nicolas Cage. There were many shops to get souvenirs and seeing inside the Dolby theatre was interesting.It is very very busy, and you come across a whole variety of people. Tourists, homeless people, street performers etc etc.sometimes it can feel overwhelming, but for me it was not too overwhelming, and I wanted to look at all the stars! It was slightly dirty, however that was not a problem for me. If you love film and new experiences, go for it. If you have high standards then I would not recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/223alanam

10,"Disgusting, horrible, dirty- don't bother!!!","Terribly sad place full of hobo's lying everywhere, people dressed as cartoon characters or celebrities in dingy dirty outfits.The smell of marijuana and urine fill the air, I covered my nose most of the time.

30,You have to go.,"Well this is one of the must do things in LA, although its is neat to walk down the footpath and see the stars, you get sick of them after about the first 20 or so. hence the 3 stars So make you way to the Chinese Theatre which is on the way. Much more fun and you can stand in the footsteps of the greats. Easy parking on N Sycamore Ave just a block away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveS217

30,Not much to offer,"I completed this street in just 35 mins. Its a happening area with all the famous stars name on this long strip its hard to find your favorite star because there are so many (I didn't find mine :( )...also you will see chines theater This will offer you messages from most of the famous celebrities written on the floor, some of these celebrities have left their hand prints some of them left foot prints. I personally didnt find the place so interesting but if you are visiting LA you should just make a quick trip to this place. Its a less than 10 mins drive from universal studios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/884richaa
30,Imagine a sidewalk or pavement with people's names on it.,"I'm sure if and when I ever get a star on the walk of fame I'll be delighted. However, until that day it'll always be a pavement with people's names on it! It's value is as a curiosity rather than an actual attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frewba
30,good during the day,Check out the Chinese theatre and the shopping mall but other than that there isn’t much to offer. Best avoid the place at night if you have a young family.. a few bad eggs come out of the shadows and try to cause trouble,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tangawang

30,A bit of hype,"Not sure if I take it for granted living in Los Angeles, but it's a very crowded, high traffic area. Terrible & pricy parking so if you are willing, take metro to hollywood/highland stop. Unless you want to experience museums or El Capitan theater or TCL Chinese theater or take photos with character imitators, there isn't much to do. Oh, I haven't done this but there are Hollywood bus tours everywhere. Definitely go during the day if you want to take pictures of those stars on the grounds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/665michellek
50,A must do if you visit LA!!,"There is a lot of history around this area,the Hollywood walk of fame is just one small piece.The area gets very crowded with tourists & street sellers but is worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pauly26
30,"Great for some, not so for others","I grew up just over the hill from the ""Walk."" I would guess for some visitors, the experience might be awesome enough to send pictures to the folks back home, ""I'm in Hollywood on the Walk of Fame."" For others, it's a sidewalk with entertainment icons names framed inside stars. For me, the luster of ""old"" Hollywood is long-gone but the crowds still come. At times that you can hardly see the names through all the feet and legs. And, most unfortunately, it has become flooded with people trying to get you take one of their flyers that advertise all kinds of ""deals."" Be careful, the scam artists dwell among them. If you happen to be nearby, go ahead, visit the ""Walk of Fame"" so you can say, ""Been there, done that.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
30,Its ok...,"The Hollywood walk of fame is a tourist attraction and that's about it. At first glance one wouldn't even notice the stars on the ground because its so busy and also quite dirty and smelly. If you are tourist then I would say check it out. Its a long stretch to walk so we only walked a short while, saw some famous peoples stars and took a few pictures. If you see it once its good enough although it is nice to think that you walked there at least once in your life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelC2000

30,Dodgy area,Hall of fame is self is very nice and you can see the Hollywood sign from here. But the area I wouldn't recommend walking alone at night and have a spare dolla in your pocket because you get harassed by the homeless and people dresses up in characters. They will ask for a photo with you and expect to be paid.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NadiaC449
30,Two blocks of great! The rest was yuck!,"Chinese theater and down about two block looks great. Then the walk gets so dirty and the stores are usually only selling bongs and pipes. What happened to the great Hollywood stores the blvd. used to have? Disappointed. Nevertheless, we had fun!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M8873BFstephaniec
50,Good,I would recommend if you are looking to just hang out and see the Diffrent type of things going on- the walk of fame is about 15 blocks - come prepared to walk and bump Into people while you are taking pictures of the ground,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelLoves86
40,Go during the day but NOT at night!,"As I said in my detailed review of Hollywood Boulevard, the Walk of Fame was great during the day (specifically in the morning). We were able to find several stars and take pics. But at night, it transformed into a totally different environment. The walk became filled with homeless people, panhandlers, scammers, intimidation, confrontational people, litter, etc. The Walk of Fame was not as glamorous as I had imagined it or seen it on TV. If it's on your bucket list, go for it, but be sure to go during the day and don't allot very much time to it. There's so much more to see that's clean and safe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
20,Disappointing,"We did the obligatory stop by at the Hollywood Walk of Fame and only spent 15 minutes. The place is full of people in costumes and get ups trying to get you to tip them for photos. People passing out tour fliers everywhere you looked. It was dirty and run down. It's a shame because the star concept is really cool. I get it if you want to see it, but don't plan on spending a ton of time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferS988
50,Cinematic History,"I taught at Hollywood High School for several years, often taking my lunch time walk up and down the Walk of Fame. While others have a problem with the crowded conditions at Hollywood and Highland, the boulevard is much more than that corner. As you walk east, you come across names that you know and remember, and names you don't know. The trick is to see if you can jog your memory by looking not just at the names, but the little circles at the top of the stars. Each one tells you what the person is famous for, which explains why you'll see a few of the names repeated on other stars. The camera represents movies, the television of course represents TV shows, the phonograph the recording industry,the microphone is for radio personalities, and the comedy/tragedy masks represents the stage. You'll find your favorite actors and celebrities from the early days of cinema to the present. Be sure to stop in front of the El Capitan Theater to see the Disney actors and characters represented.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JT_Burciaga
50,Interesting.,"The names of famous people from Hollywood are a must seen for any tourist visiting Los Angeles.There are so many ""stars"" on the side walk that you will need a few hours to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeronicaJ57
20,Hollywood Walk of Fame !! Not sure if I want to visit again,"As soon as I heard I was moving to LA the first thing was I would see the Hollywood Walk of Fame wow was my expression. But when I actually reached the destination neither did it have the charm nor did it attract me enough to go back.All the excitement was drained when I saw the crowded streets and street vendors all over the place. It was dirty and extremely crowded. The place is not well maintained and you can witness a police chase very frequently. Sad but reality.There are some shopping malls with top brands tats good to go around and see. They have the regular stuff nothing specific which is exclusive to LA though. You can see the Kodak theater and the Chinese Theater. There is Madam Tussaud's and Believe it or not. Which are worth visiting.If some one ask me to visit again I would say no. But for the first timers my advise would be no high expectations, one time visit is nice to go if you want to get something checked of the list from LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ppir5362
20,Hollywood Blvd,"It's not a long street, but was crowded, full of smelly people...Some people cos-play film heroes, but not really professional...Sometimes there is live shows, you can take a look if you are high enough...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793tianx
50,Old Hollywood,"This is one attraction you should visit at least once. Some people have a love hate relationship with it but if you are a fan of old Hollywood, this is for you. A little warning...watch yourself and keep an eye out for your valuables. There are what we call, the 'characters' who line the Blvd dressed up as characters. They can be very annoying. Don't indulge them in conversation, just be polite and keep walking. They want money for posing for pictures. Start at La Brea and Hollywood Blvd. For the statues of the women in film and the Beatles Tribute. Then, wander up and down Hollywood Blvd for your favorite stars. I would recommend going online to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce site prior to your visit to map out the stars you want to see and where they are located. My personal favorites are Sophia Loren and William Holden!Enjoy this walk through the stars! Stop by the other landmarks along the way such as the Chinese Theatre and the Roosevelt Hotel to really round out your visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PupAndCircumstance
40,Fun time,We have been to the Walk of Fame several times. It is fun to walk around and find the star of your favorite actors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christyreznor02
20,I was never impressed with the Walk,"The Holly Walk of Fame is not really a walk of fame. Most of the actors today pay to get their star on the fame. Some are barely famous, Rick Dees, really! The older stars mostly are unknown to today's youth. My son's friend didn't know who John Wayne was. Hollywood boulevard is usually overflowing with tourist, panhandlers, drug addicts, and people dressed up as movie characters. This summer the Spiderman character was forty pound too heavy and had a giant sweat patch on his butt area. When he came up towards my family we moved likethe real SApiderman to get away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lous732
10,Just pathetic,"How exiting can a list of celebrity names be? Not very. Does not matter that it is written on the pavement. No. Same list. To make the experience even worse, it is difficult to get to, difficult and expensive to park, you get harassed by vendors, it is dirty and the area is full of pick-pockets.L.A. has a lot to offer. There is a lot to see, a lot to experience if you go outside the beaten path. Save an afternoon for something else that will bring happy, positive memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psjofors
30,Hollywood History,"A good free way to spend a short time doing the 'tourist' thing.We had been here before many years ago and as we had an hour or so to spare we headed to the Highland & Hollywood Center, parked the car and headed out for a wander.It's good to spot all the stars, but it didn't feel comfortable walking around. Maybe because we were too aware of vagrants and homeless in the area. It was also crowded with hawkers, street musicians, and people dressed as super heroes or movies characters for a photo opportunity ... for a price!Glad we did it again, but wouldn't be somewhere I would rush back to ... ever!If you park at H&H Center, get a coffee or similar at Starbucks (with a view of the Hollywood sign) and they will validate the ticket to enable you to get a discounted parking rate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindsay-and-Neil
40,Don't Walk Alone,"Took a long walk with my adult son. Dusty, dry, seedy. Loved seeing all the stars, even Lassie. Odd that the area is so run down. Lots of homeless and just sketchy characters around and it was 9 in the morning. I wouldn't walk it at night.We did not take a tour. I probably would do that next time I'm around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flowerchild1969
20,TA OVERRATED,That people (tourists) would flock to see this so-called attraction is proof of the power of marketing. These grimy stars have no real-world connection to the actors they represent. You may meet some pretty obnoxious buskers however.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
30,Hollywood History with a sprinkle of crime,I guess it's fair to say that if you are in LA you should visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame at least once. Take a few photos of the stars and check out the Chinese Theater and the El Capitan but sadly there seems to be a lot more things to avoid like the crazy homeless people & unpermitted character actors. Plus there isn't a great selection of good restaurants on that strip anymore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/686jennis
40,Free way to enjoy a few hours,If you want to spend a few hours discovering some of the forgotten memories of your youth this is the place. As a space program nut I was really excited to stand with all the Apollo 11 astronaut stars. Many of the biggies are well represented.Whilst doing this activities you also get to do a spot of window shopping and people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8676DWpeterb
30,Pros (happy) & Cons (sad),"This review is very neutral and honest about the pros and cons of the Hollywood Walk of Fame.First, we have to remember that Hollywood is an OLD town for the most part, therefore there isn't a whole lot of real ""glitz and glamor."" Speaking for the Walk of Fame itself, it's pretty neat to see your favorites star along the walk, and when you find your favorite, you'll feel that smile come over you and it's the perfect photo opportunity, that is, IF there isn't a homeless person sleeping next to it, it's not covered in dirt, gum and slush from the foot traffic that goes up and down the Blvd and IF there aren't a hundred people in your picture.However, this walk is loooong, it stretches many blocks on both sides of the Hollywood Blvd and up and down Vine street as well. The reality of it is, unless you are a huge television, movie, radio and recording buff ... you will be walking aimlessly over names that you'll have no clue of who they are. I did my homework and found the ""where are they"" research online which tells you in alphabetical order who you are looking for and the address on the street where you can find them. I will gladly share this link to make your life a little easier as it did mine.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_on_the_Hollywood_Walk_of_FameI recommend going early in the morning before all the street performers and tourists get out, so the streets are bare and you can get a good shot without random people in the picture. And getting haggled by everyone trying to make a dollar. I enjoyed the morning stroll while looking for the ones I wanted to see (mapped out via that link) which made it easier and much more fun, considering ""we were now on a hunt, not just a aimless walk!""If you do get approached by a street person, just kindly tell them ""No thank you."" and they will leave you alone.Here's a FUN tip! If you have the time, there are a few empty stars (without names) so you maybe could bring some pre-cut out letters and place them on the star and personalize it with your or your groups names! Please just remember to take your creation with after you have fun with your pictures as it is illegal to ""ruin with malice and or demarcate"" on the HWOF Stars.Another tip! If you do want a copy of a CD from someones own work, hand them a couple of dollars, if you want to take a picture with Minnie, Mickey, a Transformer, Michael Jackson lookalike, Olaf and many, many more... bring LOTS of dollar bills! Truthfully, it can get a bit annoying really quick.Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/THE-TW0-BEES
30,Hollywood 'Walk of Fame' what can I say !!!!!,"The street is lined with 'stars' names in the pavement. The Chinese theatre has impressions of movie stars hands or feet in concrete. The Dolby theatre is where the Oscars are held. While I was there the premier of 'Horrible Bosses2' was shown. Loads of security as you can imagine, large screens covering off the actors attending. did catch a glimpse of Jennifer Aniston's back in the distance and Christofer Waltz, he is small !!!!! The street itself is full of tacky souvenir shops, 'panhandlers', 'touts', wannabe 'lookalikes', musicians, beggars, hustlers of all kinds, all trying to make a buck !!!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Duggie65
40,Hollywood history at your feet,"Hollywood is an idea, a dream, an ideal. And it's likely not going to live up to the hype it's had for more than 100 years. As a fan of Old Hollywood, dating back to silent films, it was fantastic to walk along the historic Walk of Fame. As a cemetery historian, the Walk makes me think of a cemetery--the stars are like gravestones for so many long-gone stars. In truth, a number of those stars (most of the forgotten ones) don't have proper gravestones in a cemetery. So the stars on the Walk of Fame suit that purpose. When you visit Hollywood, you're not going to find streets paved in gold and celebrities standing on every corner. In fact, you're probably not going to see anyone famous at all (unless you count the figures in Madam Tussaud's Wax Museum). Enjoy it for what it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mindap2017
30,star studded,"We went to see Jimmy Kimmel and the theater just happened to be on the Walk! I had a bad experience there 20 years ago and wasn't really interested in going back, but a friend had gotten us tickets to the JK show. So, we get out of the cab and there it is: the Chinese theater and the Walk! It is definitely something to see when in LA and after I got over my anxiety of being there, it was fun! Find your favorite actor and stand on the star and take a photo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nisty_13
30,Not so Glamorous...,I have been there a few times. Nothing too special except the stars on the sidewalk. The area is not that clean and has lots of strange individuals hanging around. Not for families.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelpY372BZ
20,"Tired, old and not a bit of glamour!","Hollywood in general is a total let down. I'm not even sure what we expected, but Hollywood Boulevard is old, run down with little more than a few souvenir shops, some clothing stores and average restaurants. It looks like any suburban suburb street in a run down part of any city. What we hated were the number of homeless beggars and the number of hawkers. We were harassed constantly to buy tickets for tours. Madam Tussauds was interesting but not much else.We did the LA City tour which lasted for five hours. The tour guide was good but overall the distances between attractions means you are just sitting in a bus driving through traffic and on freeways most of the time. Venice Beach is a stop they could eliminate. Tacky, cheap souvenir shops and more hawkers. There is no access to the Hollywood sign so the best you get is a lookout with the sign in the far distance for photos. Seeing some of the Stars' homes was interesting and we enjoyed that (although I'm sure they don't!I've been to LA previously and stayed with relatives in a nicer part so I've been able to see both sides. There are some lovely parts of LA and nice beaches, but it's so large and spread out, you really need to have a car to get around and then you are stuck in awful traffic. Hollywood itself - do yourselves a favour and go somewhere much nicer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Courtcase
40,It's the walk of fame,"It's one of those places you have to go to, if your in LA why would you want to do the walk of fame! We got the metro to west Hollywood from our hotel came out of the metro station walked about 50yards down the road before we even noticed the stars on the pavement. Some are very dirty but then you are on a pavement that gets walked on by thousands every day, some stars are more popular than others and can be difficult at busy times to get a picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carly3
40,Awesome,I really enjoyed walking down this street and reading all the names on the stars. It is a very generic street however.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexw985
30,Not what I expected,"I was really looking forward to seeing this street with the stars and names. It wasn't quite what I expected, just like any other ordinary street, expect this had stars on the pavement with famous names. Maybe I expected too much, but at least we got to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pippa56
30,Not all that glamorous,I was really looking forward to seeing the walk of fame and hollywood! I think I had built it up to be really glamorous in my mind but it was far from it. I found it quite run down with lots of people trying to hassle you for money or to book trips etc. everytime I stopped to take pictures I was pounced on. It's full of tacky souvenir shops and is far from glamorous. I've ticked it off the bucket list but you don't need much time there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyDing
50,The Hollywood Experience,"A great place to create memories. There are independent performers/actors on the sidewalk most times and very entertaining. You can take pictures with them for tips. Most are good look-a-likes of famous movie stars, and characters, etc. The walk of fame may be about two or three blocks long but you can stand right where that star stood and take a pic next to their feet for free!There is a huge shopping center with lots of stores but don't spend too much time there because there are also nearby museums and souvenir shops to explore as well. Towards the end of the Walk of fame is a little shabby, but overall safe if you go during the day. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Honilovee
20,"I wasn't expecting much, but it was even more disappointing","I knew the Walk of Fame was just a few starts on the pavement, and I wasn't exactly expecting glamour (more like tourist shops everywhere), still the street surprised me by being even sadder and seedier that I had expected.The part near the Chinese Theater is ok - lots of touts, but that's to be expected. However, as you go up and down the street the areas just get on getting shabbier. I didn't feel unsafe at any moment (after all it was the middle of the day), but still quite ugly for such a well known place.But oh well... it's a must see, anyway :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fledermausg
50,Walking Tall in La La Land,I am a real believer that you get what you pay for. I was able to find a excellent tour group and had the best time of my life in HOLLYWOOD and HOLLYWOOD Hills. Even got the opportunity to meet some of Hollywood's Stars at their Homes as part of the walk of fame. Find the TOUR that is LINKED to the HIP HOP TOUR in Compton....... This was really exciting to see the birthplace of West Coast Rap.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertrR7802SS
50,Funny and famous,"This street is very cool, very attractive, lot of shops, actors for pics, all the stars to take photos, very fun !Cette rue est vraiment cool, beaucoup d'activités, de magasins, d'acteurs pour faire des photos, les étoiles évidemment, très marrant à faire !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miaoum2014
20,A must-see that will disappoint you,"As many other reviewers, I was also quite disappointed by the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It's somehow unavoidable to go there because you know, it's Hollywood. But the reality is that the place is pretty unremarkable except maybe for the Chinese Theater. Other than that, it's not much more than a normal street with stars on the sidewalk and cheap souvenir shops with tons of people trying to sell you something. Walk a few blocks in any direction and you might even start to feel unsafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrNeko
50,A fun outing!,"I enjoyed it very much. It's really cool. I've known, since I could remember, about the Hollywood Walk of Fame, so it was pretty cool to be there. It's nothing grandiose. It's sidewalks with stars on them, but it commemorates the work of celebrities, so it's interesting to look at. It's the kind of attraction where it's ""been there done that, bought the t-shirt"", but I found it cool going back there again,visiting Hollywood and enjoying the day. I enjoyed the experience of going to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It can be crowded, and alot of vendors trying to sell their products, which can feel like they're pestering people, but just say no and keep doing what you're doing and they'll most likely leave you alone. Also, be careful for tourist traps (e.g.: if there's people dressed in costumes and they ask if you want to take a picture, you'll most likely pay for the pictures... been there, done that, a real rip-off. I didn't know I had to pay for the photos (taken with my camera, by the way), after the photos were taken and they ask for the money. It's not a bad place, it's quite fun. A must-do if you're going to Los Angeles or passing by near there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amelie1991
30,It seems better in the movies,"It's cool, you can actually say you've been there, and do what everyone does and have a picture of the star and put the ends of your toes in it just to prove to everyone you've taken the photo!It's very crowded at the best of times, and it's literally got hundreds of people trying to make a living selling you stuff that you don't want any can't even get away from them once they're on you!Some of the costumes are pretty cool down there though, I genuinely saw THE BEST Samuel L Jackson dress up. Was a spitting image on him in Pulp Fiction! But then again they come straight over ""want a photo guys?"" before you've even done anything it's ""5 dollars please...""I had ""spiderman"" come up to me, holes all in his costume and everything trying to charge me for a picture I didn't have... Just hold your own on the walk, if someone harrasses you, seriously, say nothing back and just walk off. They're very good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nawilliamson89
30,"Fun for teens, but beware","The 16 year olds had fun, but then got a little creeped out as they noticed more and more seediness as the glamour and novelty wore off. We have gone both in the evening and midday, and although it is more crowded at night, you don't notice as much grime and ickiness. It's worth a visit, but set expectations for crowds and a seedy element.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindad633
40,Obiously must do visit,"This is an obvious visit while you in California. This area is packed of restaurants, bars, pubs and places to visit. Lots of stores. Some areas are dirty. There is the wax musseum to visit. Walking distance you will find a show store outlet. You can expend a morning there and grab something to lunch. Is an interesting visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravelerPRUSA
40,A walk down memory lane,"Took my family here and had a ball looking for my favorite star's foot and hand prints by Gruman's Chinese Theater. If you go, park far down the street and walk and walk. There are character actors walking on the street taking photo ops with the visitors. ( expect the uncomfortable silences after the photo op for $$. The crowds were definitely there. So be careful to hold onto your pocketbooks and wallets. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time for this visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darylmarx
30,Hit and miss,This one is probably something we will miss next time and Hollywood was fairly dirty and had an unsafe feeling to it (no one likes drug dealer looking people and black SUV's driving around). Seeing the stars was pretty cool though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K3MP5
40,So crowded :(,"It was neat to see the sidewalk, with all the stars that seemed to go on forever. However, there were so many people, and the crowds never seemed to lighten, that we just took a couple of photos and moved on. We like the leaflet that details all the stars that are there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TFry55
30,glad to see it,If you are in the area it it's worth the trip.Plenty of people trying to sell you stuff but not too aggressive.Beware people bearing gifts...Quiet at the fringes but it gets very busy near the cinemas and main shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LozzaCam
20,Nothing like I imagined,"the walk of fame was a huge disappointment. I could barely stop and look at the famous stars along the foot path because it was so packed with people whether it was tourists, impersonators trying to take photos with you or the young wanna be singers pretty much forcing you to take their demo CDs then trying to get money from you, it was just too packed if you stopped you would be trampled! It was also very dirty and full of cheap tourist shops and take out places. It actually made me feel uneasy being there especially at night time. Unfortunately it was Nothing like what I imagined. The whole strip needs a big clean up and revamp to try and salvage the uniqueness and glamor it used to bring years ago. Don't get me wrong it was good to go to just to say I've Been there but I would not go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933dane
30,Nice to see,"I visited in Nov, a nice thing to see and take photos of. I think it's a good thing to say that you have been there and done it. It purely is looking at stars on the pavement. And it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GenG85
50,Amazing,It's an amazing sight. Seems like I am really close to the stars who walked here and touched these places.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110HIna
30,"Not what you expect, but see it anyway just to cross it off your list!","If you believe what you have seen in the movies you will expect this to be amazing and glamorous... prepare to be disappointed!It is dirty, full of 'Americana' shops, and there are beggars everywhere.Having said that, if you know what to expect you won't be so disappointed.The 'Americana' shops are not necessarily a negative, as if you are a tourist you will think that they are fun, and certainly find some sort of souvenir for your trip. They are quite expensive though!I would still recommend going, just so you can say that you've seen it for yourself. Don't live through other people's experiences, make your own. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexandraRabbit
30,Need to at least once in your like,"Was expecting more, some parts of the walk of fame are not in the best of LA. I can tell I did it and is done. Best part is in front of the Chinese Theater",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steeprock
40,Lots to see and do!,There's lots to see and do at the walk of fame. Check out the stars and enjoy Madame Tussaud's wax museum. Visit the Dolby theatre or just relax and people watch. Tons of shopping and things to do! Plan a day trip with the girlfriends or an afternoon with your man.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Julie325
20,Least amount of fun.. and dirty,"You would think that theHollywood walk of Fame would be so cool.. and it is cool to post on your instagram for maybe 1 day then you realize how awful it was haha. Streets way too crowded with tourists. The vibe is not very ""hollywood""its quite dirty , and you may or may not run into a mob of protesters and the annoying wanna be music artist trying to sell you their CDs really hard.. Will probably never go there again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeanMLove
30,"Okay, not as glamerous as I expected","The Hollywood Walk of Fame was not nearly as glamorous as I expected. While I'm not sorry I went there, it's not something I need to do again. It's similar to Times Square but not quite as exciting. There's the 'characters' who want money to take a picture with you, and the bums with stories about how they're not homeless or anything, but they lost their wallet and need bus fare, and the guys trying to hawk their cd's they made. I hate having to dodge them all the time. Then you get a nice tourist who simply wants you to take their picture and you have to be suspicious of them, so sad. Thankfully we went there during a red caret movie premiere so we did get to see some of the Hollywood aspect that we were looking for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/343theresas
20,Dirty and disappointing,"The first star you see is nice, but after the next few, it gets boring. Lots of people on the Wall of Fame try to sell you stuff like their hip hop cd. I gets annoying. I have seen it once, would prefer not going back. L.A. has so many better spots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FredScott
20,Tacky,"Not what we expected. Dirty, un'hollywoodish', homeless people, and tacky looking characters dressed up who want money for photos and daggy souvenir shops..

If you have to do it do it but don't expect the glamour and amazement you see on tv.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frizzy63
40,Something you just have to do,"The Walk of Fame is pretty cool to see. The stars with the names and then the Chinese Theater in the middle of it all. All you pretty much do is look at the names as you walk by. Maybe pay an pushy costumed character to take a picture with you. There is a really nice mall and food courts very close to the Chinese Theater also. Parking is pretty easy, but not straight forward. Find the public parking, but once found, not too expensive. You need to validate parking by purchasing something in the mall for the cheaper rate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZafferB
20,Hollywood walk of fame,"Very disappointed when we arrived at the Hollywood walk of fame. It was dirty, lots of homeless people all down the streets. Didn't feel safe in the evening walking down hollywood blvd. there's was a lot of animated people standing down the blvd wanting to pose for pics. They even started fighting with each other and the police had to get involved. Very scary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolynP18
30,Interesting,I'm not sure if my expectations were too high or it wasn't as good as others had sold it. Still definitely somehting you have to see if you're in the area - but wasn't what I was expecting. Very crowded and lots of shops that seel the same thing - hard to see the stars on the ground with the amount of people wandering around. Lots of people in costume - however if you want a photo with them make sure you prepared to pay. Some real like characters and some that should consider another career.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2JoanneD
50,Wonderful Attraction.,"A highlight of a recent visit was walking the Hollywood Walk of Fame.This attraction is a must see when in the area.It takes in hunreds of Stars set in the path and includes all walks of the entertainment industry.Just walking and looking can bring back lots of memories of the past and not so past.Along the way you will pass many attractions such as the Ripleys Believe it or not,Wax Museum,Chinese Theatre where you will find all the famous cement tributes to many of the stars that have visited.There are many theatres along the walk and lots of tourist areas.You will also find many street acts,many dress ups (Star Wars etc)If you venture through to shopping centre next to the Chinese Theatre you will be able to see the famous Hollywood sign set on the top of a hill.A must see when in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennisp859
10,Disappointing,"Maybe the walk of fame is good for ticking off your bucket list, but for me it was a big disappointment. The area is just run down and depressing. There are homeless people everywhere, I even witnessed an attack by a homeless guy on a poor passer by. Oh and a cyclist verbally abuse a random guy for being 'too fat'. Real classy area.It's full of tacky trinket shops and pushy desperate people trying to sell you CDs and rubbish. Not a nice atmosphere, and not quite as 'flashy' as I thought the notorious Hollywood would be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KumaTzu
40,Walk of fame!,"Well it was great to be here, if it wasn't holliwood walk of fame, it's nothin. Walking around this area is so so. Many people bugging you, it's annoying! it's dirty, seen a lot of trash everywhere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198MichelleF
10,Couldn't wait to leave,"Whilst the walk of fame is something that you know you should go to see when you're in LA, the experience was horribly uncomfortable. We were taken there as part of a guided tour and were looking forward to seeing it, but I can honestly say we were happiest when we got back on the bus and left! The 'walk' is over crowed with people, so it actually made it very difficult to see the star names and you felt like if you stopped you were immediately in people's way. Then there were the volumes of touts and sellers constantly badgering you to buy tickets for their tours, trying to hand you CD's in return for a 'donation' as well as what looked like a whole load of tourist tat. It made for an awkward time. I would have happily just driven through and avoided the discomfort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrandMrsHinMK
40,Must see attraction,"Really something cool to see, we took pictures with heaps of the stars and the kids (6,10&12yrs) really got a kick out of seeing some of their favorites here. Handy tip, if you are wanting to see a particular star print off the map before you go as you will save yourself a lot of time. There are heaps of street 'performers' along here too, they are very quick to grab your attention and try to get a picture or hand out their CDs but they will all want some money in return so just be wary.Good place to grab some cheap souvenirs if you need them as there are heaps of shops along here. Also the pizza places are pretty good too if you want to sample some authentic American cheese pizza. We walked around both during the day and at night with our kids and while we were very alert we never felt unsafe or had to worry about being in danger at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MEPlatt
30,Worth a look,"Cool place to visit, fun and interesting to spot all the places you see on the t.v and movies. Even got to see Johnny Depp giving a speech! However probably not suited for families with small children as it's extremely busy and there's tonnes of sales people trying to coax you into various tours and buying merch etc. Nice to have it ticked off the list though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2jasmineh
40,Hollywood walk of fame,spent the afternoon on the walk lots of of well known celebrity stars and good places for souvenirs are good prices. \had the opportunity to be part of jimmy kimmel set. good view of Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dealfinderblue
30,Tick the box exercise,"I visited the walk of fame as it's an essential thing to do when visiting Hollywood.There's the stars on the walk and the Dolby theatre but apart from that not much else.The area is full of blokes pretending to be up and coming musicians who thrust a demo cd into your hands before making it uncomfortable for the tourist not to give a donation. Just ignore them.There's also the people dressed in poor costumes (superman, Spider-Man, Star Wars etc) insisting on cash for you to take a photo on your camera.Best to combine it with a tour and spend 30mins max there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonySopranosVest
10,Disappointing Beware when taking your children,"Had huge expectation and so looking forward to finally see the Hollywood walk of fame, but what a disappointment to finally arrive at this much anticipated place only to find idiots hand you CD's and than ask you for money, we were hassled 4 times and been first timers I had not idea what was going on I initially thought they were just friendly but little did I know taking the CD meant paying up so I handed out $5 and than $20 as I had no smaller change I finally realised more people kept coming up to us as they watch you very carefully. We were there for only 10 minutes and had to run out of there with a poor kids in tow. Just wondering why police are not there to monitor this area anyway lesson learnt .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emilydaley
10,Overrated and Disappointing,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I visited the Walk of Fame, but I was seriously disappointed. Hollywood is no comparison to the likes of New York and Las Vegas. Dirty streets and average restaurants. We quickly stopped to get some dinner than walked as fast as we could back to the car, we didn't feel safe at all in Hollywood... I will never return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kayla_maree92
30,Had to be done!,"You cant really go to Hollywood and NOT go see this! They were rolling out the red carpet for a premiere (perhaps they are an permanent feature in Hollywood) and it was quite buzzy and busy!Quite a lot of hassle from street vendors, but (other than one who hade a grab for my camera) they do leave you alone with a firm ""no thank you"". Made a point of leaving before nightfall.I think parking could be a problem, so I would advise leaving the car & taking the redline metro in if possible. You buy a card ( a bit like an Oyster card) at the station then a single fare is about 1.75$.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/789lindan
50,a little piece of history!,"So loved seeing all the old and new stars!Great way to spend the morning by taking a stroll along Hollywood Blvd, and it's FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ohmystarzs
30,Once in a lifetime,"This is a once in a lifetime trip - don't bother to go again! It is very tacky, too many people milling around, but we avoided any unpleasantness. We had fun finding our favourite stars on the pavements and taking photos when we could. Unfortunately there was a film premier on the night we were there in the afternoon, so could not see the stars footprints outside the Gauman's Chinese Theatre. A lot of street performers, people selling tours, loud noise. We even saw a man being handcuffed by the cops, which was a highlight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Margo37
30,Bucket list item,"Went to LA with my wife and teenagers over Spring Break and had to make the trip to the Walk of Fame... Not nearly as ritzy or glamorous as I would have expected. Huge amount of traffic, roads and sidewalks in need of repair, lots of construction, gave the air of just walking downtown in a big city. The stars were neat and we recognized most of them, there are places to eat, souvenir stores ready to take your coin, you can see the theater where the Oscars are held. We saw it, and had fun, but definitely wouldn't plan a day around it. It is in Downtown Hollywood, so if you bundled it with a trip to Wilshire Boulevard, the La Brea Tar Pits, and a trip up to the Hollywood sign, these are all things that take about 2 hours and makes for a great day of site seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobn343
20,"Dirty, smelly, and annoying.","I, too, was mislead by the grandeur of Hollywood on the silver screen. I mean, what an iconic place to visit, no? THINK AGAIN. The streets SMELL, not only of urine, but walking through cloud after cloud of cigarette and marijuana smoke is enough to make one nauseous. Some of the stars are inaccessible because of some bum laying over it, or a street performer laying out his wares on top of it, or because you just want to keep moving for fear you'll have to tip someone because he hands you a CD while you're idling. My husband and I resorted to crossing the street multiple times just to avoid the harassment. We visited for the first time last week, came all the way from Buffalo NY to walk the grand streets of Hollywood, and left thoroughly disappointed. One visit is enough for me. Hasta la vista, baby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/112erinb
50,Fun place,So fun seeing all the stars and finding actors or actress that you had forgotten all about. Best time to visit is early in the morning(9:00) not many people out that early and you don't have to worry about people walking all over you while trying to make pics etc....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsTipp
50,2nd time - always a blast,It's always nice to walk the Hollywood Walk of Fame. My fav is Marilyn Monroe's located outside McDonalds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cas_clay
20,Overrated,Do not see the point of walking down a crowded street!! May be you do it once. Going back a second time was an overkill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldCTZenT
50,Good feeling,Ya it os nice to see good old and some new stars. Got myself clicked with some of my favourites and that's pretty much it. Lots of people did so and overall it was a great evening stroll down the Hollywood blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SidTalwar
10,"Filthy, Unsafe, Unfit ; Caution Families w/kids ; Outright Health & Safety Concern","As the City of Hollywood does not clean it's streets or the sidewalks, and countless homeless literally live in the doorways among the tent ridden drug afflicted youth and mentally ill, the place it literally and absolutely filthy. The air smells strongly like urine, block after block. Disgusting.Even during an evening out with adults to adult places, I considered throwing my shoes in the trash for the human waste one navigates to see the stars on the walk. Panhandlers are everywhere and there is no sanitation or public restrooms available to the hoards of homeless, much less mobs of tourists that crown the streets. Honestly, the entire place is overpriced, gross and outright, dangerous. If you go, be sure an go out at night so you don't have to SEE the horrors all to clearly. Hollyweird, not. More like, Hollyhellno.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U370GMsarahm
30,Overated but a must do,Yea - hundreds of stars have bronze stars embedded in the sidewalk. Ho Hum. But this is an iconic this to do in Los Angles. If you are just bout anywhere in the Hollywood area shopping you will see them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/650TomB650
30,Disappointing,"I had high hopes before I went to Hollywood with my family. I have always thought it would be grand and beautiful as seen in many movies. However, it is overly packed with tourists and everyone on the street is trying to sell you souvenirs or the day tour trips. It is getting annoying and I didn't even have a good moment for myself to take pictures. However, the Walk of Fame itself is fun to walk along, seeing hundreds of stars with popular Hollywood stars' names. I still think it is a must-go if you go to LA, but it is not one of the best attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cottoncarmen
50,Hollywood Walk of Fame,We loved it! It's cool and free. There are many old school actors along with new ones. So it makes for a fun experience. Lots of street performers too. Just tip them if you want photos. That's how they make a living. Marilyn Monroe on hollywood and highland is a doll! What a sweetheart and we took photos with her.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorigarcia
10,Absolutely avoid this cesspool,"It amazes me that no one cares enough to clean up this area! On a recent Sunday, we went to see a film at the Egyptian Theatre. During our walk from the parking lot to our location, we were approached by 23 (yes, I counted) people trying to sell a tour. We walked past three people sleeping on the sidewalk. Avoided one major mess of dried vomit near Carol Burnett's star near the closed Pacific Theater. Stepped over a pool of urine that came from a man still laying there against the building. And saw a used syringe right outside the Indian restaurant we ducked into to get a soda. Until someone in LA or Hollywood cares enough to clean this up, it's really an unsafe place to suggest to any visitor, especially those who don't speak English as a first language. It's not easy to navigate and horribly frightening if you don't have your full game on. That's a shame. This area was intended for people to walk along and leisurely look at the sidewalk and the many names on them. You cannot do that. You cannot take your eyes off of what is spinning all around. It's just not safe. I would NOT recommend this location and especially alert parents with small children to forget this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chgo919
40,Be aware :0,"I loved walking the Hollywood Walk of Fame! BUT, be aware that if you pose for any pictures with the street characters then be prepared to pay. Which wouldn't be so bad except they're pretty grungy looking. Also, if someone walks up to you and prepares to shake your hand don't go there because they will hand you a CD and then ask you to pay for it. I'm glad that I went but once is really enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MO1958
30,Disappointing,Not sure if we got off the bus on the wrong street but we didn't feel very comfortable walking along trying the read the stars. So many people trying to sell you day trips which was very annoying. Once we reached the Chinese Theatre it felt like we were in the right place but unfortunately the pavement was closed off in front of the theatre so didn't really get a chance to look at it properly. For a famous tourist attraction in Hollywood it needs to be looked after better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahW615AH
40,Hollyweird at its best,"I loved walking among the stars in LA! It was so fun to see them along the 10 city blocks. I suggest looking up the location of the stars you want to see to make sure you find them - there are hundreds of them!People work for tips along this street - if you pose for a picture with a character, it's appropriate to tip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lediamedia

20,Disappointed,"It seems to be so exciting in the TV, but when you get there, its just a sidewalk with some stars, many of them broken or dirty.

30,Street of stars,Loved looking at the stars but the street needs a good clean up. People trying to sell you something all the time is very annoying when all you want to do is look at the stars and go about your business.

30,Creepy and strange people all round; be careful out there!,"As mentioned by other reviewers, it was not what it used to be. I did see a few stars that I liked and took some photos, but the constant pressure from people with CDs and weird and cheesy costumes. It was a zoo out there. We did not stay long and left soon after. Perhaps it would be better during the day? Proceed with caution.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MARKL455
40,"Best for Tourists, a Must-See","I've seen this strip of Hollywood Boulevard go from a hooker- and drug addict-filled horror to a much nicer but still a bit seedy family tourist magnet. Not nearly as scary now with some high-end hipster restaurants and the nice but overpriced Hollywood and Highland. Try to see a film at (the) El Capitan theatre, restored to much of its former movie palace glory and often accompanied by a small stage show and organ recital, then follow that with a head-explodingly sweet hot cocoa at Ghiradelli's next door. Then walk down to the lovely Pantages Theatre at the far end of the strip. You can always take the subway back - imagine that! The LA Metro Underground is really the best way to get to Hollywood nowadays, and will cost less than parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandisonk

10,Was I at the right place??,"My whole family wanted to see this very badly. Sadly, as soon as we drove past, I decided to just keep going. I actually wondered if I was at the wrong place for a minute. I guess I was expecting something entirely different. Pictures of this place are quite deceiving. I didn't even take a picture from the car. I was busy checking the locks on the door and there was no way we were getting out of our car. Also there was a bunch of scaffolding or some kind of construction or something all around it. Is that always there? I have no idea but it's been my dream since I was a child to see this?! What a disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C7356VQannam
30,Not very interesting.. (for me),"Street shows, souvenir shops, Hooters, Dolby Theatre, Hard Rock Café, Madame Tussauds, Chinese theatre...Names of favourite stars on the walk..People of different costumes around, can take pics with them and they insist on a tip or contribution.Its a crowded street. After having a fun filled Universal studio tour, you can relax at Hooters or Hard Rock...(Been to Madame Tussauds before, so it did not excite me)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rejiplr
30,Grotty,"For a place that is suppose to be one of Los Angeles famous tourist attractions, we found the Walk of Fame to be very grotty. Apart from the stars out front of the Chinese Theatre they were generally very dirty and we even saw some that had blood splattered over them. We walked from the Hollywood and Highland Center up to N La Brea Ave and back along the other side down to Hollywood and Wilcox Ave. We found the Hollywood area in general to be dirty except for the Hollywood and Highland Center which was very clean but outside this there was a dirty look and feel to the area. Disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nic0leR
10,Absolutely not what I expected!,"I'll be honest. I've been dreaming of coming to see the Walk of Fame since I was a little kid. This was the very last stop on my bus tour and quite frankly, when we saw it, most of us on the bus didn't even want to get off! Our tour guide warned us that the crazy people in costumes will try to take a picture with you, then demand money. Also the people trying to give you ""free"" CD's nope.. they will hound you for money.The walk of fame was so crowded, dirty, seedy with the people the tour guide talked about (Spiderman in a dirty ripped costume) was jumping into my picture and I had to tell him No thanks politely. Homeless people everywhere. I didn't feel safe and wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. It was a huge let down and not the glitz and glamour you see on tv. I was so glad my kids weren't with us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tuliplvr22
30,A good free activity,This is one of those free activities that can be very enjoyable. Wander up one side of the road and down the other trying to spot your favorite actor. A word of warning do not accept the CD's the random people that walk up to you and say they are free THEY ARE NOT ! they will ask for a tip or contribution from $5 - $20 after you have the CD in your hands. Other nearby attraction include Madame Tussauds and the Chinese Theater so make a day of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/750ralphb

If you have time or just want to get out of the heat the Scientology building had an interesting tour. Catch a tour of the stars homes. Very informative and a great way to see Hollywood. The tour guides are fantastic with their local knowledge. Lots of souvenairs available to satisfy everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annette150
40,Amazing,This is one of the best things you could go to see when you visit LA. You will have happy smileing faces if you take kids here the get to compare hand and foot sizes with celebs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertA3260
50,Fun.,It's a busy strip and everyone walks in a zig zag so they can look at the stars on the ground. It's fun. This was my second trip there. There are stars on both sides of the street. Don't forget to bring your camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuvToTravel095
40,"A Hollywood ""must""","You have not seen Hollywood until you stroll the several blocks of Hollywood Boulevard that display stars' names and stars. Along the way you will experience famed Hollywood and Highland and its shops and restaurants, the corner of Hollywood and Vine, and Grauman's Chinese Theatre. However, this is not a glamorous area at all - beware of the characters who occasionally bother you to take their picture...for a price, and the crowd of people makes this ripe for danger, plus it is filled with the homeless. Just be careful and enjoy - hopefully not alone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/portergirlbooks
40,Look For Your Idol's Name If Your have Time,"There are over two thousand of names of famous personality, Radio, TV, Movies and singers and dancers and others of past and present, along Hollywood Blvd and Vine, from 1920 or earlier, I found many of my favorite within few minutes, if you have time and look for your favorite, probably you will found them all, they even have blank one without name to be added in later date, Hollywood Blvd not a glamour avenue, gift shops, bars and restaurants of your choice, girlie show theatre, many homeless folks and strange among them, walking at daylight is perfectly safe, just mind your own business and don't do anything stupid, you are in Hollywood, anything might happen, just like in the movies, I am sure the people show up here are from every corner of the world, looking for a piece of action or looking to take advantage of a fool, a word of warning, BEWARE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hkvisitor1997
30,30 mins is enough,Worth seeing but I wouldn't spend more than half an hour here. Very trashy but cool to see some of the older stars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davideA893AO
40,Stop Off At Walk Of Fame,I visited this Hollywood Wall Of Fame on a city tour of Los Angeles. When we pulled up we were warned of the people trying to beg money and sell CD's etc. If you look past all this its a great icon not to be missed. Just walking around all the hand and footprints reading the stars names was an experience. Great photo opportunities all around and souvenir shops galore to shop till your hearts comtent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RCee_CCee
10,Once is Enough,"It was interesting to see the stars' names embedded into the sidewalk. However, this experience was a bit tacky and seedy. Too many people dressed up in costumes trying to fleece money from the public, by getting your photograph taken with them. From fat Spiderman to inflated Supergirl.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foppoff
30,"Cool to see the stars, but hated the calls from tour companies","Of Course I was only in Los Angeles for a couple of days and felt that I needed to go to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was really cool to see the stars, but to constantly have people asking if we want to see star's homes was really irritating. It is a giant tourist trap now, which takes away from the importance of these stars on the sidewalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8Nikki8
30,A Must do....Once!!!,Came here for a look as I suppose it's something to say you've done but to be honest would not rush to come back again.Strange how in such a famous place you have so many beggars and down and outs being allowed to mingle with the tourists and give them hassle by asking for money all the time?Not very easy to take pics of any of the stars on the floor as way to busy everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JOANNE_M186460
30,Iconic,You can't really go to Hollywood and not go to the walk of fame. Its not all its cracked up to be - wasn't as clean as I was expecting and it is just a pavement with some famous peoples names on stars. Was great to take a few pictures and say I'd been there - its not out the way so its easy to get to with other things to do all around you. Why not stop for a few minutes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKB0022
10,Waste of good marble,"We were on hollywood blvd. and you cannot miss this ahem attaction. From what I have heard, you pay $1500 to get one so there are many names you probably never heard of. If you are that star struck, go to the Chinese Teater and see some of the footprints and handprints that created Hollywood. I wont waste any other words on this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewkX5306OK
30,At Night - A Circus Atmosphere!,"If you're familiar with Times Square, NYC; or even the Las Vegas Strip, this is similar in nature as to the atmosphere. Street performers are everywhere with costumes, tricks, loud music, singing, and acting. (Tipping is encouraged, especially if you take their pictures.) Very crowded. Very noisy. Must admit, it's crazy, colorful. That said, be aware of your surroundings. Easy place for pickpockets to work their mojo. The Walk of Fame is interesting, but not spectacular. It's an area of hype and tribute to those in the entertainment industry who have enriched our lives. If you have a favorite or two entertainers you wish to pay your respects to, make sure you find the location of their stars before you journey into the area. I've been there during the day and it is a little quieter. At night, the area explodes - and that includes the car traffic. Your choice to make as to when you wish to see it. There are plenty of stores (typical chain types) - so food, items to purchase and bathroom facilities are in the neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roadwarriorNewJersey
20,Do not see its value nor interest,Pathetic admirers of the movie stars strolling down the street ... instead of doing something useful with their own lives... Makes me sad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gonzalo_de_Berceo
40,Interesting,"Liked it all!! a must see, Great to read all the stars name, colourful people everywhere, wax museum worth visiting, great gift shops, Hollywood sign, Johnny Rocket restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbP439
30,"Alright. Interesting enough, but ruined by the tacky tourist trap it is",Not worth much of your time. Far better and more interesting places to visit while in LA. Each to their own of course.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bobbies_trippin
30,Do not waste time,"If you drive near the Hollywood, I propose to devote no more than 10 minutes for viewing Walk of fame. Take some photos and move on, there are many other interesting things / places to do/see in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baibams
50,must see,"A trip to L.A. is not complete without seeing the walk of fame. if you are lucky (we have been both times) you get to see a celeb being presented with one and then you get all the celebrity speakers with them. They list online when there being presented, its usually in the week so never really that busy I have found. Its is very tacky around the around so be prepared but its part of Hollywood history",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karluk29
40,Walking on stars,"It's was interesting strolling down the street finding our favorite stars. A bit touristy , but good fun to see the sites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/868tinap
30,Too many people,I was here nearly 30 years ago and getting around was much easier than it is today. Simply too many people here. Too much hustling for money going on. Glad to have seen it for the last time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pitufo00
20,Huge Surprise,"When you think of Hollywood, what automatically comes to mind is glitter, splendor, fashion, wealth, smiles and glamour. From the airport right down to Hollywood Blvd, there are none of those things. It is a sad and depressing looking city and the area where the Hollywood Walk Of Fame is located is a disgusting, filthy, smelly, dump. Street people, beggars, gangs and general low life's make up this entire area and the streets are overwhelmed with them. Taking a family to this attraction is a mistake. It is not the kind of place you would take a child with even the smallest amount of good upbringing or parenting decency, which pretty much explains the low class of people that have taken over and whomever raised them in the past. It is embarrassing and it astounds me that the City of Los Angeles officials don't clean up the streets and get rid of this riff-raff that has taken over the area. This is a huge tourist area and people are not coming to see this kind of nonsense, and as long as this continues, very few will. Sure the area is crowded, but most of that crowd are locals and the people I am referring to; not so much tourists. The police seem to be overwhelmed and the store owners looked depressed because they can do nothing about any of this. It is not a good climate to spend any length of time in and certainly a let down. Keep this in mind when visiting. If I were you I would not carry anything of value, a purse or a wallet. Also you might want to consider wearing a health mask. The area is this dirty. Keep it simple and be alert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Larry8241
40,Really Cool Place,Really cool place to visit. Its definitely a must see while in the Los Angeles area. A little crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad803848
30,It's okay,It's okay. Glad I saw it but wouldn't be in any rush to go back. Dirty street but interesting to see once given it's history and place in popular culture,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marc_blues3
40,A must see when in LA,Everyone must do this at least once. Fun to step back into time seeing all the celebrity hand and foot prints.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/698bg
40,A must see but very crowded,"One of the most famous sights in Hollywood, LA. You can walk the full length in a couple of hours: it goes down 2 sides of the road, so go up one and then down the other. When it’s busy the central area gets very crowded with tourists and street performers. Don’t take photos of the performers without tipping them, they get aggressive. You might have to wait take a photo of the more popular stars. It’s a shame that some stars are badly damaged and I feel these should be tidied up. When you go towards the East along the walk of fame you can see the Hollywood sign (a much better view than from Mulholland Drive).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shadowed-raven
30,Second honeymoon,No need to book any tour or pay money to aee this attraction..just pass by these stars and read the names of the stars.Remember that its for the honor of theor sucess and achievements these stars r there. ..The only star worth seein is for the absolut vodka!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ziadj_13
40,Popular Art.,"You can see a lot of shop, get souvenirs, the walk of fame is like a boulebard is grat to see so many ""stars"" which were reconizied for their arts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aigonzaq
50,Walk on the stars,take time and spend time walking around the walk of fame and gaze at your favorite stars and take lot of photos. Go through chinese theatre and kodak theatre which is now renamed Dolby theatre. Browse the shops and buy souvenirs and T shirts. Great place for a tourist.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mukundkasthuri
10,So unappealing we didn't get out of our car!,"I had visions of glitz, hollywood & fame. Our party of four drove 40 minutes from Manhattan Beach to see the walk and we couldn't believe what we saw. A hodge podge neighborhood. No glitz. Blocks and blocks of sidewalked lined stars that meandered past regular theaters, ""Show girl theaters"", empty lots, and retail outlets (some nice, some sketchy). Made me feel bad for the stars and ""this"" being how they're honored. It wasn't compelling enough for us to bother getting out of our car. This was unaminous among the four of us. No wonder there's famous well deserving names like Clint Eastwood that aren't paying the tens of thousands of dollars for this ""honor."" Maybe if you go with extremely low expectations you'll be pleasantly surprised. If you go expecting to see how you would envision the Hollywood Stars immortalized, you're in for a big disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankd680
30,Tick it off your list,"A must see and once you have you need not return so you can tick it off your list, Very busy area with souvenir shops and characters looking to part you from your cash. A fun place to be to look out for your favourite stars and take photos of their hand and foot prints. I admit to photographing the prints of Marilyn Monroe, Clint Eastwood and Robert de Niro! You can also access a pedestrian bridge that gives a distant hillside view of the 'HOLLYWOOD' sign which is worth a photo! All a bit tacky but I would not have wanted to miss the experience of being there and the atmosphere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cadnoc
30,Good to see but nothing special,"You can visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame and try and spot your favourite celebrity star as well as visiting the various museums and souvenir shops. Try not to get sucked into getting a photo with the street performers as they will EXPECT you to tip them. However if you do want to get a photo with them you must tip them afterwards. There are plenty of people on the sidewalk trying to sell you tours and CD's. Ignore the ones trying to sell you the CD's as they will suck you into paying money (they will rip you off). Once you have been them the novelty quickly wears off. And if you are lucky to be around when there is a movie premiere or if a movie or TV show is being filmed, well, good luck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chris_sharry
30,Be prepared to look down!,"Walking down the Hollywood Walk of Fame is an experience anyone who loves music, TV, radio or film must visit! Be prepared to walk a very long distance if you want to catch most of the names. The street is very crowded but that's part of the fun of the experience. You'll note that many celebs have their names listed multiple times. Be sure and look at the icon for which category they received the particular star for. It's very interesting. If you have someone in particular you want to find please do yourself a favor and google it prior to going. It will save you a world of time! It's unfortunate and surprising that many of the stars are in disrepair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMac511
30,Not the best of hollywood,Looking at a few blocks of the walk of fame and see handprints and footprints at Tcl theater is about the only reason one might go to hollywood walk of fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soINInTraveler
20,What a dump full of street hawkers,"What a dirty dump of a place obviously only dressed up for awards nights. Every 5 steps someone tries to solicit money from you in scams like ""here have my free cd, then can you give me a couple of bucks for my family etc. "" we have to keep the kids close and these hawkers just spoilt the experience. The strip is just full of over priced sovornier stores. When you come from Melbourne LA seems very under whelming. I been seen and never come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkB10625
40,Crowded but necessary,Well it's got to be done doesn't it? Best bit is seeing the celeb handprint/footprints. Dislike the amount of tourists (to be expected).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonj376
20,Everyone should see it......ONCE,"I had really looked forward to visiting the walk of fame area. When we got there, it was quite disappointing. From the time you hit the sidewalk until you return to your car, it's a constant barrage of beggars, hawkers, and bad street performers. You can barely see the stars on the dirty sidewalk through the crowds. Trying to snap a few pictures of the El Capitan, the Chinese Theater, Madame Tussaud's, etc. was nearly impossible. When you do snap a picture, you run the risk of some bad Elvis impersonator thinking you've taken their picture and owe them some money. The only area we actually enjoyed was the handprint/footprint area that is off the sidewalk by the Chinese theater. It seemed that there were just a few visitors like us taking pictures away from the mob on the sidewalk. I think this is an area everyone should see (just to say you did), but not something to expect a lot from. My advice is not to snap a picture of anyone, don't talk to anyone, and don't take anything from anyone. See it and LEAVE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soonersports
50,Historic and interesting,Find the stars of each of your favorite Hollywood stars and other famous people. Love that Billy Graham was there. Every genre and interest covered. Love the city hub bub.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dawnie_Bird
10,Dirty Sidewalk,"If I had know this was just a piss covered side walk, I would have stayed home.The characters along the street - one really looked like Michael Jackson. Then saw a 47 year old fat bald man squeezed in to Walmart spiderman pj's and tried to pull it off. not so mucheveryone tries to sell you a tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryguytpt
30,Not what I expected,"We lived off the walk of fame for 2 weeks and didn't stop to marvel over how the place has been left to fall to pieces. It is a crowded mess 7 days a week. Homelessness is rife with beggars and hawkers on every corner. One evening there were 6 spidermen (with dirty, torn costumes) offering to pose in photos for a fee. There was one shooting incident where a young man was arrested at 4pm. It's hard to imagine that the Oscar's are held here each year. We did see a new star being awarded and the Hollywood Museum was a delight (although a bit run down too).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aodina
20,So disappointed!,"The street is dirty, smelly and the Crowd of unwanted hustlers is so overwhelming ! You would think the City of Angels would clean this world famous site, since they probably get some very hefty property taxes from all the businesses located on the street....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgutierrez5
20,Grotty!,The whole area is filthy and run down. There are touts EVERYWHERE and whilst you can say 'no thank you' you will have to do it at least 15 times. Drive past and see it but don't spend anytime here - unless there is something you particularly want to do and see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dippa78
30,A bit underwhelming,"We've all seen the red stars in the granite sidewalk but there didn't seem to be any logical order to them. Some of them were also covered up by street vendors or construction equipment. And when you stop to take pictures, there is a get-rich-quick street busker who offers you a CD ""free"" but asks persistently for a ""donation"" to help his ""career"".Same goes for the guys dressed in superhero costumes who accost you to take a picture with them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palmfronds
30,Negotiate or Just Say No Thank You,"Your choices when met with all of the characters in costume on Hollywood Blvd and there are a lot of them, some costumes and there wearers have seen better days. If you want a picture with one of them, negotiate the price before the snap, they are trying to make a living so be kind but not silly. The rappers will try to give you a free CD and if you take one, they will then ask for a donation, we watched one of these transactions, we don't know the amount they asked for but they didn't hassle me when I said no thank you. The costume characters and the rappers seemed to mostly hang around TCL Chinese Theatre. There are also a lot of people hustling for tours, we were already on an excellant tour, The Legends of Hollywood, that gave us time to explore Hollywood Blvd, so we politely declined, again be polite they are only trying to make a living.Was it worth it, yes, it makes you appriciate the fact that you don't have to hustle to make a living.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CocoaMelbourne
20,Not what it is cracked up to be,I had very high expectation of this place. It is just a star with a celebrities name. If you see one you have seen them all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/366kelliw
20,Disappointing - hold onto your wallet,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame and the TCL Chinese Theater were not worth the time. There are people dressed as characters who work for tips by trying to get you to take a photo with them. Others are trying to push CDs on you and pressure you to buy them. The handprints of the stars are interesting, especially the older ones. You can go here to say you've been here but not much to do and not as it appears on TV.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trippin00
40,Find your star,"The Walk of Fame is an interesting place. The biggest names are around the Dolby Theatre block, but you can find others down the road. It can be fun to look for your fav or finding familiar names everywhere. Also, it is only a regular road with special pedestrian pavement, so despite the center, everything else is just like any other road (shops, restaurants, souvenirs, homeless). The mascots and the interesting things only happen in the center, but it can be very crowded all day. Go in the morning and you can walk around in calm. Don't expect any glamour or 'star' things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bgama87
40,"A must to visit, but look where you are going!!","No visit to LA would be complete without a visit here. It's very long (over a mile?) but people tend to concentrate on the main touristy area around the ChineseTheatre. Be careful where you are walking as too many people are so busy looking down at the stars that they walk right into you. There are plenty of names to see on the other side of the road and further up and down Hollywood Boulevard, so don't just follow the crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TOM-C--LIVERPOOL
30,Very Disapointing,"We were expecting a big glitzy display along a major thoroughfare but it was largely in a run down area of Hollywood. We visited it on the hop on hop off bus on the red route. we wish we had spent more time on the green and yellow route which were much more interesting. This is definitely more hype than substance, if on a limited time scale give it a miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RIDINGAROUND
40,"A little crass, but then it IS Hollywood, right?","We enjoyed our amble down the Walk of Fame, and were amazed at how comprehensive it is, and had a number of good laughs and exclamations of surprise and happiness at seeing some of our favorite actors' stars. That said, the sheer number and wideness of the recognitions came as something of a surprise.......reminded me of my mystification at the telephone book length credits at the end of movies. The biggest stone in my shoe was the multitude of folks in costume who cajole the rubes (me included) into taking photos with them, then get belligerent in demanding their ""tip"" and expressing their displeasure at the size and timing of delivery of same. All of that said, I would still much recommend this one of a kind place/experience - - - DON'T MISS THE GLITZ!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gtennant
40,Pleasant Surprise,"This place really isn't as bad as some past reviewers make it out to be. Before i left for LA i checked reviews for everywhere including the walk of fame and was slightly apprehensive approaching hollywood bvd as i had read some horror stories on here about how bad it was. However, i was pleasantly surprised as it really wasn't that bad and walked down it every day before moving on to a hotel in Anaheim. I've been to NYC a few times now and the WoF in comparison to Time Square really wasn't anything different in terms of having the terrible looking characters desperate for your money. If someone offers you a CD (which they will, multiple times), just politely decline and move on and have fun looking for the stars of your favourite celebrities!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/502rebeccaw
40,Iconic and very interesting characters,"Very easily to get there via the metro. What a fantastic day for photo opportunities. We spent so much time just people watching. Ripleys museum, Hollywood Highland Centre, Disney Store, Guinness World Records, Ghiradellis but to name a few. There was a fantastic sale at DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse : what a variety and so many bargains !Loved the buskers, but it gets annoying when all the people dressed up as characters demand donations at every corner. Was surprised to see so many homeless people though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YasminHL
40,Not as bad as some reviews would have you think,"While we didn't spend much time at the Hollywood Walk of Fame (we spent more time at Madame Tussards and the shopping center), it was still worth the brief visit in order to walk down the street and glimpse the stars of celebrities from various eras.I never felt threatened and was actually surprised of how respectful people were of each others space and how people would give those who crouched down to take photos next to their favorite celebrities' stars, ample space to do so. Yes, there are musicians and people dressed up as superheroes and the like around but I simply said ""no thank you"" and they'd go on their merry way. Some were extremely polite and apologized for taking up my time.If you've only got a day or two in LA, I wouldn't recommend visiting the Walk of Fame as LA has so much more to offer. However if you're spending at least a week in LA, go ahead and visit the Walk of Fame. :) Especially if you plan to visit one of the two wax museums next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TabathaAJ
30,Once was enough.,"Had some time yo kill before we could check into out hotel in Anaheim. My husband had never been so he wanted to see thy Hollywood sign and the stars on the sidewalk. This place is OK if you've never been, and aren't bothered by people on the street trying to sell you their CD's, or getting you to go on a a Hollywood tour. We were also asked by a few people to give them spare change because they were out of their ""medicine."" I don't need to see this email place again...once was enough to kill time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RainbowLieberman
50,Great Time!,"We all started off our afternoon with lunch at Musso and Franks's, then on to look up the stars of our favorites on the Walk of Fame!

Wikipedia has a List of Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame that makes it easy to find your favorites!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tag-about
20,Not sure if this is a must see...,"If you are a People Magazine, US Weekly, E! News, TMZ watching creature, this is properly for you. Yes, it was nice to see the Chinese Theater and some of the famous stars in person, but I would not fight all the crazy people on the street for it again. What's up with all the wanna be rappers trying to give away/cell their CDs. Not fun to walk thru there and most of them are very rude. Just get ready for it, if you decide to go and see it. It definitely is not all the glamour they show you on TV, more the opposite to be honest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lillitiger
40,Must see,You can't go to LA and not go and see the walk of fame. The stars go on for ages and it can get very busy.Be careful of the men handing out CD's I nearly got caught. The CD's are not free and as we witnessed the men can get abusive if you take one and then try and give it back.Would go back though as it's Hollywood!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinkgirl86

40,Fun To See the Different Stars - A Walk with Memories...,"When in Hollywood, its always fun to see the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Each time I seem to find different stars I like to see. One of them is Regis Philbin - We like his as he was once the guest of honor for the fun Hollywood Christmas parade. There are even stars for some of the famous Disney characters. Its not something to spend a lot of time doing, but look down, and see what stars interest you when you visit this famous area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini

30,Different experience this time around,"I've been visiting HWOF since the late 90s. During the late 90s and early 2000s, HWOF was really nice. There was no panhandling from the characters, and the experience was one that didn't need to be rushed.During my recent visit, my companion and I popped in and out of a few stores, bought a few things, had drinks at Lucky's Tavern, and he was persuaded out of $10 for a homemade poetry CD. When the guy saw my friend's money, dude said, ""My CDs are $10 but ppl usually give me $20."" I laughed, my companion said ""Is that right?"" The guy responded, ""yes."" I chimed in again and said, ""Not today."" Dude took the $10 and went to the next potential customer.The only reason I wanted to visit HWOF during this trip was to see the Jimmy Kimmel studio, of which I STILL didn't see because our movements were so quick that we passed right by the studio without knowing it.Will I go again, I don't know. Especially since my companion paid $15 for us to park just a little over 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RiesReviews
30,You do it once,"I expected Hollywood Blvd & the Walk of Fame to be more exciting and interesting even given the tourist trap that it is. It really wasn't. It was overkill and that $5 store by the theater practically sucks you in like a black hole as you walk by. We were there over Memorial wknd to be fair and we did find parking quite easily in the blvd., but after walking up and down, checking out the tee-shirt shops we were good and I would not feel the need to go back when I visit LA again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rengem
20,Not that great....,"I would have liked this more without the smell of urine and the man lying in the middle of the sidewalk, with no arms or legs! It is a scary area, with lots of homeless people roaming around. It is mildly entertaining to see the stars on the Walk of Fame, but I would not go there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaomeBradshaw
40,Good experience but beware of hagglers,Good experience walking down hall of fame and sights ana lights. However beware of hagglers. We got stormed by 4 people dressed as Spider-Man Thor pirates of Caribbean and anothe one we had no clue about. Took pictures and it costed us about 20 bucks!!! We got sucked into it as we had kids but over all a good 2 hours spent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashishbh
40,Fun,"Found underground parking by the CVS/DSW area and were able to easily walk to several of the ""stars"" we wanted to see as well as some shopping areas. Very crowded and lots of people trying to hand you CDs or sell you tickets, but if you can ignore them, it's a neat experience you can have for as short or long a time as you want. We got a pamphlet at our hotel that listed where each star's star was so we were able to find them all easily. Without it, this could've turned into a much longer stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/916katy
50,A walk through History,"A walk through history among many well known stars, (no pun intended) right next to the Chinese Theatre, full of mystery and the famous hand prints and footprints of many of earlier day stars. The whole area vibrates with excitement and enthusiasm, with street artists, snack bars Cinema's and the odd shoot of part of a movie being taken and surprisingly clean. well worth a visit if you are in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rod1444
10,Down right dangerous,This area is not at all what I had expected. There were unhinged people wandering around everywhere and talking to themselves. The sidewalks were extremely dirty and we couldn't find a single quality restaurant. I will never take my family there again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNMomof2BG
40,"A must see, with caution","We visited Hollywood around dinnertime to check out the hoopla around here. We parked in the first lot available at a reasonable $10. The stars are every few feet along the walk of fame and go on for many blocks. Most names we were unfamiliar with but with a few hundred stars along the sidewalks, there were still plenty to see and photograph. It's easy to constantly look down at the stars while not paying attention to our surroundings. When we did look up we were sorry to see a variety of bizarre characters looking for handouts, others loudly singing or playing instruments for donations, or the obnoxious crews handing out cd's trying to get you to fall for their "" I will make a cd for you"" bait and hook. Our already leery family had to keep a close eye on our belongings. There are many shops along the way for cheap gifts and souvenirs, such as real US state license plates that made us wonder where they came from. Strolling the walk of fame was both a thrilling and alarming experience at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoadtripCowboy
20,Very disappointing,"We ended up booking a week on Hollywood Boulevard and expected it to be a very upmarket area, how wrong we were. The area is seedy and dirty, you have people walking past who are high on drugs, drunk or on the corners you have prostitutes or homeless people. I wouldn't visit again.I had someone try and snatch my handbag and another guy was following me so I ended up going in to a cafe to get away. I am use to being in dodgy areas around the world but I've never felt as aware and alert as I did here. I didn't walk alone again after that one incident and wouldn't let my 20yr old son out alone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karos1
30,Don't miss this,"And I mean it literally: Do not miss this, because the surrounding area and the shops are mostly in a bad shape so you would not expect ""The Walk Of Fame"" in such a place. This point of interest is in my opinion not what it promises but you are going to visit it anyway, wouldn't you? So don't miss it ;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reef20000
40,Visit once & only once,"The walk of fame is a great sight to see- plaques from all of your favourite stars can be seen along the walk as well the the Kodak and Chinese theatres, the Roosevelt hotel and Disney store. Souvenir shopping can also be done and I would highly recommend La La Land. Be aware of your belongings at all times as there are a lot of hustlers along the street, do not give your name to anyone or prepare to pay. Buskers are also a big hit here and if you want photos make sure you tip. There are take away restaurants if you need a quick bite to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChantellePrice
30,Stars,"have to agree with several othersthe stars (specially those ones around the kodak theather) are well mantainedwe walked maybe 10-15 blocks and the area isn´t the nicest, lots of homeless people around not that they bothered us but stillfor us it was a must see but a short walk was all we needed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evelinaNybro_Sweden
30,This was okay,The walk of fame was part of my Hollywood experience. I'm glad we went but I was a little disappointed. It is very dirty and the streets are lined with shop after shop of souvenir places. We did have fun looking at the hand and for prints of the stars but that was it. I would say this is a place you should go to if you are in Hollywood but it dont plan on staying long,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/59kathyn
40,Interesting and Fun,"This is another of those must do things when in Los Angeles.It is fun spotting the ""stars"", and when we visited there were floral tributes on the star for Robin Williams..so touching.There are people dressed up as film characters who will try to get you to have a picture taken with them, beware, they are after tips.Parking was a slight problem, but we found a ""garage"" around the corner for a reasonable fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nsmith50
30,Overrated.,"On my recent trip to Los Angeles I was looking forward to hollywood blvd and the walk of fame. You always hear people talking about it on tv and other places. What I found out is that there is no glamor in it. You walk a few miles to see the stars, most of which belong to people I've never heard of. The street is crowded with street performers and bums all seeking a dollar. Not to mention people pushing their music cd on you and when you accept so they leave you alone they demand a donation. The street is lined with trinket souvenir shops with cheap items for a high price and over priced restaurants. I'm glad I got to see it once but have no desire to go back. Also you can't walk more than 20 feet without someone offering to give you a tour of Hollywood in a dirty open topped van.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelerfromthatcher
30,Tick in the box to say you've been!,"When we went last year in June it was baking hot and to be fair not that enjoyable. Parking the car was a nightmare and cost us a few bucks! Would I go again, probably not no! It's just a tick in the box to say I've been to it, it's a very very long dirty packed area with millions of tourists around you. Every man and their dog are trying to sell you their crap music CD's which you don't want! You have to look hard and long for any famous stars you may know. There are loads of bars and clubs down that way but not a place I'd socialise in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fonseca-Denning
40,One of those things you should see at least once,"It's names of celebrities on a sidewalk. That's it. It's become an iconic thing to see your favorite stars name on the ground for some reason, I've always found it quite odd. Anyhow, it's all part of the allure of the Hollywood tourist trap, which is exactly what you should expect, I don't mind though because I know what it all is!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoubleOIncognito
30,Know what to expect,"Hollywood Walk of Fame is described as ""Scenic Walking Area"" - but it is not really a walking area and it's definitely not scenic. It is just a long and dirty stretch of Hollywood Blvd with cheap souvenir shops. The reason it's called Walk of Fame is the pavement has stars with supposed celebrity names on them every few feet. It is stretched across several blocks, so there are MANY starts and many names - only few of the names were known to us despite our love for Hollywood movies.So, it may be OK to see Hollywood Walk of Fame if you are already in the area - just to be able to say ""I've been there"", whatever its worth. But know what to expect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V043
50,Amazing!,A must do attraction for anyone in Hollywood. We were disappointed that Michael Jackson's star was under construction but everything else was awesome. Some good souvenirs stores along the way!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Preshanthan
40,Fun to see the stars,We visited the Walk of fame in 2011 with our than 13 month old son. We found it a sport to find as many stars we knew. It was fun walking over them. The shops are touristy and cheesy. The small mal is fun to walk through and eat in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cosetteiscookin
40,Better than I expected,"I'd heard bad things about Hollywood; it's full of homeless people, it's a bit dirty, etc, so we were a little worried as we arrived at gone 7pm with the sun firmly set. However I'm now assuming that the people saying those things haven't been to San Francisco! While we did see a couple of crazies, and it probably is a little less than nice if you wander away from the main stretch, we had a really good time for the hour or so that we were there. There was a really fun buzz to everywhere even just walking up and down the street, and we got some insane bargains from the $5 store.You don't need to spend more than a couple of hours here including time for a meal, but it's well worth it. Plus if you park at the Hollywood & Highland Center - and not the $12 parking place immediately in front of the entrance to said parking lot - you can get 2 hours parking for just a couple of dollars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scruff_UK
20,not what i expected,"Seeing stars names in stars was okay,but the entire Hollywood scene was nothing more than chincy stores all with the same cheap souvenirs. The celebrity impersonators were polite and explained they do photographs with you for whatever tip you feel is fair. They did look very much like the real deal. Was fun seeing a few places seen on television like mels diner and graumans theater. I had expected more upscale stores and more famous buildings. Glad I did it but won't do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodar21
20,See what you need and then get out!,"The walk of fame is a cultural landmark that everyone wants to see once, but it can be unpleasant to be here. Hordes of tourists flock here and, following them, all the worst you might expect from a tourist trap: cheesy museums and junky shops, tour company reps who approach you every 5 seconds, people dressed up in superhero or other bizarre costumes, people offering you a ""free"" music CD (they take it back if don't pay them or insult you if you decline), and a whole cast of other characters. You may be happy to say you've finally visited here, but as soon as you've seen what you need, you want to get out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rlennon1
30,Must visit at least once,"I recommend everybody to go this place at least once in their lives as it is apart of American and Hollywood history. That being said it is (obviously) packed out with tourists and to be honest could do with a good scrub as it was quite dirty. Some of the young men trying to promote their cds are very polite whereas others are actually quite rude. I would suggest sometimes doing what others do and ignore them as oppose to saying no thank you politely as some get pushy. That being said some are also very polite. There are lots of stores and souvenir shops but a lot of them can be over priced however most of the items sold are the same in every store. Theres a large variety of food places too. In regards to fashion, clothes and other shopping (non-souvenir) based the prices are not that bad tbh and make up and ladies perfume) so my partner told me) was still cheaper than the UK. The coolest part for me was Elvis, Michael Jackson and Muhammad Ali's star alongside various celebrities hand prints. Overall was a good experience but I will not be that bothered about going again I suggest everybody does this at least once in their life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PersianDanny
40,A lot of fun!,I had no expectation but to see the Chinese Theater from outside and look for the hand prints and shoe prints of my favorite actors. It was a lot of fun to locate them. The people in costume are VERY obnoxious! There are a lot of people and it is very crowded. We just drove and park at the public parking. I would not pay for a tour but going on your own is great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pomerols
40,Nice!,I visited this place december last year. It was a nice place to see! Lots of people around and there are really lots of people in Michael Jackson's star wanted to take a picture so it's very crowded in the Michael Jackson area. :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johngerard3
30,Holly weird!,This place is very eccentric in every aspect all the way down to the ppl in costumes walking around and the druggies lurking! It's almost impossible to get a good photo of the stars due to the high volume of rude ppl walking around not to mention the solicitors and hagglers trying to prey on the tourist. Everything is way over priced and overrated. Sorry not impressed by the lights and glamour of this so called Hollywood hot spot. One pro is that if your a tourist there are a lot of photo ops and tours of the city offered.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PostCommander
30,eat before any tour,"Tock my cousins that came from Mexico to see the walk of fame. Total of 4 adult, 2 children and 1 toddler, (in a stroller). Not so exciting to walk but tock a bus tour that tock more than 2 hours, did not have lunch prior to the tour so we were starving at the end of the tour. Nothing really to see if you walk unless you want to shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/comento123
40,Nice to see but it needs some work,"Didnt stay long, just went to have a walk along the famous strip, the area looks dirty and really needs a good cleaning. Was over the streetwalkers/buskers as well after a few minutes. Worth going to see just to say you've been there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I8157ZKdavidr
40,Must see,"We were in LA so had to see. The walk of fame wasn't as interesting to me as the handprints and foot prints in front of the TCL Chinese Theatre, but we also only walked a portion of the walk. Didn't see too many homeless as many reviews state but there were a few.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinad2010
30,"Not as amazing as I thought it would be, but cool all the same!","It literately took us about twenty minutes if that to do/see this! The hand and foot prints of the celebrities were cool! Would recommend going to see this, just to say you have! Not as amazing as I thought it would be, but cool all the same!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dandilionaid
20,Over Rated - Tacky - Boring,"Took a walk down here - up one side - down the other.Harrassed almost all the time.After a few stars in the path - they all look the same and it becomes ""so what""But it ticked a box - we walked down the Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidAWooo
50,Something that made me cried,"It was the month where Robin Williams passed away, and I was there at the walk of fame, going past by the names of super stars. And I came across Robin's name, where flowers were placed around. It captured many people's attention. And many did cry a tear or two.. silently.Overall, was a pleasant walk in the heart of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flowerymae
50,Gotta be done,"Walked the walk of fame last evening, Saturday at about 5.30pm as a family of four with the two boys aged 8 and 10. Read lots of helpful reviews here so knew to avoid eye contact with anyone carrying a stack of CD's- successfully. Also avoided the characters / photo ops but still got a good look. Saw a few stars on the walk important to us and got some great photos. Busy, bustling, yes there was the odd unpleasant smell and a few homeless unfortunates but having come half way round the world could not have left LA without seeing this and recommend to all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilM367
40,More to this than we realised!,Although reviews are mixed for this tourist trap we enjoyed our short visit not realising that Hollywood Blvd is as long! We had dinner in Cleo's on Vine St but should have left more time to explore the Walk of Fame. You certainly need to get a map if you want to find particular 'stars' otherwise I was made up as I stumbled across my namesake Simon Fuller! Worth a look if in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonF64
50,A 'Landmark' street of Hollywood,We visited the 'Hollywood Walk of Fame' when we visited Los Angeles during our pan-USA tour in August 2012. It was a wonderful experience and see the names of all renowned Hollywood stars reminiscing about all the movies that one had seen. The kids aged 11 and 9 years enjoyed it too. Worth a visit for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Naresh_Karani
40,Street for the stars,"The Hollywood walk of fame is crowded most of the time by tourist looking for the names of their stars. Unfortunately, for the unsuspecting tourist, they stand to be ripped of by bogus tourist guide who charge them sky high prices & to lose their hard money to pickpockets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosAzmanShah-Madinah
50,Hands Down - this was a must during our Hollywood trip,"Although many of the Hollywood streets themselves I found a little bit drab and disappointing, it was truly great to walk down this one with the hand (etc) prints of so many stars. The Star tour of the famous houses is also well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/508malcolmh
30,Watch your pockets.,"Hollywood has nice areas but unfortunately this isn't one of them. It's for tourists so it's very crowded, dirty and expensive. I've been here several times and I've seen pick pockets steal out of women's purses, homeless beggars, there are pushy people in character costumes and young artists who are trying to sell cd's. At all times someone comes up to you and tries to get money. They have Hollywood bus tours and if the buses are empty, they will approach you for a discounted tour. Some are nice, but most are just the standard Hollywood tourist spots. Everyone should experience the Walk of Fame at least once, just watch out for who's around you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GK19792014
40,Street of stars,"Who can help but look at the stars at your feet & try and recognise the many famous names. It's a great attraction as it stops you looking at the trashy shops and the more seedy side of life. Well worth looking at the major TV stars on the corner of Hollywood & Vine, as they are the only stars without a star on the pavement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisdY6254YU
50,Amazing!,"This is a must for anyone in LA. The Hollywood walk of fame is a really great stroll, looking at all the stars. Lots of great shopping, people watching. Beverly Hills and the Hollywood sign are nearby as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1987Stella1987
50,Disappointed. .,We found it extremely dirty and found ourselves a little scared to get out and walk around for it being such a highly talked about area I would expect it to be cleaner and more inviting. There were homeless people everywhere and trash all over... men trying to promote themselves on the streets getting extremely pushy will females not wanting to be bothered.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrissyjo2381
20,No impressed.,We were expecting glamorous Hollywood stuff. This area is creepy. Its dirty and smelly. We spent a total of 30 minutes there and were ready to go. It was great to see some of the sights & stars. Just surprised at what a crummy area it is.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissKS67
30,It's ok,"It's a ""must do"" but it wasn't that exciting for me! nothing really special besides the stars with their names.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P6538ROsarag
40,Hollywood Stars,"What you see is what you get, the Hollywood Walk of Fame is simply entertainers stars paved in cement along Hollywood Blvd as well as Vine Street. There are many people I as well as the 3 people I was with had never heard of, so I would encourage if you want to make the most of this attraction, search for the addresses where your favourite people are. I made sure to see Michael Jackson and The Beatles and stumbling across some others along the way was enjoyable. Great seeing the Dolby Theatre along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Begg_rfc
40,Worth it if you haven't seen it before,"If you've never done it, I would advice going maybe once or twice. Eventually it will seem like a slightly glorified sidewalk, but considering how well known it is, it really is kind of a must.There is a little more added excitement if someone is getting a star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeW45
40,At least go once,The stars are honestly really neat to look at and take pictures of/with.Homeless individuals are in certain areas of the walk.The main reason I went is to see Marilyn Monroe's star.TIP: Marilyn's star is actually in front of the McDonald's.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Revy679
40,Walk Among The Stars,"This is a must when visting Hollywood, a bit of nostalgia, a bit of mystery. I visited after Robin Williams passed away, his star was covered in flowers, photos, it was very sad. But I really enjoyed seeing all the stars and the chinese theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TalineLovesRoadtrips
50,Hollywood Legends,"I loved following the stars on both sides of the road. I did not realise just how long the Walk of Fame is. I was thrilled to pose next to Clint Eastwoods star-it ""made my day"". I also loved the tribute acts posing for photos for a fee especially Catwoman.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/781steved
30,"Been there, done that.","We used the metro and buses out of Hollywood and Highland station, so the walk of fame was on our daily walk. As Robin Williams passed away, his star was full of flowers and that was neat to see.As others said, we wanted to see it. And we did.There is a lot of people, tourists and characters combined. Along with the shop people that want to go in their stores and buy something for 5 $. The characters that want you to pay them for photographs (but they are quite nice) or hat sellers.In the AM, homeless folks sleeping everywhere. They were not approaching tourists or being scary though.Overall OK.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zaz936
30,Not as glamorous as the TV shows.,"From what I saw on TV, I expected a glamorous area dedicated to the Stars. This wasn't the case. The Walk of Fame (WOF) is on a city street that is busy and dirty. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed finding and taking photos of the stars of celebrities, but it just didn't live up to the hype. One of the most annoying things are the up-and-coming singers/rappers that con you into buying their CDs. They will chat to you, sign a CD, give it to you and then expect payment. Even if you refuse it, they won't take no for an answer.I am happy that I saw the WOF, but I feel it is a ""been there, done that"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quinni_224
30,It's about your bucket list,"If you are in the area, why not? Best way to do this is to find your favorite star's star (or see if they have one). The Walk of Fame is 3 miles long so, use this website to find the location: http://www.walkoffame.com and save time and energy. While you are in the area take advantage of everything else too: El Capitan Theatre, Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Dolby Theatre, there is a lot to see in this area as well. So, you will not be wasting your time. Park at the underground parking lot under the Renaissance Hotel, get your ticket validated and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/297PaulaL
50,Long Walk,It is a great honor to walk by/pass or on the famous names in the world. From the oldies to the new it is a great experience. Walk Of Fame seems like a never ending path... to Fame of course! Great walking experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/406giovannir
30,"Tick off the list, probably wouldn't go back.","It's worth going for the day just to tick it off the bucket list, but really it's quite dirty/smells of urine and you get a LOT of people trying to hassle you selling you stuff like their CDs and tours. They will trick you and shove a CD in your hand and then when you think it's free, they'll ask for money. Same thing with the characters in costumes, they will tell you to take a photo with them INSISTENTLY even though you don't want it and then afterwards tell you to hand over the cash. You can see the chinese theatre (meh), walk of fame (meh), Madame Tussades (meh) and take a look at some souvenier shops, but really i wouldn't plan your LA trip around the Hollywood walk of fame. It is really missing the Glamour and Old World charm you assume it would have!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieRiley
30,Underwhelming,"It certainly is a ""must see"", but I was rather underwhelmed. My fiance didn't even get out of the car. I just took some pictures and we left, mainly because the surroundings are quite dodgy. Would probably go again though as we lost the photos I took, but not a place I'm raving about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinak239
20,Do not make detour for that,"Crowd, peddlers, agressive scam artist that put a cd in your hands and then want you to pay for it.

20,Let Down,"I was expecting a magical place as we are talking about Hollywood right?Nah...would not waste much time there. The street is a bit run down, would only go just for the sake of seeing the place.Would recommend you to search the star you are looking for before you go because the walk of fame goes on for kilometershttp://www.walkoffame.com/starfinder",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610carolinag

This is a call to LA to clean the area up. Get rid of the local rif-raf!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aashpatel

30,Ok,It's sad that the local people basically take over a portion of the Boulevard and make it pretty trashy and ghetto. Fun to see all the names but only for a quick second before somebody harasses you for a tour or money,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradr879
30,Cool,"This was a something we made a trip to see and see what it was all about, since we were in Nevada we said why not take a trip to LA and see the walk of fame. But I was not impressed it was just an average day in NYC.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimlanw
40,A Must Visit - Not what we expected,"We were not sure what to expect coming from Australia and didn't realise that the Walk of Fame was actually located a long way away from our hotel which was in Beverley Hills. Let me start by saying the Walk of Fame is a street which runs for I would say 3kms with stars on the path (I was expecting a small little area) the street is really lined with tourist operators, souvenir shops, cafes etc and a small shopping presence. At night it comes alive with impersonators and buskers. It was a fun place to visit and would definitely that you pay it a visit even if it for a few hours. I would suggest visiting late arvo early evening then you see all the lights and the wacky people come out. There are also a lot of places to visit along the street (ie Madame Tasauds, Ripley's, Guinness World Records)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frequentoztravellers
50,An interesting jaw dropping fun experience.,"Despite being our second visit to Hollywood as we previously had a stay over there on our way to Hawaii, it remains a very interesting attraction. Although our hotel was within walking distance of the Hollywood Walk of Fame we also stopped there while doing a tour of Hollywood and Los Angeles. This Walk of Fame comprises more than 2,500 five-pointed stars embedded in the sidewalks along 15 blocks of Hollywood. Boulevard. The stars are permanent public monuments to achievement by many people in the entertainment industry, bearing the names of movie and TV actors, musicians, directors and many others. About half of them are of people in the motion pictures category.The only problem is that it spans over such a long distance that it is rather difficult to find one of a particular celebrity. When we enquired from our tour guide whether he knows where we could find one of our local South African born and oscar winning actress Charlize Theron, he did not even know who she was.I stroll down Hollywood Walk of Fame also provides some interesting experiences. Some locals dress up and pose as famous Hollywood characters like Jack Sparrow, and Spider man. To have a picture of you taken with them cost about $5.My colleagues envy the photo of me taken with a wax version of Marilyn Monroe.The jaw dropping part was our posture while viewing the weird locals!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeonKay
30,Pretty Average,"It's a iconic place, but otherwise just a touristy, busy, sidewalk. I'd imagine if there was an event going on things might be a bit more exciting but otherwise just some famous people's names on the sidewalk and lots of places to buy souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skirack
30,Very creepy place with creepy people.,"Even that ""Hollywood Walk of Fame"" sounds attractive, it is not really related to stars and especially to their way of life. The whole street is full of stores with bad quality of Chinese souvenirs, cheap lingerie, fast food, drugs and tobacco. Sometimes, everything is possible to find in one store.You will see around youself homeless drug addicts, comics characters, prostitutes and tourists walking through them.In addition, it is also very hard to find a parking lot during evening. Therefore, we (a couple) recommend you to come early morning in order to find some empty space that will allow you to park your car for couple of hours for free. Otherwise, be ready to spend approximately 10$ per hour for some stuffy underground parking.If talking about stars on the road, then be sure that no homeless or no other creepster is standing on your favorite star. And even when you will find it, be sure there is no puke or something worse above your idol before taking picture of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lalaki-Papaki
20,Crowded!,"We were there Dec 23, and decided not to try walking. The crowds were unbelievable. It's obviously a popular location!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JANETM45
40,"Touristy, but also just as fun for us locals.","Thank goodness Hollywood is trying to clean up the streets, used to known for the hookers and other non desirables. When tourists come to LA, I try to tell them not to stay in the craphole called Hollywood, but come during the day, play tourist, and leave.Not every celebrity gets their name on the Walk of Fame. Ok, it seems that every celeb (even the B lists) gets a star, but I heard that its not just money but a nomination from the right person will get you immortality on the shiny streets of Hollywood Blvd.Its always fun to read the sidewalk while walking to your destination. The most recent was at Hollywood and Highland, where I spotted Robin Williams' star.Yup, a destination for the star struck tourist who doesn't know any better, but wants to visit Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callmemochelle
30,"Tacky, but iconic","Walked this and like the review it's tacky but iconic. Well impressed with seeing the Kiss, Motley Crüe and Tom Jones stars. This goes on for ages and some of the stars are duplicated which i didn't understand - surely you'd just not have a star rather than have two?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badm00nr
40,Really cool and funny place.,"The place is right out from the metro so it is not so hard to find, if there's a recommendation to give: Look for the exact location of the star you are looking for!, it may turn in a headache if you do not look for in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesusep

10,"A lot of hype, A lot of dissappointment","From the amount of people staring at the floor bumping into you to the amount of people trying to sell actor look alike and other things was just a great deal of disappointment. Let alone not just how overrated the area is, it's only a few streets that are nice. I didn't find any place that interested me only stores that I could find in my home town mall. I guess living in New York City puts any other city in the US to shame. The only other city i'd suggest, calling a true city is Chicago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kat_r0d
50,Lifetime and Awesome Experince,"The place is full with fun and enjoyment. There are shops, pubs, and restaurants at both sides of the Hollywood street. Many roadside shops are also available. Interested people can also book Hollywood city tour from here as many tour operators are available here.You may also like to see many artists here posing as famous Hollywood characters like Jack Sparrow, Transformers, and Spider man etc. To have a picture with them, you have to pay some money to them, may be $5 or more.There are 2500 starts available on the walk of fame belonging to five different categories. All starts are available on the ground probably this is the reason this place is called The Walk of Fame. But one name is not on the ground, and the name is Mohammad Ali.You may see people from all parts of the world coming here and enjoying. I saw a few Indian families there in traditional clothes which was sufficient enough to identify them as Indians.People from Europe are also in abundance here as for them visiting USA is cheaper because of difference in Dollar and Euro.Overall, this is the place I bet you will enjoy a lot. Better if you go with your partner of family. No hassle. No problem. Nothing to complaint about this place. After all, USA is USA and there is only one Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amitabh_kishore
40,great fun,"if you are in Los Angeles, the Hollywood walk of fame is a must seeIts great fun to walk along Hollywood Boulevard spotting the stars of your favourites. its also amusing to watch excited tourists photographing the wrong star (there is a star for Michael Jackson the singer (king of pop) and another for Michael Jackson the radio presenter. There are also 2 actors called Harrison Ford (Han Solo and silent movie star) - don't get the wrong one!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_fatdonut
20,"You should do this once, and at night is best","On a Friday night, we arrived an hour before sunset, and it is pretty easy to see as the crowds and street entertainment hasn't gotten underway for the most part.At certain parking lots, the street entertainers are getting ready and dressed, for their night of doing what they do, ask for your $$$To walk a couple miles on one side of the street, then back on the other side, after the full crowds are there when its dark, takes a few hours. Parking will cost you about $15-20, make sure to lock up and hide valuables!Everything is on sale (LOL) and there are tour bus operators begging for your $$$ every 100 feet, along with 100's of street people sleeping, along with the smell of urine not to include the actual filth.You should do this ""One Time"" but try to keep an open mind, thinking about the stars that have graced this area, and the beauty it once was.

30,Not what I expected!,It was not as nice as I expected! The sidewalk was dirty and too many people trying to get you to take their sightseeing tours! It was hard to find cheap parking and it was hard to see signs! Routes not marked good! Too many homeless people going though trash! I did find the star I wanted to see but I had to do it without my husband because he was too busy driving around trying to find parking which he never did! I would of like to see more stars but because of the parking didn't get to do it! I guess it's best to take a tour but they're so expensive and the tour busses didn't look very clean! Just totally disappointed!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harleyoso

The smell of urine (not even faintly, but eye stunningly strong), lots of homeless people and shops selling drug paraphernalia?It's something you can say you've done, but it's certainly not a highlight -don't go out of your way to do it unless you enjoy the taste of disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O7739ARthomass

40,"Hectic, but enjoyable piece of history","After reading the reviews, I wasn't excited about our visit to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. But I knew that since it was my first visit to L.A. I had to see it. After all, it's pretty amazing to think that so many entertainers who I have enjoyed watching and listening to my entire life have walked the same path. We went about noon on a weekday. Even though it was hot (above normal temps during my visit last week) and crowded, it was worth the visit. One tip (really for any tourist stop in L.A.), don't take any CDs or merchandise folks are trying to hand you on the street. Once you've touched it, they'll expect a tip. I saw them make tons of money the three days I was in L.A. (Venice beach was particularly flooded with these offerings). Definitely wear your walking shoes and bring your camera. I was very surprised how long the walk of fame actually was!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gizmo1980

40,Fun... But,"It's fun to walk the Boulevard looking for the stars you know and love. However, it's busy, and perhaps not the best part of town. Every once in a while you get that feeling that you might want to keep an eye on your wallet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisitout
30,To be seen once,"Lower your expectations…It's just a black stone walk with names of Hollywood stars where each one honoured has a pink and gold plaque in the format of a star.It's in the Hollywood Boulevard, close to the Vine street. Close to the Chinese Theatre, which I consider more interesting with prints from stars. There are many tourists like you and me in the area, many locals dressed with costumes from different films trying to get some money to take a picture with tourists and, of course, none stars are around.But it's one of LA landmarks and, as such, it's an area to visit once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuPereira
20,Disappointing.,"Nothing really special to see, the only good area is near the TCL Chinese Theatre were more of the special stars are. The area is alot more cleaner than the rest of the street, which has quiet a lot of Hobos' begging and also people selling tours who are fairly pushy. Glad to say I have seen it but would not go back for more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Llanito71
30,"Don't go with high expectations, be open minded and you'll enjoy the experience","This boulevard looks nothing like it does in the movies. It's only great close to the Chinese Theater area, the only attractiveness of this boulevard are the celebrity stars located on the ground, and the beautiful architecture of some of its buildings and theaters. But sadly even when this is one of the most turistic areas of Los Angeles CA it is very outdated, filthy and full of very smelly beggars, and people disguised in characters that might try to push you in taking pictures with them for a tip amount chosen by them. IF you're a lady don't try to walk these streets after 10pm by yourself, specially on weekdays were the nightlife is almost dead. TIP: It is close to 2 main train stations: 1) Holllywood & Highland, and in case is closed (they close it sometimes for those red carpets events at the theater) you can get off half way of the boulevard at the 2) Hollywood & Vine train station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naomit454
30,Overrated,"The walk of fame is ok, that's it... like any other touristic place is crowded, everything is overpriced, and sometimes annoying. It can be a pain in the butt to walk there ..ironic, right? Make sure to bring enough water if you go during summer because it can take a while and the city can be really hot. Also remember to be a little bit polite and not block the whole sidewalk just for one pic...there are hundreds of people going there and also using the sidewalk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicolasRuiz
50,Walk of Fame is Fun Place,It's a great place to walk around and see all the stars from so many eras. Then looking at the hand and foot prints is also nice. There are so many stars and it covers a lot of streets so plan on an evening or afternoon to cover it all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coachajr
40,Love the stars,"This is a very nice walk. Its fun to walk around and find all your favorite actors. Its cool that they put on each star what category he was weather film star, singer,character, director etc. There were some that had quite a few. If you want to take the whole walk its a pretty long ways. all the way to the end of the strip on both sides and even sometimes a little up the side streets. Although keep in mind you are in Hollywood and can see alot of different things. Sort of like Vegas and in certain areas there are ""Adult shops"" so i don't think its best to walk the whole thing with small children. It should be at least checked out while your visiting the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bward27

Especially the old ones outside the theatre, although my boyfriend had fun comparing his hands and feet to Stallone and other modern acting legends.Next door there is a shopping centre with quite a fancy water feature inside, and a great view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/311florenceg

So, when I offered my two teenage girls a holiday to Los Angeles over a fancy birthday bash, they chose the former.We were lucky to find accommodation, walking distance to the Walk of Fame. We spent 5-days in LA, and loved the atmosphere of Hollywood Boulevard and the Walk of Fame. It is difficult to take pictures or selfies next to your favourite ""stars"", so I would strongly advise that you get an early start, preferably before 9:00 am, as you will have the pick of the litter.We were even fortunate enough to get photo's of our hands in the handprints of Michael Jackson and Daniel Radcliffe, for the teenage girls.An awesome experience. A must stop for all movie or hollywood buffs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ravesh
30,Bit of a let down,Drove into Hollywood and parked at the Hollywood and Highland Centre. This is central and you walk out onto the walk of fame. The pavements are packed with people selling tours or trying yo sell you something. You could be on any high street apart from the stars in the pavement. I thought the stars would be clean and shining but no..chewing gum stuck on some and they just looked tired and unkempt. There are many people taking pictures and I couldn't find anyone who actually knew where the walk of fame started! The people unfortunately were rude seeming that tourists were an inconvenience. I am glad I went but wouldn't return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jocQ5581AN
40,Research the stars before you go,"We researched the location of our favourite stars before we went. We were ken to locate Brian Cranston as mad breaking bad fans that we are.. We watched the you tube unveiling before we went and it made it more tangible. Also the tips that some stars had more than one star allocated. Plus the fact that there were 2different people named Michael Jackson's and robin Williams.. Pretty hard to miss the correct ones though as they were well blessed with flowers and candles. We found taking photos when we returned in the evening was better in that there was less shadowing on the stars from the sunshine. Glad we went, good fun spotting old names that brought back memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diswix
30,Worth the walk but bear in mind its a long way,"Put your sun cream on if you are there in summer, its worth the walk but its a long way. There are lots of tour guides along the way offering to do beverly hills tours etc (you're looking at about $20 to do that). Lots of people have two stars on the floor which we didn't think was that fair, but its definitely worth the trip. Look at the hand and foot prints outside the Chinese theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/664NatalieM

40,Film history,"We always stop here - and it was particularly poignant as James Garner passed away whilst we were in LA this time. The Rockford Files and the film My Fellow Americans (1996) my particular favourites of his. People were stopping to pass their respects, and photograph themselves next to various stars on the pavement. If you are in the area just take a walk here - it is part of film culture. It is an odd, quirky and somehow appropriate location to visit. Can get crowded, and if there is a film premiere being set up there are areas that are roped off. Guardians of the Galaxy was being premiered on the day we went - but that added to the atmosphere (and prompted a trip to the cinema to see it later on in our holiday. Entertaining.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TessW107
40,Brilliant! Yes really!,"Have been just reading some of the reviews of this street- what is the matter with everyone!? Of course it's tacky and busy and touristy!! Why did you go there? I was never scared and Im a 'senior' and female and small as they call us over there! All you do is ignore the ' characters', smile and say no thank you and walk by. It really is that easy. No one hassled us at all when we did that and we had a little girl with us. I don't understand why people are complaining about them. They make the street more Hollywoody. The stars are brilliant to spot, when my little grand daughter spotted Harry Potter stars her face was a picture. I think it's better that the stars are all mixed up, half the fun is looking out for the ones you would like to see. The only place that was really busy was outside The Chinese Theatre and there it wasn't uncomfortable and we visited lunch time on a hot August day. The shops are all tacky and over priced souvenirs of course SO don't buy anything or get a magnet. We took our time and spent about five hours around the street and having lunch inside the shopping mall ( Hollywood and Highland) in a small cafe.We did have a little trouble getting a taxi late afternoon because there was a premier for a film I personally had never heard of but clearly everybody else had! It started getting crowded but all I did was grab hold of my grand daughter's hand tightly, smiled and waved my hand in the air at the taxis. I managed to make eye contact with a driver and ran for it!! Fine!Go and enjoy the tackiness. It's Hollywood! I really enjoyed the whole experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suitcase0810
50,Great walk down memory lane,"You have always heard about the stars but seeing them in person was a special treat. The stars go for miles along Hollywood Blvd and include actors, comedians, producers, etc. . . . If you want to get a picture of the star without other people around I suggest you go early in the day as the longer you wait the more crowded it becomes. We happened to be there 16 hours prior to the death of Robin Williams. Within hours of his death the street was covered with flowers and candles in honor of his life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjwright

40,Cool,"It is cool to be there to know the place, take some pictures and see the hand and foot print, and see how Michael Jackson is popular. its something that you can do very fast and go right ahead to the groom or farmers market,but it is a chaotic place to walk around,take your photos and continue your journey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricardomikioy
30,Nothing to die for,"I went to the Hollywood Boulevard to go to the Jimmy Kimmel recording studio, which is right in front of the Dolby Theater and saw some of the stars. It was somewhat a good experience to see all the stars in the walk, but I think is nothing to die for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edgardoo363
30,Nothing special,"Busy with tourists, , fairly dirty, lots of souvenir shops that are overpriced. It was neat to go but I did not think it was anything special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tasteslikehappy
20,Underwhelming,"I suppose it is a good place to get photos, but a lot of the walk of fame is just along an ordinary street with nothing much else going for it apart from overpriced souvenir shops. I was hoping to get a feel for the showbiz nature of Hollywood, but just felt a bit underwhelmed! It was all quite one-dimensional. There was a farmer's market nearby the day we went though, which was excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahandCameron
30,Necesary visit,"This is one of those visits that must be visited because its a famous landmarkby, but honestly, I do not think it is worth spending more than a while walking through it.Its overrarted",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosPalacio70
40,A must see,"If you have never been to LA, then you have to go to Hollywood and walk the ""Walk of Fame"". It has a Times Square feeling with the crowds and is kind of dirty. It's one of those things that you do once and probably won't do again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waynes464
40,History of film is here,"Yes it is very touristy---but hey--you came here to see about Hollywood and the movies, so you must see this. Again, the older you are, the more you will recognize these stars. The history of the Oscars comes alive here. There are lots of things to take a picture of, just for fun. It is a good idea to have either a map or a tour guide to help you see where the most interesting spots are. If you are traveling with young children, they probably will not relate to this so much. Also be sure to check out the entrance to the theater where the Oscars are--that is also interesting if you are a movie fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PikesvilleTraveler
30,Kinda overrated...but historical none-the-less,"This place is definitely a must see, but you will also see the filth, and the panhandlers with it. It's a long walk, and unless you've become a fanatic of all genres of film, music, and television, you will not recognize a lot of the names you see. But when you do...be careful breaking out the camera or you will get run over by five others with the same goal!It's a long walk to see them all, and will take the whole afternoon. Don't forget to turn up Vine!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrpleasant
50,Unmissable!,"Great fun walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard looking at all the stars and the fun when you realise you know most of them! Even my teenage daughter recognised lots of the stars and had great fun photographing them! The area has a real showbiz feel, real Hollywood, with Pantages Theatre,Egyptian Theatre, Dolby Theatre - home of the Oscars,Chinese Theatre with handprints, Madame Tussauds where the stars come to life and real life look a likes you can give a dollar to for a photo with them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buckleyfamo
40,"Interesting, Fun Area","Not only is the Stars Walk of Fame here but a lovely plaza with the Chinese Theater and a great outdoor shopping center surrounding the plaza. Such a lovely place to sit and sip a latte. The ""stars"" embedded in the sidewalk are engrossing and everyone has their faces turned downward or having photos taken in front of a particular star. Robin Williams' memorial at his roped-off star with flowers and memorabilia was special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonikaDery
40,Walk along the stars,This area is much cleaner then 10 years ago. Walk up on one side and down the other to see the stars. There is a strong smell of urine as you move towards Vine street. At you are by the Chinese theater and mall area it is very crowded. Try to park off Hollywood blvd at a side street at a meter. You need about an hour if looking to get experience. If you are taking a tour or going into a museum then pay the $10 for a lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hcs922
30,Must see if in Hollywood!,"There are several blocks of Stars to walk around and look at. Suggest you pick up a map if you have special ""stars"" you want to find. We took pictures at several that the kids knew about. Otherwise it is a lot of walking and bumping into people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4StarDave
30,Hollywood Walk of Shame,"OK harsh title but all in all, this area is an overcrowded tourist trap. You go looking for the Hollywood sign which is so far away and hard to see, you need binoculars. A local security guy told us to stand on the bridge of a shopping mall right on the strip to see the sign. Ho hum. Glad we didn't have to pay for ""the view.""The stars on the sidewalk are fun and varied. Take your pick! Everything from singers to soloists to actors to the Muppets. You'll want to take lots of photos next to your favorites. However, in the midst of all of this, are tacky street ""actors"" and impersonators of Chewbacca and Michael Jackson and porn star looking blonde actresses who get ""tips"" for mostly men having their pictures taken with them. All of that detracts from the purity of the sidewalk stars and the cool TV studios that line the street. I wish I could have cleared the streets and had my own tour!I suggest that you give yourself an hour, look around, take it all in, take some photos and go somewhere else for your ""California"" experience. It's not the California you think it is!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happynowyoga
50,Stars Galore,"Well if you are looking for stars this is where to find them, the Hollywood walk of fame is a must the atmosphere is cool, walking along Hollywood Blvd is loads of fun take lots of photos you will see look a likes everywhere get you photo with Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, Hugh Jackman, Michael Jackson there are so any diferent look a likes popping up all the time and maybe even bump into a real star here. So much to see and do a bite to eat at Hooters is fun and a must place to visit is Mels Diner great fun to eat here, see a show at the El Capitan Theatre or Grauman's Chinese Theatre a very famous spot on this strip, loads of Hollywood stars have signed their names and left comments in the concrete some of them really wonderful to read. Stay nearby if you can for a few days just behind Graumans Theatre in a back street there are some great little hotels we stayed in one and had an awesome time in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/endlessumers
40,Worth the visit,Make sure you go early to avoid the mass of people. Worth a trip for movie buffs. A few of the older stars are a bit worn and cracked but definately worth a visit to this iconic landmark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiTraveller85
40,Fun walk,"The Walk of Fame was a few blocks on both sides of Hollywood Blvd. The stars are placed randomly, so it was fun walking along an taking notice of who's was where. Definitely a touristy thing to do in this area. Found out an interesting piece of info, during our walk, the ""stars"" can be purchased for about $32,000 by anyone (with the money). I thought there was a nomination process. It was still a fun thing to do when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roeym2014
30,Interesting for media fans,"My family visited Hollywood and one requisite was to check out the walk-of-fame. There's nothing too special about the stars themselves, but they are part of media history. I thought it was cool to see the star's for all my favorite actors along the walk. Of course, you have to dodge a few homeless people and vagrants but that's the big city for you. Not a big deal since there's a lot of other tourists walking about (just don't make eye contact and you'll be ok).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cohoman
30,Worth a see,"It was worth it to see the sights here but it's overwhelmingly crowded. Park at Hollywood Blvd and Highland Ave in the garage, it's only $10 for the day. Tons of people trying to hustle you but don't fall for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Owen_Ryan88
30,Be aware of spruikers and salesmen,"Want a photo op with a ""celeb""? Be prepared to pay them for that photo. Lots of people roaming around offering their cd demos for free but you will be expected to pay.Nice to walk along and take photos of the stars along the walk, but the novelty ends there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicab248
40,A Hollywood must see,"Though it is just famous people's names on the street, but it is a who's who of famous people. The area has lots of things to do in addition to add to just the stars. I found it fun to research people I had no clue whom they were. One of the LA must sees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshW937
30,Not what I had imagined,"The Walk of Fame goes on and on for a couple streets, so if you want to see the star of a specific artist you should try to look up the address first, instead of going hunting it. Well, the sidewalks are obviously dirty, so if you wanna touch the star or seat by the side of it, be sure to have some hand sanitizer with you for afterwards. Along the sidewalk there are people sitting, crouching, so watch your step.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnaWQ
30,All it's cracked up to be,"Okay, you've seen the celebs on TV getting their sparkling new Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and you think, I've got to see that. The reality? The Walk of Fame is interesting, up to a point. Most of the Walk is dirty and some of the Stars are cracked. Some of the celebs, you've never heard of, unless you've been around for a very long time. After a while, you can get bored, or frustrated by the sheer number of fellow tourists. Yes, if you're in LA, you will be tempted to have a look, but it sadly is what it is cracked up to be, often literally.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malcolmh826
20,Go when it's not busy,"I think we made the mistake of going during holiday week, and it was really busy. You couldn't even stop to look at any stars as you are being pushed my the crowd to walk down the street. There were also people dressed up in costumes everywhere and people trying to sell rap albums and cheap souvenirs. I was afraid to be pick-pocketed ant any time. We just decided to leave and go doing something else. Maybe the next time I am in LA I will stop by, because I was really looking forward to trying to find some of my favourite stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdub_lewis
20,Really? People's names in the sidewalk is interesting?,"This is one of those attractions I just don't get. Names in the sidewalk. That's it. Note: I'm not referring to the other things in the area, like the Chinese Theater, Dolby Theater, various tattoo parlors, ""intimate apparel"" shops, and all the meth-tweakers dressed up working on tips for their next fix. I'm only referring to the Walk of Fame itself. The stars in the sidewalk. I watched as my own friends got excited to see one. P.T. Barnum would be proud.You know, you could make one these in your own home. Pick your favorite stars. You could include famous authors, scientists, athletes or politicians. You could also include family members. It would be more interesting than this. Still... people love it. Lots of photos. Lots of people reading names, some asking ""who is Rudy Vallee?""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tennisbump
40,Hours of walking fun,"Because I was with a teenager, we had a great time walking all over and spotting the stars we knew. Lots of pictures and dreaming. We didn't have trouble with crowds either. Wish more of the stores were not so tourist oriented as each store along the way had the same items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leecabug
40,Surreal.,"The Hollywood walk of fame was one of the few tick lists we wanted to do whilst in LA.We went <10:00 and it was nice and quiet I.e. I managed to lie down on pavement next to my icon. (DO research prior if there is a particular heroes star you want to see as the walk of fame is very very long).Unfortunately there are lots of people waiting to take your money. Most seem to be dressed as Spiderman who seemed to have gourged out on burgers, or other characters who look nothing like who they're supposed to.Out of all the hundreds of stars, I remember spotting Robin Williams and smiling. It was a few hours later we heard the tragic news. RIP ♡",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crazysurfkid
40,Very good,You can find everything about sightseeing and tours there. The public parking are a little bit expensive near the Hollywood Boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuisGustavoW
40,Just go to say youve been there,"We walked one side of the road thinking that was all, but turns out it goes on and on if you cross the street. The Walk of Fame is huge!!! Very interesting to see who was and hasnt yet been honoured by a star. The walk of fame isnt as grandly decorated as we had imagined, just a long strip of sidewalk with named stars, and the crowds were massive, but its just one of those places you gotta visit just to say youve been there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R_26C
40,Not what we expected,"Not sure what we were expecting but it was very busy & crowded. People in costume trying to have photos with you so you pay them $$$ and I was abused by one when I said NO! Look, it was great to see the Chinese Theatre, Madame Taussads & Dolby Theatre but it felt very dirty there. Lots of beggers wanting money & people pushing items into your hands to buy. DONT take them!! There were so many stars and we tracked down a few but soon you are over it. The Hollywood Museum & Ripleys Believe It or Not are worth a look if you have kids. The is also the Disney Soda Fountain- a great place to stop off for a shake or a sundae. Kids will love that. The Hollywood & Highland is a great shopping complex there with all the names you would expect. You can also go up a few levels and see good views of the Hollywood sign. Buy all your Hollywood souvenirs here as you wont find any elsewhere. Here they are cheap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JazzaT
40,walk of fame,Nice to walk around to see all the celebrities rrepresented. Lots of other attractions along the way. Good spot for p7cture taking too. See a movie at Grammans while there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/363debrab
30,"It's worth your morning, not a day.","The walk is worth doing, plenty of beggars and pipe shops with a few clothing shops in between, nothing of interest mostly just touristy nick nacks, as I said go out in the morning, it's easier to get around and you'll be done by lunch to go see what else Hollywood has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CameronTravels
30,If you love pandhandlers...,"This is the place to be! There were homeless and panhandlers everywhere. Someone was either trying to sell me their CD, asking for money, or I was looking at filth and trash on the ground. Eating at someplace like McDonalds made me feel sick. I love looking at the stars, but unfortunately, you can't do it without being approached. How sad something that could be such a lovely, iconic place is being ruined like this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wildwestbunch
40,Excellent,"Worth doing taking the walk and seeing all the stars frames on the ground , good for the children to find them , you can get a map from the shop and they will tell you where all the stars are, worth doing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/187sharon
30,At least you've been there.,The place was packed and so you couldn't really see the stars' names. I think that One trip is enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyae2014
40,A must do while in LA,"An absolute must while you are in LA. Nothing extra, but makes you feel like you really are in Hollywood. Look for your favorite stars, take pictures with doublers, buy some souvenir..but be prepared it s quite a walk..1 or 1,5 h for this attraction should be more than enough.. ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mishii_mis
20,Go to say you've been but not as we expected,"We visited here in July on a hot day and it became more chaotic the closer we got to the Chinese Theatre area. Lots of characters on the street to have your photograph taken with you but they do expect a tip for doing so. There are also lots of people trying to sell a trip around Hollywood, as well as many panhandlers. Usually a polite refusal is enough but did see one person being pursued down the street by one selling a trip. Not as we expected at all but we ticked the box.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jars64
40,Good to see!,"You could spend hours looking at this and do lots of walking up and down,it seems to go on for miles. Some of it is very hard to see as it's very busy and difficult to take photographs in the busier parts. They are all mixed up in different places so if you want to see some in particular it might be worth checking out a list first. It's not as glamorous as you'd expect but worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debs21
40,A must,We went on a Sunday morning around 11am and it was BUSY!!! Way too many people to really enjoy it and not a place to take little kids (toddlers). Hard to maneuver stroller in the crowd and time to get on metro rail hardly allow for stroller to get in/out. It was great seeing the stars on pavement first hand and the hand- and footprints. Dressed-up characters are fun to watch. Only went into one store: Boulevard Boutiques and prices was not too bad. Would do it again but without kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SpokieTexas
30,It's ok!,"If you're in Los Angeles then you really have to visit here! But it's not somewhere you will want to spend more than an hour.It's good to walk down the 2 sides of the pavement to spot your favourite stars and get a photo with them. But the area itself is nothing special, with nothing else worth seeing!Although we actually got a good deal from one the street vendors for an open top tour around the celebrity houses!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/43NickS
40,much fun - very entertaining,"if you're into ""seeing the sights"" and into people watching - there's roughly 100,000 people right here for you to see. we parked near Chinese Theater which puts right smack dab where all the type was. wax museum, shops, restaurants, endless gift shops to bring stuff back. we totally enjoyed our time there. we found many of our favorite stars on the sidewalks which made for some great picture taking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/digdeep0169
40,Interesting,"Parked at Loews Hollywood Hotel which has a daily parking rate. You can spend the rest of the day walking along the Walk Of Fame, looking for your favourite celebrity. Nice photo opportunity to take a photo with your ""star"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EF71R
20,Walk of shame,"It's nothing like you would expect especially when you've only seen it on tv. The street was dirty and there were a lot of 'seedy' people loitering around which made us feel very intimidated. There are so many stars of people you would never have heard of which made finding and good ones difficult, you should find a map of the stars which will show you where to go so you can get in and out quickly",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelanieYB
30,Nothing too special...nice shopping area,It was ok. Compared to all of LA there's a lot of hustle and bustle there but it's just stars on the ground...reminiscent of a Times Square vibe. But you almost have to go to say you've been there. Mixed variety of people there. The shopping mall there is nice! We ate at the sushi place which was good. Lucky strike was fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luv2Travelw2boys
40,If in L A you can't really not go!,We had a 12 night stay in Santa Monica so had to do the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was easy to park the car in the multi-storey. I found it fascinating to see the stars with all the famous names on them. It is somewhere I have always wanted to go. There are plenty of places to eat and drink and they are reasonably priced. I am glad I made the effort to go. It was such a hot day and for relief from the heat we went on a tour of the Chinese theatre. Really enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/501hazelk
30,It is ok,"It is ok to visit if you are really a fan of taking a picture with the stars on the floor or a curious to see the place which you see on TV. However, in reality their is nothing special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/osamayoussef
50,funny place to see !!!,Very nice area !!! A lots of people walking around and taking pictures... nice shops and cafes.Nice Shopping Mall and nice hotels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roos_Castilho
40,One of Hollywood's Iconic Tourist Attractions,"When one thinks of Hollywood, most likely the Hollywood Sign and the sidewalk stars on Hollywood's Walk of Fame come to mind first. I knew that going to Hollywood had to include walking Hollywood Blvd and looking at the stars. Running for over a mile on each side of Hollywood Blvd, the sidewalks are dotted with star after star from days long ago to to Bugs Bunny forming a lasting tribute to over 2000 artists who have made significant contributions to film, radio, television, theatre, and the recording industries. It's a must at least once in your life; however, after a few hundred, it begins to lessen the excitement. The only negatives that diminish the perceived glitz of the sidewalk monument are the extreme crowds of people and especially the homeless, beggars, and street performers who detract from one's excitement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/117carla
10,"Dirty, seedy, nasty","Out of many many reviews I've written, this is my 1st negative.Personally we were very disappointed with Hollywood Bvld.I'm not saying... don't go there, because everyone should experience it once.However given all the hype of ""Hollywood"" with talk of glitz & glamour, it looked like a ghetto!Its hard to imagine this is where they hold major global events like the Academy awards.The streets were very dirty, dozens of people try to hustle you to buy CD's, I've been harassed for loose change less in third world countries & the main McDonalds in the ""tourist district"" of LA has an ARMED security guard on site 24hrs a day.We toured all over America from San Francisco, New York, Orlando, Miami, Vegas and never once did we feel unsafe.LA is a place you always need to watch your back & your wallet, so you can never relax and enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheDanDan79
50,Start early,"If you want to spend some time here you can spend almost an entire day just reading all the stars. It is approximately 3 to 4 miles long round trip, so start early beat the sun and crowds.Once you see the stars that u like always take a picture with them, you can kneel next to it or if u feel brave enough u can lay next to them or u can always do the famous selfies with them hahahahahaha.The mos popular once are going to be in prim real state area (front of the Dolby theater).Go with friends it is always more fun to do this with friends.Also while doing this there are tons of stores where you can buy all sorts of souvenirs.You can park next to the Lowes hotel under parking structure. Do not feel obligated to take a picture with the street performers. Once you pose with them they will expect a tip from you.Have FUN!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrminky
40,Hmmm,"Much more spread out and very busy then I expected. i also watched a homeless guy pull a yogurt out of the garbage and eat it. The stars are all over, so you either need to wander around the area or know who you want to find. We drove the area, it was kind of gritty. Have a buddy that lives overlooking the hills so the visit was fun, just was not going to walk all over looking for stars...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenebean2014
40,It's home!!,It's a must at least once in your life. For me it's like once a week. It's free and lots of people watching. Best place to park Hollywood & Highland!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizDelSol
30,A quick review,"Hollywood walk of fame are well known tourist side in this entire world. These day peoples lives with the entertainment in their life.This walk of fame is a non profit tourist attraction since that you dont have to pay to enjoy this site.One thing that makes me so uncomfortable is the scam there. To be honest we all know when there's so many tourist, there will be the scammers too.This are a few scam i got in hollywood walk of fame :An indie artist makes an album and gave us for free then ask a money for donation.The spiderman that forced us for tips for the unwanted photos with them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garrykur
20,Not what I was hoping for,So many people hard to take time and look. Lots of homeless people and street performers pushing you for tips. Would have been neat to see the history but too many people to be comfortable around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noshoesnoshirt
50,I want thi for lunch today and everyday,"I think this is the best ever hamburger put on the face of the earth. Everyone else must think the same too,, because sometimes if we use our car, we wait up to 30 minutes in line to get our fresh made burgers and just cut potato French Fries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xxtrasafe
30,A long crowded walk - stick to main section,"It is something to do if in Hollywood. It is very crowded especially at night and the area is dodgy around the bottom end - I suggest sticking to the ""main"" part. It is fun to see some famous names but didn't recognise most stars. Not sure if there is a map or app that can show you where particular stars are? Photos of Hollywood Boulevard are nice with all the lights on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandacO2999SE
40,Fun trip through Hollywood history,This was a fun place to stroll through and look at all of the stars. Not very crowded on the day we went. Everyone had fun finding their favorite actors and actresses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuperTxMom
30,Glad I saw it,"One of those things you feel you have to see in LA, and is fun picking out names etc but it is incredibly busy, and it also attracts a large amount of street performers, street sellers, and beggars, which means you can feel quite uncomfortable at times. I am glad I ticked it off, but wouldn't return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bicycleglasses
30,"Must-do b/c you're in Hollywood, but nothing special","If you're in Hollywood, you can't go home and say you didn't visit the Walk of Fame and thus, it's a must-see. But this is such a crowded and dirty stretch of road that without the fame would just be a forsaken street. Visit and look at the stars to say you did, but don't bother spending much time here b/c there isn't anything to see or do. Spend an hour and be happy you're done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phuc2014
40,A must see - prepare for a long walk,"This is a ""must see"" in LA. Many miles of ""famous"" people - famous in """" as 70% of them are unknown to people outside of US. It is a long walk from the beginning to end and back :-), but lot´s of things to see and shops to visit on your way. Do not expect to find great places to eat..... Use one of the public parkings spots on the side roads to ""Hollywood Boulevard"", if you go by car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinl570
40,Would be brilliant without people!,"We walked up and down here by night, and again by day. It's one of those things you have to see and look for your favourites. Stars prompted lots of happy memories for me and I was happy to see some of the old heroes of yesteryear - Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark,However, it's like looking at something where curtains are constantly opened and closed in front of you, as all the tourists pass by over the stars you want to look at. Trying to take a photo is nigh on impossible. Street entertainers also seem to take up a few stars in their quest to earn a few bucks from the tourists. Some of them are good, but most I could do without.The walk is clean and appears well maintained, and is another bucket list item ticked off. On the whole, an interesting couple of hours in this area, but a lot of frustration as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAB_Royton
50,A must,This is a great place to visit you will see all the famous stars names here may take a while to find your favourite,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nittnutt

40,Something You've Got To Do,"You can spend a day wandering up and down the stars, but I'd suggest you just get off at Hollywood / Highland Red Line Station and see the Chinese Theatre, the Hollywood sign, and the fabulous shopping. There is a number of stars around there so go and see those ones.Heads up, there will be homeless people! No matter where you go in LA there are homeless people everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keeganthomson93

20,Grimy and gross,"Hollywood Blvd. continues its descent into gross and grimy. We accidentally stumbled into an S&M shop with our 13 year old and the 5 year old. The street peddlers and homeless people begging for money along with the flood of foreign tourists make the sidewalks unpassable, especially near the Stars for Michael Jackson and other popular stars. Left feeling yucky -- probably not going back for a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesJOceanside_CA
40,Hooray for Hollywood.,"I really enjoyed seeing all of the foot and hand prints of famous stars from the old days! A trip down memory lane. The sidewalk is full of people dressed up like charactersf rom Star Wars, Superman, Spiderman, Elvis, Prince and Michael Jackson. Rather crowded but it was fun for me to see all of the people enjoying themselves. I would like to have gone into the Chinese theater for the tour or a movie but didn't have time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gobluestl
40,The Stars,"I love walking down Hollywood Blvd, there are visitors from all walks of life. I like listening to the stories of the street preformers.Looking for the stars on the sidewalks and remembering the shows they were in. It brought back alot of memories.It can get very crowded on the weekends",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CChristie966
40,Free Entertainment,"I've always enjoyed people watching. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is free and fun to do. It's just exciting to see memorabilia of some of your favorite actors, singers, entertainers, host, characters, directors, and movie stars. Besides looking at the stars beware of the real charters walking around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WGwiz
30,Snake man on walk of fame.,"We were there on a Wednesday afternoon at 2pm. It was very crowded, but I expected that. However, there was a man walking around with two snakes and putting them on people. I am petrified of reptiles, did not see him walk up behind me and put one of his snakes on me. I screamed and the afternoon was pretty much ruined for me. He was walking up and down the street for 3 hours at least. Only way to get away from him was to go into one of the stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/376annieg
30,Tick it off your list.,Tick it off your places to visit in LA but don't waste to much time there. Yes it's free but after having your picture taken with a few stars or outside The Chinese theatre nothing really worth hanging about for. It's crowded and dirty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/457garys

40,Look up location of favorite actors star before you go!,We had a blast finding our favorite actors stars while reminiscing on all other tv shows and movies from the surrounding stars! If there is an actors star you definitely want to see I recommend looking up exactly where it is and starting at that location or you may never find it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittanyi2014
30,A Must Do Thing,"I was with friends in LA for less than 24 hours and our hotel was extremely close to the Walk of Fame. So, of course, we had to do it. Needless to say, we didn't have a lot of time and so only walked a short stretch of it. As others have said, go in the morning when there's fewer people around. We went in the evening and, of course, it was extremely busy (We were also next to the TCL theatre which no doubt added to the busyness of it all). During busy periods you will get jostled around and you will have difficulty getting a really close look at any of the stars.Saying that, they do appear to be cleaned down daily and, after years of only seeing them in pictures, it is incredible to see them in real life. Even if you only go for a few moments, do it, just for the history surrounding it all and the ""I did this"" value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347rachg
30,"It's something you do that doesn't cost anything, but area pretty gross.","I was pretty excited to come back here (had visited when I was 15) and I honestly don't remember the area being this run-down. There's nothing glamorous about it. I was happy to see the hand and footprints at Graumann's Chinese Theatre and go looking for some of my favourite celebrity stars, but after that's all done and you have some photos, then meh. Too many creepy, weird people walking around trying to shove their CDs into your hand, telling you how they're trying to 'make' it in music. Do not, under any circumstances, get sucked in by all the people in costumes who try and get you to have a photo with them, they expect huge tips I hear! We walked a huge length of Hollywood Blvd and were surprised with how dirty it was. Even a lot of the stars are filthy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KelsterSA
30,Hollyweird,"As the locals say...""welcome to hollyweird"" where you can experience and see all types of unique characters, tours, museums, and of course the stars. ..Park in public parking and walk your way through history. ..take a tour in one of the tour vans, you'll get more than you pay for. Visit one of the wax museums and size up to the actors/actresses. ..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dabigattao
50,very cool,It was just great to walk down and read all of the celebrities with their names printed on the asphalt sidewalk. Very cool indeed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadro2010
50,A Great Sense of Achievement,"I enjoy walking down Hollywood Blvd. Looking at all the famous names in stars, tourist everywhere, street food, bucket drummers, seeing celebrities and posing for a picture with the Transformers, was ala in all a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SAV638
30,Lots of memories here!,"I flew into LAX late at night on a Thursday and grabbed a hotel room at the Crowne Plaza. My wife and daughter joined me the next morning and we decided to play for the day, so we set out to see some close attractions and have lunch.I've driven by the Hollywood Walk of Fame but never strolled the sidewalk to see what it consisted of. I found the stars had an icon that designate whether the person was a singer, TV actor or movie actor. Some had more than one star as they were famous in more than one medium,Now that I've seen it though, there's not a lot to talk about. There are a lot of hucksters looking for photo opps and selling Hollywood tours or free tickets to a Bill Maher show. That's probably about what that show is worth..........",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D0uglasA
30,Cool but depends on time of year/events,"In November of 2006, I visited Hollywood Blvd, the Walk of Fame, etc and loved it. I couldn't figure out why anyone would think it was sketchy. This time - it was crowded, hot and full of people dressed as various movie characters including Superman, who looked like Christopher Reeves but for the greasy hair and filthy red cape. My 16 year old adventurous son and I did not feel safe or comfortable.I then realized that the last time I visited, the Kodak theater was prepped for a premier, and there were fewer tourists. Apparently security and police clear out the ""buskers"" and homeless people before a premier - I have mixed feelings about that because more permanent solutions make better sense and are more compassionate. That said, if you don't want to maneuver through hordes of tourists unaccustomed to crowds and scam artists and homeless people of all ages, schedule your visit for a time near a premier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aerogirl59
40,Busy as hell,You got to walk the strip just to see the stars and read the names. You'll be surprised how much of your life you will remember saying those names.You will not be alone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelOnceMonthly
40,"Busy and cliche, but you have to do it, especially china theater","One if those must dos, go in the morning to avoid too many dodgy homeless people, loved the actual hand prints like Shirley temple from the 30s my 5 year olds hand fitted straight into, was special and I put my hand prints into jimmy Stewarts - WOW !!! It actually was a buzz for a movie nut like me and we had only 45 minutes on a tour and was not neat enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timhartland
40,Just what you think it is,Its iconic and a must do when on vacation in LA. I took my kids here and they had a blast finding stars of their favorite stars. The area is littered with colorful people in all sorts of crazy outfits and costumes. There is a lot to see and do here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wyomingdan
30,Exceptionally crowded!!,"Not a place for children! Skip this one if you are on a family vacation. There are far to many people to try to take photos of stars you may want to see and you won't be able to read many of the names. You are literally shoulder to shoulder with the million or so others who are there. Some people try to take photos but they have a group of people yelling in every direction trying to hold back the crowd long enough to get a shot. The view of the Hollywood sign from the mall just above the Dolby is not great either. The area feels like it is ripe for pickpockets so beware. Gentlemen put you wallets in your front pocket, ladies leave the purse at the hotel and just put one card plus ID in your pocket. Don't carry cash! Be smart!! Watch out for bums and solicitors EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/356shannenm
40,"Look for your favorites, but you may see them twice","I spent a week in Hollywood this month, so I had the chance to do the Walk of Fame several times. You can't miss it because it stretches several blocks in all directions from west of Madame Tussaud's to Vine Street and north and south. It was cool to see the names I recognize, but I was surprised to see so many that I didn't. I also was surprised to see the sane name in two different locations for several people, which made me think that whoever runs this thing is not keeping good records. What's great is that the sidewalks are washed down regularly, so if a star gets dirty you can go back the next day or so and see the name clean. Fun place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freed0mt0travel
20,Not worth it,I was shocked ! I expected a glamourous walk in excellent condition but it's more like a shabby sidewalk! Many stars are broken and there are a lot of crazy people in costumes trying get a photo with you and asking for money ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spaddel27
40,Fantastic!,We went to Hollywood Walk of Fame on our second day of the holiday. Highly recommended to take a tour on walk of fame while you are around the area. Lots of places to visit around the area as well. Need to spend at least half of the day too see whats out there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raifusal
40,Fun times,"I'm from the east coast, so this area felt just like being in Times Square. I loved the energy of the people though and looking at the stars. A lot of movie premieres happen at the theaters there too which is cool. We got to watch the red carpet for the Planes release.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanineE7
40,Definitely see but keep it brief.,"We saw the stars on the walk of fame at night. There was a fun atmosphere with crazy acts for the kids to watch, musicians, snakes etc. If you come to LA you have to come to this iconic street especially if you are with teenagers who like movies. However, we parked right next to the walk of fame ($20 rip off) and then walked down it. It was absolutely packed so we didn't stay for more than an hour and were pleased to get back in the car. A must to see but as I said in the title, keep it brief!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/696danip
30,Times Square without the lights.,"I'm from New York and the Hollywood walk of fame area is just like Times Square but without the lights and with less things to do (especially for kids). Same crowds, same dress-up characters hounding kids and demanding pay for photos from their parents, same chain restaurants/shops. The stars on the ground are unique and you can find your favorites. Grauman's Chinese theater is also interesting, but so crowded that it is difficult to take a photo of the cement slab of your choice before someone is walking over it. View of Hollywood sign from the central mall is also cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnceBittenNYC
50,HolllyWood Stars.....In Stars....!!,"My Fist time, i liked the it, crowded, nice restaurants, shopping hubs, Wax museum, lot of things to see around @ one place. fultoo time pass.What i didn't like is lot of tour people keep asking you for Hollywood tour while you walking on the hall of fame, however at all i enjoyed being there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neeravs2014
50,The Walk Of Fame Will Amaze You,"Take your time to visit the walk of fame... you will be reminded of stars, musicians and radio announcers you have forgotten.Be careful with people trying to sell you tours.. Get a reputable tour guide to show you what you are interested in touringTake about 3 hours of your day and you will be satisfied and happy you walk down the Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mhbh
30,Hollywood Walk of Lots of Tourists & Street Solicitors,"So you are in Hollywood, and everyone who knows you are in the LA area expects you to visit the very famous Hollywood Walk of Fame and TCL Chinese Theatre (formerly Mann's Chinese and Grauman's Chinese) on Hollywood Boulevard. Here is the bottom line: Visit it because it's famous and so you can tell people you've been there. But keep the expectations of the Hollywood glitz and glamour very low. Yes, it is neat to see all the various star names on the sidewalk, but don't linger too long or you'll have unsavory street solicitors and movie ""character"" actors in your face wanting you to buy their latest CD, subscribe to their religious beliefs, take a tour or have you take a picture with them for $$. I didn't feel overly safe in this area, and felt like I had to hold onto my purse a bit tighter than usual. My teenage sons weren't overly impressed either - they commented that they thought Hollywood would be a lot nicer than what they saw. As we were leaving, there was a guy holding up a sign that said ""Hail Satan"" - welcome to Hollywood.TIPS: If you are planning to go, try to find parking on the streets a few block away. You can park close to Hollywood Boulevard, but it's going to cost you $10+ for less than an hour visit. We found parking for free on a street just south of Sunset/east of Highland (near the Chick-fil-a).Hold on tightly to that purse or wallet Be prepared to be approached by solicitors. It's similar to Las Vegas Boulevard or Times Square, if you've been to those locations, but in a more concentrated area - particularly when you get close to TCL Chinese Theatre.Be aware that if you decide to get down on the ground and have your picture taken with a particular ""star"", you may want to re-think that idea as I've seen what those stars go through on a regular basis (I used to live in LA many years ago), and it isn't very sanitary, to say the least. Photoshop would be a better idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MXB
30,Not what I expected,"The area itself is very sketchy and totally not what I was expecting...There was one or two blocks that I really enjoyed but other than that it was a ""not see"" for a los angeles tourist dream. I can't imagine why stars would even care about getting their name put on it. Their homeless population is huge over there which was shocking and unexpected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niakimble74
50,Loved it!!,"Okay, so it's a place for tourists, you will still enjoy seeing the stars in the sidewalk with all your favorites engraved in them. If you have only seen this famous sidewalk on TV, then you must see it in person. Not only are the stars cool to see, but you will find some of the famous right there on the sidewalk walking around!! Okay, they are people dressed up to look like your favorite actor, but it is still cool to see them. You can have your picture taken with them, just be sure to tip them for their time. You will have fun reading-while-walking on this Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DesertDuo208
30,I Saw A Sidewalk,"Meh... If you read People magazine or watch Entertainment Tonight religiously, this place is for you.This of the second time I've been here in two years and the whole area experience remains unmemorable. Five square blocks of nothing that I can check off a list I didn't need to keep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/l0rrink
30,Exactly what you'd expect,"Very touristy, filled with shops and interesting costumes. It's neat to see all the names on the street and you might get to see the red carpet rolled out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/898marcelr
20,Dirty sidewalk with Stars,"I took my wife here while in California and was very disappointed. This place has gone down hill over the years. Maybe it's cool for first timers but she was less than impressed for her first time my second. There are tour bus groups trying to sell tours, characters dressed up wanting money for photos and stars on the sidewalk all over the city in a 4 block square area. There is no really impressive star and they are just that. Stars with names in the pavement. Good luck finding the one you want without walking a ton or paying a fortune for parking. It's crowed and dirty. There is really nothing else to do here as well but see the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmonstrola
30,Busy Street,"Hopped off one of the tour buses to see the walk of fame. Stars on the pavements one after the other, gets busier as you approach the Chinese theatre. A few street performers around and a few in costumes doing their best to part you with your cash. Seen it, done it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dyavid
50,Make this a must see!!!,"If you love all things Hollywood and especially a fan of old movies and actors make this a must see in your upcoming trip to Hollywood! It's like getting to meet them (the old stars) - seeing their handprints, their footprints and how they sign their names! It was just such a trip to see everything!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1472BOlisag
30,Crowded and dirty,I was not at all impressed with the Walk of Fame. We visited on a Saturday and it was extremely crowded and dirty. I envisioned this to be a little more glamorous and valued but it's downtrodden and unmaintained. There were many street performers and individuals dressed up in costumes that would gladly take a photo with you for a price. It was a depressing and over rated place to visit but at least I can say that I have been there. The placard under the statue at the beginning of the Walk explains how it all started and who the original members were. That was neat to see. The best part was the viewing of the HOLLYWOOD sign from the 3rd floor of the Shopping Mall located next to the Walk of Fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrspinney
40,Stars on the sidewalk,Another iconic site but Hollywood is still seedy and dirty. Lot's of cheap souvenirs which is probably the best reason to go there. Unless of course you get a thrill from seeing an imbedded star in the concrete.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itraveltheworld2013
30,What a shame..,"What a shame of street lacking of glamour and luxury.Funny tho to see some of your fav actors on a star, but those away from the theater are like forgotten and not taken care of",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LetitflyGX
30,Just Because We Mush,"Unimpressive street lined with stars names that repeat over again is nothing special. We were bombarded with people selling bus tours constantly which was really annoying. But, in Hollywood you must walk the street to say you did. We ended at Mosaic church, a friendly place. Parking can be pricey; we found a garage offering $12 all day valet parking, pretty good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamFromNY
40,All your favourite stars at your feet,"So there's nothing to do there really other than walk around trying to see how many times you find Harrison Ford's star (it's there more than once) but it's still quite enjoyable and at least I can now say I've had Helen Mirren underneath me :-).While you're walking though there is some street entertainment in the form of celebrity impersonators, the ones that sort of look like their character can be quite amusing but the ones that look nothing like their celebrity are quite hilarious.The only downer on the experience are the number of people trying to 'give out' their CD for a small 'donation'. If it were one or two I could out up with that but there must have been at least 50-60 within three blocks. It got quite annoying in the end,Overall through it's a must see attraction and it's free! Not many things are these days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmAitchKay
40,Nostalgic,Stars names brought back memories of talented individuals. Area was very crowded and not conduciveto relaxing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Staffer5
40,I walked on the Stars,"I had the opportunity of walking on the stars of many celebrities including Steve Harvey, Lucille Ball, Perry Como, and many others. It was refreshing to be reminded of the stars who were just childhood memories. The shops, museums and other attractions like Wrigley's Believe it or not, to pose for pictures with the statue of the world's tallest man, to see Elvis Presley's look alike and to have the opportunity of taking pictures with other look-alike celebrities was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandrina55
50,Everything we expected,"Why do you suddenly join in the mad impulse to run around looking for the stars names? Then photographing them? I don't know but you do and it's fun! The handprints outside the Chinese theatre and the stars on the sidewalks and the atmosphere and the crowds and the people dressed as batman, transformers, etc etc. it's trite, it's touristy and it's fun, bog enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pickyperson910
40,Interesting to see the history,"When in LA, you have to see all the kitschy touristy things. The Walk of Fame is just exactly what you expect from LA. Worth a trip and a stroll, just don't be taken in by the hucksters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ilaeria
40,Tourists Galore,Of course you need to come and visit the walk of fame if you are in L.A. There are stars on both sides of the street so you need to keep your eyes open if you are looking for someone special. Understand that this area is not so clean and very crowded. Go early to avoid some of the crowds and the heat. You can find parking on the street if you are not going to be more than 2 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dschlott
30,Felt Bad,"Call me an emotional fool, but I am not a fan of walking all over the stars that shined in the entertainment industry. How can stepping on them be a fitting memorial to them?

It was a bit busy even though it was a Sunday so need to keep your wits about you and be street smart.All in all an okay experience. Nice to see the Hollywood sign from the shopping complex next door and good parking as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FemiL
50,You'll be there anyway...,"Of course this is worth the walk! It's going to be where you're touring anyway, Hollywood and fine and all around Hollywood sidewalks. Google your favorite celebrity and go take a look at their star if it's in your area. Otherwise you can imagine it just being a star with the person's name and the main reason that they are a celebrity (music, tv, movies)...So many names you may not recognize while walking because the Hollywood walk of fame has been around for quite a long time. It's really fun to look down and see the stars at your feet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler4k
30,Disappointing,"When visiting LA, I guess one has to go see this landmark, but I thought it was a somewhat of a let-down. It's full of cheap souvenir shops and packed with people.

30,A must see but not the grandest thing in the world,"It was very neat to see how many different stars you knew and find your favorites but contrasted next to the pitiful conditions of Hollywood Blvd brings the rating down.

40,Walkin' with the stars... Or on them!,"Obviously you go to Hollywood to see the stars. A must see! But don't think you're in for the glitz and glamour of the academy awards. Be aware of people trying to get money from you. We were handed a CD and then told that he usually gets $10 for it.You definitely get a real image of poverty in California even in a place that is so known for the luxury lifestyle.But definitely a must see, you will regret if you don't and there is lots of fun attractions along the way like the highland centre and Madame Tussaud's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robert0809R

20,Not at all what I expected at all,"Far from being a glamorous Hollywood setting, this area is very run down, dirty and sketchy. Adjacent to the Chinese Theater, the Walk of Fame is a star studded sidewalk that stretches a couple blocks. The area is super crowded with both tourists and those hoping to make money off the tourists...so crowded that it is difficult to read the inscriptions, much less capture them with a photo. The street vendors and hawkers are so tenacious that I didn't feel safe in this area...one costumed street performer who wanted me to pose for a picture with him grabbed me when I refused. Between the shysters trying to get money and the crowds pushing & shoving, a quick ten minute stay is all that you need here....just long enough to say you've been there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/899donnas

30,"Notorious so must visit, but nothing to write home about","Did all of one block of it, got our token picture, had lunch overseeing George Takei’s star and left. It’s unfortunate that the shops along this strip are not either of better quality or in line with the entertainment industry (just kitchy china-made products, really). But really, you can’t say you visited LA and not seen the walk of fame. So go, make your pit stop and get your token picture but don’t plan to spend too much time there. There are far better spots in this great city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wasfou
30,Worth Seeing Just to Say You've Seen It,"I've been there twice now - the first time it was pretty cool - you always hear about it, see it on TV. I think it's worth the trip just to say you've seen it. There's a lot of pricey stores in the area (Fossil, Lucky Brand Jeans) and a lot of kiosks selling souvenirs. There is an underground lot to park in that isn't too expensive, but I recommend going early to get a spot. I guess I was fortunate both times as I never ran into a pick pocket or any problems, but I usually just ignore the characters wanting to take a photo with you for money or people trying to get you to go on tours regardless. Definitely walk through the Roosevelt Hotel that's across the street - it's supposedly haunted. It's dark and eerie, but can't say I ever came across a ghost either. Overall, I think it's worth the stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R0se_S121
20,California Road Trip,"Don't waste your time going to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. If you have been to Times Square in NYC you will find that the atmosphere is the same. Parking was a nightmare and people trying to push the tours via a tour bus were everywhere. We could not walk five feet without someone asking us about wanting to do a tour via their bus. There were so many people we were not able to see all the stars that we hoped to see. Overall, the experience was horrible. Don't waste your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindyt27
20,Just a street.,"Sorry, but all negative reviews are true. Nothing special. We have been there in the morning - almost nobody there but a lot of rude seller. You can park somewhere nearby - parking meter charge is $1/hour. You can pay also with the credit card.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbQ5308QB
30,OK - Careful Situational Awareness,"Just be aware of the areas you look. if you look like a tourist they will try to sell you a car trip or take your photo. be careful while being focused on our photo op, and being distracted as a target, and also sidewalk events for pick pockets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephStx
20,Disappointed,The hype did not live up to the experience. Full of people trying to sell music to you and not at all what I had expected.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/817rhysm

30,Dont...look...down,"Its great to see these stars names lining the walkways of Hollywood,some really great names past and present. However, Hollywood offers some very unsavoury areas, so take the time to look up occasionally and not where you are and who's about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MP889
30,Something u gotta do once i guess,One of those things you need to see when your in LA because of how famous it is not because it's really interesting. I only spent an short time there so i guess it was an ok part of a larger day spent seeing thr hollywood sights. Dont regret going this one time but wouldnt go back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elchay
50,Family enjoyed the experience,"Started at the Chinese Theater and walked a few blocks. Lots of famous celebrities' stars to take photos of, not to mention, the street was very lively with performers. Had a chance to see a reality star heading to a birthday function for Kevin Hart. Would have like to have seen more information about where celebrities' stars were located.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Family671
40,"Nice, but crowded & hyped-up","Hollywood walk of fame is very hyped-up. I had a high expectation and it did not live up to it. When I went it was at night and it was very crowed to spot the names on the stars. When I thought of Hollywood, I had a high class environment in mind and probably that's why I think it is hyped up. It is interesting to walk down and spot your favorite stars' name. People and the media hype up Hollywood too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherryS78
30,Nice enough but nothing special,"It's literally just a pavement littered with 2500 stars... if you are visiting Madame Taussaud's, the Chinese Theatre or the Dolby Theatre anyway then you might as well take a pic while you are there but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way just to see the Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ANH779

10,Hollywood Walk of Fame,"Hollywood itself is a big let down to all visitors. It is a small run down area, fully of beggars and people dressed in dirty fancydress suits wanting tips for photos. Paths and roads are in a poor state of repair. Nothing really opens until around 10:30am, so a little difficult to get breakfast if you do not simply want a burger from one of the big chains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clive_Sally_H
50,The Boulevard,"It's a trip to walk down the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I used to live in LA and I can't believe how it has changed in 20 years. Lots to see, but very touristy, and I believe that's what the Chamber of Commerce wants for that spot. So it is what it is and it's fun, so go with the flow. Tons to see with some good restaurants to choose from...love the mall, and Dolby Theatre. Tons of Hollywood history. I had fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisadesanti
40,Fun for young kids.,Admire the names of favorite stars and while feeling you're really in the heart of Hollywood. Especially loved Mohammed Ali's star which was hung gracefully on a wall rather than placed on the sidewalk. There is an outdoor mall near the Chinese Theatre where you can easily view the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Louay
30,just be careful,"this would be my 2nd time coming here and the first time was when i was a kid - maybe as i got older, the anticipation of walking down the Hollywood Walk of Fame as i saw on TV was met with disappointment.around the chinese theatre, there are those who will want to take pictures with you but we declined.also, though i'm from NY, i got the sense of watching out for my belongings probably because we're tourists? lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianl904
30,The well known Walk of fame,"Well, we all have ideas that the walk of fame is like a dream, but in reality it is not that famous. There is just a long street with a pedestrial full of stars on the ground. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad attraction since it has a history behind it. The fact is that it looks amazing on T.V, whereas once you visit it, you discover that it is normal. But there are a lot of eccentric people there. An interesting place to visit...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imen2
40,"So many stars, so little time...","*I actually went in December 2006 and July 2013, they make you put a date*I enjoyed going on the famous Hollywood Walk Of Fame. It is something everyone should see when going to Hollywood. It was really fun. The first time I went I was only ten and didn't realise the significance. I didn't know any of the people on the stars, so it was a bit of a waste that time. Then the next time I was sixteen and was really excited to see all of the stars. The only problem is, it takes so much time to see all of the stars you want to see. But there is a fantastic app you can get, that tells you exactly where particular stars are. I didn't get many photos of the stars, but definitely worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tk1323
30,Just a road with dirty pavements,Was expecting an amazing road with stars of famous. Infact it's a nog standard road - notjing too exciting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RC_reviewer
20,Nothing Special,"Quite honestly, the whole area around the walk of fame can be a filthy mess of a tourist trap. I'm not saying that you shouldn't go because, let's face it, everybody back home is going to ask you if you went. But seriously, lower your expectations, see it, and then go someplace else. Farmers Market is close by and worth seeing. Or, if you are up for a little hike, Runyon Canyon is close and offers some great views of the city. Just don't plan in spending a whole lot of time at the walk of fame. Get your pics and get out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonathanV817
20,"Dirty, dingy, crowded and really not worth it","The title seems to sum it up perfectly. Between the obnoxious amount of street performers, tourists, vendors and homeless, you really can't see the stars anyway. When you do find a square that you want to see it is usually damaged in some manner. There is really poor upkeep. If you happen to be in the area then it is a happy bonus I suppose, but I certainly would't go out of my way for it.The upside is that it does go through some pretty big landmarks like the Kodak theater. And while there are street performers e-v-e-r-y-w-h-e-r-e, most are at least pretty good and make for great pics with the family. They are infinitely better that the Walk of Fame itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephj377
30,Not all that exciting...,"Wanted to take kids to see ""Hollywood"" so we went to the Chinese Theater and the Walk of Fame. It was more interesting for me than them since they did not recognize many of the names. The hand prints and handwritten names are located right in front of the theater. Was very crowded and lots of very forward peddlers on the streets that actually scared our kids most of hte time. The most entertaining part of our visit was to the Sweet shop located to the right of the theater. Very interesting (and gross at times!) and the kids LOVED it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferp556

40,Walking on Stars,"Recently did this with a visiting guest. I remember the thrill of my first visits to Hollywood Blvd and the walk of stars! This time around, there have been many many, I had to get the thrill through the eyes of my guest seeing it first time. Then I realized a perk by not being so caught up in looking down I was able to really get into the people watching & that is priceless!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelSecrets78
30,The walk of fame,I wanted to see the Walk of Fame in Hollywood .I was disappointed.It was dirty.Some of the stars were damaged.The traffic was terrible .I enjoyed seeing the wax museum and the movie star look a likes. Restaurants in the area were okay priced a little high.For a major tourist attraction it could be better maintained. I also visited the Ronald Reagan museum and library.That was a trip well worth taking. The grounds are clean and well cared for and the exhibits are really impressive.I believe it's a must see.I didn't do or see all I wanted so I'm going back in the future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddieq2013

30,Filthy,"If I were traveling from a great distance to see this, I would be so very disappointed.There are old stars and great stars and forgotten stars and unheard of stars. They are each filthy and grimy. Along a noisy crowded and bustling street in front of scuzzy, cheap, low class, tourist traps, smoke shops, and sex toy stores. Its pitiful. I imagine it in the Golden Age of Hollywood to what it is now....a far cry from glamour! I don't recommend this and its heartbreaking because its an icon but its just plain not worth the time to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peppermonkee

Walking on the path is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerrylea142016

30,Not very clean,"The walk is about 20minutes in total along a mostly boarded up, derelict road, the stars cover most of the walk but are very unkempt. It's a realy disappointment, especially considering it is one of the major attractions in LA. It really could do with a clean and you can see the money is spent on Rodeo drive rather than Hollywood Blvd. Once you find the star you are looking for you definitely wouldn't want to sit on the floor and pose for a photo. The main part outside the Dolby theatre is very busy and there's many street performers etc, but they will only perform if you pay them.....nothing is free these days! You are also constantly hassled by vendors trying to sell tours, literally every few feet which gets really annoying. We can honestly say we were disappointed with LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda1051
30,It was ok,It was ok. It was a bit dirty. I understand it is a busy footpath but could be cleaned more often. It is a star attraction after all. It was cool to see all the stars & of course running into a gaggle of Johnny Depps etc. Loads of crazy people & spruikers. Just like you see in the movies :)The chinese theatre was being refurbished so really did not get to see it at all. Overall we walked it a couple of times on our visit & it was an entertaining experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katkaren
50,The sidewalk with John Wayne to Mickey Mouse,"We walked up one side of Hollywood Blvd and down the other.As we checked out the stars, of course I went into the quaint shops for stylish clothes to shows and trinkets.While walking back to Candy shop in order to go on the TMZ tour I saw Spider-man sitting on mailbox.Then handed a CD of music from an up coming rap star.The day I was there a movie premiere was showing a Grams theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanineW330
40,"Same ol, same ol, but it never gets old.","I've been to the Walk of Fame many times, but it never gets old. I always see a new name/star that I haven't seen before.

30,The Times Square of the West,"In looking st the picture used for the walk of fame was, how in the heck did they get a picture without any people in it?Being from NJ we are used to the amount of people jammed onto the sidewalk in front of Graumanns theatre but if you are crowd adverse stay away. Remember those people in costume who want to take a picture with you are not their because they like you, they work for tips and expect that you give one.Enjoyable for my family but not for the faint hearted",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jims582
50,"Loved it , especially the people watching!","We stayed just behind the Dolby theatre at a little place, Hollywood Celebrity Hotel. It was 3 min walk too Walk of Fame. We just loved the people along the street. You have too just soak it all up, smile and say no thanks. We travel too Bali so it's no hassle too us. They are dressed up in costume, dome are fantastic, Tim cruise was so nice and polite and very alike. Others were tacky but just earning a living. To see the stars on the walk of fame and how long it hoes for is fabulous , take photos and soak up the atmosphere is wonderful ! We travelled from Australia , 3 generations and we our favourite celebrities stars that we had too find. We all loved our time there, we will go back again !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessa38

30,"Worth it to say ""Been there, Done that"" but parking is not good","So fun to see all of the stars on the sidewalk. If you start at Mann's Chinese Theater you will be better off. The parking is so bad, so best to park in the underground parking in the mall next to the theater. Fun to see and experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YearoftheRabbit

50,LA Must See!,"The Walk of Fame is just one if those things you have to see in LA! I've visited twice, and both times have been enjoyable. It's free and you see a lot of interesting people and places when you stroll down the sidewalk. Aside from the stars of famous people, many street performers sing, play instruments, dance, and dress up as cartoon characters for pictures. On this visit, there was a guy with no legs playing the drums, and another posing with a python. The walk of fame is a very interesting treasure in the heart of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdwardHawk

50,Interesting,"My daughter and me really liked Hollywood Walk of Fame, we stayed in a hotel nearby and just walked there, it takes less then half an hour to see it and to make pictures, walk to a Chinese Theatre and other attractions nearby. Plenty of people there. Good to go during day time to see all the stars and to make pictures. Worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apple77733
30,Hollywood Walk of fame,It is very exciting but tiring because it stretches for blocks and there is no map to tell u where the person is unless you puchase it I believe. But the area is filled with so much excitement. Early morning is less crowded but the evening is when the action begins.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/522victoriaa
30,A Zoo!,"Typical tourist trap, it's so overcrowded and crazy noisy. The actual street could benefit of some heavy duty pressure cleaning, it felt sticky and gross. Aggressive sales people approaching you to take their Hollywood Tour, they even followed us after we said No! There are a few nice stores and businesses, however - nothing that would ever make me want to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EuroGem

40,You Just Have to Do This,"This is just something everyone should do. One of those cultural literacy things. If you haven't done it, you have missed out. I will say it was a little dirtier than I thought it would be, but we had a great time discovering names of famous people we had heard of and many we hadn't. I learned that they aren't free, the person actually has to pay to have their star put in. Expect to see lots of folks dressed up as famous people, posing for pictures and asking for tips. Their costumes range from fairly authentic to Halloween ridiculous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KniteRiter
30,Overrated.....,"We planned a trip to the Hollywood Walk of Fame at our teenager's request. It was neat to see all of the stars ""honoring"" the famous actors, radio personalities, etc. but it is definitely not what it is made out to be. It is like walking through any other major city just with fancier sidewalks. People dressed as famous characters are rude to those walking through or trying to take pictures of the stars. The look-alikes who stand on the side are much politer than the ones walking up & down the street bothering everyone. BEWARE - you will be asked to take a tour every 2 minutes & some of them downright badger you even as you walk away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherF888
40,Fun,My husband and I went to the walk of fame in February and had a great time. It was fun to see the stars of all the celebrities. Walking the Walk of Fame at night was super fun because of the atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bee42435595
30,"A loooong walk, but we saw some cool ""Stars""","We visited the Walk of Fame on a lark during a trip. It was not pre-planned, so we wandered for several blocks before we found all the stars we wanted to see. In front of the Kodiak (formerly Graumanns) Chinese Theater is the greatest concentration of costumed performers. Be ready to tip for a photo, but I was happy to. Their costumes are spot-on, the attitude is friendly and they posed for several photos with my son. Further along there are stops for tour buses where you will get a low-pressure sales pitch. Just say no thank you and everyone is friendly. I was there during the late afternoon, early evening and I felt very safe. You could easily spot a local and they can easily spot you. I never felt ""hustled."" Honestly, I felt safer here as a tourist than I did living in Baltimore! Some streets are populated with bars, others gentleman's clubs, but even there I felt safe. 3-stars for the loooong walk and poor condition of several stars. (Poor William Shatner-his star is almost worn down.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/636allisonk

40,Give business to the kiosk in front of Forever 21 that sells the light up shirts,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame itself is okay. We went on a Monday afternoon/evening so it wasn't that crowded. They had street performers, celebrity look-alikes, and vendors. Be prepared to tip for a picture or performance - tips are their bread and butter so I didn't mind. We only walked from Highland to La Brea, but I think that's where most of the popular attractions are - the Highland Center which is where the Dolby Theatre is located, the Chinese Theatre, as well as the theatre where they film the Jimmy Kimmel Live shows. The Wax Museums are located there as well. In fact, the next day, they had street closures because they had a True Blood 2014 event in front of the Chinese Theatre. My ""very good"" review is based on the kiosk in front of the Forever 21 that sells the shirts and hats that light up. I promised my son that I would buy him one on the way back to the hotel. We were approached by Steven, who is so charismatic and loves what he does. My kids totally fell in love with his fun and positive attitude. We ended up spending over an hour there and it was the highlight of their day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/994jenr
50,Fun walk for the Family,"The Hollywood walk of Fame was fun for the family. We didn't walk extremely far or that much due to walking with very small children, but we still experienced a ton of famous names even fun names for the children...cool gift shops for the kids and live characters along the stroll to entertain our lil ones. We had a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liveinthemomentnow
30,Similar to the old Times Square,"I found it a real zoo, where one has to watch their wallet. Lots of hawkers. It reminded me of the old times Square. I heard at night in the bars, there were problems like shootings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/feenst128
10,Very underwhelming!,"Just like LA itself, it's a very underwhelming place, an overhyped cesspit and a bit boring unless you're easily impressed by people dressed up as elvis or a superhero. I wouldn't have bothered if I'd known what I know now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/667mick
30,Stars paving the way,"Stars on the pavement! Yes, you have to go here but do not expect a fantastic overwhelming experience, it is just stars on the pavement and some parts are very worn and it is absolutely a pity that they cannot clean up the place. If I were for example Sylvester Stallone I would demand that the city should clean up the place a bit to get that shiny feeling back.It can be difficult to find a parking but if you are patient you will find one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lamboswede
40,Worth a visits to find your favourite actor!,"My and wife visited the Walk of Fame on our first full day in LA, which also happened to be the same day as Captain American The Winter Soldier premiere so the Boulevard was closed to traffic? I had been before, but not really taken it all in, so we were both keen to see as many of the top stars as possible. It is well worth the visit and regardless of what one of the guides there said Bruce Willis handprints is there. Lots of top stars to see. There are lots of folk dressed up as movie stars and characters e.g. Transformers and Darth Vader, who charge for having your photo taken with them...if you are quick you can get a good shot of them before they see your and turn around!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Magmoncrieff
20,not what i imagined,"We went there at the beginning of this month. We decided one afternoon that a trip to los Angeles won't be complete without going to Hollywood walk of fame. The weather was nice and taking the metro to get there was easy. When we arrived we didn't find the experience that appealing. We even visited the Chinese theatre. This is where you find actors and actresses hands and feet prints. I'm sure that others love these things but not for me. Universal studios were so much better and fun, but not the walk of fame. Sorry!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Denz1908
10,No thank you.....,"As the title says you get used to saying this (if your polite) to the tour operators and other people trying to sell stuff or ""give "" it to you for free.The area is filled with homeless and other folks that appear to try to intimidate tourists. I personally had to fend off a homeless chap who tried to follow me and start a fight.There was minimal police presence and I could tell the area was in dire need of more of them. Our group had three off duty police officers in it and all of us agreed the place was the pits and one squad car in the area was not enough. The two officers were posing for pictures with tourists and lacking in their actual duties....sad and disappointingOnly a few of the costumed characters were actually genuine to speak with in that they did not demand tipping. Jack the pirate was the best and actually took the time to explain how things work to many tourists.Most of the costumed folks will try to grab you or your kids and pose for pictures. Watch out for them especially the two chebaccas!The place has gone down the tubes and is really a taste now of any inner city street that attempts to lure in tourists through over the top selling of crap and tee shirts. Stores have same stuff inside so just be wary as prices do vary.TMZ tour only legit one in area.Avoid this place......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chicagoburgsfamily
40,Ya gotta do it!,"The walk of fame stretches a few blocks on either side of the street. It's fun to find different stars like Bugs Bunny and Big Bird, along with real people and their stars. It's a fun little trip but expect tons and tons of people, all of them stopping to take pics so expect slow-moving walks. I saw this via a tour which let us off here for 30 minutes, which was the perfect amount of time. I'm glad I went, something to see and kind of fun too. Tradition in Hollywood - ya gotta do this one, but don't plan on spending all day or you might feel cheated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindawJ811LW
20,Dirty and crowded,"There are more stars than you may realize and finding your fave can be a fun scavenger hunt. However, you are hounded by people in ratty costumes wanting money, it is very over crowded and really dirty. It was cool to say I have been there but overall I was very disappointed with the Hollywood area. It was smaller, dirtier and a bit of a rude crowd when we went as well. We did go into the Chinese theater and saw Raven Simone at the Louis Vuitton store but my feelings would not be hurt if I never got to return. Once again another review I had to put a date but actual visit was in 2007.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catiei2018
40,If you visit Hollywood you want to see it,"Its an icon place. Crowded and not the cleanest place, but fun. My daughter loved seeing the handprints of celebrities at the Chinese theatre.

40,Guilty Pleasure,"This has always been a guilty pleasure of mine every time I visit LA.Be aware this is not what you think it is.All the glitz and glamour of Hollywood are all the way in Burbank now.Your not gonna find any celebs or film shoots here.This is an area that is run down and filled with homeless people.I do not advise walking here at night,the area can get very shady.That being said it is a very good learning experience to walk by here and it serves as a warning to stay in school so you do not end up as one of the beggars sleeping on Marilyn Monroes star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginoh368
30,Go.. so you can say that you've been!,"Not movie star crazy! So Im not a fan. You have to look profusely for the star of your favorite personality, if you don't have a map, which Im sure they sell. It's definitely a tourist spot. Lots of infamous actors/actresses shooting commercials there. You can see the famous Chinese Theater, and people dressed as characters walking up and down Vine. You must pay them though if you plan to take a picture with them. This landmark is nothing special to me. Yawn!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrettyInPink18
40,"Quick, Free and Fun!","It was nice to see and take photos and to be able to say we were there! Why not? It was nice walking around and taking it all in, just being a tourist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CatalinaV
30,More stars than I thought,"We drove and parked in the main garage on Hollywood. Very busy street with many people dressed up hoping to make a buck posing with you in a picture. People trying to sell you their CD, some drunks trying to be your best friend. You can google the address of your favorite celebrity's star location. The stars cover quite a few blocks so be prepared to walk. I was surprised how many names you recognize on your walk. Even in the less popular sections of the block there were many famous names. I was reading the names as we walked and telling my kids what they were famous for. They were impressed how many I knew. We ate in a restaurant in the mall over the garage and they discounted the parking for me. Worthwhile to do for a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UnkLjo
20,Not what we expected,"From all the times the Walk of Fame was shown in the media, it looked like this was a spot that you just had to go to. Little did my family know that it was dirty, stinky, and the sidewalks had people in costumes that ask for a picture with you only to ask for a tip after! This was unbeknownst to us and my dad refused to give the guy a tip only to have him follow us for blocks asking for one. Very irritating with not much to see either. Sure it was nice seeing all the celebrities names on the ground, but if you don't want to waste your time, don't bother going here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ultimateshot
30,Go early,"I know this is a tourist trap, but I still wanted to visit it. Time zone difference worked out well for my family. We got up, went out for breakfast, got here and parked before 7am. We were the only ones here at first and walked around unhindered for awhile. When 7 o'clock came, buses of tourist arrived and the area got congested fast. Fortunately we were leaving at this point because people in tacky costumes and homeless people were starting to show up looking for money. One man was wearing a kids spiderman costume taped together in many places to keep it together, my kids were a bit scared of him.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belindam
30,R U A Movie Freek ?,"Wow... what a fun walking with the stars. But be careful... You may find so many people asking you to buy some cd from them. Once you stop by, you are gone. They call themselves a musician, and want to sell their music cd. I came across one guy, listened to him, as he said that Indians helped Africans, so you are a good guy, and help me. When I denied to buy, he called me cheater !!!! I just walked away. so just be careful. Taking the pictures of dressed characters are just not worth it. Rather take the pictures of the Stars..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D0shi

30,Busy busy busy,Becareful. Nothing is free not even taking pictures of the people who are dressed up as various characters. Its ok for an hour but quite overwhelming. There are guys giving out cds then ask for donations which are super irritating. The place is buzzing day and night. A place for tourists to congregate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ivana-banana
40,Not as interesting as we had anticipated...but glad we went!,"There may be other Walks of Fame, decorated with stars...but there is only one Hollywood Boulevard Walk of Fame that attracts visitors from all over the world. What is it about a load of slabs of stone with a brass inlaid names that can cause such a buzz...well it is who they are, and the fact that the stars themselves were there to unveil them and their pride that they had been honoured in that way. You would need more dedication than we had to do the whole length and see all the stars...but just a brief walk is enough to say...been there, done that...and now we have!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterandLesley2013
50,Mini vacation,Seeing all or most of the stars past and present on the sidewalk was as if you were with them. There were so many impersonators near by that it almost overwhelms you. From Transformers to Michael Jackson to Marilyn Monroe! Lots of things to see and places to visit near by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvangHouston

40,Must visit,"This is a place you must visit and see the handprints of the stars, It is a very busy part of the city but still worth it. The only disappointment was the amout of people dressed up in costumes they caused blockages in the pavements. Though the kids loved getting their photos taken with them. Some were were done others pretty poor.The whole area outside the theatre was crowded. But still worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williedor
30,A Fancy Sidewalk,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is on Sunset Blvd. not in the nicest area of town. it now stretches a fairly large area. If you happen to be nearby you can give it a look, but not worth going out of your way",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyNYLA
10,Biggest disappointment,"As a huge hollywood movie fan, I was so excited to get to LA and have a fabulous experience. However, hollywood blvd was so dirty and foul. The walk of fame wasn't glam or fun it was a chore walking down it seeing all the dirty pathways and rubbish. Prepared to be disappointed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hanmoran12
20,See it...Once.,"The area is a typical touristy area. Tacky souvenir shops, cheesy attractions and sub par food restaurants. The stars are OK, nothing special. You'll get tired of seeing them after a while. Lots of weirdos dressed up in dirty costumes trying to get you to pose with them for a photo then expect money. CD hustlers, etc. It's OK to visit once, then move on to better things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aerowing
20,Stepped On Stars....,"I was not impressed by the way this has been kept up. But, what can you do when so many folks are walking on these stars. There is cigarette butts, spilled drinks, stains...ugh. If I had a star here, I would be crying. The area is not good either and is a tourist rip off. There are crazy characters in abundance. But, if you must, go and take a walk there...at one time this street was much better kept.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annie123896
10,Not nice,My one bit of advise would be either do a sit on tour down it or a taxi.. its a long stretch of road with is full of tacky shops and quite frankly its horrible. The stars themselves look great just a shame they are surrounded by the bong shops/ cheap under wear/ dressing up shops!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesna2017
30,Hollywood not at its finest,"This is somewhere I've read about and seen since I was knee high to a grasshopper; the actual reality is very different from the 'idea' of it.It's neither glamorous or classy - nor did it fill my childhood nostalgia like I so very much thought it would. Instead it's just a smelly street, with uneven pavement surface and an abundance of stars. There are many more famous stars outside the Chinese Theatre - which is in fact the best part of the walk. The road turns into a run down dump the further you walk along it.Do not misunderstand me; it is still worth seeing and hunting down your favourite singer/actress, etc, but do not go with high expectations.I was disappointed, but that was because I expected it to be as it is portrayed on the television and on film.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belle-Noel
30,Tour by a seafarers...,"As a seafarers we don't have much time to spend ashore, but my visit here was worth it coz it's so iconic... We took a train from San Pedro and it was about an hour ride.. But be cautious while riding the blue line coz there were a lot of weird people traveling.. Hehe but for me it was part of the experience.. 6 dollar day pass is awesome.. After this you can proceed to universal city.enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randylouier
50,Excellent experience for one's life,"We visited this place and had to take the picture putting our hands in our favorite singers, everyone does the same here so no embarrasement, the place has a lot of people dressed like actors and movie's people and if you give them a dollar they will happily take a picture with you, We got pics with star wars , wonder woman , batman and superman, we loved it and highly recommend this place for families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryanmantezoni
30,Mixed bag,"The walk of fame is just something you have to do while in Hollywood as it is so iconic. However be prepared as it wont be all ""movie like"" as you would expect.It is a dirty area, cockroaches running around and sticky floors. There are also handful of people dressed up (poorly dressed up) as batman/superman/halo etc etc who will basically grab you for a photo and demand $5 for the picture you never wanted.It is also very busy around the Chinese theatre as the Starline tours start here.All in all its worth a see but don't get your hopes up too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kodak747
40,Follow the stars...,"This is something that just has to be done. Yes this area is filled with tourists what feels like 24/7 but its because its in prime location to everything that Hollywood has to offer. Its really cool seeing all the stars for the different celebrities, some I didn't even realise had stars. Found a lot of Aussie celebrities which was really cool too. Just make sure you don't miss the ones going down random streets along the Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lozh_13
30,Crowded!,"I remember coming here over 30 yrs ago as a kid. I just want to return for another visit. The stars probably doubled since then. As I said in my title, it is overly crowded especially near the Chinese theater area. The place is a little sleazy with people dressing up as characters ready to take photos with you, as well as panhandlers. I'm probably a fool for giving them money but that's another story. Of course I'm here only to see the stars on the sidewalks so I pay no attention to those characters. Sometimes it was nearly impossible to take a snap shot of my favorite actors as people just walk right over what you were about take. We ended up walking the entire 3.5 miles of the Hollywood Walk of Fame and taken over a hundred photos of stars.Depending on how long you will be staying there, it is best to look for a parking garage that either gives you a good all day rate if you staying more than 4 hrs, or one that gives you a good short term rate if you are staying for only a couple of hours. The garage we used is $8 all day during the weekend. It was located behind the Fresh & Easy market complex on Sycamore Ave. The one on Orange Ave, behind Madame Tussauds is good for short term (under 4 hrs). You can have your ticket validated at the Highland shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RainbowCowboy
10,Terrible.,"Wow. This area is disgusting. Smelled, sticky sidewalks and a whole bunch of creepy people. Not counting the one's trying to run a little hustle. The city of Los Angeles should be ashamed of themselves. That they have allowed this Walk of Fame to turn into the dirtiest creep show on Earth. Have some pride and maybe start by power washing those sidewalks. Or you could enforce laws like loitering, aggressive panhandling, under the influence and prostitution.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/otev915
50,Has to be Done,"OK, I know. The area is a bit sleazy. A bit jaded. However, this is just one of the places anybody who's ever lived in the western world has to visit. Wandering along the pavement (sorry, sidewalk) it was just like having your whole life unfold before you. Names from your childhood, your youth, etc abound. How could you visit LA and not see this?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanpfc
50,Hooray for Hollywood,"Yes it's all fake and showy and crowded with photo scammers but that's what it's all about isn't it? Well I think so anyway. We did the tour bus on the second day here, actually visited twice because the first time it was closed off in front of the theatre, unfortunately the same on the second visit but we still had a lot of fun and saw a lot of ""famous"" folk. It's a must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodgerskay
20,Don't expect much,This place is crowded and full of tourist and costumed folks waiting to get their picture taken with you. Not very interesting and it gets old within 15 minutes. Of course you will have to come see it for yourself. Just don't come with high expectations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IowaRod
30,If you are a fan...,Great idea to go just to say you've been there and have the T-shirt. The Chinese Theatre is cool and the attractions like Ripley's and Madame Tussauds are awesome. What put me off are the dressed-up folks trying to basically force you to have a picture taken with them. I guess the sectret is to not look them in the eye or at their costumes. Then there's a $5 shop that probably has a $5 promo going every day of the year - great place to get a plastic oscar.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PieterV355
30,Nice to see,It is nice to see when you are on Hollywood BLVD. IT is a free attraction so takes nothing but time and effort. Now if you are looking for someone particular it will cost 5 dollars for a map.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrentJ293
20,Very over rated,"We were standing right there and we're still looking for it.. What I mean to say is that there are no signs, lights etc indicating that u have reached one of the most talked about attractions of LA.. Don't expect much.. Go directly outside the Dolby theatre / Chinese theatre at least it's better lit and has some characters walking outside ( batman / transformers / spidey etc etc) kids enjoy that... Else it's nothing much..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salonisingh
30,Nothing like I imagined,"I was looking forward to Walk of Fame and I was slightly disappointed.Hollywood is not what I imagined.It's cool and good fun to walk looking at the famous stars but things that put me off, people dressed up, 'rappers' handing out cds, performers and homeless all after your money. Also a strong smell of urine in some parts.I didn't imagine it to be quite like that.It's a must see but I will not go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RayBan__x

50,Worth visiting at least once,"I've been here a few times and I like it but unfortunately this is a really busy street. It doesn't matter what day of the week you visit, it's always crowded, hard to find a parking and there are mobs of people everywhere. I brought my young kids here and they didn't really understand what it was and I couldn't tell if they enjoyed it or not. It's more for adults and older kids. The crowds are the only problem but otherwise I enjoy stopping by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GK19792014

20,Walk of fame??,"ALthough I may be slightly jaded, having grown up a few miles from Hollywood Blvd, I've always felt bad for the tourists who make the trek to walk down the Blvd. It's really just a dirty street, with a fancy sidewalk. The names of stars have been put into the sidewalk, with a camera, or microphone, or TV to indicate what medium they worked in.Near Hollywood and Highland (where the Oscars take place) there are marginal perfromers dressed as super heros. Slightly more fun and impressive are the hand and foot prints at the former Grauman's Chinese Theater right there at Hollywood and Highland. The movie theater is now part of the shopping center there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vivilein
40,Great to say you have been there,"We'll obviously nothing spectacular but I would recommend it everyone has seen it before on the TV and it is good to say I've been there when it comes up next time, you can get a photo with your favourite steers name or find your first name and take a photo with your foot covering there last name.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dion92
30,WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR !!,"During our stay ,we saw the Hollywood Walk of Fame . Nothing to get excited about ! It's worth a photo or two , don't go out of your way if you're not close by ! Universal Studios Singapore has a mini walk of fame !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susy1Brisbane
30,Worth a look if you're close by,"It didn't feel as special as I'd expected. Too much hype and not enough substance. Although, I'm not sure what more could be done - it's a bunch of stars with names on!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerrypoint
20,Wasn't a fan,"I was expecting the walk to be more.. Preserved.. Instead there were street entertainers , general heavy footfall. It's on a busy street and not much to look at. I was expecting a lot more and was disappointed really.By all means go, just don't expect anything special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephanieM362
40,A Walk of Fun,"LA is unique and this is one of this places thats why.The Walk of Fame in Hollywood Boulevard is a nice stroll to make in a sunny day. The path of ""stars"" and famous people starts at La Brea Av and Hollywood Boulevard with a little shrine and you can walk the 2 blocks to the Chinese Theatre.You can easily spot all the stars (and the tourist on the floor) and have fun looking for all the famous people that have a star there. If you dont have a sense of humour or are short of time you can use google to locate them.Yes, there is a lot of people trying to catch tourist. From tour sellers, to dress people and scam artist but thats common in every touristic place. Just avoid them with a firm ""No, Thank you"".Parking its a hassle so I would recommend you to look for a place between Sunset and Hollywood Blvd, passing La Brea Av, around Poinsettia and Formosa street where there are no parking meters and usually there is plenty of space.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RMartinSDXB
30,"Once you have seen one star, you have seen them all.","I do not know why this place is so popular. I have visited several times with my wife and they are just template stars with an individual's name in the middle. I know there is a process to get a star, but someone could have easily just placed a whole bunch of stars on a random sidewalk and included some random individual's name. I just do not see what is special about the Walk of Fame. The same goes for the gaudy stores on the Walk of Fame. Once you have seen one, you have seen them all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kandkwed

40,"Fun, you sorta have to do it... Still kinda dirty though","Hollywood Boulevard is a mixed bag. Even with the new developments, there is still a crowded touristy seediness about it. Competing Elmo's wanting to pose for a picture with you. But this is a REAL walk of fame. The celebs mostly were here for their ceremony, and combined with the forecourt at Graumann's Chinese Theater - it does anchor the tie between the celebrities who live or work here and their fans. There's still a fun little delight when you look down and see you're standing on the name of a star that you really like. Oh look, I'm standing on Dolly Parton ! (Outside the El Capitan theater). Yeah... I'm not so jaded that you can't get excited by a name. If you're visiting, you have to do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roadwarriorla
10,Overrated is an understatement,If you areca tourist out to find a star you should find your star and walk away. People with costumes will try to take pictures with you. People that sell tours to hollywood stars will seem to be stalking you and that is mostly what happens in the area...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/biribilis
40,Walking among the stars,"Spent a pleasant time walking along the walk of fame viewing the names of the stars. The handprints in the concrete in front of the Graumans Chinese theatre were amazing to see and photograph. We recognized so many of the old movie stars such as John Wayne, Roy Rogers, and Shirley Temple, plus a hundred more. Just be alert of the large crowds and street characters who pose for pictures with you and then hound you for a tip. When we were there they began closing the front area of theatre as they were setting up for a premiere of a movie with all the actors and actresses appearing. Wish we could have stayed. Nice place to see Hollowyood history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/670PaulL

The street characters are fun to see and interact with, but be prepared for them to hold out their hand for a tip if you pose for pictures with them. Oh well.

20,Dirty cheap walk,"I just don't really get why is one of the most famous attractions is not well maintained. Very disappointed.

Sorry, didn't like it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackier161
10,Go if you must....but be wary,"I realize that the ""Walk of Fame"" holds a special allure for many around the world, I guess it would rank right up there with the Eiffel Tower...or the or Big Ben or Times Square...but the ""Walk of Fame"" draws a lot of people you would not like to have dinner with...the homeless, the down and out...the criminally insane...you get the picture, and then factor in the people hawking things along the Boulevard...If you must go be AWARE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandolinguy
10,As tired as can be,"This Hollywood ""walk of fame"" is a disaster in so many ways. When I first moved to Los Angeles decades ago, it was kind of fun to walk along the boulevard and see the names of celebrities, especially the ""old-time"" movie stars. A stopoff at C.C. Brown's for a hot fudge sundae was an indulgence not to be denied. Today, Hollywood Boulevard is like the worst ghetto, with overly aggressive costumed ""performers"" soliciting passersby to take photos with them, or to hug them (creepy), or whatever. Be prepared to pay for those photos with Spiderman and Catwoman, or you will be verbally abused at the least. The souvenir shops sell such schlock, it's embarrassing. You would not want to buy this junk for the folks back home. There are lots of fun tourist things to do to in Hollywood, but walking along this urine-perfumed, homeless enclave is NOT one of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveller77

40,Must-see for Movie Buffs,"My husband and I are avid movie buffs -- new movies, old movies, action movies, dramas, comedies, we love them all. So when we visited LA recently, we had to visit the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Though touristy, it was a lot of fun. We especially enjoyed the handprints in front of the Chinese theatre.The Walk of Fame encompasses more than 1-2 blocks. It makes for a nice walk, you just need to be prepared for it.There is also a lot of fun 'people watching' here too. For a period of time, we found outdoor seats at the Starbucks, bought two Frappuccino's, and watched the other tourists. There is something about this place that makes everyone remember their favorite movie, quote, scene, etc, and it is not unusual to launch into those favorite scenes spontaneously.This is a fun place, filled with great memories that give us all a chance to remember why we will always love movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/midwestworldtraveler
40,For movie buffs!,"Hollywood Walk of Fame is a must if you can do it, especially for all the movie buffs out there, you can get maps to find your fav stars but I like to just stroll along and see who's there.

Every inch is crawling with certifiably insane people dressed in characters from Tinkerbell to Johnny Depp's pirate's & Alice in wonderland character. Parking is expensive ($8-$15 per day). Meters are scarce & max out at 1-2 hours ($2 per hour) & neighborhood spots are permit only.I challenge you to cover 500ft. without being solicited for change or a Hollywood bus tour (I wish I was exaggerating). The smells that you will experience are second to none (urine, vomit, extreme b.o.). People on Hollywood blvddo not like to swallow their saliva.. It could be a rule?Anyway, it IS a sight to see. Good shopping, Riley's museums, & tourists that literally stop mid-step to photograph a star on the sidewalk. Experience it. (That's a genuine suggestion). It's free & you can't beat that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q1647MHaudreyh
20,Nasty dirty and dissapointing. Much like Hollywood itselt.,"Just a bunch of grubby stars on a grubby street. If you venture into Hollywood, don't go for this sad collection of stars.

30,Walking the walk,This is no doubt one of the greatest attractions in Los Angeles and Hollywood and a must see for all tourists but there is a lot more Hype over the location i feel. It is really fun and exciting to look at the names and try and find all your favorite ones but there are a lot of interesting people on the streets and panhandlers that just ruin the location. The smell at times is pretty intense and not in any good way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CholentTheTraveler
50,Nice to go if you have never been.,"It's nice to go one time and walk around see the different stars, there's museums, characters on the walk and a pretty big shopping area.

30,What a crazy place!,"I definitely needed to checkout the walk of fame. I have always heard of these hollywood stars on the sidewalk, and about the chinese restaurant. Other than those 2 places, there really isn't anything to see other than up and coming rappers trying to forcefully give-away their cd's, which one should never accept! The crowd is weird, and very pushy. Once I took a few pictures, and bought a few t-shirts, I was out of there. At least I saw what all the fuss was about, and I am not sure why there was a fuss in the first place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AustinVisitor1
10,It is a zoo,"Way overrated. If you want to see hundreds of people looking for signs in a ground, this is the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zhenya
50,Memory Lane,Looking at the names on the walkway brings memories of a lifetime back to life again. Great outing. Good to do with a peer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SiouxMac
40,Some walk!,We walked part of this every day of our stay & loved reading all the names - difficult to walk safely at times!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelenewright
50,Fun times,It was really neat to see all the names of movie stars. Even young kids will have fun looking at the stars. And if not the stars then the really weird people in costumes. We were given a tour by my cousin who lives in so cal - maybe we enjoyed it more that if we had been left to fend for ourselves!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardbS6816KM
20,Clean this up,"The whole area smells like urine, is filled with hawkers and what I will at best call ""Lost Souls"" parading around. Seeing the stars on the sidewalk might've been fun had I not been walking at such a fast clip to give my nose a break.To be fair, I am not a fan of LA or the culture there (this being my 5th time there either due to work or to see friends) -- I just can't understand why the mayor/city can't clean up things more in the area and make it somewhat ""glamorous"" as they want to promote -- New York, Rome, London, all have these ""tourist traps"" but even Times Square (which I am not a fan) seems somewhat clean and upscale compared to the Hollywood area and most of LA in general..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joawhite48
30,So-so,Not what you see in the movies. The sidewalk is filled with people shoving there CDs or movies in your face and asking for money. Then there are people dressed in costumes ready to take photos for money. Can I say GET A JOB!!! The stars along the path were great the times I wasn't being bombarded with the freeloaders.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValerieG7
50,Once in a lifetime,This is one of those things you will do once in your lifetime but don't let that diminish the fascination and history that this will give you. I found myself thinking back to all those people and all those times in the past when they were at the top of their careers and here I was in the very spot where I had seen them onTV with their hands in the concrete! I'm glad I visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christinalyth
20,Boring...nothing special :P,One famous street and a lot of people :) nothing speciala... clothing store and couple museums with celebrities and that's it...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Micili
40,You MUST follow the stars!,It's fun to follow the names along Hollywood's Walk of Fame. It goes for quite a distance so be prepared to spend a little (or a lot) of time. A trip down Memory Lane with the names from yester-year and today.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanYHZ
40,Walk of Fame!,"I acted like a little kid by taking so many pictures all down the streets. My favorites are Bugs Bunny, Harrison Ford, Robin Williams, Michael Jackson, Kelsey Grammer, Roger Moore etc. This is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2BmoreGirl
30,Only okay.,"I think this experience was lessened by the fact that I'd seen the walk of fame on TV and in the media so much. AKA-- I had high expectations. It was a lot dirtier than I expected, and 85% of the shops were the same souvenirs. Also it was kind of annoying that some of the stars are repeats and many are for rather silly ""stars"". I can think of many more eligible celebs than Howie Mandel. Basically I'd always thought that it really *meant* something to have a star, but not so much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clearing_boxer
40,The Walk of Fame and the surrounding area,"The Walk of Fame is simply a set of celebrity names with a designation about whether they were in film, music, etcetera. It runs along both sides of Hollywood Blvd. By itself, it isn't that impressive. But, throw in Grauman's Chinese Theater, The Dolby Theater (with it's view of the Hollywood sign), and the various restaurants, bars, shops, and young people dressed as movie stars (Marilyn Monroe, the various super heroes, and other stars) that pose with tourists for tips, and this is a worthwhile visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UGAly1
40,Fun place to see,"The most fascinating thing about this walk are all the people so starstrucked. I still think it is a must see if you are in H-wood, if you want to take pictures visit it in the late evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ponti89
10,Honestly I think its stupid,Its really dumb. Who cares if the ground has a bunch of names on it. Also its a bunch of tourists and tourist traps. Hate it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheboygieS
10,"Find the Stars you want to see before, and spend as little time as possible","This area was incredibly disappointing. When you weren't being harassed by someone in a Spiderman or Darth Vader costume, it was a homeless person or a up-and-coming rapper trying to give you his CD. It was not a good experience-- and frankly, it was pretty dirty. I wanted to see Audrey Hepburn's star and I wish I would've gone before to find where exactly it was. If you do still go, keep your purse/wallet/money as secure and close as possible. I literally twice had to hold mine in my hand to avoid getting pickpocketed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hilaryr2017
50,Get you feet really a good walk,It's a fun place to visit and it's free try to have a picture with your favorite stars name on it. Lots of shops and restaurant along the way,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosievil
10,Drive by but don't stop,Not sure what we were expecting but what a let down. We were driving by and couldn't believe it. Did not even stop. Looked dirty. Area wasn't nice. Just not what we had envisioned at all. Not sure what else to even write about it. Do yourself a favor and don't waste the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJandCin
30,Nice to see,This was good fun and a great experience to see the Walk of Fame. Very busy at night time.Only annoying thing is people trying to get you to have photos with them (people dressed up as characters etc) and pay for them. So difficult to just have a walk and enjoy it.There's a cool little gift shop that is worth checking out :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicoleara
10,So disappointed...,"When you are planning a trip to LA your travel agent tries to get your accommodation as close to the Hollywood Blvd as possible right... DONT DO IT... !!!It's dirty, un appealing and to be honest a little scary.You would think the ""Stars"" would be maintained... Wrong, they are covered in gum, some all cracked and some even have resident homeless people living on them.Our first day there, our first 10 minutes cost us $25... First a DVD was thrust in our hands and after a few quick words our names were permanent penned on it and we felt obliged to pay ""what ever we think is fair"". Next a photo with Spider-Man cost as well... DO NOT BE FOOLED PEOPLE... Everyone wants your money. We learnt very quick don't make eye contact and do not talk to them.The beggars & homeless are not a great look but it's the tour bus operators that jump out in front of you that are the worst.The best part was the Chinese theater and the complex to the side and behind it.You need to say you have been but do not plan a whole day here. 1 hour is ample.And watch out for the Sesame Street characters, they get violent if not tipped...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Empress110
20,Grotty,"When you see all the glamour and glitz on television you think wow that looks worth a visit. When you get there its full of begars, down and outs and people trying to scam you for your money. Be very careful and be streetwise otherwise you will get fleeced. A trip into the hills and down to Rodeo drive is worth while once you have made the effort to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tang043
30,Very disappointing,It was an extremely hot day when we visited here. I was disappointed that they were just pink stars with people's names on them .. I don't know why .. I just expected more. There are loads of out of work actors dressed up as the stars who charge you for having your picture taken with them. There are also lots of would be rappers trying to sell you their cd. A busy place with lots of tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chippy378
40,Busy during the day!,"We toured Hollywood and found that the Walk of Fame was good but very busy. We were there on a Thursday and took a 5 1/2 tour. We were pleased with the Walk of Fame; however, it was a little hard stopping and getting a picture of a star. There were just people walking and you didn't want to interrupt their walk by stopping them and taking a picture. Overall, we were pleased with the Walk of Fame. If you visit LA/Hollywood, I would recommend taking a guided tour. There is so much there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VaSpeters56
30,kind of boring,"looking at the stars were a little boring, unless you look at the one outside the grauman theatre. the stores on the block are more interestingbottom line: still go to take a look",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationer187
30,Hollywood is a big disappointment,"I think that everybody has heard so much about Hollywood. Therefore the expectation is really big, but at the end nothing special there. The city itself is not in the best state. Ok, the walk of fame is just interesting because it is so well know. You will find many very well know artists, actors, musicians there... And that is it... Don't expect more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valdothebird
10,Dont do it...!,"As some of the others have wrote. You think yor are gonna miss something but you wont.I just arrived from Vegas and is tired of The Strip. Walk of Fame is kinda like the same as The Strip. To many people, homeless people, ""famous"" people you can pictures taking with for to many dollars and so on. Yeah its fun to so your idols stars, but all the other stuff is just horrible.I wouldnt recomment anybody to go there. Its a tourist trap!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlberteGrene
10,"SERIOUSLY OVERRATED! Dirty, many homeless people and picture robbery","Walk of fame was the worst experience about Los Angeles. Walk of fame is seriously overrated. Although you can see celebrities' names on the ground, you can't see any celebrities' hand print or foot print. It feels like you can make one by yourself. Many crazy homeless people. More importantly, LOTS OF photo robbery. They ask to take pictures with you and ask you for tips, even though you don't want to. They would try to threaten you if you don't give them money. Disappointed!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/closefire
50,HOLLYWOOD TOUR,"We recently did the Hollywood tour via Las Vegas, and the view of the mountains and valleys between Las Vegas and Los Angeles is fantastic. The tour of Beverly Hills, Hollywood and Santa Monica were worth the tour within it self. I must mention the Tour Inc. It was Adventure Photo Tours, Inc. and the tour guide was Dennis Truitt, the rates ,service, great and the knowledge of the tour guide was excellent. I do plan to use this service again in the near future. A.H.Y. S. Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Artie2
40,good place for tourists,"I've been to the Hollywood walk of fame a few times. I like this place because you can see a lot of people dressed in movie/ cartoon character costume and take pictures with tourist for tips. Also I like the highland shopping area. From the third floor, you can see the hollywood sign in distance. it's a nice place for souvonirs too. I like to take pictures with my favorite movie star's star on the walkway, and visit the wax museum there too. It's a lot of fun:-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142angelw
30,Dirty and crowded,"Happened to be staying on business within walking distance, made the mistake of going to see the ""walk"".Don't be fooled this stretch of street is all there is to see for miles, however given its significance to Hollywood it attracts the tourists and all those looking to make a fast buck. The stretch is dirty, crowded and not well kept.Go very early to avoid the crowds",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Exiles
40,Hollywood Walk of Fame,How do you not ho to the walk of fame if in LA. Great tourist spot to visit while in Hollywood. Plenty of parking along the roads and parking garages. Lots of restaurants and shopping. We liked it for souvenirs for the kids. Plenty of shops selling inexpensive shirts and trinkets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sethw118
30,Not that beautiful!,"I found a bit disappointing. It is worth knowing and seeing all the people and costumes and the Walk of Fame itself, but do not think it's worth returning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiorgiaGS
40,Well worth seeing,It's iconic LA and it would have been a shame to miss it and we were really pleased we made the effort to drive right across the city. The added bonus was that we got some great photos of the Hollywood sign from The Hollywood & Highland Center mall. The look a likes were amazing too. A really nice atmosphere and a good place to get bus tours from too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/behappy222
30,Go see the stars!,A tradition for anyone visiting Hollywood for the first time. Took a first time here and she had a blast. Went up and down both sides of the street and even caught Jimmy Kimmel filming his show in front of us. It's a great little walk. Do bring water or something to drink and be aware since the sidewalk is black and reflective not to go during midday heat. We noticed the difference as soon as we walked back to the car how much cooler we were. It's cool to the stars and see the people dress in costume. Be aware that the people dressed up expect tips and will not pose for free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emowk
30,Worth seeing for the atmosphere!,"There is so much people around the area!! There are a lot of impersonators for famous movies characters which were really good, get you into the spirit. The actual stars at the pavement are not that impressive, but there are a lot of tourist attractions around so it's worth checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mprica
30,Better in pictures,I thought this area looked better to be experienced in the guidebook or photos. Had to look for$10 secured parking 4blocks away as premium parking was set at $25...unless you are a big fan of a star; most names I didnt recognize :( ... Lots of people dressed in costumes; offering to be photographed only to learn later that they expect tips. Walk was eeking of urine smell probably from homeless people? And i dont think the street gets washed down with water to clean it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamabelz
50,Great,"A lot of stars and a lot of names. I really had a great time in this place. You can see a lot of things happening there, as the movies premiers etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pime_pimenta
30,Cheaper than Disneyland,"While we don't have kids, I would definitely recommend this as a cheaper alternative to going to Disneyland.Some of the impersonators and characters on the strip are seriously impressive and you just have to give a small tip to get your photo with them. We were able to spend a couple of hours just walking up and down taking in the sights and being mildy surprised by some of the names in the ground.It's not the most amazing place you will visit in your life, but worth a stop if you're nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmO6405MS
40,Always a lot to see looking up or down!,The walk of fame is always fun - good assortment or stores to pop in and out of and a LOT of people too see. We were there in July and managed to get a lot of free samples:) I am always mindful of people I am traveling with and my purse and there are a lot of people in a small area. it's also a place for homeless people but they didn't bother us at all..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cava33
40,Quite enjoyed! Got to see if in Hollywood,"Really enjoyed following names on the walk of fame.. Was great to see a number of recognisable names, but looking down at the floor at different names in the stars can get abit boring after a while.. Would still recommend if in the Hollywood area as its a 'must see'.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gurdeepc2014
10,What an atrocious place,"I recently went here with my family. I was so disgusted to see how dirty Hollywood Boulevard is. There are homeless people littering the street approaching everyone that pass by for money. If not a homeless person, than people with signs screaming in your ear about their $4.99 sale at the ""Everything is $10"" store. I'm sorry but if you want me to enter your store you're going to have to come up with something a little better than making me take your basket to ""get the sale"" What a scam. Hollywood boulevard was nothing but a mere joke. I would have rather spent my hour at a museum not getting pushed around in a crowd of hundreds. If I wanted to be elbow to elbow with someone I would go to Times Square.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelinew181
40,A must see,"I was so excited to see the 'Walk of Fame'. I definitely think it's a must see in Hollywood, and it was great to find your favourite stars and be able to take pictures. I have to say I was a little shocked at some of the names I did see on the 'walk of fame' and come to that.....the names I didn't see!! But overall definitely needs to be done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nbulley
30,A bit overrated.,"Not that special, but if you're in the area it could be fun checking out. It's like others have said full of people and it can be quite hard finding specific stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirderfr86
40,A must see but lower your expectations!!,"Hollywood Blvd is a must see but just be aware that Hollywood is really a bit of a dump, it has to be said! People go expecting bright lights etc etc but the reality is some areas are pretty shabby and even the pavement with the stars on was lifting up and cracking when we visited in April! We took a bus tour round the hills, Bel-Air, Rodeo Drive, Sunset Blvd and then up to a viewpoint for the Hollywood sign and we really enjoyed it. You can negotiate a discount on their prices if you walk away and say you'll think about and come back but if the tour is good then it's polite to tip the driver so we gave him the difference they knocked off. There is a nice mall at the side of the theatre where there are nice restaurants, the places to eat on the boulevard itself looked pretty grim.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ed333H
30,If you are looking for specific stars - google the address,"The stars in the sidewalk are kinda fun, the pushy street vendors, street performers, costumed characters, people selling CD's, tours, etc. are not. NOTHING they offer is FREE - they expect a Tip. The sidewalk can be crazy busy at times, so if you are trying to take pictures of certain stars, try early morning (before 10 a.m.) when there are less crowds. There are thousands of stars between La Brea and Vine along Hollywood Blvd. Many will be for people you do not know. There is no rhyme or reason to where they are placed. If you are hoping to find a specific star research where it is first and make a list of the ones you want to see and put them in order by address.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeremy044
50,Nice Experience,"Yes, there are homeless people, and yes, I was approached by a tour guide and I politely declined, but the surreal experience of seeing all of the stars made up for all of that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/135daniellem
10,If you don't go you will think you missed out,"But you won't have. Grubby, busy, noisy, constant hustlers. Apparently the stars are purchased so they're hardly an accolade so it's just the usual self adulation. (If they're not, and I dreamt that, I'm sure someone will put me right).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The2KsAuckland
30,Grotty,Has to be visited but have low expectations. The whole street is grotty and the pavements in particular. So many homeless around and constant approaches from Tour Guides etc make it not very enjoyable. Lasted half an hour then had too get the hell out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcWain
10,Not pleasant,"As our hotel was right around the corner we wentOnce at 7.30 am and it was nice . No one was aroundAnd we could have a look at the handprints . There was alreadyOne guy dressed up as an alien asking us to take photos with him but weCould avoid him . When we took our children thereIn the afternoon it was full of hawkers, aggressive dressed up characters and down rightScam artists . Beware of their trick of handing you a cd and asking for you name .They quickly write your name on the cd and then insist you pay $20For the cd. They suddenly have 4-5 other heavies surround you if you don't pay .And by afternoon / evening there are so many people on the footpath you can'tStop and look at anything on the pavement anyway . Come very early in the morning or don't bother coming at all .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yebziSydney
30,Fun Spotting the Stars,"Was a little disappointed, it’s a small side walk with loads of start on it.Can be done in a 20 minutes.The side walk was very dirty, you would think they would polish it up a bit.Its get crowded and hard to take photos which so many people walking round.It was fun trying to find certain celebrity stars and coming up across others.One of those sights you have to tick off…Beware od costume charter and people selling cd.. they will try to put it in your hand, once this happen it will be hard for you to give it back and the only way to get rid of them is to pay them for it. These people can be very verbal aggressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/341ava
30,OK Place...nothing special as such...enjoyed the mall nearby,Went here last year but the place is ok ok..nothing super special. Lot of people walking the hall of fame and taking some photos. Some street artists doing their thing etc.There is a shopping mall nearby and it had California Pizza kitchen and we ended up eating there and the food was delicious...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveller_sb12
30,Average,"As a British tourist, I suppose it is was worth attending at some point on my trip to LA. Nothing special in all honesty. The stars themselves don't seem to have any kind of personal feel to them and are essentially just names on the road, the majority of which are not really recognisable. But maybe that's just my lack of knowledge...The area itself is not particularly nice and has quite a few strange characters about. As with any tourist area, it was also absolutely packed.Worth a short visit once to say you've done it but don't expect anything fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sp1506
20,"Honestly, not great","It's fun to see the stars if you happen to be walking down Hollywood Blvd for other reasons, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see this. If you happen to be going to a show at the Pantages or something, why not check out a few stars.Hollywood Blvd isn't exactly the nicest of streets, particularly after dark. It doesn't feel unsafe, per se, but it isn't somewhere I felt completely comfortable walking around at night.Again, I'd say skip it unless you're intent on seeing a particular star (find it on a map in advance), or if you happen to be there already.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnbayesa
30,Hollywood Boulevard,"We went with LA tours in February and that part of street was closed for preparation of the Oscars the Dolby Theatre (aka Kodak Theatre) is where the Oscars are held! They were rolling out the red carpet while we were walking the walk of fame to the Chinese Theatre. The walk of fame is where the stars with celeb names are on Hollywood Boulevard, the place is dirty and some people were weird.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smeetsp
40,Take a Walk of Fame,"First time in Los Angeles, this is a must for a first timer. Its cool to walk along and see all the names and know at one time they once stood there :)I must say at night the atmosphere changes dramatically, it was a Saturday. As night approached we kicked in to Hard Rock Café for dinner, by the time we came out, the streets were filled with people milling around from all walks of life. Side shows everywhere you looked.Reminded me somewhat of my visit to NYC. Large crowds outside the Chinese Theatre, free entertainment by street performers. It was really a cool thing to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Native2tx
30,For the tourists.,"I feel like walking along Hollywood Boulevard is just something to do once... so you can say that you've done it. Seeing the name of familiar celebrities is fun and admiring the Hollywood sign from a distance is neat. It isn't the cleanest area of LA, but I wouldn't say it's filthy. There are some panhandlers here and there and celebrity-home tour employees harassing you to take a tour with them. But the best parts are just peeking into the various shops, finding good eats along the way, walking past Grauman's Chinese Theater and eventually wandering around Hollywood and Highland shopping center. Jimmy Kimmel's studio is located across the way and you can try to get free tickets to a taping during your visit. There is also the Pantages Theatre at the east end of the walk of fame if you want to catch a show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inspiredpanda
30,Needs cleaning up,This walk of fame has so much hype and when you get there it is so grotty!! I thought it was a disgrace that these famous people - a lot no longer with us - took the time for hand and footprints and they are not looked after at all. The whole area needs a makeover - even pressure washing would help!! More like walk of shame !!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeJ437
30,Take a walk on the wild side!,"Not the greatest place for kids, or the Leave It To Beaver type. Lots of homeless, street people, and freaks! It is fun to see all the Holloywod stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabrielleM412
40,Hollywood Blvd!!!!!,"Have been waiting to visit this place for a long time, finally got a chance in this April. Specially the area close to Dolby Theater is very happening and fun to spend some time. Though you will find the star sign up to several blocks from the main point, but not all areas are perfectly maintained or clean. Some areas definitively need some improvement. For parking, park at Hollywood & Highland mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanzir26
50,Walking around Hollywood Blvd!,Wow! This is the real place to visit if you want to find a fantastic job as an actress/actor or artist. It is so much fun!I really enjoyed meeting all kinds of fun characters coming to life on Hollywood Blvd while walking around with friends one evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSchwartz1
30,Simply a walk way,"It didn't impressed me. It is a long walkway with stars praising famous people. Well, ok, we can remember some of our idols, but some places were dirty and surrounded by older buildings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guga19
30,Place to visit for star struck fans.,"The area has improved, if you wish to see names of stars in the side-walk, this is the place and people watch. Very similar to Grumman's Chinese Theater, names with their hand prints, not much more than that. Go stroll through Rodeo Drive shopping district instead, you might see stars in person shopping which will be more of an experience for star struck visitors.Most locals do not frequent this area, only when out of town visitors benefit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bento2744

30,"Fun to visit, not much to see.",It's a rather dirty area. Full or tattoo shops and souvenir shops. expensive to park but fun to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josienpaul
20,Historic sight in an area not well kept,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame si thrilling for tourists, and I actually do recommend it to first timers. However, it is really a shame that this area of Hollywood is very downtrodden, with lots of bums, very dirty streets, peddlers, closed down and run down storefronts. And the worst part to me is the sheer numbers of dressed up characters (Elmo, Darth Vader, Iron Man, Jack Sparrow, etc.). They trick you into taking a picture with them, and then force you to pay them a hefty fee for doing so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhillyBilly24198
40,Hollywood Tradition,"The stars on Hollywood Blvd. are kind of cool. There is no other place that honors the history of motion pictures like Hollywood. The stars on the sidewalks are dedicated to movie stars, directors, producers, etc... The stars go for a couple miles along Hollywood Blvd. past great old Hollywood movie theaters, restaurants and tourist shops. While looking at the stars, don't miss the hand and foot prints in cement at the Chinese Theater. There are lots of various kinds of restaurants along the blvd. and plenty of parking in lots and along the streets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanmhersh

30,The Hollywood Walk of Fame,"What resident of Los Angeles has not taken visitors to Hollywood, in particular Hollywood Boulevard and its ""Walk of Shame,"" as some refer to its star-studded sidewalk role call of the famous and not so famous. Who doesn't walk down the street mumbling, under one's breath, ""I know who that was"" or ""I remember this one."" It's a common, if private, diversion, if you happen to be walking down that street. When I was young I had a job handing out free tickets to ""The Dating Game"" on Hollywood Boulevard. I'd tell people the famous people were buried below their stars, but straight up and down due to the limited space. People continue to arrive in droves to catch a glimpse of someone famous, to sit in restaurant booths where maybe their favorite icons of the silver screen once sat; to gawk at their houses, at least the ones that tour guides say they are from the bus microphones. It's cheesy and tacky, but let's face it, it's a must-do experience if you've never been here. So off we all go in a car full of our relatives visiting from Kansas or wherever to show them the capital of tin, to the Chinese Theater (who knows who owns it this year) where the famous footprints and handprints are fossilized in cement. I once brought visitors from Amsterdam to Musso and Frank Restaurant, the oldest and most famous on Hollywood Boulevard, and they ended up getting their pictures taken with Johnny Depp. So go figure. I gave this ""attraction"" three stars not because it deserved it, really, but because it should deserve it. Come on, it's Hollywood Boulevard!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/205PeterH
40,Interesting.,I always go a night there's alot more to look at. I have a great time just hanging out people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gotgodonmyside51
30,It's what you wnated but some things you didn't sign up for...,"There is only one Hollywood Blvd and I won't say it's not worth the visit, particularly to people who adore celebrities. But I would only do it once if I were a tourist. Very crowded, lots of homeless people and people who are, to put it kindly, part of the drug culture, transvestites, runaway kids, and tons of shops selling cheap garbage at a mark-up because it's Hollywood Blvd. Also don't forget that some people ""relieve themselves"" here and there in Hollywood.Having said that, if you can tolerate that and ignore it, and if you can maintain good security of your vehicle and possessions, you will enjoy it. There are some interesting shops, people and sights to see.MY ADVICE: Treat it as incidental to your trip as there are some things to see in Hollywood, notably the Dolby theater center and other tourist traps. If you are not from around here and want to know about celebrities, do the TMZ bus tour, they know what they are doing (if you like that sort of thing). Last word: California has a hell of a lot more to offer than downtown Hollywood, but it's okay for what it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P7256SDmichaelg
40,Must see,This is a must see at least once in your life time. It's fun to see the different actors and actresses hand or foot prints. There are a lot of weirdos that are quite entertaining!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinamcneely
30,"Meet the ""Stars"" on the Walk of Fame","The once glamorous Hollywood has taken a sharp turn down hill in terms of glamour.However, the stars representing the most glamorous in history are still available to thevisitor. Many of the imprints also include ""hands"" and ""feet"" imprints as well... that wasa lot more interesting to me. Get ready for the ""live action figures"" to pose with for apicture and a quick glance at the Dolby Theatre... where the Academy Awards areheld. All in All it is an adventure and although not glamorous, still interesting to view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardL624
40,When you wish upon a star,"There are over 1000 stars of the movies and the recording industry recognised along Hollywood boulevard. If you're old enough, you'll recognise all of them, however there's bound to be some that will bring back memories of the movies you love.You can spend as much time as you like, as part of your overall trip to experience Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/328gregm
40,Spend an hour getting a Hollywood vibe,"About 50 years ago, Hollywood and Vine was a really cool and very famous place. That's history. What is still cool, however, is seeing how many of the ""stars"" from multiple generations you recognize and remember. It's a great way to spend an hour, but focus your attention on the sidewalk, not on the boring, touristy stores and fast food places. What makes it fun is that the celebrity stars aren't grouped, so you're as likely to see someone very famous from the 50s or 60s right next to someone very contemporary. Same with the hand-and-foot prints at the Chinese Theater. A fun place for a stroll and some fresh air. MUCH better shopping and dining a short way away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760AndreaG
20,"Touristy, dirty, and over-rated","The only people who actually ""visit"" the Hollywood ""walk of fame"" are naïve tourists. There is nothing special about this street. You won't see anybody or anything ""famous"" on this sidewalk. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is really just a cliché. It is not what LA or what Hollywood is all about. It is, however, pretty dirty. The restaurants are overpriced. The parking is both expensive and hard to find. You are sure to get a ticket if you park in the wrong place, even for a minute. There are lots of LAPD cars cruising the street -- which is never a good sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909alanc

30,Interesting but dirty and seedy,"This is not a nice part of town; there are homeless people, drunks, panhandlers, tons of tourists, and only a few locals. But it's nice to at least once visit your favorite stars' star and handprints of celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, the Star Wars cast, old time movie stars, etc. It's always crowded and there are lots of people dressed up as different characters you can pay to get a photo with. Watch your pockets and purse, be aware of your surroundings, and be extra careful at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marierm

10,underwhelming,"though they've tried to clean up the hollywood strip in recent years, I remember my first visit to the walk of fame was an underwhelming one. A tourist trap in the worst sense of the word. Unless you have a star whose handprints you'd like to see or star you want to be photographed with, I would skip this attraction in LA. A drive by will cover it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAjessitravels
10,Lower your expectations,"This is a dirty and kitschy part of LA that has gotten a lot really excellent PR but is not worth the effort. To start with, as with everything west of Downtown, the traffic is atrocious. So, expect to battle 45m of traffic to go the 7 or so miles north from the 10 that it will take to reach overpriced and overfilled parking lots so you can stroll up and down dirty, crowded streets. Once there, expect to be jostled and have to dodge crowds in order to even look down at the sidewalk where everyone walks across the stars. This is in no way a reflection of the positive parts of the industry that has fueled LA for a century, it is filled with sleazy shops, mediocre restaurants, and the sort of people that make you hold your purse and children in a death grip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielaA279
40,Kitsch touristy stop which is a must for all first-time visitors,"I hesitate to call this attraction excellent, but, it is one of those 'must-do' attractions if you are visiting LA. Hollywood is much nicer than it is used to be, and much safer nowadays as well. You can walk around and find stars that you know (confession: I have not heard of many of these people, must be before my time). Be sure to help out a struggling actor and spend a few bucks getting your pic taken with some dressed up character, buy a Made-in-China souvenir and peruse the local restaraunts. Not a bad afternoon for a tourist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhiteCollarNomad44
10,Walk through a sewer of humanity,"If rubbing shoulders with the dregs of humanity is your idea of fun, don't miss Hollywood Blvd. I went to a theater for a play recently and the 3 or 4 block walk from the parking lot - 7:30 to the theater, 10:30 back to the car - was an adventure of being bumped, jostled, stepped on and rubbing the underside of humanity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BIigBen
20,Reminiscent of Times Square in the 90s,"Very crowded, very noisy, and very touristy. Yes, there are the stars to look at, but otherwise there's a mall, junk stores, and low quality restaurants. Lots of people in costume trying to get you to take pictures with them. Reminds me of what Times Square used to be like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellej869
30,Something you Should See Once,"I hadn't been here since I was a kid, so we decided to take our teens here on a recent trip to Los Angeles since it's only a 10 minute drive from the Burbank/Universal Studios area. Graumans' Chinese Theater is fun to see with all the hand and foot prints. Walk of Fame not as impressive. This is a grimy area and really not a lot to do. The Kodak Theater shopping area was really nice and girls liked the Forever 21 there. But there's a lot of weirdos on the street and all the people dressed up as celebrities and super heros who want $5 for a photo with them. We really only spent a total of about 45 minutes here, not including our lunch at the ca. Pizza Kitchen in the mall. I would not go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DL9022
30,Not what I expected,"Not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. Hollywood Boulevard is really just a dirty strip with lots of tacky stores. No restaurants, but a few fast found joints. While spotting names that you recognize on the sidewalk stars is initially pretty cool, it quickly loses its novelty. Of all the places we visited during our two-week trip to California, Hollywood Boulevard was the most disappointing. We really could have skipped this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lost175lbs
30,Just Okay,"See the stars, but that's about it. The Dolby Theater is right there where they do the Oscars and Jimmy Kimmel films across the street. There is kind of a mall area where the Dolby is. You can do 1/2 tours on Saturday, but we missed it since they stop at 1pm on Saturday. It's nice to stop if you are passing through, although we paid $25 to park in a lot a street behind. Not many places to park at all, so be careful if you plan to only stop for less than an hour as we did. A bit seedy, a bunch of characters such as sponge bob and spiderman will charge you if you want a photo with them. Many people selling CD's, shoving them in your face on the street corner. Kind of LA's version of Time Square in NYC.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curley888
30,Ok,Not very impressive but one of the things that you feel you must do to complete your visit to Hollywood. It's busy and bustling and you are liable to get pushed out of the way if you stop too long to look at a particular 'star'.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParqueTropical
20,tad trashy and not the real Hollywood,"Disappointed! Be prepared to get hustled by some of the best Hollywood actors. Everyone is the next big rapper about to break with a ""free CD"".

30,Depends upon you,"You may totally love or hate this attraction... The walk of fame defines Hollywood Boulevard.. so for fans its surly an exciting attraction.. I was looking for the STARS of my favorite stars of hollywood- though gave up looking for everyone due to reasons below.Like many other places in LA and Santa Monica beach area, the place is very crowded (to the point of being festive during weekends and holidays). This also means abundant over enthusiastic tourists, homeless and 'shady' people to bump into (or get stepped on or pushed off).The Kodak Theatre and Chinese Theatre is right on the other side of the road.Honestly I like the whole place better on TV events like Oscars and stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmbienceB
40,Tip for the ones who don't like crowds:),"I have decided to wake up early in the morning on a work day,missed the breakfast,found the exact place where I would go(the stars or the prints) and it was fantastic. It was in April but I guess it's less crowded than in the evening. I could take my pictures, no one was bothering... Give it a try if you don't want to fight over stars and have strange people on your pictures:))",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelab797
40,Must See,"The Hollywood stars on Hollywood Boulevard are a must see when in Los Angeles. There are thousands of stars going for a few miles up and down the main Boulevard, however we were in LA during Oscars week so some of the stars were covered up becuase of the Boulevard being closed for the ceremony, but we still managed to see all our favourite actors stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darren1702
50,"must see, but..","This is so cool to finally see this. Although, man, who knew that it would be such a MADHOUSE! There are so many people shoving CDs in your face, and then asking for a donation, or people shoving brochures and other things at you that it takes a lot of the fun out of things. Anything goes here, obviously.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottyG777
50,Classic attraction - now way better,"If you are visiting LA, you have to visit the Walk of Fame and the TCL Chinese Theatre (formerly Grauman's Chinese Theatre) home of the Star's footprints and handprints.You will also be rewarded by visiting old Hollywood with its amazing architecture.Previously, in the 80s and 90s, Hollywood was a miserably run down, somewhat dangerous area. It has undergone an amazing renovation and is now a vibrant, exciting place to visit.There are over 2000 Stars on the Walk of Fame which covers not only Hollywood Boulevard but also Vine Street. There doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to the locations of the Stars, so if you really want to see someone's Star, I recommend you research its location prior to hitting the Walk. During my last visit I only accidently ran across the Beatle's stars. Their Stars are actually at 17500 Vine Street, not Hollywood Boulevard.It's fascinating to see who has been given a Star. For example, would you believe that Judge Judy has a Star. What you may not know is that obtaining a Star on the Walk is difficult, with the recipient having to satisfy many criteria.And trying to remember why you know someone's name on a Star will take you on an amazing trip down memory lane.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IBenevolentDictatorI
10,Seedy and overcrowded,"I spent a total of about 30mins in the area and couldn't get out of their fast enough! The entire area was seedy and overcrowded. The constant on-selling made me angry, you can't walk 5 steps without someone trying to sell you something and the ""characters"" are annoying and you do have to pay them to get photos and why would you want to anyway?? I don't really understand the concept. I would have really liked to have spent some time looking at the actual stars on the footpath but you can't, the area is so packed with people you can barely move anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/galaga_girl
40,Definitely worth the walk!,"it's surprising how long the walk of fame actually is, but its so worth it! I had a lot of fun recognising people/bands/characters on there. I was lucky when I went as it wasn't really busy. Also, you can get maps or look on the internet to find certain stars - the stars go down streets off the main walkway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beccib186402
40,Walk with the stars !!,"Must be lot of history for hollywood.. people get excited when they locate their favorite stars among hundreds of tiles with golden embossings of the holly star names. Found sylvester, mike jackson, disney, manroe !! You can reward yourself with an Oscar from one of the souvenir stores",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hemanth2k
20,Scummy and full of tourist-predators,"It's not glamorous at all down the Walk of Fame. It's really quite the opposite. The streets are pretty dirty and when I took a picture of the Johnny Depp star I noticed a stream of water on the pavement, I followed it up to the wall where I realised it was urine.When you walk near the Chinese theatre you are pestered for pictures to be taken with poor imitations of movie characters - then they have the nerve to ask for money and complain if you don't give enough!!The most annoying were the wannabe-rappers who ""give"" their CD to you, then call you back saying ""Oh just let me sign it for you"" and then finish with ""I work really hard and I would appreciate ANYTHING you can give me"" - then if you offer $3 they complain and say $10. The cheek! No chance did I give them $10!Anyway once you get away from that area you're pestered by tour agents asking if you want to go see the sign and movie star homes. Even if you're not interested they try to convince you that you are.Overall, this area was pretty nasty looking, scabby. My wife and I didn't feel particularly safe from some of the unsavoury people there. We're glad we got out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JazzJPH
40,A True Walk Down Memory Lane,there is no doubt that The Walk of Fame is more interesting for an older person who knows who some of the stars were/are. It is good to be reminded of some of the stars you may have forgotten. There are people who want to hand you things and offfer tours but none were too pushy. It was good to do the walk with an 11 year old who was interested in knowing about some of the old stars and there were enough newer ones for him to remain interested.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/973russellc
40,Walked the walk twice,Visted los angeles for a week just arrived home to the uk. Hollywood blvd is a good place to see but you get fed up of being offered the tours when you have already taken one.and one tour operator even offered me to purchase kush from him I imagine that's a form of cannabis in the uk. And the fellas handing you c.ds then wanting money for them.I told them I don't listen to gangster rap and they still passist to trying to con money from you.all in all its worth seeing the stars but keep your wits about you as con_men will be in your wallet.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/997nathans
50,Still Seeing Stars,"We had so much fun in the few blocks that we strolled along Hollywood Blvd (there is a parking deck by the Chinese theater). It was well worth our ""pick up and go"" road trip from our vacation in Vegas. I wish we had had more time to do a bus tour (and they are out there hustling to give you one), because we were transporting ourselves to some of the sights/landmarks and getting lost, and the LA drivers show no mercy. Good times!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andAwayIGo
10,One of the great disappointments.,A tacky area full of down market souvenir stores and struggling actors dressed as super heroes.Just awful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnlmoore
40,The Hollywood Experience,"Yes, there is a lot of hustle and bustle, but what would you expect. This is a very popular attraction for good reason. It is fun to go on a hunt for your favorite celebrities. With the help of the internet, it is even easier to find them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/389billk
30,Good place to vist at night,it was an OK place to visit at night with friends and family. It was kinda small walk and it took us 10-15 minutes to finish it. There are lots of shops there but I will not recommend trying them (overpriced).Overall good place to vist for first timers in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/393AbdullahA
30,just like a carnival,"the place is bustling with tourist, lots of them when many characters are all line up in the .busy side streets,few in the morning, lots of them in the afternoon, and plenty on weekends... kids and adults enjoyed the colorful scenario.. ok . the place is festive, but quite apprehensive about taking pictures because of an incident about tourist who took a picture of a bum out there previously , so i kept my cam.anyway, a visit to LA would not be complete, without visiting this place. btw. if you want to have a picture with your favorite character, they charge a dollar for one shot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/711rose
20,Not Impressed,"We were very excited to see the Walk of Fame on our first trip to Hollywood, but, honestly we were not impressed. The entire area is very run down and a little bit sketchy. There are a lot of impersonators in costume who will come right up to you and try to get you to take a picture with them (for a tip). As you pass go down further past the Chinese theater, the area becomes even run down and scary. Also, be prepared for the many people who will come right up to your face and ask you to take a tour! They are everywhere!Overall, not worth the time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caribby96
50,Busy but must do,"With all the tourists and spiderman impersonators its busy. Be sure to grab a map in your hotel lobby. For everyone with a star the house number were the star is located is mentioned. If you want to see just some special stars make your route first, this saves time and searching in between all the others. Parking (valet) is $10 on Orange st.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jlove1982
50,A free must see!,"I mean... This is really one of those must see touristy places when in LA. And it's free!!I suggest parking in the garage under the Hollywood and Highland mall. If you go to any of the stores in the general area, make sure to get your ticket validated and its only $2! The whole thing is quite long, so I suggest checking online for a specific star if you really want to see it. And it all kind of runs together after awhile though. Make you sure you look up a lot too, as people will stop to take pictures, and everyone else is also looking down instead of up.The hand and footprints are in front of the Chinese theatre, and if you ""tip"" the performers there, they will let you take a picture. Just be nice when your taking pictures and make sure your not getting in anyone else's picture as well (like when taking a pic of the theatre itself make sure the person behind isn't getting a photo of your feet) just be considerate. Also don't take any ""free samples"" like CDs or anything, they'll ask you to ""tip"" too. There's tons of shops around, the wax museum, jimmy Kimmel, the Disney/Ghirardelli store. Any of these places will validate parking as well. You can take a long or short stroll and take as much or little time as you like. It's fun and a great little stop on your trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iagomega

30,See It!,"First of all, it's free. It is a must see just once. Some areas are more crowded than other areas but it was enjoyable to walk the Walk of Fame. We were disappointed in how unmaintained the sidewalk was. There was lots of cracks and such and since it IS Hollywood and the Walk of Fame we expected it to be well maintained. There are over 2000 stars so if you are looking for a certain star then check online for the location. Many stars still do not have a name so it will be interesting to see who gets the next one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judy177
50,Free! FreshAir! and Famous People!,"First of all it's free and EVERYONE will find a star or an entertainer they love!

30,Over rated - but a must do,"Visited the boulevard couple of days before the Oscars so some of the road was closed off in preparation (didn't go back for the Oscar night) and found the experience not all it's made out to be.The section of the boulevard that is of any interest is about 200 meters long and the only thing of any real interest is the names on walkway. There are people dressed up as various actors and some of them are really good and in the 'role'. We took some photos, and yes tipped them as well, and stood out side the Chinese theater, took photos but not much else of interest. There are plenty of eateries and shopping to do but only along that 200 meter stretch.One visit is enough. Unless you plan do shopping 1 hour is enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abdul7829
20,"Check-the-box activity: was kind of dreading it, but wasn't so bad","Was kind of dreading this visit to Hollywood Boulevard, but then again, I knew we'd need to ""check it off the list"" to say we'd done it while there. I knew it would most definitely not be a highlight of our visit, so I allocated about 1 hour there just to say we'd done it. We LUCKED OUT completely, as we were there just at the end of the Marathon so although it was a pain trying to find parking due to the street closures, it was was most excellent being on the Boulevard when it was pretty closed and quiet as they were just waiting to clean up after the last runners. We walked down the Boulevard, saw a few stars on the ground (big whoop, not really of interest to most of us, though my husband seemed to be more impressed by names he recognized), took the pre-requisite picture of the Chinese Theatre and the Dolby Theatre, agreed to pose for a photo with one of the impersonators (yes, we tipped them, we knew that going in) -- some of them were truly pathetic, by the way -- took a brief walk around the Hollywood and Highland Center and went up to the observation deck to take a picture of the Hollywood sign (we were hiking up the Hollyridge Trail later that day to get a better view, so we didn't obsess too much about seeing the sign from the Center), and went back to our car. Done, checked the list, got the photos to prove it, don't see a reason to need to go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clamc40
20,Long walk little reward,We decided to take the walk of fame because we had heard about it and never seen it. We discovered that they are just stars on the sidewalk with a name and a small plaque in it...there is really nothing remarkable about them. They are repetitive. If you walk far you see some of the names repeat. It does not get you closer to fame. The old theaters and the new shopping areas are attractions worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loren778899
50,Fun Experience to Capoff a Visit to LA!,"For over a decade we have traveled to LA for business, combining pleasure and family in Orange County. We just returned from LA a few days ago. This time I had added/deleted sites in LA. Oddly, my only experience of the Hollywood Walk of Fame was a ""drive by in the car"" with a light rain a couple of years ago. So, this time I was determined to ""go to Hollywood."" My husband was lukewarm.So, from my experiences with LA and the surrounding areas, the Hollywood Walk of Fame is more appreciated after seeing the surrounding areas first. Even on this trip we went to the Walk of Fame on our last day as we were leaving Beverly Hills and traveling to the airport. The advantage: after you've been to the beach, the Santa Monica Pier, Malibu, Manhattan Beach (one of my favorites), Rodeo Drive (for people/car watching), Disneyland, Universal Studios, and so many more...the Hollywood Walk of Fame is really one of the few truly ""historical sites"" to see in this area. I photograph everything and I was camera-ready for this one.The day before we visited Melrose Drive (about 3 blocks south of Hollywood Boulevard) for great Hollywood Shopping (including vintage shopping), outdoor cafe dining and a great Hollywood experience. I saved the Walk of Fame for the last experience of this trip because I didn't want to set unrealistic expectations. I didn't expect a thrilling experience so I took my purse, my camera and we were ready to walk.Even my husband enjoyed the walk and seeing the 'stars' on the Walk of Fame. On this Sunday afternoon, there were a few asking for money, a couple of vendors selling tours and there was food. We didn't see any trash and we weren't bothered or concerned about anything. We stopped and had lunch in one of the many restaurants and I found great pretzels for the flight home. Parking on a side street is a must. I discovered Hollywood High School is 1 block south of Hollywood Boulevard - due south of Graman's Chinese Theatre so I got a photograph of this school where so many kids of celebrities had attended high school. So, wait until you've seen the other famous attractions in the LA area, go on a non-peak day (Sunday was surprising for an off-peak time), park on a side street (across the street from Hollywood High School) and take photos of the 'stars.' This was unexpectedly relaxing, fun and a low pressure way to end this LA trip. After more than a decade, it was well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA
20,Underwhelming,This place was crowded and underwhelming. I thought I would enjoy it more than I did. I was not impressed by seeing the stars on the walk of fame (or the Chinese Theater). There are lots of actor impersonators trying to get you to take your photo with them (for money). I did not really enjoy this part of my visit to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmyMPLS
50,An entertaining way to stretch your legs!,"Yes. It's just a busy street loaded with hustlers, the occasional magnificent old building, a surprise of brilliant graffiti here and there, and dirt and trash and people hard on their luck. But I found it thrilling to look down and recognize the names of people I have known and valued. For a movie junkie like me, it was great fun walking along, looking up to see the Hollywood sign on the hillside, looking down and reading the stars. It's not a ride at Disneyland--just a fun walk through time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Umbeijo
40,Must see!,It was great to see all the stars. Before going I would recommend taking a look to see where all the celebrities stars are located. Easier to determine which ones you want to take pictures of and really want to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/177janinec

It is a scummy area , there are a few OK shops but a word of warning you will be harassed nearly every step by rappers trying to hand out CDs , Homeless people asking for money and Questionable characters dressed up as famous characters and NEVER accept their offer of having a photo with them without expecting to pay we watched people be followed saying "" it's not free"" after taking their picture and avoid the Mr Muscle and Captin America characters like the plague , Also the weirdos saying ""take a tour today , take a tour today "" and do not reply if they ask you where you are from because then they really don't leave you alone we were followed for one block by some guy telling us "" your in California lighten up , take our tour .. God why don't you guys smile "" annoying as hell ! Still go if it's on your bucket list or to say you have been there if you really want to go but seriously if have better things to do then do them !! And do not walk down it after around 9.30pm even the staff at our hotel and the local cafés said it's not safe after then !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amygrimm88
40,A Must!,"This is a ""Must do"" when you visit Los Angeles, you can see the historic celebrities' stars, I recommend to locate your favorite celebrities before you go to walk of fame, that will save you some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ingenierosaurio
30,Nothing spectacular here,"There is nothing unique about this place. The walk of fame is stretched for miles however you will find most of the people near the Chinese Theater area. If you are coming here and are looking for a specific person's name, then you can look it up on the web for the location where you can spot it. We got our picture taken with Mohammed Ali's sign. His is the only one which is not on the walkway but on the wall.There is parking available on the nearby streets for a reasonable amount. There are also parking garages available for $10 or so",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smhr
30,something ot see ONCE,"Very touristy, junky and seedy. What I expected. Many homeless folks and foreign tourists Do not need to go again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janye7
30,Got to see it if in LA,"Yes it is tatty and not very well kept. The Graumont ,El Capitan theatres are magic. we also did the star gazing tour with Star Line. Our guide peter was superb drove all around Beverly Hills and rodeo drive. We travelled there with the Metro easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/234Joost234
30,Stars of yesteryear and now ...,Not as exciting as I thought it would be and seemingly no rhyme or reason in whose star lies along another's. Go there to say you've been there and move on...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Libralaw
30,Definitely not glamorous!,"Ya know how Hollywood looks sparkly and enchanting on TV? Well... when you're actually on the strip, looking at trash lined streets, souvenir shacks, dirty snack shops, and the faint smell of urine and hot dogs hangs in the air, you gotta wonder if you're in the right place! The Walk of Fame is something you should do, cross off your list, and never do again. I'm glad I touched Marilyn Monroe's hand print in the cement, took a photo of Barry Manilow's star, and saw the gorgeous theaters that host some glitzy premiers. But... I never want to go again. I don't like being hassled in the street by people dressed in ragged Minnie Mouse costumes, shop owners hawking from doorways, or ""pre- famous"" artists shoving CD's into my purse and demanding money. So, if you're like me and find these things bothersome, get Hollywood out of your system and go once to appreciate the talent that has walked that Blvd. Then get the heck outta there and tour some of the finer parts of sunny CA- See the the Hollywood sign, go to Santa Monica Pier, or walk along balmy Malibu Beach. These areas showcase what CA truly has to offer! And if you wind up on the strip, tell Minnie Mouse to get some serious rehab! ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JodieE543
30,Nice but simple,It is a walk that takes 15 min to see. If you don't pay attention you will pass through it without notice. Find the names you want to take a picture and that is it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gmiura
50,Loved it but very spaced out,Both of us being big Hollywood nuts we loved this attraction just walking along the Walk of Fame was awesome.Knowing that these stars had unveiled their stars over the years and finding all our favourite celebs was good. Only down point was some of the Stars were a little run down and some of the Best and Biggest Stars were in out of sight places compared to lesser known celebs who were in the main part of Hollywood Blvd.Would recommend this to anyone visiting Hollywood and stay at either Loews Hollywood or Roosevelt Hotel both were great hotels with great service.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrPaparazzi81

30,Slippery when wet,"Probably my most notable experience on the Walk of fame is almost falling over with a coffee in my hand. The pavement is extremely slippery after rain, so take good care.

20,Not what I expected.,I was surprised to be told that the 'stars' meetin the criteria purchased thier own star and continued to pay for its upkeep. We went 2 days pre oscars and the place was full of scaffolds and tv crews. It was full of touts dressed in superhero costumes pushing you to have a picture taken with them and they are not polite when you refuse!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scozziegirl
20,just another mark on your my map,"From one side it is the must visit for all tourists. However, from other side, what do you see there? Yes, just stars on asphalt and crowds of torists, mendicants, tours sellers, batmen to make a photo, etc. For me it was another mark on my travel map, unfortunately nothing more",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OldMoscower
50,A Must See !,This is classic Hollywood people. If you go to L.A. you have to walk the walk. Find your favorite entertainers star. see famous personality look alikes.. absorb the atmosphere... Manns Chinese Theater and a really cool hidden treasure if you go up the stairs and search around a bit--you will find something only found in D.T Hollywood !! One word of advice: watch where you step. you may have to avoid a pile of vomit or human poop in the middle of the sidewalk !!..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R2432YVlisab
30,Looks much cooler on TV,"I've been here a couple of times, but I remember what I thought when I first visited:""This is it???""Seriously. I used to see this place on TV all the time and in photos and grew excited to see it. But when I actually went, I was disappointed. It's not as exciting as it looks when watching red carpet events on television. It's also on the dirty side.For those who really want to take photos with names of stars they know and/or hand/foot prints of celebrities in front of the Grauman's Chinese Theater, this is a place to see. Just don't hold any high expectations, or disappointment will follow.For the most part there's some sort of life in the area. It's rarely dead, although there have been times where there have been less people dressed up in costumes. (Those want photos of these guys or with these guys must provide tips. The characters turn to the side when they're not entertaining tippers so it's hard to get a good photograph of them.) There are also people that dance to music out of their boom boxes and they tend to draw crowds.Lots of people will approach passersby to offer ""free"" CDs. Don't take them - they'll follow you until you give them money for their music. (Unless you want to give them money, which is totally fine.)Basically, whether or not to visit the Walk of Fame depends on the reason for visiting. If it's to say you've been and to go on a scavenger hunt for stars, it is worth your time. But if you're expecting some glamorous walk, you won't miss much by eliminating this from your itinerary.Also, visitors should be prepared to fight their way through swarms of people, especially if the visit occurs in the summer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agnesc409
30,Full of Tourists,"I was so surprised at the amount of tourists on the walk of fame. We did go during the summer in all fairness but the amount of people did ruin it slightly. Also it's not as glamorous as you might think as pavements were damaged. They are also located randomly. For example The Beatles was off the track away from most of them. It just seems to be a tourist area to get you to spend your money and not much else, but you have got to do it atleast once, to say you have been there and take a few photos!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollieb519
30,Must-Visit,"The Walk of Fame was exactly what we expected when we visited in April 2010, just a bunch of stars in the sidewalk, however it really is a must-visit when you go to Hollywood! We enjoyed taking photos of our favourites, but it was quite busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsrelly
20,Obligatory Stop.,"Being in LA for the first time, I felt obligated to visit the walk of fame. Now I can say I have, and I never have to go back. First off, this was not at all what I expected. It was run down with lots of closed storefronts and full of people begging you to take tours. Certainly not for families. Walking along the street, there was a couple casually passing back and forth a joint. I was glad there were no children around. Skip this one. You won't be missing anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EB0320
20,not so much,"You think of Hollywood blvd as ""the place to be"" , but it's not. The blvd is dirty, and has no charm whatsoever. Beggars and stars lookalike will want you to pose for a photo with them, but they look like drug addicts looking for money.You go for the famous names and prints on the sidewalk, you take a picture or two. You leave. Not worth a lot of time and trouble.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophieSorel_tracy
30,Just average ..,"Well, other than the celebrity prints and stars, it is just am average sightseeing. It was crowded with tourists and big busses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mutiaw

40,Good to walk around,"Hollywood Boulevard is busy at the best of times, so you have to be prepared for the crowds when walking along. The people dressed up as movie characters are a good laugh, but can be expensive if you want a photo with them. The Walk of Fame itself is quite interesting and something that you almost have to do if you're visiting Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/328nathand
50,Never a dull moment,"Hollywood has it all! From funny characters dressed as your favorite movie stars, night clubs, bars, souvenir shops, outdoor shopping, restaurants, tourist tours and people out there doing anything to make a quick buck! You will definitely be entertained all day or all night long! Just be prepared to pay to park and if your driving up Hollywood or Sunset blvd. to there just know you will be sitting for quite some time as the traffic gets really gets congested after night fall! Although there is no fee to walk up and down the streets, there are lots of shopping and eating right at your disposal, aslo to include a fee for any pictures taken with the impersonators. Usually they already have a fee in mind so it's best to ask their price before taking the photo. This will avoid any hassles (some do them for donations at your discretion and others have a set price).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496ericas
30,"Cool but hectic, visit earlier in the morning to avoid chaos","Everyone has to go once but if you go later in the day beware of busy people, panhandling, homeless... ect. We stepped in human urine and had to avoid drunks, puke and scary people. People thrust stuff in your hands too. It was still worthwhile. We visited also early in the morning and it was perfect. Right now also they are repairing some of the walk so you may miss a big chunk of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/616savannahj
40,Movie Buff,"This was my second time visiting the Walk of Fame while in L.A. - the first back in 2008. I have to admit that Saturday afternoon is not the best time to come here, and that the first visit on a weekday early evening was a better choice.On Saturday, the entire block is a zoo. Street performers abound, and people gawking at them create lots of congestion on the sidewalk, making it difficult to get around. The street was filled with star impersonators, including Tom Cruise, Michael Jackson, Spiderman, Cruella DeVille, Batman, etc, all making themselves available for photo-ops (for a fee of course.)Add to that the python handler, and the parrots handler, and the musicians, not to mention the wax look-alike of Marilyn Monroe, and ... well, you get the picture.Having said that, we were fascinated with the cement in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre. The handprints and shoe prints, signatures and comments of A-list stars, dating back to the 1920's, are imbedded in concrete for posterity. I wasn't interested in more recent concrete etchings, but it was amazing to find Jack Benny's offering from 1941 or Dean Martin's from 1964. This few hundred square feet oozes Hollywood history, and we were thoroughly engrossed for half an hour, at least.I noticed that the most recent concrete etchings from 2013 are blotchy and difficult to read. Don't know if time improves the clarity or what makes such a big difference between the very legible ancient squares and the poor quality new ones.I thought it was pretty tacky that a hot dog vendor would be permitted to have his cart positioned over half of Mel Gibson's cement square, but when I found out who was under the wheel, it suddenly seemed appropriate.It seems that the city could do better to facilitate an enhanced experience for visitors here, since this is such an important part of Hollywood's identity. Move all the street performers to the other side of the street, for starters. And no cart vendors or kiosks within 100 feet of the entrance.If you have the opportunity to get here, don't miss this important piece of Hollywood. You can photograph at will, and if you're patient enough to wait for the right moment, even with hundreds of tourists crowding around, you can capture your favorite historical mementos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FancyFree55
30,Watch Out For Panhandlers,"Admittedly the Hollywood Walk of Fame is an obligatory tourist stop and one of those iconic places that you have to tick off on a visit to LA. The problem is, the area is dumpy and filled with panhandlers trying to get your money. Be aware of people thrusting items at you like CD's and trinkets in an attempt to get your money. I also averted a potential bag snatcher who was eyeing off my wife's handbag in the jostling crowds. If you visit here, and you will, be on guard for unsavoury characters and keep a watch on your personal possessions. If the area was cleaned up and converted into a pedestrian mall, it would be a far better environment for tourists to enjoy. As others have said, it is difficult to get photos of the stars names because the sidewalks are so overrun with pedestrians.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SydneyRoadshow
20,Nothing much,Its a sidewalk with Star names on it. One can stroll and take pictures of your favorite fans.Though its difficult to take pictures with people walking and passing by.Just do it for the sake of Hollywood .There are people dressed up like spiderman /batman etc and you can take pictures with them if you like . you need to pay them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LimReviewer
50,Walking with the Stars,"My family went to California with me in October 2013 and I just returned this month. We spent several hours in the area walking amongst the stars and there are many Stars. The accomplishments of all the entertainers is really amazing! We all had our favorites and the first trip we didn't finish them all, so I enjoyed it and wanted to walk amongst new ones this trip! Grauman's Chinese Theatre and Madame Tussaud's are a must with the Stars! You get a terrific photos of the Hollywood sign from this area too! A must see to find your favorite Star!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NonnaFerg117

30,Wanted to say I was there!,"Thought it would be cool on my list of ""done that's"" but turned out to be eh. After driving up there it took a while to find parking which cost $10 so not too shabby. Walking to the blvd and saw tons of stars facing different directions. Thought it was strange they were not the same way. Couldn't find a flyer indicating who was where but didn't really have a list of which we wanted to view. Bumped into many people wanting to sell their tour bus tours, asking for money, people praying for you, and people dressed up as celebrities. We had no idea what this was about so when Elvis and superman came back and asked for a picture we were like ok. Then they asked for a tip and we had no idea this was the norm. Gave them $2 as we didn't have cash and kept walking making sure not to have any eye contact with any others. Many were cool but we couldn't pay them. It was hard to see the stars for sure. Dunno if it go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luzsbrain
30,"A must see in Hollywood, but nothing special","When you are in LA, the Walk of Fame in Hollywood is a must see.

30,Try to Google those you want to see,"This was a cool thing to do, and I'd even call it a must! You really can't miss it while walking around Hollywood, but if you want to see someone in particular, google where they are first! It would be helpful to have a guide book or pamphlet, or if they were in a particular order, but as it is, just keep walking up one side of the street and down the other, and see who you can see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QuickWhitTravel
30,It is what it is,If you are a fan of celebrities or a serious movie buff who know your crew as well as your cast you will love this. There are also some funny star plaques for fictional characters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IOGWFH

20,Another Overrated Tourist Spot,"Very overrated and very little there to see and do. The number of tourists makes it difficult to view the walk and various stars. If there is nothing else to do, like read a book or watch TV, maybe worth a visit but you would have to be hard up for something to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Delatite18
40,Good but wouldn't say great,"If you're in Hollywood walking a small stretch of the Walk of Fame is something you really have to do. But a small stretch. They're all the same.

Most of it is not in the best part of town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BagmanNZ

But in the end I'm just happy to say I did it and quite frankly it's cool. Also, every person who knew I went to L.A. one of the first questions upon my return.... ..did u see the walk of fame?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelfanalicia
40,"One of those ""must do"" attractions","First visited the walk of fame in the early 80's and apart from more stars and the renaming of the Theatre the area is unchanged. The area was undergoing a revamp (long overdue) and a lot of the buildings towards the end of the walk were boarded up.Definitely worth a visit as everyone has their favourite movie or a TV star they can search for and take a photo of. A lot of buskers and hawkers (especially those dressed as characters wanting you to take a picture with them - for a fee). Car parking can be difficult at times we parked in a pay car parking lot just off Hollywood Blvd or alternatively walk if you are staying close by or catch public transport. You couldn't visit Los Angeles and not visit , the length of time you need will vary depending on your interest in the particular stars. An hour was sufficient before we then headed of to drive up to the Hollywood Hills to get a closer look of that other must do the ""Hollywood"" sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iitravel
50,Walk the Fame,If you are I'm LA then you definitely need to come here since this is what Los Angeles is known for. Hollywood always adds a few stars every year so you will most likely run into some new stars while you are walking around and checking these out. Walked over every star and took nearly 2 hours. Depending on how many pictures you take with each star! There are many shops and food places along the way so you can always take a break. So make sure you stop here who knows you might even run into some celebrities if you are a first timer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuestGroup
40,Of course don't miss this on your visit!,"We learned very quickly that early evening is the best time to visit for less foot traffic. During the day it is so crowded you are on top of each other and feels like you are being swept along down the sidewalk. You can""t really enjoy looking at and finding certain stars. Taking pics with the different hand and foot prints at the chinese theater is virtually impossible during the day due to the crowds. It's fun to see your own hands or feet on top of the star's and if you are fortunate to get a pic makes for a great memory. There are a lot of souvenir shops with our favorite being The Hollywood Experience. Be prepared to do a lot of walking as the stars go far down the sidewalks on both sodes of the street. Parking during the day is a nightmare. Go down the side streets and there is metered parking there and the lots you find are cheaper. Early evening you could score a parking space right on the street as we did. Visit Hollywood and Highland while you are here. There is always sometng interactive going on at no charge. Brain games were there promoting their new season and taking pics for anyone who wanted to in their mind blowing scenarios. It's a good time at no real cost so go for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bankerchic77
50,It's something everyone should do in LA,"This is something that's very popular. It's literally the sidewalk on Hollywood blvd. The parking is metered, so nothing too major there. You pretty much just park on the side of the road and start walking down Hollywood blvd and there will be lots of stars to see. There are over 2500 stars there, so it would take a while to see them all. My fiance and I just walked down a couple of blocks and then back, and along the way we saw the stars for Adam Sandler, Lassie, Bob Newhart, Art Linkletter, Billy Joel, Jackie Gleason, Ellen Degeneres, Jennifer Lopez, Steve Harvey, Apollo 11 astronauts, Elizabeth Taylor, Howie Mandel, and quite a few more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ian_and_Ivy
30,A must for tourists,"Great for a tourist who wants to walk along the stretch and gaze at all the stars as we walk. Doesn't require much more than that - it was interesting enough to read through and see the people that made history, even the oddities like cartoon characters. The unfortunate thing, however, is that you're constantly hassled by people trying to drag money out of you, by throwing CDs in your face or dressing up as dodgy-looking movie characters. For me, its easy to look past all that, but it maked my wife quite uncomfortable. So its a little spoilt by all that, but is still interesting to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wattostudios
40,"""I went there""","Be prepared for big crowds. There's so many people it becomes difficult to actually stop and admire the stars. Would recommend to do it at least once.

Highland Ave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/genxsp

40,Fun to see the stars!,"This was a must see for our visit to L.A. We were there in November which is not a busy time, but it was still quite busy and crowded. It was still fun to see the stars and take pictures. Be aware of the street vendors who try to give you their cd and expect you to pay for it.

40,Good fun!,This is a must for all LA visitors. Not that there is any specific place to visit but the location just gives you the feeling of being amongst the stars! It was entertaining also for the kids as they saw the stars on the walkways of people who they have heard about and watched in movies. The Ripley's museum is also very entertaining on Hollywood Boulevard and is something interesting to see in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NIA1011

So I couldn't look for and take pic for my own pace. and there were a lot of people who cosplayed. if you take picture with them (actually they said to everyone ""picture!! we should take picture"" or blah blah blah), they would say ""TIP!!"" to you. so you should be careful!!

Also beware the street vendors who will try and give you all types of goods, like cd's and so on, then ask for money. Some were very pushy and one followed my wife to the restrooms and would not let up until she had to be rude to him.If you have small children then do not go when it is busy. I took my 2 teenage girls and they were hard enough to keep track of.If you pick the right time then you should have a look especially if you are looking around the area at other tourist sites anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wayneb2014
30,Worth a visit - but only once,"Stopped by here with some friends on our first visit to LA. Very touristy, same as walking down the street in vegas or through Times Square. Was fun looking at the stars and taking a few pictures. There was a surprising amount and mini sausage carts all over, but hey who doesn't love a bacon wrapped hot dog?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anollmann
20,Seedy part of town,"Walked through on a Friday afternoon with my young teen child. Good thing we were mainly focused on the stars on the ground and did not have to look at the many s and m style lingerie shops, wig stores, head shops and other seedy establishments. We were bombarded with tour companies trying to get us to board very expensive buses to show us celebrity homes. It is unfortunate that there is not more of a historical preservation of the walk, most of the stars are dirty, cracking and unkept.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live2traveldaworld
20,Check it off your list....,"Walking down the sidewalk you see the magic stars in the sidewalk....but you are also besieged by vendors and the oppressive crowd. We parked in one of the parking garages nearby and were treated well....for $10.00 and a tip. This is an attraction that you need to check off your LA list and show your children, but plan to move on quickly. By the way, put your wallet in your front pocket!! I'm sure there are lots of pickpockets around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clovernookwilly
40,How to find your favourite star on the walk of fame,"The walk of fame consisted of several blocks of paved stars acknowledging the contributions of Hollywood stars (and animated characters) over the years. It was exciting to visit as we'd heard about them for many years and there they were. However, to see them properly, and to take the obligatory photos, we found it best to visit before the crowds get there at 10am. After this time, it's very difficult to see them especially outside the Dolby Theatre which gets very crowded.It would have been good to have a map or something so tell you where to find your favourite star to have a map showing where they are located. Back home, now that I have the time to think about it, I did a search online for such a guide and found something this site: www.hwof.com . It lists where to find the stars so forget the expensive crowded tours-consult this site and take yourself off earlier in the morning. A great time saving approach to this attraction.Also watch out for pick pockets in the evening. Luckily, we didn't encounter any but apparently they are there. As it's shoulder to shoulder then, I can believe it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A8635QNlisam
30,Not so special,"The Walk of Fame is marketed so much that you would over expect. We were so excited to see the stars with the star's name on it but were surprised when we were told that we were already stepping on it. And most of the time, it's hard to find the names of the starts that you wish to have pictures with because of the crowd (passerby, tourist, artist, performers and people giving out their sample CDs). And the place doesn't live by it's name because there really isn't no fame in the area :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amsai
30,"Interesting place to visit, but aware of where you are...","I have been to LA quite a few times and I had never seen the Hollywood sign or the walk of fame. We were in town for a vacation, so we had to add it to the agenda. The stars are on Hollywood and I think Vine as well.It was worth it for the experience. All of the names enshrined in the walk are amazing. Many I have never heard of, but it was still neat to see familiar names. My daughter was over excited to see Ellen's name on the walk. I soooo wish I had it on video...There are quite a few other things to visit around the walk of fame. The Chinese theatre with all the hand and foot prints (and dressed up people to take your picture with), the El Capitan theatre showing the latest movies (Disney I think), and you have a great view of the Hollywood sign at the big shopping center next to the Chinese theatre.Just be aware of a few things incase you are travelling with young ones or a more conservative group. This is a public sidewalk. It is sort of maintained, but there a some damaged stars. There are quite a few homeless in the area and asking for change is common, but I never felt unsafe. There are a lot of adult oriented clothing stores and several stores selling water bongs. There is also a medicinal marijuana dispensary and many, many sick people in the general area. If you hang out in the right place, you might start to feel better too!It is great to visit such a well known spot. Just make sure you know what you are in for...Good luck and Happy Travels!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/honeymoonin
20,Disappointment!,"We were quite excited to see the famous Walk of Fame, but we were really disappointed. We expected something more ... luxurious? There are crowds of people, bumping to each other on the street, you can barely see the brass stars on the pavement.It's extremely hard to find a parking spot (best idea is to park your car in the parking garage at Hollywood & Highland Center - only $2.00 for up to 2 hours with validation from participating shops and restaurants), everything is sooo expensive but the quality is poor (typical for touristic places). Many annoying people trying to sell you something (a trip, bottle of water, postcard) or hobos and homeless people.All the glamour and glory of Hollywood vanished from this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karolina_Berg13
20,Disappointed,"I was really excited to finally go to Hollywood and see the Walk of Fame, but I was really not impressed. You would think with all the fame and money in that area they would be able to keep that area much nicer, especially knowing it's a huge tourist attraction. But the entire Walk of Fame area was just not that nice, and you just go one street over and it's really not nice. Coming to see this ""attraction"" really isn't worth it. If you really want the LA/Hollywood experience, go more towards Beverly Hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFBaylorBear
30,Ok but not what it sounds like to be,"Interesting place to go there once because its that famous, but thats it. Its just about stars on the walkway, some areas around are not even worth to see it and some days its crowded as hell. I saw it once, thats enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juleswtal
30,CAN SAY I'VE SEEN IT NOW,"Well, you're in L.A you have to visit but can't see any point ever returning. Our driver gave us some hints prior to being let loose. Don't buy anything from the C.D guy and if you decide to take a photo with Michael Jackson, you will have to pay. Well the Chinese Theatre was hosting a Chinese Film Festival and we couldn't get anywhere near it. It was fun for a little while looking at the Stars on the pavement but don't stray too far up the street because we ran into some really interesting characters and had to turn around very quickly. The spruikers are a bit annoying but a ""no thank you"" seemed to be enough for them not to continue with their sales pitch. We were there for just over an hour, which just enough for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micha1_9
30,Ok,Cool to see the stars and the Chinese Theatre. Cleaned up some from the early 90s but still just a veneer. We parked for $20 and came back to our car to see some dudes smoking crack / weed a few spots over. Get some pictures - see the sights and then get out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMA001
30,average,"SO MANY TOURISTS. But you've gotta see it, right?You could walk for miles looking at every single star. Most are damaged i.e concrete cracked/missing and people have written their names with permanent marker (no respect eh)Full of homeless people and people trying to get money off you. Some get quite aggressive and follow you down the street.Can honestly say I'm glad i saw it but its certainly nothing special like it would seem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenna_NZ111
30,"Busy, but go to see at least once","Luckily we found parking nearby, but we were also out in California for the Rose Bowl, so LOTS of tourists. Cool to go see, find a star you want to pose with. There is a metro stop there for those who use public transportation. Lots of places to eat and Hard Rock is there. Lots of street performers as well, but remember to pay if you pose with them. You can get a great view of the Hollywood sign up in the hills behind this area while admiring the beautiful homes, BUT very narrow streets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dolittledigger
40,It is a tourist attraction,"We were there between Xmas and NYE. The whole place is crowded with tourists, extremely busy and lively. All sorts of people in costume to take pictures with. The going rate seems to be $5 for a photo session, but it is at your discretion. Some of them are more aggressive in soliciting business than others. Hollywood & Highland Mall is also worth a visit, there are lots of restaurants to choose from and good shopping. If you are looking for the hand prints of one particular star, well...good luck with that, just too many people around to do so. Great place to do people watching as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fungrc
20,"Crowded, dirty - don't go out of your way to see it",The title says it all. If staying in the area you may as well take a walk but don't go out of your way to see it unless you enjoy being jostled by people who aren't looking where they are going because they are looking down at the dirty stars on the sidewalk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronalynne
50,Looking,"We took our son there because he had never been. We all had a great time. It was News Years Eve a little crowed but that was ok,made it more fun. Their is so much to see. Went to the wax museum, a little pricey but well worth it! A lot of photos taken. We went and saw our favorite stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Had a great time, will come back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kims920
30,"Busy, but worth it at least once.","Right in front of the Chinese Theatre. We went right after Christmas. It was very busy! The hand/feet cement blocks of stars were hard to see because there were so many people. Lots of ""street performers"" - expect to pay if you want a picture taken with them.The actual walk is very long, both sides of the street on Hollywood Blvd.Expect crowds. Have patience. Go at least once to experience the location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Megnolia07
10,Miserable,"Nothing special here. The stars are ok, but tedious. Very dirty. Questionable characters dressed like famous characters. Lousy food at the Hard Rock. Spent too much time here. Had a much more fun and interesting time driving thru the Hollywood Hills, admiring the houses and views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pisces310
20,Unavoidable while here - but don't spend too much time,"Get what you expect and what you are here for: crowd crowd crowd. + Kitschy souvenirs, lousy attractions, touting people everywhere, overpriced eateries. No glitter, no glamour. Just stars and names on the pavement. Fun for the kids if they recognize a name. Everything packed on a short strip. But as mentioned: unavoidable while here...Have fun guys :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dirkaarts
30,Should do at least once,"Being a HUGE movie buff, I looked forward to seeing the walk of fame. All in all once I started walking I really only looked at the stars for a good 20 minutes before losing interest. It's definitely cool but I was sort of disappointed in it. I guess my expectations were too high. However, was still great to see the stars and i dont want to sway people from not seeing it, you should definitely walk down hollywood boulevard anyways to see the sights and sounds and by doing that you will get to see the stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cksteeve
10,Annoying People along the walk of Fame,"The walk of the stars would have been fun, had it not been for the annoying people bugging you every few steps(literally) selling maps and tours. Also, beware of the LA cops, they love giving tickets. Jaywalking will get you a ticket. Also if you park on the street, and there are NO posted signs indicating no parking you will get a ticket. We have been to LA on 3 occasions and this was the worst. Stay away from downtown. If you go to better areas, like Rodeo and Wilshire - that is safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharona53
20,Big Disapointment :(,When we headed to LA this was something I was really excited to see and do to cross off the old bucket list. To be honest it was such a letdown and a disappointment. The area is super crowded it is hard to see many of the stars as there are tourist and annoying street performers everywhere and the area is dirty. While trying to view the stars you are constantly being hustled to get on a tour or give money to the street performers (I have seen much better ones than the ones on this street).I had in my mind that there would be a map of the stars locations available but didn't see one. After about two blocks I got frustrated and lost interest. I can now say that I have seen it and done it but it is not something that I would do again or recommend as a must do to anyone visiting the area. You could use your time better else where.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KUKatie
10,Skip this attraction..,"Why this is a 'Must-see' place, I do not know. The street performers/solicitors are rude and highly aggressive. If you stray a block away from the Highland Center you are automatically walking in a shady area. If you MUST go try and go during the day, you might feel safer because I know I did not feel safe there at night. The 'stars' aren't anything special but there are some very nice stores around that a tourist may like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Colinasita
40,Nice Expereince,A nice experience to do - waling and taking the tour stop bus - double decker see a lot then get off and spend a little more time. Large crowds and many hustlers for private tour trips - be careful - stay with the know names,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephStx
30,Have to do it at least once.,"I enjoyed walking around and finding all of my favorite stars. It was decently crowded but that was to be expected. Some of the areas of the walk had cracks in the sidewalk and the stars... but that happens anywhere after a period of time. There were some interesting, seedy people a little further down the walk, as well as some interesting smells. But, overall, I thought it was fun and I think you should definitely check it out at least once in your life if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tootandtugboat
30,an ok experience,"It is very crowded and there are plenty of solicitors trying to get you go on a tour. Having said that, it is nice to go and see what the hype is about. It is interesting but I would spend more then 20 minutes here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wishwellingtons
30,pretty nice ;),"pretty nice, but nothing special... It's very crowded - you may not even see all the stars you would like. And after all - what's so special in those stars...? ;) Nice souvenir shops, though. The Disney shop is so tiny there...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christiano_10
30,More like Blackpool than I'd expected,"First time in LA and stayed in a well located motel (cheap and totally satisfactory) at one end of the Walk of Fame strip. It looks a lot cleaner/ more glamorous on the TV when the stars are being unveiled... It's totally fine as a general tourist attraction for silly photos near 'stars' etc. But actually, there are few good value, nice places to eat or sit. And many cheap tat shops - if you want a drag queen wig, here seems to be the place to head for. Suppose the same as any very touristy part of town in any city. Just because it's HOLLYWOOD! I'd expected something a bit less tacky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teaplease100
40,Don't Expect Anything Spectacular,"What you see in pictures is what you get with this area of Hollywood. There are many stars throughout this stretch of walkway, located on both sidewalks but be prepared for large crowds. There were some street vendors covering up some of the stars and a small amount of construction, which was also blocking some signs. I enjoyed the experience however it definitely was an average experience with a nice mall in the middle of the location which features a nice view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katew83
40,Trashy Hollywood at its best!,"I loved Hollywood. It is trashy in a good way. The Walk Of Fame is a must see, it does go on a bit far, it seems anyone can get a star, but to find your favorite star is a buzz,Yes it is busy and you get harassed by panhandlers but to me this was all part of its charm, tell them to back off and they do. For a couple of dollars you can have your photo taken with Michael Jackson, Spiderman and Elmo to name a few. I wanted more time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gollygirl65
40,"Low expectations, good results","I just wanted to see it to check it off the ""BTDT"" list. I wasn't expecting much. But when I got to Grauman's Chinese Theater (renamed something) and started walking along the Star Walk, I began having a fun. We didn't walk to far from the mall where we parked underground (great spot, safe, not too expensive), but we went in all directions on both sides of the street. Lots of big names, especially the older stars. Decent view of Hollywood sign for photos (with zoom lens) at the aforementioned mall. There are tons of people passing out ""discounts"" and dressed to get paid for photos with you, but I was alone with my daughter and simply said ""No, thank you"" and there was not one single problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VinoMio_NYCluv
50,Action on the road,"This is like a ""disneyland"" for big boys! A must if you are visiting LA. Is a very tourist area and is quite crowded at night, so in order to take good pictures of the stars on the floor or the Dolby- Chinese theater you better visit during the afternoon and you may also enjoy the Hollywood sign from the nearest cafe ( with sun light).Lots of atractions at a reasonable price and peolple performing , dancing, or just posing for you to tip them ( they are quite similar to Hollywood actors).Very attractive and such a welcoming air all the road long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bri2r
20,Busted up and dirty,"We expected a highly polished, clean sidewalk experience. We got harassed by bus tour guides and panhandlers. We stayed 40 steps off Hollywood blvd thinking we'd spend quite a bit of time here but wanted to get away from it after walking 2 blocks toward tcl theater. Sidewalk is broken up and dirty. SKIP this ""attraction""!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mymanimal
50,Must See for Hollywood and Los Angeles visitors,"If you're visiting Los Angeles, a visit to Hollywood and the Hollywood Walk of Fame is a must. Be prepared that it is a very tourist area with lots of people and part of the walk does not feel like its the safest area of town. If you're with a family, I'd suggest only staying within the one block of the Chinese theater area and parking in the underground parking lot below it. Be cautious of your valuables at all times. It's totally fine to venture down the street, just be aware of your surroundings and be prepared to be asked for money or see homeless laying on the stars. Area has gotten much better over the years and more construction appears that it will continue to get better as well. It's a great FREE thing to do (well other than the parking fees you'll pay)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/indyboilerboy
30,much hyped!,"nothing great about it, but the street is quite happening! You would not quite likely meet any hollywood star, but yes you can see batman, superman, etc. :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SachinA935
20,Nothing special,The walk of fame isn't really all that exciting. If you're a movie/music fan then it can be cool to see some famous names but it gets boring quickly. The area around the stars is quite seedy with people continuously hassling you to buy things. Not a great experience overall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dona167
40,Must see for new visitors,"I spent way too much time here, having a hotel nearby meant I was on this street nearly every day. Near the shopping centre the area is quite alright, further down it can get a bit dodgy. But come on, it's the Walk of Fame! So many celebrity names, try and find someone you want to get a photo with or just browse and see who you recognise. This street is in so many movies, it's really cool to see it IRL.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarijkeLondon

10,Overrated!,This is a very poor attraction. There is nothing there which is remotely intriguing. Most of the 'stars' I'd never even heard of! You feel intimidated walking up the street. I've felt safer in rough areas of New York to be honest. Parking is a rip off too. Hugely disappointed as this is not what it is hyped up to be. I'd stay away or drive through in your car if you must go,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThomC89

30,Must see but not a great place,This is a must see for first time travelers. But don't go with a lot of expectations. It is in a shady neighborhood but you do get see some famous names in Hollywood. I would suggest to just walk around for an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarega
20,Waste of time,This visit was a complete waste of time. If you are not staying in hotel in Hollywood this place does not worth driving to.We stayed for less than 5 minutes!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Majed_S
50,Great to reminisce while walking the walk,"If you're a fan of movies, television, music or radio then this is the place to be. Walk the many blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and I'm sure you'll see names you recognize - beloved performers - that will put a smile on your face. Ignore the sightseeing tour companies and you'll be fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sb1962
10,Embarrassing to the world! Place is a dump and should be avoided,I live about 40 miles south of Hollywood and its a real shame and embarrassing to the city. Brought some family that are from Ecuador and they were horrified. The number one complaint has to be the people that harrass you for your money. Some recent rules have been established to try and help this but its worthless because people still wont let you walk in peace. The city could make this a safe place and a money maker but lets it rot. Tourist should avoid this place and just get your Hollywood fix at Universal Studios.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lumerian

50,Still Fun,"I'm a local, and I still get a kick out of checking out the stars names embedded in the sidewalk on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It's just such an historical part of Hollywood. I understand the people who were a little put off by the crowds and noise. It definitely has all of that and can be unnerving if you're not used to it. Parking in Hollywood can also be tricky. I recommend parking at Hollywood & Highland and walking from there. There are also a number of parking lots off of the main Blvd. where you can park for a relatively decent price. Don't be afraid to park a little ways off and walk. It's an older city... it's going to be a little dusty and dirty in some spots, but it's safe enough if you stick to the main tourist areas. Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacquelineT611
20,I wouldn't fly here for this.,"Sure, the Walk of Fame has it's merits but walking them renders most of us clueless to the identities of the bulk of names on the stars unless you are a huge movie buff. Most of the people walking the walk are walking the Boulevard of Broken Dreams scenario and it can be quite off putting. To add to the carnival of the downtrodden theme are the barkers in front of some shops. Then there are the shady looking star map and tour hustlers who are ""legitimate"" hustlers as opposed to the hundreds of others on the make. We that live here only go there if we absolutely have to and there is good reason for that. There are only a couple of restaurants worth making the effort to go through a line of spare change artists to get in and then back to your car. If you happen to be here anyway and want to see Tinseltown's mini-Calcutta in the making, then by all means do it but don't make it the be all and end all of your trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RubenC35
20,Nothing to much,You only just need 15 minutes to check out this place nothing to much to enjoy. You should visit Kodak theater and Chines theater too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamanM_12
40,A definite must when visiting LA,The Hollywood Walk of Fame has so many stars from all ages. It's fun to seek out the stars that you like. There's a lot of restaurants and shops in the area which make it very touristy but it's a definite must.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rejsemor
10,Waaaay over-rated.,"This is an area to be avoided. In recent years they have attempted to clean it up and make it more family-friendly but really, walking down sidewalks with stars' (and some people you've never heard of) names set in tiles amid a swarm of camera clicking tourists and out-of-work waiters dressed as super heroes who demand money for taking their picture? Better to stay away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christy61
30,The Seedier Side of Hollywood,"Unless you are in the area or are dying to see this, I would avoid this area. This is a tourist trap plain and simple, and the walk itself is a huge disappointment. Like the other reviewers have stated it is a dirty, noise and crowded area this a prime stage for would be and professional pic pockets and identity thief’s. On the other hand it is a historic area if you protect yourself and overlook the other items. Warning do not stray off the beaten path while in this area and pay to park as parking enforcement is ridged in this area. The best place I have found is in the Sony Theater parking structure, if you buy something you get more free time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heumanntouch

10,Hollywood Walk of Fame,The problem with the Walk of Fame is that is has become too easy to put your name and footprints on the walk of fame without really being famous. All it takes now is money and the right connections to accomplish this.There are certain attractions that locals avoid unless they are completely star struck and this is one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palihi
30,If You're Into Movie Stars,"I'm there weekly, or more. I visit the Farmers Market in Hollywood. Glamor? Not so, Hollywood is far from a wealthy neighborhood, it houses many of the local impoverished as well as the rich; making it more of an average neighborhood. Hollywood is safe enough, just don't be frightened when you see a homeless person; most are harmless, a few are mentally ill, which is rare. The Walk itself is rather dirty, but the names are still visible. Sidewalks in the area can be crowded so watch your pockets and don't flaunt your valuables, use common sense. In a wheelchair? Possible but crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salmanal
10,A Must to Avoid,"Why people from abroad feel they have to go there is beyond explanation and belief. Something about the illusion of studios, movie stars and glamor. Instead, the reality is crowded, dirty, tacky and dangerous. Access by car is difficult and parking inconvenient. For those who absolutely must visit, take Metro Red Line, which is clean, comfortable and convenient. Beyond that, the only oases are Musso & Frank Grill, a true step-back in time, and maybe the Roosevelt. Overall, though, surely Greater LA and Southern California can show our visitors something much better. A traveler's time is valuable. Use it wisely: Go somewhere -- anywhere -- else!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fulgencio
30,Shine and Poverty,"Hollywood Walk of Fame is a place of huge contrasts. On one side you see world's famous walk with all those stars, on the other side the place is extremely dirty, noisy and you encounter a big number of hobos and wierd people of all kinds.I didn't feel comfortable in this environment enough to enjoy it properly. I had my picture with a guy in Darth Vader costume taken (I'm a huge Star Wars fan), took a couple of more photos with my favourite stars' stars and what I recommend - I visited Sweet!, a candy store right next to the Chinese Theatre which also includes Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. The look and atmosphere of that place is really beautiful and cute and staff is always helpful so I really enjoyed that!To summarize, it is definitely worth seeing as one of LA's symbols. It's nice, it's interesting but kind of uncomfortable environment if you do not really enjoy crowdy, noisy and not really clean places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matejc300
30,"Cool to see, but very crowded","We were in LA briefly & I wanted to see some of the walk of fame. It was cool to see, but parking is very limited, the sidewalks were packed & we were ""accosted"" several times by people dressed as characters (and ""Mr. Muscles"") wanting to take their pic with you for $$ or people trying to sell tours or star maps. I'm glad I saw the bit that I did, but the hustle and bustle made me a little nervous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommyinmotion
40,Historically interesting,"You will be reminded of favorite actors, singers, dancers, directors, radio personalities and producers (record and movie) just by looking down while walking along the street. If you don't know the names - pull out your smart phone and google the name - and get a lesson in Show Biz 101.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elysekomer
40,fun and interesting,This is a fun interesting place to walk along as long as you dont mind being hassled by the endless people trying to get you to go on tours etc. Find your favourite star and take the photo. I was surprised by how dirty it all was not at all like you would expect. Also a wee bit sad to see the people dressed up as spiderman and batman standing around smoking not a good look for the kids who idolise them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandy22NewZealand
30,"This is not just a walk, but the walk!","This is a must see in LA, but it's not a great place. It's just a walk, a theater and some stars on the street. The avenue is very abandoned with a lot of souvernis stores everywhere. You go there, take a picture and get out. This is what stars do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leandrim
30,Not too bad..!,"Stopped there for an hour in between our Hollywood tour and checked out some of the famous names, but it really wasn't all that spectacular. We didn’t know most of the names and took a while to find known stars for us .LOL. Heard a tourist was killed for not tipping the characters after taking photos with them a week ago.Don’t understand what’s all this big hype about it.. :O",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anunuli
30,Way too many tour sellers along the way,The walk of fame is supposed to be a tribute to people in the entertainment industry who have rightfully deserved to be recognized. Somewhere along the way others have taken something that was meant to be beautiful and turned into something ugly by being constant hawks swooping down upon you demanding that you take their tour to see the stars or your vacation won't be complete. Will I miss something simply by being left to my own devices? I feel as if I did pretty well. I saw about 5 miles of the walk of fame all on my own and without a map or a tour guide!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheArdsofSC
50,Lots of shops around,"Love to walk around and take photo, shopping, Drink & Dine. We will have lot of shops as we like to see. More food you would never be bored, more shops you would never be enough, and more attractions to find nice shot along the street... Day & Night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PiyawanJ
40,Looking for My Super Stars,"This walk takes at least 2 hours to find where my favorite actors and singers are. It's fun just looking down on the stars instead of where I am heading. Fortunately, I got some but still missed some. Many of the stars are worn because of too much passing. But this is Hollywood. I don't deny being a groovie, mentally. I am from Taiwan, and the deepdown interest in movies is inspired by Hollywood, from Clint Eastwood, the Duke, to Robert Redford. From ""My Fair Lady"" to ""Ben Hur"", from ""Gone with the Wind"" to ""You've Got Mail"". These movies and actors do influence my idea of what a culture the film industry defines. I am a diehard movie fan, as long as it is a good movie with an excellent team who makes it happen. In addition to movies, music is also part of my American heritage even if I am not American at all. However, this walk brings me back to my childhood, my teens, my early adulthood, until now as a retired English teacher. Hollywood enlightened my early stage of learning English as well as absorbing a different cultural values. Thanks to those guys whose names will be kept meaningful to others like me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neverlandalice
20,"Ugly, Dirty, Eerie!","What a Dump! I've been through ghettos that are cleaner than Hollywood! I now know why movies are so trashy ,they're being made in a run-down wasteland .Totally did not expect Hollywood to be this bad! Even the walk of fame is dirty, with lots of cracks and warping ! Also Noticed that most of the homes in the area are barricaded with barbed wired steel gates ! If you must go there stay in Beverly Hills !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/661ericg
20,Beware...,"I understood from my tour manager that this stretch is managed by ""gangs"". The have many groups of people dressed in funny costumes (that totally looks fake) and they will GRAB you to have photo with them.Once taken, they will demand USD20 per photo. IT was such a RIP OFF.So beware of grabbers, who will grab you by the waist. And watch out for your belongings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinklyn
10,Very disappointing!!,"Went for the day while on a girls trip. Was shocked and disappointed to see how dirty, smelly and disgusting the street was. Wow, absolutely nothing like how I pictured it!

So many other nice places to visit, skip this!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamhut
30,"It is a bit of fun, you have to do it, but it's just a walk.","Wife and I stayed in Hollywood in August 2013 and did the walk a number of times. The first time was actively looking at every star we crossed. There are a lot, and it really doesn't seem to mean a lot. It is a good way to see Hollywood by walking along the stars and seeing what is around, but you don't get much out of it unless you're a huge fan of Judge Judy. You will be hassled by promoters of star tours etc while you are there though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/speake53
30,Probably more special for a movie buff,"It was nice to stop there for a half hour and check out some of the famous names, but it really wasn't all that spectacular. There is nothing to do there other than look at the hand prints.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougg738
20,Do It & Go!,"I have to say that I love L,A & California - this was the ONLY part of our stay that wasn't memorable.Everyone, I mean everyone wants you to do the tour with them, it's never ending. Most accepted no for answer but one or two were more pushy - if you're adults then fine, when you have an 8yr old to watch too you suddenly become alot more nervous.When ""Spiderman & Superman"" encourage your little ones over for a photo and then demand money don't be surprised. When the car park you go into advertises its $5 and then when parked says its $15 don't be surprised. This is that sort of place.It's cheap, nasty and dirty....and like I said, this is from someone who LOVES California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CT211070
30,"Overrated, but still a must go","I imagined stars and celebrities. In reality it started as a pretty shady dirty street. The stars are like a regular pavement, nothing special. Of course, it gets much better near the Chinese theater, stars are more familiar, everything is nicer. I would say, just walk for 2-3 blocks there and you'll see the best of it. Unless you want to see all of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel-77-Kate
40,Interesting and worth it if you time it right!,"I was up very early this morning and started the Walk of Fame at maybe 7.30 a.m. There was no-one around!Yes, some of the stars are dirty. Yes, it's a long walk if you want to see everything. Yes, you'll be bored if you're not particularly into celebrities. Yes, you can spend ages finding the stars you want to see unless you google the location beforehand.But since I'm obsessed with all things Hollywood and famous, I loved every second. I found the two stars I wanted to see, so that's me happy.And yes, there will, in certain parts be people dressed up wanting to take your money. Either ignore them or make it clear you don't want to take a photo with them, it's not that bad!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieSparkles101
20,It fits for Hollywood Blvd!,"I imagine that the ""Walk of Fame"" has only significance if your being inducted, but it fits for Hollywood Blvd, full with tourist, and person's of all sorts including of course the street vendor's! In any case, it is like being at the carnival on Hollywood & Vine something to enjoy if your into people watching the entire scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateCharlie
10,Overrated is an understatement,"Went to the hollywood boulevard walk of fame to see what the fuss is all about and within about 5 minutes I had made my mind up. It was fairly tacky , very dirty and filled with people trying to take your money through lookalike impersonations.I would recommend not making a point of going here unless you're desperate to tick it off the list. The shops are fairly basic and if you walk five minutes either side of the hollywood and highland centre you get into some rough looking streets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinm219
30,Disappointing,"We booked an excursion here from Las Vegas. Tbh we were a little underwhelmed by The Walk of Fame, it was a bit tacky. Having said that we are glad we did it for the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenAaran
10,One of the many overated attractions.,"When I arrived at the Hollywood Walk of Fame, I thought ""Is that it?"". It was very underwhelming, it was just a dirty sidewalk with dodgy people around and an abundance of pushy people trying very hard to sell you tickets to the Star Homes tour. I can say I've been there and that's enough, but I would not go back and I would be recommending others to do the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiddelywinks
40,It's a Must-Do If You're Visiting L.A.,"Sure, it's just some stars in a sidewalk, but for some reason it's magical. The old Hollywood glamour is still alive here. Go prepared: it's crowded, the stars are spread out over a couple of miles, lots of walking. But once you see your favorite celebrity's star, it's all worth it. I was so excited to finally see Audrey Hepburn's star! If you look up the star locations in advance, it makes the visit go much more smoothly. If you're visiting L.A., I say you gotta go to see the Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CourtneyB445
30,So this is LA?,"It was my first visit to LA and one of the first things I did was walk down a portion of Hollywood Walk of Fame. I must watch too much TV, because I expected LA/Hollywood to look all bright shiny and clean....like on TV! Instead, it was gritty and seedy. It reminded me of Times Square before the revitalization of the area. I actually believe NYC is safer than Hollywood! The prettiness lies in the suburbs. There are some nice quiet neighborhoods within 10 minutes of downtown Hollywood - so that's what they show us on TV! I did get a few pictures of celebrity stars, including Donald Trump. I put my foot over him, while I snapped the picture - WTH was he doing there?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarleneL315
30,Once is enough,"Having seen plenty of pictures of some of our favorite actors get their star, we felt it a must see but now having seen it we do not feel compelled to ever have to go back to the Walk of Fame again. Hollywood Blvd is a congested, dirty street with touristy shops and really not very glamorous except for the Dolby Theater & some of the other theaters like Graumans (now TCL), Egyptian etc. Finding where someone's star is can be challenging since that info can cost $ !!!! If you're lucky they will give you 2!!! locations for free otherwise you have to buy the map!!! What a rip off!!!!! Best to google what you want and let your phones GPS guide you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdib
20,Looking at stars on dirty street with scary people isn't fun,"Out of state/country visitors must be very disappointed when they visit this looking for glamorous Hollywood. Everything is dirty. Lots of people doing weird things like randomly screaming. The costumed ""stars"" like batman, etc all look dirty and homeless.Even if it were cleaning looking at a star's names on the ground isn't very exciting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrkingcool
10,"Wow, a sidewalk!!!!!","That's all there is to it really...ohh, and a few very ugly buildings too! Ohh yes, you can see the names of many movie stars printed on the floors there and if you're lucky even their hand prints, and so what???LA is probably the ugliest city I have ever been to (I was justpassing through, not worth the trip) and Holliwood does not add anything to it. A waste of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unemigrato
10,Extremely over rated,"How do you like getting stabbed? Well a girl got stabbed here and murdered a few weeks ago for taking a photo of a bum that was on the main corner of the Hollywood blvd. Yep its true, we stayed at a hotel just up the rd from the walk of fame, the bums where so bad they were trying to sneak into the hotel and use the bathrooms to shoot up, my mises was sitting inside the hotel one day only to be approached by one to buy them water, the security quickly got rid of him. But they are every where. It should be called the Hollywood walk of bums. Some one needs to clean this area up quick smart as we traveled all over usa and this was by far the worst and most unsafe area we were in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoons69
20,Worth a brief visit but...,"Went there on a weekday late afternoon. It was fun to see famous names on the iconic sidewalk stars, but the enjoyment was tempered by the numerous seedy characters and the occasional low budget tour solicitors calling out as you walk down the sidewalk. There were many dressed in costume who will--in some cases aggressively--approach you to take a photo with them, then demand payment. After one photo, we gave a dollar each to one pair of characters, but one of them continued to demand $5 dollars as we walked away.Following dinner at a local restaurant, we felt uncomfortable and a bit unsafe walking the two blocks back to our hotel.Would not take younger children there as we did and we saw others do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarvel
30,"If you're in LA, ya gotta do it!","The Hollywood Walk of Fame has obviously seen better days, with large sections of the walk decrepit, with shuttered shops, and tacky souvenir sellers - however, it still makes for an interesting walk to see both stars of today, and yesterday. Keep a look out for the scam artists both those giving away ""free"" CD's and books, and others dressed up as various characters wanting you to take their picture with them- and expecting a fee afterwards. By night, the walk takes on a whole different view - with the area outside the Chinese theater filled with tourists, great food options and reasonable shopping. If you're in LA, it's certainly a must see attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilazarus
50,Hollyweird Walk of Fame,"Great place to visit old Hollywood names and places and to people watch, especially if you like the weirdos and want-to-be famous.

30,Just What You Expect,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is just what you expect it to be: stars containing the names of celebs along a walkway. Some of the stars are cracked and in need of repair. You will also find that some people have more than one star. This is because they can be placed on the Walk of Fame in more than one category. Apparently, those who wish to be on the Walk of Fame must make a request. This is then voted on by a committee and, if approved, the person must make a $30,000 ""donation"" to be included. This explains why there are some people (or fictional characters) on the Walk of Fame that make you scratch your head, while you are left wondering why certain names are missing.Along the Walk of Fame, you will find many stores, restaurants and tourist attractions. Many of the stores we came across were head shops, sex shops and costume shops. Similar to the Vegas Strip, there are also people in costume who want you to pay them so you can pose for a picture with them. There are also several people handing out demo CDs and asking for money for the CD. We didn't have a problem with anyone bugging us after we said no.We went to the Walk of Fame twice. Once in the middle of the day on a Tuesday and once in the morning and into the afternoon on a Friday. There were significantly more people there on Friday, so try to go during the week if you want to avoid the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91shannonk
30,Neat to do once,"I don't know that I would make a point of going back, but It is worth going down there to be able to scratch it off your bucket list. There is a lot to do in the area though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/958ryanh
30,Love it,"Everything was great but lots of garbage on the streets. Someone need to take care of that garbage. This place was on our list, I mean who goes to LA and not gonna visit the famous Hollywood blvd. In general we enjoyed being there we saw. I was standing on Arnold's Prints this was so exciting!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91miker
30,Interesting,"It was awesome to be able to finally walk down Hollywood blvd but it was depressing when I did. It's very dirty, the stars deserve better. There are a lot of bums and just ""ghetto"" people. We went at night and it was a nice nightlife except for the ghetto ness of it. Let's just say once you see this area that's good enough. No need to go back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stefymoni
30,Fun for about the first 30 Minutes,"The Walk of Fame is absolutely a must see in LA. However about the first 30 minutes you will have had enough. The area is dirty and not at all what I expected. It was fun to check out the different stars but after a while it gets boring. There is an army of people dressed in tacky costumes wanting to have their picture taken with you (for a fee of course) and tour operators trying to sell you a tour. The area outside the Chinese Theater with the actual handprints and signatures of celebrities is fun to see.I guess I just expected it to be more ""glitzy"" . If you do go, I would recommend going in the morning the area gets super crowded later in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448jillh
30,"Busy,but a must do","If you're going to Los Angeles then seeing the Walk of Fame is probably a must.I was staying in the area,so was here everyday.I would recommend coming early if you want any chance of looking around without all the crowds.Ultimately they are stars on the ground,so get a map if there is a particular celeb star you want to see,as it goes for many blocks,and the area is not that nice,with the exception of the epicentre at Hollywood & Highland.There's loads of lookalikes to snap a picture with,as well as Madame Tussauds and other tourist attractions in the area,like the Dolby Theatre,and Hollywood and Highland Shopping Centre,though it's just shops,nothing special.You'll get hassled endlessly to join different tour buses and groups.It's worth a look to say you saw it,but have a plan of what you want to do in the area.The McDonalds across the intersection is sketchy and depressing,and I can imagine what a dive Hollywood must have been before,even though it is improving with nice hotels and attractions.I saw Julianne Moore's star getting put in,and then again with some witches hats and a tarp covering it,it looked a bit sad really,and not that special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesssyda
40,Hollywood,"When in LA for the first time, this boulevard is a must. Although I would say I expected much more glamorous, it is still a landmark of Hollywood. Walk around the Kodak theatre, which is the nicest part. The shops around are very touristy and there is nothing there that you can't find elsewhere. At sunset, there is some street performers which makes the street a bit more lively.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lpb_38
30,Expecting More,I guess all the glamour you think you will find it is just not there... it is a dirt street with lots of people trying to sell you tours to the star's house and full of stars that I never heard about.

The best were the footprints, handprints and signatures of some true Hollywood icons- Astaire and Kelly to name the highlights for the musical lover.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NursebakerToronto
30,No Pets Allowed?,"It was a fun experience trying to match my hand/shoe prints against those of my favorite stars.

40,A bit tacky but emotional nonetheless,"Hollywood Blvd itself is a bit tawdry and tacky, however, there's something about seeing all these famous stars and thinking about the people behind them that make you emotional. There are starting to be some interesting places such as the Roosevelt Hotel and high-end latin restaurants that are taking things up a notch as well. If you love movies and the stars, it's hard not to be captured at least a little by this walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinf459
30,Better after Dark,"My daughter and I took the subway system, first to Universal Studios, then we stopped off at Hollywood Walk of Fame. The subway system was convenient. When we first got off the subway at Hollywood Blvd, I was a little nervous. I thought it was a very dirty area and not at all what I expected. We walked a while looking for the Chinese theater, not realizing it was in the opposite direction. We went into a souvenir shop, and when we came out, what a difference. It was dark out now, and it seemed that there was a party going on in the streets. There were people dressed in costumes, music, and just so many people. It all seemed very exciting and I have to say I did not feel as apprehensive as I did when I first got off the subway. It was difficult taking photos because so many people were trying to do the same thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathym532

40,A buzz for a few seconds!,Great to see the hand and foot prints of some of the rich and famous. It is in a great location just outside the Chinese Theatre and we enjoyed this part of the visit to Hollywood the most. It is a pretty quick thing to see and nothing else in Hollywood is worth hanging around for. We parked on a one hour metre and that was plenty of time to see the walk of fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedAuckland1
40,It's cool to have seen it.,"My wife and I did the tourist thing and walked a long the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was cool to have seen it. We only knew of a fraction of the stars who had a star on the walk of fame but it was still cool to see them all just the same. We did it early in the morning on a weekday so it was verily cool and wasn't very busy. It got relatively hot in the afternoon so if you're not use to that, see it in the morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jcmark97

20,Recommend as drive by activity not worth an extended visit,Worth only a short stop to take a picture of the hollywood sign at the Chinese Theatre and a pic of a few stars on the walk of fame then take off to somewhere fun like the beaches or Universal or rodeo or beverly hills. Worth a drive by stop but that's it. Jam packed with people and not particularly clean or worth it for kids... We had expected to stay for much of day but moved on fairly quickly. Everything else during trip was great! Worth a see just not a long one!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelinelU8820XM
30,Okay to kill a couple hours,"Downtown Hollywood wasn't what I expected, a little dirtier than I thought it would be there.

30,Did it Just to Say I've Done it,"I wouldn't recommend planning a whole day walking the stars. It was nice to browse around for a little while, but once you see one star you've seen them all.

30,3 1/2 mile of stars with name...thats just it!,"I must admit that a tourist in LA has to at least be on this place even for just few hours to truly say that they have been to LA. Aside from the HOLLYWOOD sign, the Walk of Fame is another landmark that can be identified with Los Angeles. But, a return trip to this place, I dont think is worth it unless theres an special event going on at NOKIA theater or JIMMY KIMMEL is throwing a free concert.

30,"Its a been there done that, wont go again - allocate an hour to see","The Walk of Fame is one of those things you have to do in Hollywood, to tick off as been there done that but personally the area is a little tacky, lots of souvenir shops, heaps of people which is to be expected, and lots of hawkers trying to sell you CD's, tours and then there are the people dressed as stars and characters for photo ops. I dragged the husband along, he hated it, but I wanted to check out a couple of the stars on the walk for the been there done that photo. Wouldnt go again but wouldnt say dont go. You probably only need to allocate an hour to this experience perhaps unless you are in to seeing stars names and like crowds.

Let me tell you, walking the hollywood walk of fame could be a boring and daunting experience, but I had a great time.Before hand i printed out a list of the names that are on the walk of fame and the approximate location of the ones I wanted to see.I then headed out. I didn't walk straight through, I would stop and look at the shops along the way, and I felt that, that helped make it not so boring.When I came across a star i liked I would get exited and take a picture.Hope you have fun!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/solotravel123

See all the people there and you feel you are YES in HOLLYWOOD",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ttecgmbh
50,something to definitely see,i tried to see as many of the hand and footprints as I could. A def must see if you visit LA. Great to put your hand where your favourite stars hand has been. :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulawDublin
30,Great to see the famous walk of fame,"Really fun to walk along Hollywood Boulevard to see the famous and not-so-famous stars! This is something to be seen. The fun in this exercise is seeing how many ""Stars"" you recognize. It's also fun to see folks stopping along the sidewalk to pose beside their idols - some actually lying on the ground mugging for the camera!! You will find that you are walking along reading about half of the names upside down because they face the other way. You realize, too, that you probably will not see all the stars on the walk but will enjoy it all the same. Just don't get some of the negative comments here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnK662
30,Don't get your hopes up,"I still think you need to do this on a trip to LA because of its fame but it doesn't live up to the Hollywood glamour at all. This is just a normal street with a number of grotty gift shops and cafes that happens to have the stars on the floor. There is really nothing glitzy about the set up and Hollywood is not a very pleasant area.The Grauman's theatre is quite a small area that gets very crowded so it can be difficult to see what you want and take photos.It is also full of street performers and people dressed up that are very imposing and always looking for money even if you have no interest in them. They will come up with their arms around you, get into your photos and then expect money. Not a very pleasant experience.I would only visit this area on a bus tour so you can get away from it as soon as you've seen the stars and theatre!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheekyface27
30,Lots of energy and characters during daytime. Fun place.,Expected more creepiness based on past reviews but it was fine. Lots of tourists and people selling tours. It was fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kurioma
50,Great for people watching!,"We knew what to expect from reading the reviews: Cheesy, crowded, sometimes gritty environment. And we were not disappointed. :) The characters on the streets are really nice but super pushy. The kids wanted to take pictures with a few of them and it was great fun. The streets are bustling and the energy is contagious. We had a super time people watching and souvenir shopping. My 10 year old was so happy to get to see and photograph her favorite celebrities stars. Can't wait to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCBosh
40,Fun,I enjoyed finding stars for the actors I have liked over the years. Many more than I had even imagined.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chessie22
30,It was ok,Worth seeing but gets very crowded and there are lots of people in costume that will get you to take photos and then expect a tip. Bit hard to navigate thru with kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SonS1975
20,Dirty and not what you imagine!,"Wow this place was scary, dirty and full of beggars! I understand it being busy as it is a tourist attraction, but it was just purely filthy. This ruined my experience there, as I also felt intimidated by the wasted beggars and didnt want to walk around. Such a shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaClowes
40,Just what you'd expect!,"Had a day trip to Hollywood from Las Vegas last week. I was really looking forward to the Walk of Fame and the Chinese Theatre, as well as the iconic Hollywood hillside sign. It was fabulous! Definetely worth seeing at least once in your lifetime, although I was surprised at how compact the space is, I was expecting a little bigger, but it was all the better, everything was closeby!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luco85
50,A Must Experience for all Hollywood Visitors!,"As they say in the theatre, lets cut to the chase! This is a required tour / walk / experience for anyone who comes to LA. It is a fun jolt of Hollywood history. If you are afraid to walk past a bit of seediness, then just drive through. Of the many people I have taken on tour / walk / drive - all of them are happy we went and most wanted to walk and locate a particular star - which can be quite a challenge sometimes! Enjoy with an open mind and just say no thank you to the parts you don't care for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleySays
10,Find something else to do,Visited with an open mind but have to say that I did not feel safe at any time here and it's not worth the hassle. Not a great place to take the kids and the hype of this attraction is way overstated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greedo1974
10,Disgusting!!,"This was in our top 5 things to do in LA and it was disgusting! Homeless people everywhere asking for money and people dressed in dirty, ripped, disgusting costumes walking up and hugging my daughter was totally unacceptable. Would never recommend taking young children to see this and I wish we never did! Tourists everywhere so trying to look at the stars was impossible let alone trying to get a photo of one!!Honestly, worst thing we did on our trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Livelivefamilytravel
30,Dont expect too much!!!!,"This is one of the main attractions of LA( as per the tourist brochures!) Each and every visitor to LA will definitely come here for an evening out at the ""Walk"". We (me and my wife) were not expecting too muc, but have over the years seen the publicity & hype the place has been potrayed in Magazines, tabloids and TV,every movie premier, awards function, celebrity night out, is from here, the Dolby theatre, the Grumans or El Capitan , all skirting the 'Walk"" . We were here in the first week of September, watched the permier of Sons of Anarchy at the Dolby theatre, the crowds were amazing and mobbed the celebrities ( we didnt recognize even one!!!) The walk itself contains 100's of ""stars"" in mosaic tiles emmbeded in the payment in tribute to their work and achievements in their respective fileds of entertainment, The most famous pavement in the world! If its early evening, you will get to see Superman, ,wonderwoman, the fantastic four, various other super heroes that I wouldnt know and of course Marilyn Munro and and older version of her further up near the shopping arcade past the Dolby. Good fun to watch people stop and have their photos taken with these 'Celebs!"".The strret performers are super, they are what make this place really tick, as you can see a 8 year old clone of MJ doing "":billy jeane"" , the most amazing breakdancing and this guy who must definitely be a NBA Pro with his basketball antics, well this was time well spent and you can walk up the stiars on the shopping arcade to have a better look at the Hollywood sign.Graumans theatre, again the pavement has imprints if many stars on the concrete pavement in front and nothing more, than a tour of the theatre itself.Many fast food joints and Buffalo wings just round the corner, so no lack of restrooms and you wont go hungry. Right time to visit, 4pm to late evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashok1954
20,Go to a theme park!,"The Hollywood walk of fame is a let down, there are too many tourists stepping all over the star you are trying to take a photo of, I found it to be nothing special. Looking back i would have preferred to spend less time here and/or go to six flags theme park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woodinnes
30,Only Need to Spend a Couple of Hours Here,"A couple of hours is all that is needed to have a look here but you should do it as it's all part of the excitement of being in Hollywood. Yes, it is a bit dirty and nothing flash but seeing your favourite star's name on the footpath is fun and there are tourists everywhere sharing the experience with you. Just politely ignore the wannabes trying to hand out CDs as they are harmless and if you want your photo taken with the people dressed as characters, just give them a dollar or two. You can pick up souvenirs from Souvenirs on Hollywood and get your photo taken with the Hollywood sign in the background if you go the Kodak Express entrance of the big shopping centre there and go up on the walkway. We enjoyed our short visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swayze073
40,Star walk,"Great to visit this vibrant boulevard. Lots happening, with street entertainment. Hard rock was brilliant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynH57
30,Not what I expected but a must do for a first time visitor.,"Found the famous Walk of Fame to be a bit boring. The entire Hollywood experience was not what I expected. There's so much hype on TV about Hollywood that I expected so much more. Was a bit disappointing. There are some great little shops along the way to buy souveniers, like Hollywood star keyrings and Oscar statues that say :Best Mom"" or ""Best Sister"" etc. You can also have your picture taken with your own star on the walk of fame for about $20. The atmosphere is great with lots of people dressed in character along the street. It's very easy to get to the Walk of Fame with the metro. It's definitely a must see for every first time visitor and great for photo opportunities however 2 to 3 hours is more than sufficient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SAtraveller2013
30,Tortured by wannabes,Tortured by wannabes dressed as movie characters pushing their CDs and calling us racist because we wouldn't take them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertaw706
10,Nothing glamorous about it!,"If you think of glitzy stars on the walk way and glamorous crowd when someone mentions the 'Hollywood walk of Fame' you could not be more wrong. Full of crazies, crowded and filthy this is nothing like the movies will have you believe. A waste of time. Save yourself the trouble and stay in your hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vjsidhu

10,Disappointing,"Don't waste your time, one of the tackiest places on the face of the planet. Felt like I was in Bangkok with street vendors trying to hock their goods and services.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adz05
40,Gotta love the Walk of Fame! So many big names :-),"Walked by here a good few times and there is always something you missed before. Everyone from Steve McQueen to John Lee Hooker is here. I even found my Dad's name on here (Different John Chambers unfortunately!) Great photo opportunities and so interesting. There will be many other people trying to get photos to so bring your patience and try to be patient with others everyone! Don't take the CDs the street vendors offer to you by the way and be careful if getting a photo with people in costume, you will be charged for both.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voodoochilled1
40,Nice!,"I was there on april and besides walking and seeing the existing stars, had the chance to see the Backstreet Boys be awarded their star. It was quite the experience. Check on the http://www.walkoffame.com/ if any cerimonies will be held while you're in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CecilSoares
30,Worth a visit.,"One thing to note: there is really a lot of ground to cover, especially if you want to see every single star! The famous (modern) celebrities tend to be clustered together near prominent buildings like the Chinese Theatre. Some of the not-so-famous celebrities are located in less glamorous areas: next to a parking lot or convenience store, for example.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnjoelseow
50,a just see,"its worth going as its an icon of LA, plus there are loads of people dressed up as famous characters from films, so take plenty of dollar bills so you can have your photos taken. the only annoying bit was people trying to sell you CD's of music, but just ignore and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hamnergirl
40,A must see in Los Angeles,"It's not very pretty, however it is an absolute must see while visiting Los Angeles. It is a lot of fun to see the stars on the sidewalk, the hand prints.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bila66
50,Great atmosphere,"Be prepared for the hustle and bustle as the walk of fame is located near lots of other attractions but is definitely worth a look.We went twice and the morning is definitely a lot quieter if you don't like crowds.In the evening it had a great atmosphere with the neon lights,street dancers and singers and people dressed up as celebrities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reneen856
20,Be ready for constant annoyance,"It was the worst spot we went to whilst in USA, constantly annoyed by people trying to sell their Music, tours, homeless asking for money, it is dirty and grotty and they need to spend the $$ to do the area up. Good to see the stars etc. but would be good without the annoyance of the locals. Stayed on the walk of fame but as soon as you walk out your hotel door you are annoyed by people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewM742
50,Must do in Hollywood,"While in Hollywood, you will eventually end up seeing this attraction , even if you don't want to. Because the stars are all over the street on the Hollywood boulevard. Just make sure you try to walk full length, as you can , as the Street experience apart from walk of Fame is also most enjoyable. it was fun finding name of our favorite stars and clicking pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharnjit_Sondh
20,Grime Not Glamour,"Going to walk Hollywood Boulevard and look at the stars seems like one of those ""must do"" things when your visiting LA. Unfortunately what you picture in your head will be much different from you experience, and not for the better. First of all it's crowded, good luck seeing the stars when your shoulder to shoulder with tourists, panhandlers, and poor celebrity impersonators (the people at ComicCon do it so much better!) The traffic in the area is bad, even by LA standards, and parking is equally bad. The area is mostly just your typical mall stores interspersed by some bad souvenir shops. The only redeeming factor is the hand/footprints in front of the Chinese theatre, besides that this is a total bust.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSpeis
30,Too crowded...,"We walked a good part of the Walk of Fame to se the stars!To be honest, it was very crowded and one felt rushed, as so many wanted to take photos with the stars. The street was very clean but again, as you have in many cities where there's a high volume of tourists, there are people trying to sell you stuff like their music CD's. Spoils the atmosphere really, but just say a firm no! People dressed as characters were fine...didn't bother having a photo as our boys were ""too big"" for that sort of thing, but be aware if you have younger children as it could cost you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blue30
40,Have fun there,"If you are a big fan of a movie star, never miss this. You will have fun to find the name of your favorite movie star. The name on this street are so shining. It's a must do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SSLOVEKK
40,Awestruck by the beauty!,"If you are going to LA and not watching Hollywood Walk of Fame is like going to NYC and not watching Times Square. Its a must watch and you get to see you favorite star's handprints and ""Star"" embedded on the footpath!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DhavalKamdar4u
40,"Lights, camera, and action!","This is a ""must-see"" when visiting LA. Yes, it's kitschy, crowded, and touristy but the signatures and names are worth it! After you are done browsing the shops and snapping pictures, you find that you are in the heart of Hollywood so go explore! There are many other attractions around like the Hollywood Wax Museum, El Capitan Theatre, The Pantages Theatre, and Hollywood & Highland. H&H is a great place to relax, eat, and people watch. From the second/third floor hallways, you can see the Hollywood sign on a clear day. Parking may get expensive, but if you park in H&H, you can get your ticket validated and it helps the cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrvlnDixie45
40,A great thing to see,A definate if you are in LA. Very touristy but we all loved pretending we were the person on the star and having our photo taken. Get there early - we were there at 8 am as we were still on English time and had been awake since 6. Sooo busy as the day gets on. Would recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/164traceyc

30,Its was ok..,"apart from the stars on the footpath theres not much to see, there are tourists everywhere to its pretty hard to stroll the street and see the stars you want, taking a photo is literally a 2 second wonder, you have to get up pretty quick so you don't get trampled on. Other than that not much in this area of hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiTraveller3101
30,Tourist trap,"Best parking spot is at Hollywood and Highland mall, buy a cup of coffee from Starbucks and tell them to validate your parking ticket so that you pay only two dollars for two hours.

50,walk of fame,On a trip back in April of 2003 I was sent to Cal.by my job. I got to see somethings on a tour but the best part was when I and my sister started to walk toward the Grauman's Chinese Theatre. I didn't get to see a lot of the Walk but there were two actors ( Elvis and Marylin Monroe). When we were walking up to them Elvis was singing and just as we got to them Elvis stopped and Marylin walked up to me ( now it is my Birthday) she started to sing Happy Birthday to me. We couldn't believe it. My sister said that could only happen to me. That just made my day even tho I didn't get to have time to walk the Walk of fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgriggs654
30,Shabby,"I don't understand how they can let one of the top attractions in Los Angeles decay so much. The whole hollywood neighborhood is a tourist trap. Everyone is trying to sell you tickets for a tour, and there are lots of drunk and homeless people everywhere. The imprints at Grauman's Chinese Theatre could sure use some restauration!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoisonedIvy
30,Apart from the stars not much to see,"We went there at night time. Apart from the stars not much to see. Ok there are some nice neon lights from hotel, restaurants... and lots of people, but at a special landmark?!?Rather a place-to-be than a landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pasqua68
30,"Meh, its ok","It pretty cool, unless your coming to go to disney and all the proper tourist stuff its worth a visit, you can see the hollywood sign and grumans (not TCL) chinese theatre (which is also closed) you can walk the entire walk of fame in an hour or two, the biggest idiots are the tour guys, just ignore them, you will be told several times ""enjoy looking at the pavement"" my standard response was ""enjoy looking at my balls"" but you may want to add your own twist, the stars and all the old stuff outside grumans is defintely worth a couple of days in LA, again just ignore the panhandlers, nothing is free, not the CD's from the aspiring rap artists or the people offering photos, they all want money, yes there homeless people, give them money or ignore them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davross23
20,"Overrated, expensive, aggressive",I visited here with small children. They were put off by the aggression of the hawkers. The crowds were extreme. The attraction revolves around cement. I suggest finding other cement,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike_J1963

50,Great place to visit,"This is a tourist attraction, lots of shops, people, sidewalk entertainment, and tons of famous actors, directors and entertainers names immortalized on the sidewalk stars.

40,I liked it,"You can find your favourit actor, actress, singer, dancer walking the streets... There are footprints and handprints with signature from the stars.

20,Overrated,"Dirty, not maintained, plenty of people sat there talking to themselves.... Definitely none of the glitz and glamour that I expected.

50,My dream came true!,"I visited the Hollywood Walk of Fame during a journey in the US from Italy... i have reached my dream on the 15th of June: to see Britney Spears' star. The only problem of the Hollywood walk of fame is that during the day and during the evening it's crowded and it's difficulto to see it well, but when me and my family waked up at 6am to have breakfast it was desert ansd was AMAZING to have a walk and see it without the crowd. The most crowded part of Hollywood boulevard it's the one in front of the Chinese theatre and the hard rock. I hope to come back there one day o visit it better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllieFraio

30,No glitzy Hollywood glamour here...,"I expected glamour and this was far from it.. Definitely a 'must do' but wouldn't recommend spending more then a few hours here. Nice to walk on the 'walk of fame' and see the stars, take a few pics, but very busy. People throwing brochures at you, trying to sell you things and dressed up as characters gets quite annoying when you are trying to view the stars. We didn't even walk the entire thing and were lucky to spend 40mins here. Shops along here are great for cheap tourist items. But the area is a little tacky, run down and doesn't have a glitzy Hollywood feel to it. I wouldn't visit at night! Go to Sunset Blvd for a nice dinner instead",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentFlyer2012

10,Avoid at all costs,"Where do I start, 4 weeks spent touring the west coast and this had to be the worst place (by far) that we visited. No sooner were we out of the car than we were continually hassled to book up for a tour to see homes of the star's. Tacky gift shops, streets littered with rubbish, the homeless and beggars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElRasoSteve
20,Wouldn't recommend going at night,"Honestly, I was so excited to see the walk of fame... It's definitely a must-see during a trip to LA.We made the mistake of going at night, and were left with quite a sour taste... so many people dressed up as characters (most of whom look nothing like the celebrity they're trying to impersonate) and just a bunch of predatory folks trying to sell you something. We ended up with a home made Rap/R&B CD from some guy who literally wouldn't leave us alone, and followed us for almost a block. $4 very well spent, he tells me he'll be huge one of these days... he was wearing a shirt that said he was the 'King of Compton' so I'll keep my eye out for him on the music charts... *insert sarcastic eye roll here*There's no where in sight to eat (that you would consider) and cultural significance aside, this spot is a bit of a sad juxtaposition between the affluence of Hollywood and the poverty of so many in this city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjayed
30,must visit,"Well if you go to LA, you can't come back without going to hollywood and seeing the walk of fame.I've always seen the walk of fame on TV and so when I actually got there, it was a bit of a let down. The walk of fame is just a sidewalk with stars on the floor! Some of the areas aren't very clean and it was just completely different to how I had imagined it would be.

If you are in the area you need to see it but dont excpect too much",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jl502
30,Hollywood doesn't make enough money to fix the pavement?,"The tiles looked well kept in the heart of the Hollywood walk of Fame, which is somewhere around the Grauman's Chinese theatre?, but as we got farther away they begun to look more and more deteriorated. Tiles were cracked and missing corners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabriela_Ka
30,Just a sidewalk,"The Hollywood walk of fame is really just a sidewalk with famous names on stars. Sure it's definitely exciting to see one of your favourite star's name, but there are locals who need to walk there to get somewhere, and sometimes, you just can't pause in the middle of the walk way to take a picture. You also need to be a little bit careful here. There are all sorts of people dressed up as iconic figures like Darth Vader and Spiderman. Let me give you an example of what you need to be careful of. As a kid, these street cosplayers see me as an easy target. So a man dressed up as the Incredibles, tries to talk to me, then puts his arm around me, and tells my family to take a picture, he keeps trying to get us to take a picture. Once we do, he says he wants $10 tips. So parents, keep an eye on your children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheKidCritic

30,Just ok..,"You know what? I was really looking forward to seeing the Walk of Fame before embarking on my first trip ever to the Land of the US of A. Now that I've been there, done that and seen the Walk of Fame, well I have to admit that I wasn't impressed. It was a bit of a bummer actually. The stars are actually and literally on the street.We went at night it was quite busy so it was pretty hard to actually pause in the middle of the street and grab a picture without getting in people's way. Plus, there were places where it was quite dark so you couldn't really see very well.The Walk of Fame goes for blocks and some of the stars are actually fading away while others have just gotten dirty. We stuck to the busy part so near the Chinese Theatre mainly. It was alright, I can actually say that I've done it now. Other than that, meh...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinS147
10,Nah,"Another thing that L.A. is famous for, and seems much better than it really is. If you are really into movies, tv, and music, and you get excited when you hear something about celebrities, you'll like it. But it's nothing special: just a 'pavement' full of names (which most of them I didn't recognize, and the stars of people from nowaydays were next to the ones from about 50s). I wish it could be at least divided into sections: Tom Cruise next to Will Smith, not (for ex.) nearby Pola Negri. Also it's a normal street, so you can't even really stop to take a picture, because people are constantly walking. Some restaurants put their tables on the stars. And those annoying sellers asking you 6372882 times at once: home stars tour ? Home star tours? Overrated, too many things happening at once, not enough space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trucizna007

40,Enjoyed the visit,"Had a pretty good time checking out the stars, the shops, the mall all in about 3hrs. Shops all had pretty much the same stuff but there were some terrific deals if your the type of person that looks for that sort of thing (me) Seeing the stars take you on a walk through the past as names pop up of celeb's that you haven't thought about in sometime. Don't know if I'll ever see this again but it was worth the stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripnic
40,Stars everywhere,"Walking down the street, you realize how many stars there are. On the one hand it's great to see so many familiar names, but on the other hand it makes the stars less exclusive than before; almost all good actors and directors have a star there nowadays.

40,interesting attraction.,It was great and fun to actually see what you always see on tv. Not as crowded as I thought. found many stars I was interested in seeing without walking so much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsladylee
50,Remember,"It's really nice to walk down the road and be able to remeber some personalities that were important for us in some way.. I don't know a big part of them still, it's very important to honor them all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FilipadoO
40,Walk of Fame,"Very interesting place needless to say...lots of attractions...beware of panhandlers and people dressed as characters, as they want money for the pictures you take of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christym72
40,A must see when in Hollywood,"Just a piece of advise to give, since everyone knows what the walk of fame is about. Alongside the walk of fame are a lot of stores selling you maps for about $5,- on which you can see at what address you favorite star has his / her star. The maps are also on the internet. Do some research at home and print it out. That way you can start starhunting right away.Go the Grauman chinese theatre to see hand- and footprints of some of Hollywood's best know stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nieb20475
40,Movie Lovers You Will Enjoy It..,Long walk yet fun. Meeting the movie characters around Walk Of Fame area was great. Names of actor and actress along the way on the star is good idea to remember them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarojinyM
30,Kind of what I expected.,"The walk of fame is set along a long stretch of sidewalk which is populated by grotty shops, annoying ""tour"" operators and people dressed up as movie characters, usually in very bad costumes. I did hear captain jack sparrow tell catwoman that he needed to change meds because he had another freak out, that was funny! It was good to see some of the names there, but don't expect glitz and glamour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JGilleese
20,Skip the Walk of Fame!,"Unless you are enamored of a celebrity and have to touch the star, I would skip this carnival atmosphere. It is crowded, dirty, cheap, and devoid of glamour. You don't want to dine,shop, or even stand here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EDardes
30,Good to visit,"My wife and I visited Hollywood Walk of Fame on 17 - 19 August 2013. We were a little disappointed that the stars on walk of fame are just stars, with many names in several locations. We were hoping to see more hand and foot prints of the stars, but only saw some outside Chinese Theatre.The highlight of our trip there was the Hop On Hop Off bus tour around Hollywood, Los Angeles, and Santa Monica beach area. Great way to see a lot with good commentary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiCzech
30,Homelesswood more like it!,"America, you have a serious homeless problem and no where more so than in Hollywood! Beggars, people sleeping on the streets. Strange buskers posing for money.Yes there are many sights to see. But I did not feel safe there and it was worse at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonsonator
50,AWESOME! What'd you expect?,"Visiting the hollywood walk of fame is the epitome of a Hollywood vacation. We visited all our favorite stars. I found Walt Disney and Disneyland. It was an awesome experience. Just figure out where your favorite stars are before you get there. Or good like trying to find them on the street. I saw some poor reviews from people in their post. The only negative is the homeless people all over the streets, but they didn't bother me at all. I live downtown in a city and we have plenty of bums. That's what you get in the cities. Oh and the people that dress up posing for pictures then demanding tips are kind of annoying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertC879
50,The staple sight of Hollywood,You must go see the Walk Of Fame - Historic Hollywood!!!! What a wonderful way to honor the stars that made the town and celebrate the current ones. Make sure you start at the beginning on La Brea and Hollywood where there are statues and don't miss the two best corners in Hollywood - Hollywood/Highland and Hollywood/Vine!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimF905
40,It is what it is,Yes it is touristy but then that is why you go to be that tourist seeing the stars. Fun finding names you know and graumans theatre and el Capitan theatre are right there to see also. El Capitan is a cinema so can catch the latest film if you want. We looked at seeing Disney Planes when we were there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lottie73_11
30,For movie and celebrity fans,"I guess if you are a movie fan this is a must see. Watch out for the costumed ""characters"" near the Chinese Theater. They like to be paid if you take pictures of them and they have been belligerent in the past. Otherwise there are a bunch of stars cemented into the sidewalk with names of entertainment people. It goes on for a long way and part of Hollywood near here is rather sleazy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pixer1
20,More Hype than substance...good thing its Free!,"I have been her before so I knew what to expect. I brought the kids and wife here after leaving Universal Studios early as sort of a surprise side trip. I was last here about a decade ago. WOW has it gone down hill!Parts were under construction so sidewalks were moved out onto the street. The area has been over run with street performers, buskers, beggars and weirdos. It added a bit to the eccentric feel of Hollywood I guess, so I wouldn’t consider that necessarily a bad thing.Things were fine until the sun set, then.... WOAH!!! The dregs and reprobates scurried out of every nook and cranny. Sketchy Meth addicts and druggies at every turn. Even my 13 year old picked up on it and cautioned me that it was time to turn around and head back to where the main crowds of people were. A security guard later confirmed that we were pretty much at the end of the safe tourist zone where we had ventured to. Parking is also at a premium. Expect to pay $10-20 for a couple of hours in private parking garages.The streets were filthy, lots of stores were closed. Seedy people, iffy restaurants ZERO public rest rooms and just generally an unsafe atmosphere.The kids got their photo at the Chinese theatre, the sidewalk stars novelty wore off after a couple of blocks. Check one off the bucket list. Been there, done that, no need to EVER return. The silver screen crowd can have it!If you found something in this review helpful, please click helpful below. Godspeed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saskheat
40,Very long walk...,"The walk of fame is very long. I don't even remember from where I started. I didn't plan for anything special. I found some of my favorite celebrities' star by chance (Sandra Bullock, Britney Spears, Meryl Streep, Michael Jackson...) while I was walking around. I've noticed that some stars need maintenance. It's a shame to see some stars not respected. It's sometimes VERY busy and crowded so it was almost impossible to take photos.If you are looking for a specific star, google it before doing the walk... There is no need to take a paid tour. It's a waste of money. Read about it online since there is an official website for the Walk of Fame.There are so many people doing personal shows on the sidewalk to get money. I guess it's a bit annoying while walking especially that the sidewalk is alway busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hedddo
30,Overated. Nothing special.,"So you have this side walk with the famous Hollywood star names embedded in it. But it's popularized worldwide making one feel like it's a must-see attraction if you're in LA. , So go ahead and visit it once if you really want, and get it off your list. On the plus side, it's completely free, if you exclude the effort and money spent to find parking nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShamiJ
40,Long Walk. Stiff Neck.,There are so many stars to look at. You can't possibly read all of them. The sidewalk can be busy with a lot of people and you may find it hard to take a picture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TarsierReviews
30,Need endurance,"The walk of fame was a disappointment. Do NOT try to do the whole walk, only the sections where people are crowding have anyone who is familiar and those sections are sooo crowded its tough to get a photo - maybe go very early in the morning - i fear none of the shops will be open - but that is nothing you cant find anywhere else in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lelanies_13
40,took a headphones tour,Headphones helped us hear our guide as we navigated the very crowded sidewalks. Without him it would have been a blur. We walked from the Egyptian theatre to the Chinese theatre and back with stops and comments along the way. When we gave in the headphones we went back to get some picts of the the stars we zoomed right over. Not a long distance but a lot of information packed into that 1 1/2 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandiH134
20,Trashy tourist trap,"I had wanted to see the Walk of Fame because you see it all the time on TV. Unfortunately the TV lies. The buildings around are all trashy, the sidewalk is nasty, there are people everywhere so it's hard to see the actual stars and the vendors are very pushy. My advice is to just look at it on TV.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoliSciGuy24
40,Catch the Buzz,"Tourist traps are just that for a reason - there is something about them that is irresistable and attractive. We had fun spotting the names of favourite stars old and new. The best part is the location on Hollywood Boulevard - at easy distance is the Grauman's chinese Theatre, Kodak Theatre, Ripley's, Guiness Records Museum, Egyptian Theatre, Wonka's Chocolate Shop ( touted to be the biggest one ever), Jimmy Kimmel Live @ El Capitan, Madame Tussauds Hollywood. The street is abuzz at night, not only with neon but with Buskers, street food, artists and impersonators. Also located within easy reach are restaurants, coffee shops, speciality dining and the usual hughstreet Stores.The place is alive and lively till about 10:30pm, then the traffic gets diverted to the nightclubs and the stars fade to oblivion, until the next day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gippsee
20,Tacky tourist trap,"On screen it looks much better, cleaner and more glamorous than it is,Hollywood Boulevard is quite tacky,lined with tourist trap shops and the stars on the ground..well, they can barely be considered an attraction. The central part, the crossing of Highland and Hollywood is the busiest part, with a short stretch, around Hollywood Highland Mall, which is the busiest but all in all, a tacky tourist trap, smaller, shaggier and much less glamorous than they make it look on films and tv news.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ariana60
30,Great people watching area.,Interesting to see all the stars along this boulevard. Great people watching area. Be careful of all the scam artists and tour operators trying to sell you something. Lot of panhandlers and odd people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tangojohnDallas
30,"Its a must, but be prepared.","The walk of fame is a must for any trip to Hollywood - in fact its unmissable, but make sure you go prepared.Find out where the stars you want to visit are in advance as the local star maps are $6 and they are not worth it (black and white info maps and not really a souvenir). There are loads of sites which can help plan. I say do this for two reasons. Firstly, everyone is trying to sell you a tour and endlessly asking ""you wanna tour?"" ""hey guys the best tour in town you wanna ride?"" etc. this can be fine for the first half an hour, but if your trying to find a certain star and you walk up and down the strip then its tedious. Secondly, some of the stars are out of the way a bit - Elvis for instance is quite a way from the main strip and the other end of Hollywood Boulevard is a little bit more 'adult' at night, therefore not a place for the kids.pros - you get to see Hollywood Boulevard, the Dolby Theater, the Chinese theater etc etc. its lively, there's street performers, some shops, fast food restaurants. Its free and because of the location the amenities are there.cons - you endlessly get harassed to buy a tour or buy a cd, don't expect a gentle stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13MatthewG
30,Worth a one-time,"If you've never been to LA, then it's worth it to see this, the never-ending-down-staring-and-wondering-who-is-that? walk.Some names you'll recognize. Some names you'll pity. Some names you'll wonder who they are and when and how they got the star. Some will be so far away from the Chinese Theater that you'll wonder whom they pissed off.All the clowns at the Chinese Theater can be... entertaining. Seeing Jack's feet along with the Star Wars/Star Trek cats is cool, but once you're done with all that...You'll never have to do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/antonahill
30,"Worth the visit, but not the return.","In one word crowded !!! Very overrated and worth a visit, but after one time you've seen it all. The boulevard would be nice to stroll around, but it is just too crowded with visitors, vendors and a lot of weird people !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IpscLady
30,See it ...keep purse in front of you,"Interesting place to visit .Large crowds .Panhandlers .Characters looking for donations for very cause known to man ,people flogging tours and CD's .BatMan and Superman looking for cash in exchange for photos ( not the real ones either ..I think ) People who stand on the star you are photographing just as your shutter moves , clusters of non english speaking people standing all around you and pick pockets who lack the subtle touch to work subways vying for position around unsuspecting tourists .Its electric .You should go .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomchuck19
50,Very interesting if you are interested in verrrry strange people,"Hi l have been to walk to fame twice,l personally enjoy it!! I live in Brisbane(Australia)!! I personally LOVE LOS ANGELES l am returning again this September with 3 of my kids they have not been before but they are really looking forward to it! We are also visiting San Diego,Las Vegas,Chicago,Niagara Falls (Canada) side,Boston,New York,Washington DC,Miami,Orlando,San Francisco, Santa Maria,Anaheim! Last time l was in America in 2011,l did Route66,enjoyed it other that l did it on a bus tour would not do that again,l recommend if anyone does the trip do it themselves hire a car or motorbike! But walk of fame is quite interesting a lot of people begging etc. Strange people dressed up trying to impersonate stars etc. When l went first time to America which was in August 2010 l had my photo done with a impersonator of my most favourite singer Michael Jackson and he was GREAT, personally you do not see enough of them anymore which is a real shame! I really hope to see them this visit! But unless you are into people being in your face l would probably avoid it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melleasa
30,A must do in LA,"Hollywood is not as glamourous as you might think! It came across as quite dirty and geared to tourists. The Hollywood Walk of Fame you will find stretching along two sides of the road by the Chinese Theatre. Interesting to find your favourite stars and have your picture taken by them. A must do if you are in this area, just to say youv've been!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/van01227
30,Typical Hollywood....,"When people think of Hollywood most envision the glitz and glam. But really it's very grungy down there. So while it seems like it would be a great place to go, if you're single person or you just out with a group of adults it's great. But if you have children I don't recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarketingDiva
40,Worth doing once experience.,It is worth walking through the Walk f Fame if you are in LA. Perspective of fame obviously can be different. You may want to do it at night with lights around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArmenGrigoryan
40,Can't miss it!,"It's a ""Can't miss"" attraction if you've never been in LA before. The streets are full of turists and some starts aren't clean. I had problems with my gps to get there.My favorite ones was The Beatles and Elvis Presley.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seraphyne
40,Be prepared for all kinds of tips,"It is funny to find name of some celebrities. And there are free cartoon characters for pictures.

40,Always fun and great for a first time visitor....,"Hollywood Walk of Fame is certainly not glamourous like the magazines but it is certainly fun and great for a first time visit. Plenty of characters, tour guides and artists demonstrate just how hard it is to make a buck in this town. Get some great photos with your favourite stars hand prints, read the tributes and buy your own little Oscar.A few things to be aware of... many would be artists will give you their CDS and start up a conversation. At the end, they ask for a donation towards their career development (often a ""donation"" of $10 or more). Unless you really like their sound - be careful not to accept the disc - otherwise some will make a scene or demand the disc back.Most of the characters are just trying to make a few dollars and expected very little - we came across very friendly people!The tour guides all compete to fill their vans with tourists so you can bargain to secure the best deal if you are keen.Great to see when a movie premiere is being set up too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/busymumsydney
40,A must see for every tourist but beware!,Great area to see once in your life. Beware massive crowds and pick pockets. A little something for everyone!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucycan
30,Not sure why this is such an attraction,"I lived in LA for many years and every visitor wants to walk on Hollywood Blvd. But if you have seen the Walk of Fame in the movies or on TV you have seen it. The street is packed with tourists and cheesy souvenir shops and no really decent place to eat. If you want to go to the movies, there are great movie theaters here. Not worth your time especially if you are there only for a few days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizznyc
50,Legendary,"One must see the Hollywood Walk of Fame while visiting Los Angeles. You can look at at maps online, to easily locate your favorite celebrities stars. It's also in downtown Hollywood, so you are surrounded by fun. It doesn't matter if you prefer the early Hollywood stars or current ones, you are sure to have a fun time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ele_denver
20,Dirty and,Went to the Holly Walk of Fame in May this year and was very disappointed. The area was very dirty and those 'characters' who are dressed up as Super hero's were so annoying. They try to sell you their time by you having your picture taken with them and then expect a tip... they get very annoyed when you refuse to tip them and can get very abusive and in some cases violent. Is that why there appears to be Police Offices stationed there permanently...?I've been there once so wont be going back there in a hurry.... Its such a shame as I feel this could be more than it is and the local officials should do something more to make it an event for tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/219MikeS
30,"not glamorous, but interesting","I live in Los Angeles. When family and friends from other places come to visit us, they often want to see the Walk of Fame, if they have never been there before. If they have been there, they don't want to go back, because once is enough. The section of Los Angeles known at Hollywood is actually not glamorous, and is pretty seedy in most places, with a fair amount of crime. There are ""characters"" that pose for photos with tourists, but beware that they expect a tip and get nasty (and sometimes violent) if they don't get one. And they are persistent - I have had to firmly and repeatedly ask some of them to leave us alone when we have been there with visitors. Now, all that said, the Walk of Fame is kind of interesting: the stars imbedded in the sidewalks span many decades, and it is fun to read the names and categories of work, sometimes remembering performers long-forgotten. I do suggest going to visit during daylight hours, and exercise some caution in hanging onto your belongings. There are a few good restaurants in the area, as well as some nice stores, and lots of theaters. Just don't go there thinking it will be glitz and celebrities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMHLA
50,You gotta go,"OK, so it's cheesy and obvious, but who doesn't go to the Walk of Fame when coming to LA? Just don't wander too far east on the Blvd, or you'll find out who really lives in Hollywood, which is not stars with mansions or would-be stars with dreams. When you get to the subway station, turn around and head back to Hollywood and Highland. Get the corporate view of the sign as framed by the building. Think of the irony that it's been co-opted by capitalists, and sigh.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnglandScotland
50,Very Surpised!!,"After reading bad reviews about this, I was very surprised when we got there and it was very clean. I really enjoyed my visit there and would have like to stayed longer to see everything. There were lots of panhandlers but they didn't seem to bother us. Really enjoyed going there and would definitely go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hudd01
40,It's a must go place...,"You ought to visit Hollywood walk of fame, the Chinese and Kodak Theatres when you are in LA.There also a lot of nice shops and good restaurants/ cafe' in the area for your souvenirs and taking photos with your favorite stars.

40,Hollywood,"If you want to take photos of the stars on the street go there before 9 or 930 and you wont be caught up with all the tourists and people selling their own music cd,s and the bus tours sellers stopping you all the time, although to be fair once you say you have done that tour they don't bother you 3 teenagers loved looking at all the stars on the street and the guys dressed up as star wars or superman etc.As adults we knew allmost all of the stars, teenagers didn't they only knew a few as mostly from old films.Chinese Theater etc,If you walk up to top of Franklin Ave, you can see the Hollywood Sign from street.Sunset Blvd. where we stayed was a little bit rougher, a few homeless people sleeping or begging on street but didn't hassle you too much.Saw a squirrel eating the remains of a homeless mans lunch while he was gone under tree where the man slept.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aria835
40,Vine to Highland and beyond! Plan more than 2 hours.,"We parked at Vine and started to walk westward but actually there were many stars east on us and not small stars. Stars are on both sides of the boulevard so plan to walk a lot if you wish to see them all. For some reason, some celebrities have two stars even!The Chinese theater is just after Highlands and the closest you get the more a mad house it becomes with many characters: Avatar, Zorro, Batman, Chewbacca, etc. $1/photo usually.Some aspiring artists sell their CDs, we bought one and were happily surprised by the quality of the recording.And the show can even be found in the bathroom at McDonalds, crazy bum women that day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingCat22

Although Hollywood (which is Los Angeles) does a great job of keeping the sidewalks clean, I cannot find anything exciting about walking across stars with names of movie stars, television stars, singer, et.al.Hollywood is an odd, but interesting place to visit. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is simply a very small part of the overall attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avus
50,It's a must see when visiting Los Angeles,This is something free to do with the family. Paid Parking is available at the Highland shopping center or fight for very limited free street parking that is available. Taking the train here is recommended as well as there are stops at Highland and Vine. The highland center has shopping and is part of the Kodak Theater. The Chinese theater is a block away.

But don't expect a lot more than what it's supposed to be, the place is very touristy, a bit cliché, and full of people that will try to sell you anything related to the showbiz (including tours around famous people's houses, highly unrecommended).

40,A Walk down Hollywood nostalgia,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a wonderful activity to do . I repeatedly have gone over and walked along Hollywood Blvd and felt very nostalgic when I come across the names of famous people who I loved in the past and now see in the form of a star. There are so many names and almost everyone will recognize people whose fame left long ago, but whose wonderful memories linger. A bonus is all the impersonators who are out hustling a buck.

30,Movie capital of the world,"Hollywood! Just the mention brings memories of Bogart, Grant, Cable, Davis and many other great stars of film, TV and stage. Hollywood Blvd. is where the ""Hollywood Walk of Fame"" is located. On both sides of the street implanted into the side walk are hundreds of bronze stars showing the person's name and what that person did in the film, TV or stage industry. Its an honor to have your name on a star. For the past 10 to 15 years Hollywood Blvd. was not the best place to visit. Drugs, sex and other undesirables were located there. In the past couple of years the Blvd. has seen a resurgence with new shopping centers, hotels and other attractions. You can visit the Kodak center where many award shows take place. Try putting your hands or feet in the cement imprints in front of ""Grumans"" movie theater. Have your picture taken with many of the ""look in like' impersonators.

If you want to be entertained and not bothered by reality , then by all means. Hollywood Blvd is not a theme park, it's an actual living community, sometimes interesting, sometimes disturbing, sometimes funny, sometimes stupid, sometimes boring.

20,Not glamorous at all,"The Walk of Fame stretches for many city blocks around Hollywood. Some of the blocks are quite seedy and the ""Walk"" has not been kept up - with cracked sidewalk squares surrounding the stars. It's really not all that glamorous.

30,Very LA and no admission charge,"Start a block either direction away from the Grauman Chinese theatre and end at the theatre. Total time about 20 minutes. Other than handprints, footprints of Hollywood stars imprinted on concrete, the block is chockful of panhandlers in costumes-- Spider-Man, Darthvader, etc ready to pose for picture taking for a small fee. There are snacks to be bought, souvenirs and best of all, the carnival atmosphere. There is also a wax museum and a fantasy museum which has admission charges but I haven't been in them. Frankly, the entire area is seedy and tacky BUT it is Hollywood and it is a decent in town thing to do for tourists.Further east of this section is Thai town. Again not much to see but the Thai food offering is good and cheap and perfect for lunch or dinner. My personal fav is Cafe Sanamluang which is right next door to a Thai supermarket.

The costumed characters harass you for $ if you take a picture with them (and can get pretty aggressive) and the area is awash in cheap souvenir shops. Its kind of fun to see the old time stars handprints in front of what was called Grauman's Chinese theater ( now re-named) set in cement but its not all that exciting. if you feel you HAVE to go here, just drive by or spend a minimal amount of time here and move on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lqgueradg35
20,Many MANY better things to do in LA,"No where to park, garages are expensive. All the strangest characters you can imagine ( or can't) vying for your attention. About the only good thing about this walk is that it is free (unless you want to go into the theater). There's plenty of junk to blow your money on all around you, though. Seriously? It's just celebrity names on the sidewalk. I don't get the interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariachurchill
10,"Dangerous, Crowded, and Gritty","This is one of the star attractions listed in travel books, but it has become one of the most unsavory places in Los Angeles. A pedestrian was murdered in broad daylight on the street right at the corner of Hollywood and Highland for taking a photo of a costumed character in May 2013. Keep your wits about you, hold onto your bags and wallets, and be prepared to pay for taking photos of costumed characters and listening to street music. This is a major stop on the public transit routes, so it is likely that you will need to pass through here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RabbiWendy
20,Tourist trap,"Ok, if you are in LA, go see it, have a few pics taken with your ""stars"" but that's all there is, there's some shopping and the Maddam T wax museum is good, but overall it is a turist trap to keep people away from the really nice places....granted, nicer and maybe way more expensive :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ringaPr

30,You don't need much time to see it all,"The Hollywood Walk of Fame is one of the most popular locations for tourists. Fans love to take pictures with the stars of their favorite movie and entertainment idols. The most important section and the most popular is by the former Kodak Center between Highland and La Brea. There is parking one block west of the Kodak Center and the Chinese Theater. If you are lucky you might find street parking but most of the spots have one hour limit two at the most. You can have lunch or dinner at the center, take photos of the sidewalk stars and the foot/hand prints in front of the Chinese theater all within 2 or 3 hours. There are a lot of souvenir shops right there with really cheap stuff... quality corresponds to the price though. There are a lot of hustlers too... dressed up in costumes offering to take pictures. Beware that they expect you to pay them for those photos you take with them. Some can get really obnoxious and ugly if you do not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dasmarek

10,From a Local: Put This Last on Your List!,"I live maybe a couple miles from the HWoF, and unless absolutely necessary, I avoid driving through it, as traffic is often very slow.Having both sat in that traffic and having walked the HWoF to visit a store or restaurant, I've had plenty of time to observe, and I've yet to understand the appeal.Most simply, it's a crowded tourist trap that offers nothing in terms of truly experiencing this awesome town. Also, it can be a bit seedy and sketchy (especially at night with the nightclub crowd). Most of the restaurants are chains and/or overpriced and subpar.Finally, if you want to see celebrities, this is perhaps the last place for that (unless there's a premiere).If you are staying nearby and want to enjoy the town, go east a few miles to Griffith Park, Los Feliz/Hillhurst Villages, Silver Lake and Echo Park. Or, go west a couple miles and check out West Hollywood…THIS is where you'll really get a better taste of LA, much better shopping and dining, and perhaps a celebrity sighting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derek_traveling
20,A squalid relic of its former glory,"During the day, the Hollywood Walk of Fame is a squalid parade of tatoo parlors and pot shops, anchored at Hollywood and Highland by a generic shopping mall and the Kodak Theater, and at Hollywood and Vine by a Glitzy hotel development. At night, Hollywood Boulevard blossoms into one of LA's premier club scenes, supported by a free shuttle bus along the boulevard. There are two interesting galleries just west of Wilcox, WUHO and LACE, that show contemporary art and architecture, and the Chinese and Egyptian theaters give a hint of Hollywood's former glory. But if you want real star sightings you are better off trawling the delis along Ventura Blvd in Studio City.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickR798
20,"Not a loss, if missed","I'm always amazed by the numbers of families with children who are drawn to Hollywood -- in general -- and to the Walk of Fame, in particular. Pretty cheesy and unauthentic. There are a few sites of interest, which can be seen nicely and safely from a car IMHO. Despite the investment in the area, it is still quite seedy -- bordering on dangerous -- depending on time of day.

Entertainers all huddle in front of Mann's Chinese Theatre to take pictures with you then demand a tip, to ask you to go on a bogus tour of ""Homes of Celebrities"", or to stick jesus signs in your face. This is an outing that is strictly a walk through, you should be street savvy, and I'd suggest getting a star map to see the stars you are interested in, do not underestimate how long this walk really is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7Ashley7Boo7
40,It's Part of the Hollywood Experience,"Yes, Hollywood is dirty and tacky... but that may be part of its charm. And let's face it, if you're a first-time visitor you know your friends and family back home are going to ask if you saw the Walk of Fame. So get out the camera and get some good shots, from one of Halle Berry's (in front of the Kodak Theatre) to Johnny Depp's (at 7018 Hollywood Blvd). Well, those would be the ones I'd like to see but there are loads of others....including one for Rin Tin Tin!If the Stars themselves are under-whelming for you the people-watching alone will be make for some kitschy fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492HappyTraveler

Unfortunately, until the recent assaults & murder, security was not a priority. Was there for a dinner @ Musso & Franks Grill , not bad although waiters have a bit of attitude, so we walked down Blvd., in early evening. Some decent restaurants, some decent clothing stores.

20,SO Disapointed,"This was my first trip to LA and a bit of dream to finnaly make to Hollywood.The walk of fame is no more than a high street, The land mark theatre and a viewing place for the hollywood sign and that's about it. Cheap shops tourist busses, students and down and outs after your money possing as film stars, some good and some want to kill you for taking a picture with out paying them. Anyway have to do it tick it off the bucket list. It's also very hot, found a nice pub called snow whites, rest your feet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djstarman
50,Walking on the stars..,"It was fun walking up and down Hollywood Blvd searching for the stars. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes as it is much larger than I had thought. We enjoyed searching for the stars and taking pictures. If you have time, take the walking tour as you learn more of the history of Hollywood and how it all started. Worth your time. I did find Johnny Depp's star, along with his signature, hand and feet prints in front of the Chinese Theater, now renamed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scrap4fun

20,Such a shame,I was looking forward to this but was disappointing as the whole area seems cheap and has lost its class. I admit that I would be nervous about staying there long especially after dark. Granted it is full of tourists but some others were a little intimidating. Shops seem trashy and only after your money,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wrappo
40,Needs to be done,"My family enjoyed the experience of looking at all the stars and the hand/foot prints at the theatre. Nice to see the Beatles have pride of place next to Elvis. You have to put the place in context. It's history. I found all the characters in costumes amusing and compared to some places ( Africa..) perfectly polite after a ""no thanks"", most didn't even enquire. Take it for what it is and be glad to say you were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guxxi
20,Yuck.,"Visit this place one time so that you can say you've been there, then never go again. It's crowded, filthy, and filled with pan handlers and costumed weirdos. We got yelled at by panhandlers when we refused to give them money. The costumed weirdos are everywhere and create chaos by posing for pictures. Of course, they want you to pay. It was wall-to-wall people all pushing and shoving. I could hardly see any of the stars on the sidewalk, much less take a picture. It's seedy and gross. I wouldn't go there after dark. This is not a glamorous street. It's nasty. If you want to see a classy place, go to Beverly Hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cool_teacher590

20,Go during daylight,Went here with wife and kids last September. Nice to say we done it but do during the daytime as gets dangerous when dark. We had prostitutes coming up to the kids (3 and 2 years of age) and all shops along street require u to buzz in before u can enter. Illegal drugs were being offered to us every 200 yards also. The stars could also be better maintained as some of them are damaged which is a shame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKeating100
30,Worth it to say that you've done it!,"Definitely worth visiting the Walk of Fame, just to say that you've been there whilst visited Hollywood and LA but don't get too excited about it.Firstly, it's hard to spend time hunting down your favourite stars when the street is so busy and people are constantly getting annoyed at each other, holding people up and walking into each other.The street itself is pretty dingy, dirty and tacky. It's quite sad to see where some of the stars are placed - next to horrible costume and wig shops.I didn't feel particularly unsafe here, but there are a few homeless people around and you are constantly getting hassled by tour reps (don't bother, it's a rip off after paying the ticket price and then having to tip the driver!!).It definitely isn't the glamorous Hollywood that I expected!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krystinaf
30,Do it so you can say you did it,"I specifically wanted to see this site, just so I could say I saw it. I found a few stars and the one star I was really looking for (Dorothy Dandridge). It is sometimes kind of sad to see a big star placed so far away from the action around Dolby Theater because I wonder if people really ever walk the full length. I didn't walk the full length. It goes on for a while so I'm sure there are some stars that rarely get attention. It's fun to see a name though and recognize the performer. Yes, as other reviewers have mentioned there is a lot of soliciting in the area. Characters want you to pay to take photos with them. Bus tours want you to pay to take a tour with them. Bootleg musicians want you to pay to buy their latest CD. I just waved them all off or flat out ignored their request. It didn't bother me when I was ignoring them because they just move on to the next person when they see you're not interested in buying anything from them. There are certainly plenty of crowds in that area so keep your personal belongings close and use common sense. Overall, if you want to say you did this, it's fine for a one time thing or if you just want to find that one star for your favorite performer/actor and take your picture with it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FiveCityDweller
30,busy and fun,"The walk of fame is really just a very busy downtown street with the stars on the pavement and it culminates at the front of Dolby Theatre where the hands and footprints of the big stars are... It's a fun thing to do but it's not for families with little kids. I went there with my boyfriend and a couple friend, and we were on our way to dinner, and inside the Dolby Theatre mall there was a live Jazz concert that was nice to watch... So for us it was a terrific way to spend our time with our friends as we made our way to our restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gracep724
20,"Good for a scavenger hunt, but nothing else","Its an honor to be have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but sometimes its sad to see where someones star has ended up or gets placed. The street is pretty dingy, but his is a right of passage for any new LA citizen or anyone that wants to be able to say they saw all the sights in LA.So go see the names of your favorite stars, but don't expect the rest of Hollywood Boulevard to glitter and twinkle as much as the stars imbedded in the sidewalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Roaming_Raven

Just keep your wits about you & enjoy spotting the famous names on the street!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lrnnnn
30,Glad I've been but wouldn't go back!,When we first arrived in Hollywood I was very nervous and apprehensive. A lot of tramps everywhere and I just thought overall the place was a dump. I enjoyed seeing all the famous 'stars' and the Chinese theatre but apart from that not much else around. We had a walk around the shops but I just never felt comfortable around the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chunk1985
20,Disappointing visit,"I went there just to see specific actor star. I was really disappointed that the place is not clean and you can be easily pick-pack. Be aware of them and do not take valuable things with. Also it does not worth more that 1 hour visit. If you want to find a specific star, search for the exact address on the internet, then go there. Do not waste your time searching as the street is too long and have lots of stars for people you did not hear about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sis1111

30,a bit sleazy,"Do not pre book those 45 minute to 1 hour tours, as nearly every brochure has a price of somewhere between $45 to $50 per person. If you walk along the strip where all the stars are on the Walk of Fame, you will get tons of offers from all of these operators, and find that they drop their price, because of the competition, we were able to go for only $15 per person, and others got it for $10. Besides that, they ALL take you up Mulholland Drive to a spot that is supposed to be good to take a photo of the Hollywood sign, but that spot is terrible for a couple of reasons. 1 It is too far to get a good shot, unless you zoom the heck out of your camera, which means you can’t have a proper photo with your family in the foreground. The second reason is that being far away, when you add the smog that is almost always there, its terrible. There is a great view apparently from the Famous Chinese theatre right there near the Walk of Fame, but that was closed for us as they were doing repairs. There is also a great spot about 50 metres or so to the right of the theatre as you look at it. It is a shopping mall with a wide circular courtyard in the middle – you can’t miss it - . There is a balcony section a couple of levels up, which is visible from the bottom of the courtyard, just go up there at click your cameras with the best shots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/333billk333

30,Ugly area,Went there just to check it out but got there early before most of the tourists arrived so felt a bit unsafe for a while. Lots of beggars and people trying to sell you tours. Some good souviner shops though so spent some time shopping. Stars themselves were really quite old and some were dirty and cracked. A lot of stars I didn't even know from the very early days of film. Took a while before I found a star of anybody I knew to photograph. Didn't walk the whole area as we were short on time. What we did see was enough. Definately not the glitzy scene you see on tv and in photos. Rather disappointing but worth visiting to say you've seen it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vickopro
40,Great! But go in the morning!,"We initially started to do this one evening since it was a short walk from our hotel. The Walk of Fame area is extremely crowded during the evening, with impersonators wanting to take a picture with you, street performers and others who want to basically do something to get money or tips off of you. It was really too crowded, so we just ate dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe and returned to our room. We went early one morning shortly after 7 am, and what a difference. There was hardly anyone there, which made for a nice, peaceful stroll to look at all of the stars. There was some construction, which kept us from seeing some of the stars, which I think, were the most famous ones (where the hand prints are). All in all, it was great considering it's free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andbod1
30,"This was a must see for my wife, son and daughter",I would have rated this higher but being bothered every 200 feet by those wanting to stick you in a cramped tour bus to see the homes of some stars was sickening. Then add in people dressed up trying to get you to take their picture then demanding money or telling you to delete the photo added to my thinking this was nothing special.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wkrupa

40,Been there done that,"This is one of those things you HAVE to do just to say you've seen it. Once you've seen it no need to see again. We had fun finding everyone we wanted to see and luckily I checked ahead of time so we weren't going in blind by finding the location of everyone whose star we wanted to see. It gets really annoying though that about every 50 feet or so someone is trying to sell you a tour. And don't be fooled by the people dressed up as someone famous who ""offer"" to take their picture with you. They expect a tip. My daughter took her picture with Batman, Captain America, and someone else (escapes me now) and they wanted $15! I gave him a ten and he tried to argue. I told him he was lucky he got that--figure out how to spilt it and walked away. And don't take the cd's people are ""handing"" out. They want money for those too.

30,fell short of expectations,"I came across Hollywood by accident when I was driving along highway 101. I saw the lights and familiar signs and pulled off. At first, it was mesmerizing to think that I was in, off all places, Hollywood. I immediately checked in to a motel. A review of it would be a page long and nasty. But it was close to the action. After a short tour up the Boulevard, it became apparent that the tourist section wasn't very big. Beyond the theaters, the boulevard consisted of liquor stores and chained store fronts, with an occasional bar and restaurant. What was really apparent was the number of homeless people and runaway teenagers. I didn't see any obviously threatening people until I walked passed a liquor store. I ignore beggars. This guy wouldn't take no for an answer and came after me. I realized that he wasn't a beggar but a gang banger who wasn't going to be disrespected by the likes of me. I was able to dismiss him without being stabbed or shot. After touring the Chinese theater, I realized that Hollywood is no more real than a movie facade.

It's interesting to see though at least once, and maybe even a big fascinating in a car wreck, slightly depressing sort of way -- the stars are right there on the sidewalk up and down both sides of the street mostly forgotten and a weird afterthought.

We found most of what we wanted, but I could not help but note how beat up and dirty that the sidewalk and surrounding area are in Hollywood. The idea of visiting a world famous landmark is exciting, but when you see how dirty it is in person, you just want to take a few pictures and keep it moving.

50,AUSTRALIAN IN LA,FINALLY got to see in real life what you always see on tv!Although there were a lot of wanna be rappers that wanted to give us their cd's and lots of people dressed up as famous characters which we were warned to stay away from :D,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dave279
20,Stay for 5 minutes...,"This is not one of my favorite LA spots to visit. I understand people want to go to say they've been there, but PLEASE.... Find a meter, walk for 5 minutes, take some pictures of the street, look at the nice mall (if you go up a few levels in the mall, you can see the Hollywood sign and take some pictures) and then RUN to your car and get out of this joint. I cannot believe that this is Hollywood? Don't get me wrong, the stars are cool to see and there are a few fun attractions, but I've been a few times now and each time it just gets progressively worse. It feels like a dirty part of Vegas with people dressed up in costumes, people harassing you to go on tours, people begging for anything and everything. I keep hoping it will get better...but so far NO LUCK!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/578LaurenM
40,It is what you make it,I enjoyed seeing the walk of fame. and walking down Hollywood Blvd. It was a very touristy thing to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Temikatae
30,VERY TOURISTIC,"We walk to find stars names, just because our daughters wanted, but i was a little dissapointed with the Hollywood Bvd. in general.As tourists we felt it was a must, so we went and additionally we saw Kodak Theatre, Historic Chinese Theatre, wax museum,Guinness world records museum, we had starbucks coffee and had also lunch there.

30,I wouldnt bother,After reading several poor reviews on here o decided we would drive through the area first and its really run down. We parked up and i had a walk up and down a 200 meter section but didn't spot any well known names (well that i had heard of). I personally didn't think it was worth the trip but if you are a film boff and want to go and find an actual star of someone maybe it would be worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kel1042
20,Go to say you have been and leave quickly,"Dirty and run down. Very busy with tourists. Find your stars name take a photo and go!

20,"a must see, but disappointing","Ok, it was nice we saw the walk of fame, if you are around, you can't drive by it. But it's only one big street, with lots and lots of people I don't like. Guys trying to sell you a product (for example) and when you accept they say 'now give me a few dollar'. So irritating! Also the look alikes are way from good. No, this was not what we expected. Oh one more thing, the 'jezus we love you groupies' were also very irritating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/devriesmartijn
30,Nice walk if you have time.,"It was fun at first to find famous movie stars in the sidewalk, but then we started seeing the same names further down the street or on the other side, so finding the names lost its appeal a little.The stores are not that great but you can get some nice Hollywood souveniers as your looking for the names. There were tons of tourist so there is plenty of energy if you need a boost. Lots of people bugging you to buy tours or CDs or random crap. Its worth it to go once just to say you've been there, but I dont think I will stop again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunnysout

20,Too much construction,"I was so disappointed to drive all the way out here and the whole front of the Chinese theatre is fenced off for construction, are you kidding me? The whole block was under construction and were jimmy kimmels show is filmed is also blocked for the show. The area in Hollywood and highland was nice with shops and restaurants. You can see the Hollywood sign if you squint while looking at it on the fourth level past the smog, otherwise you might just want to drive closer if you have the patience for all the traffic. Good luck, not my cup of tea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/biltrim
30,Meh.,"If you haven't seen it before it's neat, it's a landmark... but when it's all said and done it's just famous people's names on a sidewalk.

20,5 mins is too long,"Very trashy and touristy, with 100's of out of actors trying to sell you something. I was very disappointed with Hollywood, but as a tourist one should at least give it 5 minutes to say that you have been, but would not recommend it if you have to travel far to get there.I do feel that they have missed a trick in Hollywood, they could make this such an enjoyable experience, but alas they have not.Sorry to be so negative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davethebear1953

Lots of stores to pop into that sell souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeLoveTraveling23
40,Fun walk up and down Hollywood Blvd,"We parked our car and went walking. We took many pictures of the numerous stars and even got some shots with a very realistic Michael Jackson look-alike (for only $5). This is nice to visit once and then check off from your bucket list. There are many ""interesting"" characters roaming around. Keep your valuables safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtopel
20,"Tired, dirty and grimy","We visited the walk of fame 2 days ago and disappointed doesn't even cover it. Considering Hollywood is a popular tourist destination and is known the world over the area in general is tired and dirty, someone needs to wash LA!! We parked the car and walked to the 'walk of fame' however the pictures don't show you it's surrounded by bums, tacky porn shops and bars as well as crazy people wandering the streets shouting at the top of their lungs. How do they host such a star spangled event as the Oscars in such a hole?! Had much higher expectations of this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesscoombs91

30,Must see - once only to say you've attended,"The strip is littered with homeless people (harmless) and street performers trying to make a dollar for tips (no issues) , its very crowded and for those who have never been - hollywood isn't what you think. its good to see the stars and find out some facts i.e stars have to pay to have the star put on etc. Beward of the street entertainers with snakes as i didn't expect it and if you have a phobia, one may suprise you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennismel
20,Waste of time ..,"We spent here a little time to see Dolby threatre and stars and marks of the stars on the street. What a waste of time. Trillions of people are bugging you all the time to take their starbus. The hand marks and names in the concret in front of the Chinese theatre was ok and interesting, but that's it pretty much. Just 1h is ok. Park 2 blocks south for 1$/h instead of crazy 20$.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KKBuddy
40,Fame,"Being a fan of movies since childhood this was a great thrill for me to walk and see all the famous names of old, Judy Garland, the one and only Frankie, Spencer Tracy, Bette Davies, Tyrone Powell, Betty Hutton, Ester Williams, Paul Newman, and of coarse Marilyn, lovely day spent tracing a few, well worth the time. My visit to LA was in 1999.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marycairdmeleca
40,Must Do,This is a must do if you are in the area. It is always a lot of fun to walk up and down the strip and see your favorite entertainers. If you show up after 6pm there are a lot of street performers on the strip and makes it even more enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeastMode36
40,in los angeles so had to do it,"it was good fun, yes lots of people trying to sell you tours but hey you just walk on by. got some great photos of stars I wanted - walked both sides and up one of the side streets and hey we see a big crowd and cameras and mikes and we saw stevie wonder and Natalie cole, some music producer was getting a star and they were there. so we were happy with our visit - in shopping mall up the escalaters great place to see Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathS1
40,We finally got to see the Walk of Fame,You hear about it all your life but you simply have to take the walk some day. This is a unique attraction as it is a totally different experience for everyone who takes the walk. There are hundreds of stars on the walk and we all have our own collection of favorites making our walk of memories unique.We actually spent two afternoons in the area. The first day we parked at a meter on Hollywood Blvd. It cost $2 per hour with a one hour limit so we had to feed the meter a couple times. The next day we parked in the Highland Center. If you are going to spend some time this is the best deal.Take your time and enjoy all of the shops and attractions on your walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfuqua
50,The stars on the boulvard!,"There are so many of them to see, but don't keep your head down ya might miss seeing the real thing. I just saw Ryan Renalds yesterday!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianG997
30,Not worth a special trip to Hollywood area,JUst a lot of names set in the sidewalk---more important to those whose names are there than to anyone else.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meralee1122
50,Fabulous fun time.,While Hollywood Blvd. is a little cheesy and dirty this Walk is a must see for any visitor to the city. My family still loves to go down there and check it out and there is great shopping and eating all around! Movies too and easy parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yellowsunfish61
40,Stopped here as part of our LA Tour,"Our hotel in LA organised this tour through a third party company who were very professional and organised.Apart from stopping at other areas we also had time to have a wonder and take photos outside the Chinese Theatre (where all the famous celebrities have their feet and hand prints and names on the pavement) and the walk of fame.The closer you are to the Chinese Theatre, the more likely you will see the famous celeb names from the early eras such as 50s, 60s and 70s. The further you walk away down the full mile of the pavement (on both sides of the road) the more likely you are to see the current celeb names surrounded by the famous star.Beware of the locals dressed up in some of the comic hero costumes including Superman, Spiderman, Batman, Mickey Mouse who will pose for a photo with you in exchange for a couple of dollars - we firstly came across this in New York City's Times Square.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zamyhussain
10,Finally made it to Hollywood and boy was it funky,"So, first time for this Southern girl to venture west; in San Diego (a super wonderful friendly city with an endless array of shopping and restaurants) and decided we were so close to LA we had to drive up and see the Walk of Fame. Been there, done that and won't bother again. Really? - it hasn't crossed the mind of the city leaders to give this area a good scrubbing? And that oh so famous theatre? Well, it hasn't been painted for decades and apparently power washers are not allowed to be used on the sidewalks of Hollywood. And, I really can't think of another tourist destination where you get so harassed by tour companies (doesn't happen in New York City) Dirty gift shops, dirty streets, dirty restaurants. Hooray for Hollywood? Hooray it only took me about 10 minutes to find Marilyn Monroe's slab of concrete so I could get out of there and find some nicer shopping and attractions in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nanna119
30,Once is enough,"Is it free - YesIs it cool - sort ofShould you go if you are visiting LA - YesPlenty of rift raft, begging, sidewalk salesman, small shops, and quick places to eat.Plenty of characters in costumes who want money to take your picture with them next to you.Looking at the stars on the sidewalk is cool but it quickly gets old. You can walk it all in about an hour.We parked at a local garage for ten bucks.We also checked out the hand and feet prints and wax museums. All are ok if you like that sort of thing.You can catch cheap tours of star homes, Rodeo drive, and Beverly Hills all from the walk of fame area.This is the place you do not want to go back to if you live in the LA area and you have guest in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PH-Travel-Lovers
50,The Hollywood Walk of Fame is worth checking,"Hollywood Blvd. itself can be hit or miss. Lots of tourists walking down the street of course, but we did enjoy stopping to check out the nicer restaurants, souvenir shops, and several clothing shops we didn't have in Tallahassee, Florida. There are photo ops everywhere as you see certain people dressed as Transformers characters, Star Wars characters, Michael Jackson, etc.It was fun to be able to see all the stars along the floor. All along the pavement you will see the stars. Most names we weren't familiar with, but you will know which ones are popular when you see a crowd of people around a particular one taking pictures.I would highly recommend you visit this area if you are in CA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinacheS
30,Worth the visit - once - but a bit tacky,"Let it be said from the outset, I am NOT into Hollywood. Despite this I still wanted to see Hollywood Boulevard and the Walk of Fame along with the Chinese Theatre with its foot and hand prints and the Dolby Theatre where the Academy Awards are held.The Walk of Fame is on both sides of the street. It extends for many blocks and many well-known (as well as lesser-known) stars are represented with a pink star. It is fun to walk along finding names.The TLC (ex Grauman) Chinese Theatre is just along from the Dolby (ex Kodak) Theatre. Outside are the foot and hand prints of many stars with their signatures. This area is always crowded and getting photos can be difficult. The Dolby Theatre forecourt has plenty of shops and eating places. On Hollywood Boulevard you can also find Mme Tussaud's wax museum, Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum, various theatres and souvenir stores. You will also find bus companies selling you Hollywood tours. The Grayline hop on-hop off bus stops here. Hollywood/Highland Metro station has its main entrance here as well. If you are lucky, you might see a show being filmed in the street.The boulevard is always full of people dressed up in costumes - Batman, Spiderman, Michael Jackson, Robocop, Mickey Mouse etc. If you want your photo taken with them, be prepared to tip them. There will also be spruikers trying to get you into the souvenir shops or to buy tours.Pros- can be interesting finding the stars- it's free- area feels safe due to crowd numbersCons- can be a bit tacky- can be crowded- the homeless are often on the streets, especially early in the morning. They don't bother you.- if you stop for 5 seconds you will be accosted by someone trying to get you to part with your money- can be difficult to get photosTips1. DON'T buy an expensive map showing you where the stars are. If you are looking for a specific name, its location can easily be found using a Walk Of Fame app available on the iPhone. They are inexpensive and can be used offline.2. Walk up the steps, or take the escalator, to the crosswalk pathway of the Dolby Theatre. From there you can get a great photo of the Hollywood sign.3. Kids love playing with the fountain in the Dolby forecourt. It changes colour and they run between the rising columns of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roddlez
40,Interesting to see,"But do not spend much time there, as there is not much to do beside looking the stars and famous (some not so famous) names on the sidewalk. But is always good to find there the names of your favorit artists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y4405MGsergiod
10,Blackpool with stars on the pavement,This place is a dump cheap gift shops down and outsNo good eating places except buffalo wingsWe was shocked by how bad this place is yes they got stars in the pavement but you can barely look at them because of the whole horrible surroundingsWe got the feeling that everyone who was not selling tours on every corner were eyeing you up to see if they could rob youThis place is really that bad and my first review that I have ever rated a 1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madpartyboy
40,Exactly What I Expected,"If you are in LA, this is a place you would like to go, just because it is featured everywhere. So, yes, we went there to see the stars with the names of the famous on the ground. And that's it. It is kind of confusing to me why people rate this a bad place to visit. It is what it is, a bunch of stars on the floor with famous names on them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Arlyn1
50,alot of people but alot of fun,"Very fun just walking around trying to find our ""stars"". They charge $60 to give you a map showing exactly which star is where so that was dissapointing. We pretty much just walked up one side of the street and down the other and hoped to get lucky! Lots of gift shops and places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yaquelin2
30,Hollywood,"Got to visit Hollywood once, just to say you did. Lots of gift shops that all sell the same thing. On every corner there is someone trying to sell you a celebrity house tour. Good service at Starbucks and Jameson's pub.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrandonF329
30,"Have to see it, but only once!","Not sure our expectations, apart from seeing new stars being added on TV, so when visiting California, we had to walk along the Hollywood Boulevard!First issue was parking, there are parking lots just off the back of the street, but they want $15 to park, which is fine if you are there for the day. I asked if they could apply a rate for an hour (we justed wanted a walk up and down some of the street) to be told its a flat rate, so I drove out. We got parked easily near Madame Tussauds, on a parking meter. You stick your credit card in, enter your space number, and its $1.50 for an hour!Then you just get bombarded with everything from tours to paying for pictures of poorly dressed up wannabe's, to leaflets for shows etc etc. One woman dressed as a cop put her hand in front of her face cos she thought I was trying to get a free pic! Only realised later, and her hand is stuffed with dollars! - see attached pic!We got a nice surprise when we walked into an open air mall of shops and restaurants, and stumbled upon an area where we could see the Hollywood sign! Theres a pic attached of the entrance to it.Good to walk along and see all the names on the stars, but like I say in the strapline, only once. Dont need to go back now!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m4xwl
50,Famous hands & Footprints,"On Hollywood sidewalks, most of the celebrities, from the distant past, to current Stars, have had their hands and footprints enshrined in wet concrete on this cement Hall of Fame. It's really amazing to place your hand into the convex mold of these great stars. Amazingly, they were shockingly small prints for what I found, compared to what I imagined and actually REALLY imprinted into the wet cement, by stars walking/working in Hollywood. It seems that people were MUCH smaller during the 40's and 50's. One of the few exceptions to this, was Hulk Hogan, a massive man, but he was born much later. Charlie Chaplin, had hands and foot prints, comparable to a 10 year old boy. I guess the lack of growth hormones (common today) in most meat and vegetables; was lacking so many years ago. In fact a few years ago, I was in Europe, Heidelberg/ Berncastle, Austria/Germany and visited where Mozart wrote so many of his symphonies, and to view his grand piano and stool he sat on was similar to a 10 year old boy today. Even what looked like the Knights of the round table ( as armored external outfits), looked like they were no more than 4 foot 6 inches tall. REALLY AMAZING!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimGoHabsGo
40,A must see if in Hollywood,"This is nothing spectacular - but also a ""Must Do"" when visiting. It's great just walking and reading all the stars that have their names... Several were covered for construction, but still a good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerrickN207
30,"OK, But nothing to brag about","I expected so much more. I am from NYC and to me it felt like I was in Times Square. Tour buses everywhere, all sorts of characters trying to get you to take pics with them, guys trying to sell you their CDs. I literally felt like I was in Times Square as we have all the same characters trying to feed off unsuspecting tourists.. The walk was nice but I felt a little disappointed.. It wasn't the Hollywood I expected it to be.. Sorry..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lydiaerd
20,Hollywood...not quite what you expect..!,"Although very magical in terms of the whole Hollywood dream and the excitement of the big screen, Hollywood is a rather disappointing sight once you see it. The sidewalks are lined with the stars but many are in front of dumpy stores and/or less appealing locations on the street. The only area with a slightly bigger appeal and draw is the ones in front of the Chinese Theatre. This area is also the location of the cement hand/foot prints as well as the theatre for the Oscars. However be prepared to be confronted by less than welcomed characters in costume wanting your money for a photograph. ( Think Spiderman, Mini- Darth Vader, Batman, cartoon characters ) Many of them are dirty looking and rather scary. Also do your best to avoid the Music CD pushing guys. ""Heres a CD, check out my music"". Then they follow you trying to get a few bucks. Hollywood is far from the days of mega stars and fancy studios. Most Movie studios are miles away! Its fun to see once and than move on. Not worth more than the 2 hour metered parking",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zzixor1
40,"No glitz, no glamour, but still a kick","The extreme homelessness in LA is overwhelming. And it is very apparent in this area. But if you are out to see LA, like we were for the first time--just go to do the tourist thing and see the walk. There are lots of tacky shops--just walk on by, and look at the stars...because they really are impressive in the history. If you stop for a pop, be sure to use the bathroom because facilities are hard to find. Skip the hollywood homes tours with all the buses in this area...save you cash because God knows this city will suck it up elsewhere! Just find the fun in the area...with this and grauman's just up the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BBMT
50,The Heart of Hollywood: Hollywood Walk of Fame,"Your Hollywood experience should begin here. The ""stars"" on the sidewalk are what most of us remember as children dreaming of Hollywood.

Its a dirty street with many tour selling stuff. and a lot of smoke shops as well, you will see many homeless people going around and ask you for changes. You will feel unsecured to walking down there. If you carry a big camera in the street walking, those local sell people will know you as tourists, and non stop pursued you to join their tour programs. Just be aware of this. That was my first time there in LA and Hollywood, this place just totally disappointed.

20,Not what you think...,"With this being my 1st visit to LA & Hollywood, it's not as impressive as you think. Hollywood in general is quite dirty & loaded with either homeless people or wannabe stars trying to sell you crap. Walking along the walk of fame is really tricky, try & take a picture without someone bumping into you, selling you something or throwing a ""celebrity homes"" tour in your face. To be honest, I would advise you go to spend your time elsewhere.For cheap parking, park at the Hollywood & Highland Center, its $2 if you buy something in any of the shops in the center. We bought a $1.50 orange juice, otherwise the parking minimum is $6 at least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jables89

Filled with drug users and broke acters selling maps and rides of Beverly hills. The sidewalks were packed, and filthy. A highlight for me was the private tour of the Chinese mann theater. We also checked out a movie at the world famous el capitan theater. I would advise skipping the headache of coming out here by car. Take the metro instead. It quick and cheap. hassle free. If you must go, then allocate about an hours time to do the private tour. its worth every penny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikej734

40,fairy dust in the sidewalk,"Tourists, especially older ones, love the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It is an area around Sunset and Vine but it covers a lot of sidewalks. Fun area for taking pics. Some of the more famous stars are located in front of big theaters like Grauman's Chinese or Kodak (it has a new name now), which allows for a touch of Old Hollywood Glamor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/queenwendy
30,Dramatic setting but a bad area,"For anyone who hasn't been to the Walk of Fame or Grauman's Chinese Theater, it's pretty shocking to see all the signs and billboards everywhere. You will notice landmarks that you might have seen on t.v like the Kodak Theater and the El Capitan Theater, but you might also notice the area these places are in. This attraction is not in a good area, so if you'r thinking that the Hollywood Walk of Fame will be all glamorous and stars will be just walking around, think not. Instead you might run into a fake Elvis who wants you'r cash if you snap a pic of him. There are also men down there who bang on these buckets with sticks and get very angry if you don't give them money for their poor performances. Also, parking is a toughy, if you want anything around the area you have to give up 20$. Thats the Hollywood Walk of Fame for you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gokifwaz
30,Worth seeing once,"Kind of neat to see but it's something I would only do once. The whole street is covered with shops, tattoo salons and bars. They do have homeless people and LOTS of your companies trying to take you to celeb houses, Hollywood signs, etc. (politely say no thank you and that's all you need to do). Not sure LA is for me but definitely something worth checking out if you're in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alwaysmiling43062
30,"It's crazy,the stars of old and new stars were all mixed together","It's very confusing to find the stars of your favorite actors, actresses, characters, etc. It's crazy, the stars of old and new stars were all mixed together. Starting from La Brea Ave. to Highland Blvd, stars were scattered on both sides of the walkways. The only one that close together were the Bridges family, Lee Majors and Farrah Faucet. Also, there were a lot of people looking and taking pictures of the stars of their favorite actors. In addition, there were several people dressed like the avengers, Marlyn Monroe, Pirates of the Carribean, Mikey Mouse, etc, that you can have pictures with them with a price of course. Of course, watch out for your wallet and pocket book in any crowd. I recommend to put your valuables in your hotel safe before heading to a big crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaimel351
40,Worth a visit!,"Nice to see, and take a few pictures. Just watch out for people trying to sell you their cds and the tour operators can be a little pushy. Also watch out for ppl in costumes that want your money. I would stay near Hollywood and highland if you're pressed for time, so you can see some theatres too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doug2244
30,Overrated and Crazy,"We stayed just on the walk of fame. The majority of the walk of fame is not hectic, but the stretch near the Dolby and Graumans theatre is just crazy. The crowds are massive and it's impossible to work out what stars are in that area. Overall good to see, but I wouldn't recommend staying too long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kingcalo
40,A lot of fun,"I recently visited LA and had a lot of fun. I stayed in downtown hollywood and the walk of fame was right there once I exited my Hotel and got out of the connected mall. While you may get tired after a little bit (There are so many stars to look at!!), overall, it is worth at least a visit once in you lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/texanindiaguy
30,Loved the Hollywood Sign,I was expecting more - however I did visit during the day. May have been more lively at night. Lots of people soliciting for tours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MizScorpio
30,crazy croweded and a lot of people trying to sell you things,"Ventured down to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was neat to see but we spent very little time there. It is very crowded and there are people every ten feet trying to sell you something (tours, jewelry, picutres, etc). Be aware of the guys handing out their CDs. They will try to ""give"" you a CD. If you take it they then ask for money. We actually witnessed this and it was very uncomfortable. Just a firm No thank you and keep walking. There were a couple that tried following us and trying to hand us the discs but we just kept walking. This is such a spoiler for something that is otherwise very neat to see. There are also tons of people dressed as different characters. You can take pictures for a ""donation"" to them. These folks didn't bother us but we didn't have children or show them any interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesslynn064
40,A Hollywood Must-Do,"I don't care if you're a tourist or grew up here in Southern California. Anyone who likes movies or anything about the entertainment industry should come here at least one time if tehy can. It's so cool to see all the names, handprints and footprints. The new mall they erected is good and offers moderately-priced garage parking (great for hot summers). There are loads of tours available right on the street if you want to hop on one, or you can just walk along at your leisure and find your fave celebs. NOTE: the area near Grauman's Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre and the new mall (corner of Hollywood and Highland) is just fine. But you may not want to venture too far with small kids or on your own. The outer areas where the star walk kind of dwindles is unsavery. There will be pick pockets and probably a hooker or two. Just be warned is all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicoleF880
20,TRASHY DIRTY STREET,"It is FUN to go down the walk of fame and see your favorite stars, stars. However, it is very dangerous dirty and unsafe. To be honest, I would never go back. Other than finding your favorite stars star there is really nothing to do in Hollywood. If you are short on time, skip this and go directly to BEVERLY HILLS. make syre you have mace or some type of self defense with you as it is dangerous there. The three hours I spent in Hollywood was more than enough. In real life it is NOTHING like they show on TV.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRAVELDEB_10
30,Watch your step!,"The good - the stars on the walk of fame. It's great to walk and see the stars that you grew up with and loved recognized for their works with a star.The bad - the homeless and junkies walking around harassing visitors and even screaming at people for just walking by. It was disgusting when we almost stepped in human feces right in the middle of the sidewalk. Be cautious of your surroundings and those around you.Some of the vendors for tours can be pushy and aggressive and an FYI...If you take a picture with a ""character"" they do expect to be paid for their time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AprilH160
50,Take a Walk on the Wild Side!,Loved Hollywood Walk of Fame...it was crowded and a party-like atmosphere but so much fun! Many shops and restaurants and finding the star of your favorite celebrity is a must! Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillianD953
30,Interesting to see,"Go there, see the walk, see the four silver ladies gazebo statues. There are so many shops to buy gifts. We have our favorites. My words of advice is to not look or act like a tourist and watch out for pick pockets. Act like you've walked this street countless times. If you do these things, I think your trip will be more enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/374dw
30,"Overrated, but fun if you're in the area","This is a neat place to visit, but don't have high expectations. Hollywood is a touristy but otherwise fairly normal Los Angeles neighborhood. The street is busy with tourists and people selling tours and trinkets.It was neat seeing a few of the stars that I liked. I spent about 15 minutes there, which is probably enough for people not obsessed with Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NathanS417
20,Not for little kids,"We had an hour just to take a few pics @ Walk Of Fame. There were a ton of people. As soon as we parked a guy was peeing on the sidewalk infront of everyone. The walk was not pleasant, due to many vendors trying to sell you anything they had. People begging for money. It was very dirty and much of the side walk was broken up. It's very hard to push a stroller. This is was our first visit to LA. So we decided to do this attraction. The view of the Hollywood sign is great from there. We went to the Griffith observatory and by reviews thought we would get better pics of the sign but it was to small from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rocharocha2018
20,Overrated for sure,"A sleazy kinda feel to the whole thing. Every 5 feet someone is trying to sell you a tour of stars homes, funny smells every so often, the odd hobo asleep in a corner, and of course the photo guys in their halloween superhero costumes. If you want to feel like a total tourist walk up and down this strip of road. The area itself is quite sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpattison
30,"So, so.","Iconic. I guess it's worth a brief visit if you love Hollywood history, but it seemed like a tacky t-shirt shop sort of place to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CW1807
20,Disappointing,"As the Walk of Fame is a well-know landmark in Hollywood, my expectations were reasonably high. Sadly they were not met! Essentially the stars in isolation are rather nice to look at, however glance upwards at the surrounding area and you'll realise that it really is nothing more than a sidewalk through a myriad of tacky souvenir shops and fast food outlets. In actual fact, I had to drive over a couple of stars in order to get into a carpark (the stars carried on across the car park entrance!)Overall I left feeling disappointed - certainly not what I expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wycombe-Simon
20,Overrated,"Was looking forward to this having seen marvelous footage on TV but was very disappointed.The area could do with a jolly good clean and the walk of fame is in need of a refurb, with damaged paving slabs and stars alike.Be prepared to be asked to take celebrity tours every few yards and have your photos taken with 'superheros and stars'.Tacky with the usual souvenir shops...all that was missing was 'Kiss me Quick' hats!!!!Still a must while on vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve-and-Andie
40,There I was,"It's only a street, but but engraved on the long sidewalk there are not only the signatures of people who were big in movies and music, but also the dreams of the little boy who is inside each of us",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GdN80100
30,Not what I expected.,"I guess, how exciting can a path of stars on the ground get? I just expected to know more of the stars. My husband did inform me, basically anyone with enough money can pay their way onto the walk of fame..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMyers331
30,Once you've done a few - it's a bit dull.,"I think once you walked about 100 yards either side of Hollywood Boulevard, you'll have had enough of this. Lots of names in stars on the floor & that's it. There are so many of them that you will be clueless about (who's he/she?). Worth going to say you've done it and have your photo with the odd one or two (Russell Crowe, Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johannsson) - but then go and have a coffee!!. I agree with other reviews on here. It is quite grotty (and a bit tacky) and the people who try and sell you a tour or a picture with them are annoying. That is unless you want a photo with a chubby spiderman.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidM096
20,"Tacky, it's a shame.","It's cool to see the stars with your favorite actors directors etc. but it is ruined by people trying to sell you rubbish tours, various shops selling tat, and ""rappers"" trying to force their CDs on gullible tourists, we did not buy any of their (probably blank) CDs, but saw them put CDs in to tourists hands and then demand payment, Grumman's and the Dolby Theater are beautiful and it's worth going to look at the outsides. Oh there are also druggies around begging. It is worth a visit, I never felt in danger or intimidated as others have suggested, it just feels tacky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentw91
40,One of those things you must see,Can't go to Hollywood and not get your picture taken next to the star of one of your favorite actors. And it's free,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712christineg
20,Very dirty sidewalk,"There are several problems with this walk 1) the sidewalk is not kept up...there are cracks and holes in many places, 2) 90% of the walk is situated along the part of Hollywood Blvd. which is dirty and frequented by people who seem to be transients, bums, or heavily tattooed. I always have the feeling that I must keep an eye out for my safety.The third reason why this walk is disappointing because the Chamber of Commerce, in what seems like a blatant attempt to enrich their treasury (a star pays money to get a star on the walk), have been honoring people that are not famous (Art Laboe), local celebrities known only in L.A. (Bill Handel), cartoon characters (Big Bird), and groups of people (Rush).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
30,if you're into that,It's ok and kinda fun at first but it got old quick. Not really sure of the appeal. I wish I had brought along gold letters so I could have made my own star while I was there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agw7777
40,A dream come true for some and totally boring for others,"Located in a trendy neighbourhood, this is a great highlight for many film-lovers and wanna-be celebrities. The only problem with this is landmark is that a lot of hustlers are around. I personally had the time of my life here due to my love for films and television. Thankfully there is a metro station nearby so you don't have to worry about driving (L.A public transportation is horrible). Definitely go to the Chinese Theatre and see the hand-prints of the various stars in front of it. If you are running low on time, at least go to the Kodak Theatre (this is where the annual Academy Awards are held).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/celleo
50,Welcome to Hollywood - what's your dream?,"Wow! You see it on the TV and in all the big movies, but to arrive there and stand on the stars yourself was just mind blowing for me. It still seems so surreal to say that we walked down Hollywood Boulevard where some of the worlds most famous people have stood.There is parking close by. We used a multistorey car park where they charge by the 15 minutes. So we didn't spend too long here. The majority of people were tourists all taking photos, so prepare yourself to wait to get the shot you want without others being in it.I would have liked to spend longer here taking in all the sights and attractions, but as I say, parking is expensive.This place is so cool and no one can take that away from you. Despite some people saying it's tacky, you will never find anywhere else like it, it is the one and only original and it has to be seen to be believed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SquidgyPidgy
30,Is that all there is?,"Living across the continent, I always had ideas of how cool the Hollywood Walk of Fame must be. So when I finally got the chance to go to LA, I took the time to head to Hollywood to see it for myself. Pretty disappointing. I enjoyed seeing the ""stars"" of my favorite actors, but there wasn't anything special about it. Such an opportunity to truly celebrate the Hollywood legend wasted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rgc1600
40,Out On The Street,"You walk on the stars. They are underfoot. And when they die, the flowers appear like wild flowers. Hollywood is the most disappointing tourist destination extant. The Walk of Fame is no Cooperstown. No one looks for athletic paragons on a plaque here. Sportswriters do not argue endless nights about glory. You walk on the stars. And the stars' fans pay for the ""plaques"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTW72
40,Not at all what I expected,"I came at an exciting although weird time - the week of the Oscars. The set construction and security made maneuvering around more difficult and I assume more crowded. The area was dirtier and more run-down than I expected as well. There are a few ""nice"" places to shop on the strip, but it's mainly tourist shops selling Hollywood souvenirs. Additionally, I had no idea the Oscars were essentially held in a mall theatre. You don't see the mall shops since they are hidden by drapes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrandonW957
50,Awesome landmark,"This place is so cool. good photo op. I love seeing all the different stars' names, and it is an amazing landmark that a vacationer has to visit. New stars are often added, and it could be your favorite movie star! This place is right downtown near a lot of other tourist-y things that you should check out as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophiem910
50,Golden moment,It so exciting to just know at one point in time that star was actually there i enjoyed walking up both sides of the street taking pics of my favorite star i found Michael Jackson star & yes i took pics touching his star it took a minute cause me & every one else this was the main attention the sidewalks are very packed with people but its a once in a life time moment enjoyed every second.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mz_Washington
30,Its just a sidewalk!,"So, I see all these tourists walking down the Walk of Fame to take their picture next to their favorite star; that is great and if everyone does just that they will have a fine experience.Remember everyone, its just a sidewalk, thats it - no attraction.The problem is that the local homeless and crazies (we have plenty in L.A) have learned that they can get your tourist dollars if they dress like a famous character and hang around on the famous side walk (that is the Walk of Fame).Where I start to cringe is when I see a tourist hand their child to Marilyn Monroe (local crazy person in a wig) to take their picture. These ""characters"" are not employed, not background checked and likely not normal. Please please keep it to side walking and avoid the unsanctioned ""attractions"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferQ975
20,gross,"i read the other reviews on trip advisor. i figured i've been to NYC many times, how bad can Hollywood Blvd be? Well, let me tell you, it is gross and a little scarey. All my dauther wanted to do on our recent trip to LA for her 16th birthday was go see Ellen's star on the walk of fame. She could not get out of there fast enough. We did walk along the blvd and see many of the stars (many of them she just didn't recognize, but I did), and I told her we could find out specifically where Ellen's star was and come back. She told me she never wanted to go back there. We went to one of the resturants, and even our waiter told us that we should not be there after dark. I think it's sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traceyl603
40,"Fun walking amongst the ""stars""","It was fun walking and finding your favorite stars. Lots of folks trying to sell you tours or asking for money. It is real easy to ignore them and focus on the stars. If you are a Harry Potter fan,, check out the hand prints in front of the TCL Theatre. Lots of walking, but it is fun and free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladyomaha
40,CROWDED!!!!,It was nice to seek out the stars on the ground just be aware that it gets really crowded. Everyone is walking around staring at the ground. There is always a crowd around the Michael Jackson star. Its good fun. A must do in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjsanchez
40,Tourist Delight,"If you love movie stars, this is the place to go. A must see for most tourists visiting Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JSW842
20,Run down area,"I suppose you have to do this, but I was disappointed. Probably expected something more galmorous. Area is quite run down, there are a lot of stars but it is luck of the draw if you find the actor who you are looking for. Lots of homeless people, people trying to get you on a Hollywood guided tour,run down shops.Best bit according to teenage kids was the refreshments at Starbucks, says it all for me.Like I said, having made the journey from the UK you have to do this, but can not really recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/896JanK896
50,Just like on TV,"Walk around, take pictures with the stars you like the most, and do not miss the Kodak theater which is along the way. The place is normally very busy, but there is near by parking and the GPS will take you right to it. Come to Hollywood and not visit the walk of fame is a sin.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrEg0n
10,Very disappointing.,"We drove from San Diego to Hollywood to see the walk of fame. We thought it would be glamorous and ritzy. Just the opposite!! It was dumpy, had cheesy gift shops all down the street, homeless people everywhere you looked. Not in a safe neighborhood at all! There is 1 nice upscale shopping area right in the middle (which was wierd because it was in the middle of the ghetto street). Rodeo drive is just as bad. The street itself is nice with very upscale stores, but 2 streets away is the ghetto with garbage all over. I would not recomment going to Hollywood to anyone. Extremely disappointing!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelli0502
40,very fun,"It was a week prior to the Academy awards, parking was very limited. Very crowded, many characters from movies walking around for you to take a picture with be prepared to flip them a couple of bucks, that is how they make a living. LOVED the Spider-man character!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseA992
30,Walk of stars and tackiness,"Our first time here, it was a buzz to try and spot your favourite stars name on the sidewalk. But the shear number of people and the terrible tshirt and junk shops lining the stars is a real shame. This is a grimy neighbourhood and we would not walk there at night. Too bad there were not some nice cafes around with outdoor chairs, instead of being harassed to take a tour to see a stars front fence. I would never go back but I did enjoy seeing how big and small some of the stars hands were outside Graumans Chinese theatre. We were there on a Sunday afternoon at 4 pm it was busy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsWorldly
50,Definitely on the Bucket List,"Going down there with the family sounds more involved than what it is. Parking is easy, and you can have it validated at one of the restaurants in the shopping mall. It looks cool on TV, and it's even cooler in person! The kids had a good time! You will be able to see all of the ""characters"" on the walk.. like Pirates of the Caribbean, and Tom and Jerry! What fun!TIP: Park in the garage next to the mall near Loewe's Theatre. Get validated at the Auntie Annies, or other smaller restaurants, for cheaper parking! Walk 'til your heart's content!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Debsfulton
30,Famous but maybe too much?,"The walk of fame is actually quite narrow walk way along the Hollywood boulevard. Every each of the stars is aligned to opposite direction so you need to rotate your head all the time to see names. Also while looking the stars, you feel you are obstructing peoples way. But hey, still worth to visit. There are amazing shops along the walk of fame! You can find public parking spots at side streets from the walk of fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SirRahikkala
40,"""Star-studded"" sidewalks - look for your favorites from Hollywood!","A walk on the ""Star-studded"" sidewalks, on both sides of Hollywood Boulevard, looking for one's favorite Hollywood Stars & other famous names engraved on the stars on the sidewalks may look silly, but is worth experiencing. Apart from the stars on the sidewalks with the names of Hollywood Greats, one can see and if you like, for a fee, take pictures with ""dressed-up"" Hollywood Characters & Stars. Around this place there are a lot of souvenier shops where one can buy nick-nack gift items. If one has the time and interest, bus-tours are available right there which take you around to show the Star homes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler-O-World

20,not a fan,"if you want to look at the sidewalk for a star's name, take a picture and walk on that's the extent of the adventure. Look a likes in costumes attempt to get you to pay for a picture with them. What are you going to do with that? Show your friends you were saw a fake Lady Ga Ga? In front of the Grauman theater it is remarkable how small the stars feet and hands were otherwise not much else to see. In front of the theater there is an entrance roped off.

You have to have a rental car with a GPS ake your own. With a car u get to do and see more.
