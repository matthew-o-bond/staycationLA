50,Working up a sweat,My wife and I visited early Saturday Morning whilst on holiday in LA. We got to the bottom and parked for free at around 7am and took the steps up and the track back down. The walk is more strenuous than it looks with each step requiring more of a lunge than a step. Loads of locals and tourists there going for their morning work out. Well worth a visit with several juice trucks at the bottom.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyager46031510283

50,I loved the view on entire Los Angeles,I was driving by so I got on top of this hill via car. There is a small parking lot on the top but it was not crowded since most people here got on the top by food...most of them are people who exercise and want to stay fit or loose weight....great views of LAif I remember parking was only $2and there is a state of the art visitor center on the top but check hours (I believe they closed it at 5pm),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6378WFannag

50,Great Workout and Views,"The Baldwin Hills steps up to the scenic overlook are a great workout, with each step being fairly tall and they go on and on! There are also switchback trails you can do to climb to the top and see the panoramic overlook of Culver City and downtown LA! Remember your sunscreen!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdgierl
50,"Beetles, snails, doves, Rabbits keeps my son buay","The wildlife along these steps keeps my kid busy. The steps remind me of life too, some are tall to and some not so much. It does feel like a workout after doing it sometimes once, sometimes twice. I have seen many do it five times plus. Takes about 7 to 11 minutes to climb depending upon what we see along the way. Only petpieve is finding parking here. There is a cop prowling and will not hesitate to issue citations for every minor mistake of not making proper U turn, or traffic obstruction when we wait for someone to pull out, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viswanathu2017
40,A good workout with great views,"This is a very popular spot to get your sweat on. Most people park along Jefferson Blvd, but you can access the Scenic Overlook and its killer stairs from the parking lots near the Boneyard Dog Park, baseball fields, and the Overlook lot. Depending on where you start, you can tackle the entire set of stairs that go straight up the hill, or do a partial stair climb by using the network of trails to gradually climb or descend. Either way, you'll be in good company and enjoy expansive views from the coast to downtown Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gmarsh726
30,Good workout,"These steps provide a good workout, and there’s a great view from uptop. Be aware that there is something like a huge microwave (not sure if that’s accurate) tower around the summit. I don’t really know if I want exposure to whatever that is, so I don’t go here often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dave90230

40,Nice Place to Take Visitors,"Very scenic overlook. I took the easy way up and paid $2 to park at the top long enough to take some pictures and enjoy the beauty. I highly recommend that the city mount a permanent pictorial chart which locates some of the most significant sites in L.A. - it's kind of difficult to know what we're looking at without a reference. There are a few such charts around the overlook area, but they are more about flora and fauna.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentTraveller034

40,Beware of Smash and Grab Break-Ins,"We were parked on the street and returned to our car and found a broken passenger window. They grabbed a canvas bag containing homework from a Spanish class. From San Francisco and very familiar with car break-in issues there. Do not leave anything visible in your car. Put backpacks, bags in trunk. Hike was nice but short and fairly crowded. We visited on a Friday. Also no dogs allowed. Told it is super crowded on weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babygame
50,Base Jumping Awesomeness!!,"While passing by a couple hot chicks in yoga pants, I realized I left my parachute in the car. That's ok because I passed by 50 more hot chicks in the way down the stairs while walking backwards.I brought my dog with me, but since dogs are not allowed, they shot him with a 12 gage double barreled LC Smith from 1903. It was not retro fitted with a stainless steel barrel, so it exploded and blew the left side of the ranger's face off. No biggie.I climbed up the stairs in 45 seconds (a personal record) jumped over the railing, and parachuted all the way down the side of the hill. A big gust of wind blew me all the way to Skins,,the gentlemen's club where I was blown again.You gotta love those freakin' stairs! A+ !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gtrla
40,Cool Park with Great Views,"Seems to me most people are here for exercise. Most people park on the street and bike, walk or jog up the hill. If you want to just go up top just know you have to pay for parking up there ($2/hour.) Up top there's a nature center with info (it closes at 5pm), bathrooms and hiking trails. The views are amazing. And you get them all: downtown, coast, the city. Really nice place to get your sweat on or just sit and relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms
50,Strenuous exercise nets you a fabulous view!,This is a super popular attraction for fitness buffs. Park on the street and climb a bunch of stairs to get to a great lookout with a wonderful view of LA. You can also drive up to the top but there are only a handful of parking spots and (as I recall) the parking charge is pretty hefty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveldan21
50,Amazing view to watch the fireworks!!!,"The climb was a nice mild workout in the dark, but it was well worth it. We had a panoramic view of the 4th of July fireworks over the entire area. It's best to stay on the path, but we had no problem trekking through the other paths, with a 3 year old in tow. It's easier to climb up the steps than it is to come down, since many of the stairs aren't evenly spaced. If you are looking for an amazing view, this is the place to go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/227tanyam
50,Sweeping views from DT to the ocean,"Great stop to get in some exercise and see a spectacular view of LA - from DT, to the Hollywood sign, Wilshire corridor, Malibu, LAX and even Catalina Island on a clear day! Great nature center at the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulah888

50,Lunchtime Break at The Stairs,"I parked on Jefferson Blvd along Ballona Creek at around 1:00 pm on a Monday. The place was pretty busy as it seems to be a popular location for locals whether they be residents or nearby workers. I found parking about 100 yards away from the trailhead. Two-hour parking was free.I crossed the street at the crosswalk and approached the trailhead. Here I saw that there was a road going up along with a paved trail going up to the right. Up to the left was the switchback trail that led up to the base of “the stairs.”I opted for the stairs. I have arthritic knees and am not in the best of shape, but I made it up around three-fourths of the way up before needing a breather. I used another ascending person to help pave myself. After about a minute, I continued to the top. I was exhausted and was coughing a little, but recovered quickly and was able to enjoy the scenery.There were lots of people up there sightseeing and exercising. The interpretive center was closed for some reason.The way down was much easier though there is a falling risk when descending and these stairs are unforgiving should one fall.Definitely bring water and dress appropriately for the weather. Don’t bring your dogs; they’re not allowed. Not even the cutsey ones you carry in your purse. I saw at least two violators of the dog rule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SummumBonum
50,Amazing views!,"This is a great workout if you choose to take the stairs. It's a lunge with every step if you are little like me.There's free street parking.

40,Fun local work out with an amazing View,The Baldwin hill Scenic Overlook is one of my favorite spots in Culver City. It is 288 very steep steps to the top but the view is totally worth it. You can see from Downtown LA to Brentwood to Torrance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnalieseD
50,Great workout with fabulous view for reward,"Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook is actually located in Culver City on Jefferson between Overland and Jefferson. This is a 53 acre public park and is free. The reason for it's popularity is the challenging 300 steps that take you from Jefferson to the top of the hill. It is an elevation gain of about 500 feet. At the top of the hill, you will find restrooms, a fabulous 360 degree view which on a clear day will give you a look at downtown LA to the north east and the beach to the west. There is a small visitor center. Not very exciting. The steps are big and challenging. If you want to take an easier route, there are a couple of hiking routes which zig zag up the hill instead of going straight up. Much easier. You can take the steps part way and switch to the trail. They intersect at about 4 points going up the hill. If you just want the view, you can drive up, but there is a parking fee. On weekends, it's hard to find parking on Jefferson. This is a very popular activity. You will get some exercise just getting to the trailhead. There is no food available in the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850annettem
50,Excruciating steps with an amazing view,If you're brace you will climb the steps a couple times with your reward being a 360 view of Los Angeles with an awesome breeze. Otherwise you can take the trail up and down which still has the same reward. Beware there have been snake sightings but no rattlesnakes live in the area and no poisonous snakes at all. It does get crowded but still well worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/622michelled

It's a great outdoor activity, the fantastic views are added bonus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BMCinCTG
40,"Good workout, great view","I had heard of this place and finally decided to check it out. Best if you drive there, although there's limited parking at street level so consider Uber'ing there. However, you can actually get there from the Metro and in true Trekker form that's what I did. Get off the metro where Washington crosses National, and you can either walk back along National till you reach Jefferson (then head south) or go down Washington to Higuera to loop back to Jefferson. From the Metro station it was about 1 mile walk, a good warmup for the climb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestwoodTrekker
50,Gorgeous Scenic Views,"This is one of my favorite places to go to just because the view is so beautiful and clean. I frequently come here to workout and utilize the free things the community has to offer. There are no dogs allowed, you need good shoes and don't forget your water because you're going to sweat as usual. Also, you might run into free workout sessions make sure you take advantage 😆",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Queencrez
50,Peak Experience,"This is an amazing scenic overlook that you can walk up to the top of from street level. The scenes from up top, which includes all of LA and the Hollywood sign, are fabulous.You can walk up steps, which are a straight line to the top and look (and sure seem to be) brutal to take, unless you are really fit and want that degree of exercise (a lot people do). Instead, we took the switchback trails that enable you to climb on a steady, but manageable, grade. Great hiking for being able to walk and talk (and chew gum, if you want) at the same time. Nice activity for a couple for a family with children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acinonyx60

40,Fantastic views of the whole of LA,"Decided to take the trail to the top - the steps are brutal so we took the path that winds to the top of the hill. An easy walk - not too difficult, and well worth the view when you reach the top. A great way to spend a few hours - we did it when it was sunny but quite cool so suspect it would be much harder in hotter weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ditsy_11
50,You better be ready to work out!,"I've frequented this area for years, I guess its about time to review right? This is an AWESOME hiking place AND work out area for those mile high stairs.

40,Great views,Although I grew up in LA this was my first time here.282 stairs (Culver City Stairs) lead to the top and they aren't easy as they are very irregular. You can also take the path if you don'*t want to take the stairs.Great for your workout too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Goddess_in_KA
30,Great workout and viewpoint of LA (but not much more),"Great place for a workout, either up the 275 about 12"" high (sometimes more!) steps or up the road. A stout test for joggers and cyclists. Morning cyclists should note that the road can be blocked at a couple locations about half-way up until the park ""opens,"" but the road is often open before the stated times, especially in summer. Joggers can split up the elevation by running up the road in Botts Park (adjacent to the west) and traversing along a path around the high baseball field to a side entrance to Baldwin Hills. (There's a gate on this path that gets locked at night, but it too is often opened before official park opening hours in the summer, or it can be easily scaled.) On weekend mornings, the park often has many serious walkers, hikers, joggers, runners - few posers.On a clear day, you are rewarded with a panorama from downtown LA to Santa Monica. You can also often see the Hollywood sign. There's bathrooms, a small interpretive center, and a plain shelter. There's not much more than that, but it's great for a workout and view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C9231AFalexg

40,Top of the world Ma!,"This facility is clearly in the sights of the fit and healthy in LA, so no shortage of takers. You have an option of climbing straight up what are called steps, but are more random sized blocks set at random distance from the next makes for a challenging workout especially going up. There is an option of a curved dirt track. The hill is nothing spectacular but once on top the views over LA are, downtown, coast and hills all in view. Worth the effort, in true LA style if you really don't fancy the walk, you can drive to the top! car is king here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JGillis51
40,Great Workout!,The infamous Culver City stairs! Yes I finally got a chance to do this awesome workout! I really love the fact that it offers such a wonderful view AFTER you have climbed a million and one stairs. It's not as easy as it looks but it also isn't too hard! I will say though if you are completely out of shape then you might want to take it easy! I ended up here because Runyon is closed and plus I wanted to try something new. I brought my best friend here because he literally lives maybe 5 minutes away and has never been before either. All in all it's a great workout and I will definitely be back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BugattiBoi88
50,Breathtaking view but lots of stairs,Good moderate workout climbing all those stairs. Parking along street or at top in park's lot for $6. Make sure you bring water and sun hat. Not recommended for those out of shape or with cardio/asthma. The view is spectacular. Not a long hike; we did it twice for the workout. Best to go early morning or sunset. Opens at 08:00am.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_ligayaginsburg
50,I found my thrill...,"Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook is an awesome destination if you're in Culver City or near the downtown LA area. There are three ways to get there: take the stairs, walk the trail, or drive to the visitor's center. I was in LA for only a few days and found it necessary to go TWICE!! There are over 250 stairs and the hike using them is as such a steep incline you can't help but get a grueling workout. It is the most direct route to a spectacular view of the surrounding city and the most taxing. It is not uncommon to see people running up and down the stairs or even do various plyometric exercises at it's peak. I also liked the juice and fruit vendors at the base ready to help you ""treat yo'self"" after your walk/jog/run.The most difficult part, besides the stairs, is finding a place to park. The first time I got lucky and someone was leaving. The second time I parked about 2 blocks away so I thought of that as my pre-workout workout. Both times I went during the early-mid morning but I imagine the park is quite busy all the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cml969

50,Great quick workout with spectacular panorama views of LA,"Not too difficult if you're a beginner. The steps are quite steep, so maybe stick to the trails.

If you aren't able to climb the stone stairs then you can walk on the dirt trail the whole width of the hill going around and around until you reach the top. There is also a street that many people jog/walk up and down on. There are different ways to get to the top of the hill and once you get there the view is fabulous. You can see from Century City to Downtown LA. If you need to park on the top there is a small parking lot for a fee. Or there is plenty of metered parking on the street of Jefferson as well.

Street parking (my car got broken in) so make sure you have nothing visible in the car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Missellen1
50,Beautiful view and good workout,"This is a great view and great workout. Come prepared. Parking was easy (Friday 4:30pm). The view was amazing at sunset (even on a hazy day), we were able to see Downtown LA, Hollywood, Century City, Santa Monica, and I'm guessing El Segundo it looks like. If you don't feel like doing stairs there is still a winding hiking with a gradual incline. It can still be a workout, but not as difficult or rough on the knees.I definitely recommend this place for residents to visit if they are looking for a fun workout. I would recommend it for visitors for the view. I couldn't see a visitor spending a whole lot of time here unless they were working out and making multiple trips up and down. It is also not really close to anything. So you would need to drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/27amandag
50,Walk Up the Hill Regularly,"Beautiful views from Catalina and Marina Del Rey to the Santa Monica Mountains and the Hollywood sign to Downtown L.A. and the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains.Awful stairs too large to be comfortable. You see people twisting their bodies in unhealthy ways to get up some of those huge, chunky, deteriorated concrete slabs. But the zig-zag trails that go up the hill are great.People, please don't take shortcuts! With hundreds of people walking up to the Overlook daily, just a small proportion taking shortcuts quickly causes erosion and packs the soil so much that plants can't grow back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SingDanceTravel
50,Scenic Stairway Trail to Marvelous Views,"This is a recent addition to the attractions in Los Angeles. I really enjoyed visiting here. I went on the Baldwin Parklands shuttle to get here. Once you're on top of the hill, there is a visitor center (open only Friday-Monday from 9-4, depending on staff availability) with a short film, and a number of trails you can explore to get magnificent views of the Los Angeles area. You can drive to the top but there is a $ 6 charge to park up there. Most visitors avoid the fee by taking either the stairway trail or another trail without stairs to reach the top. On Saturdays, Sundays, and some holidays, a shuttle bus (costs 25 cents to ride) called the Baldwin Hills Parklands Shuttle goes to the top of the hill from the Metro Expo Line station at La Cienega at Jefferson. From Hollywood and Highland you can take the Metro bus line 217 going Westbound on Hollywood Blvd (southbound on the bus schedule) to get to this station.The website for this attraction is http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=22790Here is a website for the shuttle info:http://www.transitunlimited.org/The_Link_Baldwin_Hills_Parklands_ShuttleNote that the shuttle stops running at sunset which can be earlier than 6 pm or later depending on the time of year you visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonplatt
