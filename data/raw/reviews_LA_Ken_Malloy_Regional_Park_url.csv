50,A hidden yet very big gem!,"For years, this park was ignored and pretty much a mess. Following a lengthy cleanup of the lake and installation of new park facilities, it's now a beauty! There are lots of paths for a stroll. Note that no path goes all the way around the lake. It's a great place to see a variety of birds. The wetland areas are a magnet for them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3718TTbarryw
50,Great place for the whole family,"My daughter and I took the boys (9, 7, 5) and spent about 4 hours at the park over the weekend. There's a ropes course, rock climbing, a playground, and trails. The park is very well maintained with lots of green space and shade, and adjacent to Machado Lake with lots of birds flying, diving, and swimming. A great park to keep the kids busy and entertained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gr8fish2017
50,What a nice park,"The renovated Ken Malloy regional park and lake is quite nice. The park is very handicap accessible with paved paths to both sides of the lake. There are expansive grassy areas, picnic tables and BBQs and awesome playground equipment for all ages including adults. The lake is painstakingly revived with many ecologically sound improvements. While many of the homeless have left the area some still live in the bushes. If you go off path you may encounter some of their camps. A nice improvement has been the visibility of park rangers. There is ample free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoboTravlr
40,Face lift of local park successful,"I visited Harbor Regional Park again after it being closed for several years. The section along Vermont Ave (opposite the Kaiser hospital) has been completely redone. As of July 2017, the spillway walk over the dam is not yet open to the public, so you can't get to the far side and the additional open grounds and golf course over there.This is a major stopping spot for waterfowl migrating, so lots of birds passing through, as well as local geese, ducks, coots, pigeons, and the hawks looking to feed on them.There used to be a major homeless encampment at the north end, which seems to be gone for now. The redo at that part of the park is less supportive of surreptitious living.There were lots of children using the playgrounds and people fishing in the lake (stocked with carp and catfish). Added bonus this trip was the netting around the edge of the lake, to protect new water plants, makes it look like a budget Christo project - see photo. I will have to come back with my dogs...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markinRB
