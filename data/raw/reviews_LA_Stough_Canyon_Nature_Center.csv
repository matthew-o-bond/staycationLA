50,Stough Canyon Bicycle trip,Stough Canyon Nature Center is a great stop for bicyclists for a cool sip of water from the drinking fountains and if the center is open the displays of flora and fauna are a quiet diversion before gaining the crest of the Verdugo Mountain truck trail at 2505 feet above sea level. With the recent SoCal rains the regrowth in the canyon is remarkable. The climb up to the Nature Center is 900 feet from the valley below at an altitude of 1500 feet. The Verdugo crest is another 1100 feet above the Nature Center but there is The Henry Cook Lookout Point for hikers (bicycles are restricted) a few hundred feet above the Nature Center with a wonderful view of the Burbank airport and the San Fernando Valley to the coastal Mountains.,James R
50,Great Hiking Paths,This is my favorite place to hike. It’s a great place to just get out in nature and it’s not crammed with people who just want to be seen like at Runyon Canyon. I can go for 10 minutes without running into someone on these trails and when I do they’re always friendly. The area has recovered nicely from the wildfires and It’s especially beautiful in spring with the flowers in full bloom,Jackie S

30,Exploring Nature,The center itself is okay. I didn't spend much time in there. I did however enjoy walking around the grounds. Interesting birds and plants. The hiking trail was steep and since I stumbled across the center by accident I was not prepared to make the hike.,thymegrower

40,Great Hiking Area,"We spent about a half hour in the actual Nature Center. From there, we went on an amazing hike. Though steep, the view at the top, looking out over Burbank all the way to LA, was pretty amazing. There were more hikes, but we only had time for the one.",Mary D
40,a nice trip for the kids,"Lots to see and cool things for kids and adults. Pretty grounds and hiking trails. Local flora and fauna and wildlife, living and stuffed. Great views.",Frank H
50,Hidden gem,"I was exploring my new neighborhood when I stumbled up on this nature center. It's very welcoming and family friendly (all ages). Full of information about the area and it's history. There are maps and walking/hiking paths for all levels. It's a bit steep so, I think wheelchairs might have to their work cut out for them. There were off road cyclists having a great time on the trails. When you get to the vista lookout, the view is amazing. You can see the Pacific from Burbank!! It's not too rugged a walk or too long. There are few trails you can take, differing in distance and complexity. The staff at the nature center is very helpful and knowledgeable.",Heather P
