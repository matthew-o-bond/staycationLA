Walk out on the pier, which goes way out into the ocean with waves crashing beneath you. There’s many restaurants in which to choose. And they are not very busy with it still being Feb.

10,Exorbitant parking fines,"this was my first and last visit to Hermosa beach. I parked at a street meter that appeared to be free in the evening but found a parking ticket for $53 after being parking for 30 minutes. There are so many other beach towns in South Bay that actually have reasonable parking rules - check out Manhattan beach has free parking everywhere during the holiday season, Hermosa is just not worth it.",merryl8

There are ample restaurants to find something to eat. Great place toChill.,Caroline H
50,Tranquil Stroll,If you're looking for a peaceful stroll out over the Pacific Ocean then you should check out the Hermosa Beach Pier in the morning or at dusk. Much quieter than Manhattan Beach or Redondo Beach Piers!! And so pretty! Have taken some really beautiful photos from here.,Mercedes V

50,Beautiful pier and beach and accessible area for the Summer concert series!,"I am handicapped and use an electric scooter. My husband and adult daughter went to the Hermosa Beach pier and sat on one of the benches on the pier overlooking the water for multiple hours! It was so beautiful and relaxing! I was not able to go onto the beach because the scooter could not get onto the sand. There was a concert on the pier the Sunday evening that we were there! There were 2 different bands. What I found awesome, was that there was an ADA rubbery-mess path so that I was able to get on the sand to be able to see the concert (as well as hear it!) There was also a guy who had asked those of us that used this path if there was anything else that could be done to improve accessibility to those summer concerts. I was very impressed that there was someone that was concerned about people with disabilities! One suggestion that I had was for the front few rows near the stage be made ADA ""only"" or that some sort of platform be made so that people in wheelchairs or scooters would be ""elevated"" so that they wouldn't have to struggle to see over all the concert goers that were standing.The pier was beautiful and the area vibrant with activity! We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon and evening on Hermosa Beach pier!",SueAx57
50,Loved it!,Spent the day at Hermosa beach. The pier was amazing. It was very clean. What a spectacular view of the ocean and mountains.,rshadrosky
30,"Its a pier, not much more to say.","The only think on the pier is a nice surfer statue. Lots of nice beach nearby. A boardwalk passed through it. Lots of restaurant/bays close to pier, some had nice character. Town a couple blocks up also had some interesting places.",David S
50,The Pier. The Shops. The Foo,"The pier is so peaceful. Stop by the one of the coffee shops on your way, grab a Paradise bowl and enjoy a beautiful walk on the pier. Watch as people pull in the fish and some just take in the beauty. Afterwards you have to check out the shops on Pier Ave. such a quaint little town with big attitude. Don’t forget to go down to the beach in the evening for the beautiful sunsets.",Gypsy soul
40,Visit to Hermosa Beach,"We had a great time here, but like any Southern California beach in July, it was crazy crowded! Beautiful weather, lots of choices for food and drink, but just prepare yourself for a massive amount of people if you go during summer months.",61leslien
40,Mommy and mini beach day,Mommy reviewI love love LOVE Hermosa beach. It is a lot easier to walk around to shops and restaurants than some of the other piers in my opinion. Up and down along strand you can find great restaurants and quick dining options. The beach doesn’t get too crowded though parking isn’t the best. During the weekend getting there before 1pm is your best bet for finding parking but know that most parking close by is metered.Mini reviewI love coming to the beach and playing in the water. There is a park in the sand not far away that Mom takes me to all the time. You can ride your bike up and down right by the beach too! Definitely bring friends and stay all day!,iamLydiaElle
50,Vacation,Very interesting pier to say the least. College atmosphere. We got there while a volleyball tournament was going on.,Mulkey40
40,Long Pier for Nice View,We walked the length of the Hermosa Beach Pier. We walked over the plaques of the Surfers Hall of Fame but we mostly watched surfers on both sides of the pier and fishermen throwing their bait into the water. Magical Place but no concessions.,Pfitzgerald1946
50,Lots to do,Lots of great restaurants to check. Fun bar scene. And of course the beach is amazing. I spend my whole summers down there.,Melissa S

40,Nice peer during June gloom,Peer is nice. Lots of restaurants close by. Friendly people and good views of the beach on both sides. It’s June so the weather wasn’t the best. Good place overall to stroll or even jog to the end and along the beach close by.,joshuaelee

50,Beautiful walk along the pier,Beautiful long walk down the Hermosa Beach Pier. Great pictures with the family. Lots of people fishing off the pier.,kimberlyayersrdcs
40,Lovely pier area,"Liked this Pier much more than Redondo Beach. It was more traditional, much cleaner with open views to the beach and the water. Apparently this is the original place for surfing and had many plaques on the ground on the pier commemorating surfers, as well as a statue in honour.Were even more impressed when we saw dolphins swimming off the end of the pier !! Also nice to see the fisherman and women from many different generations of families.We were dropped off here by an Uber and walked through the pedestrianised area of Hermosa Beach to get to the Pier, with its many shops and bars/restaurants. Very friendly service in the liquor store at the start of this area.The beach looked really clean with many bins for rubbish/trash….Seemed a pretty cool place to visit. Walker back to our hotel along the promenade mainly in Redondo Beach. Took around 30 mins…..but out of condition at mo, so could probably make it quicker.",Angie R
40,"Nice view, it was windy on our visit","Concrete pier, with great views from the start of the Pier to the end. Lots of benches to rest and catch the view.",Frank D
50,beautiful sunsets!!,"Went down for dinner and watched the sunset, it was a great location and was able to capture some beautiful pics!!",sacsoup
50,Great spot to take out of town guests,"Hermosa pier is a fun place to bring out of town guests, though parking is a little tricky to find. The shops at the pier have great finds and great food, allowing a full day of fun at the beach, shopping, and eating.The beach is deep, so plan to walk for a while to get to the water, but once you're there, it's worth it.The bathrooms are along the strand, so if you have children, you'll need to take them to the bathroom because you can't see the entrance from the sand (safety first).There are showers on the ocean side of the bathrooms with a short wall to set your things on as you clean up.",LivPurple
50,Lovely,Strongly advise visiting all three piers - or at very least Hermosa and Redondo. Superb beaches and lots of places to eat and drink.,London J
50,One of my favorite spots.,The Hermosa Pier is a little bigger than Manhattan Pier but smaller than Redondo. But it also has better visibility of the ocean than Redondo and benches to sit on whereas Manhattan does not.This is a great spot to walk out after your trip down the Strand or to talk off whatever yummy meal you might have enjoyed there. Great spot to see dolphins too!,MK F
50,Hermosa Beach Pier,This is is beautiful beach with a really relaxed vibe. The pier is a great place to sit and watch the world go by.,Fiona H

50,I like long walks on the pier,"Hermosa Beach pier is very unique to me from the crowds that they attract to the sites that you see. there's a lot to offer here at Hermosa Beach pier lots of food places lots of bars lots of activity lots of fun. whether you want to go for a stroll down the pier and people watch days at the surfers or the volleyball players oh, I just go for a bike ride down the boardwalk or skateboard you're able to do it comfortably at this pier. the one thing that I really love about Hermosa Beach pier is people don't bother you it doesn't smell there's no trash laying around and the best part it's a smoke-free environment.stopping to one of the local bike shops and do bike rentals for a day for excitement at the pier, or rent a boogie board or surfboard and enjoy your time out on the water. the beauty of the spear always amazes me with captivating sunset views on a great clear day to being able to see Manhattan Beach Pier c Redondo Beach pier on other great days take a stroll down the strand and look at the beautiful homes. have a bite to eat at hennessy's or grab a drink at sharky's. this beach has everything for anyone",Staycation Vacations

50,What’s not to like,I love to come to Hermosa Beach and the pier is a great place to walk with my grandchildren. Looking forward to more visits,Gin-Ginnie
50,A worthwhile destination for a bike ride from Santa Monica,Hermosa Beach is an easy hour and a bit bike ride from Santa Monica. I must have done the trip at least 5 times or so but it never gets boring. Once you are round Marina del Rey and past the long stretch of beach in front of LAX and Los Angeles water treatment plant you are rewarded with the sight of some pretty cool beach houses. Not as amazing as the ones in Malibu or Santa Monica but very neat.The crowd seems to be a bit more down to earth here too but way not as scruffy as at Venice Beach. There are no beach vendors and I have yet to spot a homeless person sleeping rough at Hermosa. If you need refreshment at this half way point of your bike trip there is good selection of cafes and delis.Be aware that you may have to walk your bike in sections of Hermosa beach - during busy times they put flashing red lights on. I completely missed that because I was distracted checking out the newest renovation of a beach house but a very friendly police officer pointed them out to me.,Ntalabany
40,Long pier gives good views,Hermosa Beach was a very nice place to visit. The Pier is long and a lot of fishermen. Nice views both North and South. The entrance to the Pier has nice statue.,Jim & Bea

30,Nothing that Special.,"Folks, it is a pier, and a pier full of people. A great place to take an Instagram shot of the beach and the waves. Probably a great place to watch the sunset, but you can watch sunset from the beach too. We were biking the bike path along Hermosa Beach on a November Sunday, we just found too many people, too many bikes, not really a relaxing experience. If you like sun bathing, beach volleyball, walking on the beach, and kids playing on the sands, yes, Hermosa Beach is definitely for you. Otherwise, it is just a beach, not much character to offer.",2CanadianTravellers
50,Look for sea lions after the sunset,After sunset the sea lions come in to take the fish too small for the fisherman to keep. Awesome to watch that happening. Great views of the sunset from the pier as well.,AwakeTraveler
50,Beautiful Cali beach town,"Everthing you can expect in a Cal beach town, with good bars and restaurants. Wednesday is farmers market day..enjoy a walk on the strand",Carrera
40,Walking and Fishing Pier,This is a simple long pier to walk out on and look back at the town of Hermosa. No or buildings rides or anything to take away from the view and tranquility. It is a popular place for fishing as there at least a dozen people fishing. Just a nice place to relax,george g

30,Nice pier,"I took a long walk from my hotel to Hermosa Beach pier, and it was barely OK. Along the beach, it's just many houses - maybe a couple of them were nice. On the pier and in the area there are just a few shops, but nothing remarkable.",ANGELO V
40,Beautiful View,"Bring your camera, phone or sketch pad. The view is awesome. Take a picture of volleyball players, waves breaking in a gentle curl, or homes that most of us can't afford. Either way, enjoy.",Nikolaus B
40,Nice pier but nothing else to do on it,this pier is nice but it is just the pier.. I prefer Santa Monica or Huntington because there is a lot more to do and see but if you are just going to the beach this is a great spot. If you do want to go here stay at the Hotel Beach house hotel Hermosa Beach and get an oceanfront room. Awesome!,Jimmy Rex
50,Great area,"Excellent area for families and couples lots of restaurants and cafes . Pedestrian and bikes etc , no cars .",5starry
50,Tranquil Hermosa Beach,"I was in from Chicago and the summer is ending and this was the best way to hang on to the waning days. It was not overly crowned and if you wanted to supply your own adult beverages, there was no one there to stop you. There was no riff-raff and the views were great, talk about the perfect time to go!",Quin4
30,Can’t get near the edge for the fishermen,"This is a large and well built pier with loads of rules about what you can’t do eg. no bikes, no skateboards, no this no that. But, you can fish here from dawn until 10pm and take up as much space as you like and cut your fish and bait all over the railings no problem at all.Great views from the pier especially at sunset but again it’s a struggle to get a photo without a fishing rod in it!",Andrew M

50,"Wonderful place, can get a little crazy and crowded sometimes",Always wonderful to watch the sunset here. During winter you can ride down the sand dunes and during the summer it gets packed especially when all the volleyball tournaments are happening.,J6063CWjamess
50,yes,hermosa..just amazing in every way ...go am appreciate its beauty and vibe...you will never want to leave,santamonica17
40,Great way to end the day,"After a unique dinner at a gastro fusion restaurant near by, a team I was with walked down to the pier to end a busy day and see the Pacific and end the day. Some of the team walked out on the sand while others stayed on the pier. It was a fun area to enjoy fishing dinner the beach and sporting activities. Everyone their seemed to be having a good time either by themselves or in their groups. This included young adults kids parents old and young alike. It is a great way of ending a day",Sfrims
40,One could get used to this lifestyle!,I hadn't visited California on over 20 years since I moved back East. Easy to fall in love with the beach lifestyle. I'll come back mire often.,Double_F
50,Just our perfect beachfront,"It's our second time visiting Hermosa Beach and first time on our own. A friend was kind enough to give us a tour not long ago to show us the different Beach cities and we loved Hermosa the most! It's not too crowded and tourist-y and felt so homey.A big surprise though was that most meters on Hermosa Blvd only accepted coins and not debit cards so we had to get something at a liquor store to be able to feed the meter. It's good for 3 hours.The bike strand is 2 miles from the border of Redondo and Manhattan Beach which is a good stretch to walk, bike or run. We decide to bike on this trip and had a blast! The Beach looked so calm and inviting but we decide to just stay on the strand this time around.",Fiona H
50,Beach getaway,"Hermosa Beach is a clean and nice beach. They do have bathroom facilities too. Parking can be a hassle though. Bring quarters, lots of them. If you find a parking spot, it’s 12 minutes for a quarter.",bitsmom_tn
50,Beautiful stroll over the ocean,"A nice clean pier, stunning views, benches, friendly people. People are fishing near the end. I believe dogs are not allowed on the pier, officially, but we often do see leashed dogs.",Ruth Houston B
30,Clean,"Very clean, very minimal. I enjoyed the walk to the end and the views were cool. But it's really just a pier. So average rating.",daqattaq
40,What you think Cali should be,"Really beautiful beach , Shops, restaurant and pier . Lots to do and take in . Great place to people watch. Can’t beat the view .Only 2 complaints1. Parking is a pain. Metered parking , some took credit but most took coins. Annoying . We had to feed the meter several times.2. Although the pier is great place to sit and watch the ocean and surfers, there was a lot of fisherman . I was afraid we were going to get hooked . Yikes !",Jen P
50,We needed some downtime.,We were in the area for Disneyland but we also knew we would need some downtime.My family came here to get away from all the rides.I am beyond grateful we were told about this beach.The locals call it the surfers beach and I now know why. We definitely enjoyed the sounds of the waves crashing while building sandcastles.My son was only 8 when we came here and he loved jumping the waves. We all got rolled or pushed around a bit by the waves but it was hilarious.I can’t wait to go back🕶🏄🏽‍♀️🏄🏾‍♂️,purpledaisyrocks
50,Beautiful beach!,Rent some bikes and ride along the ‘Strand’...a paved stretch that goes south from Redondo Beach all the way to Santa Monica. Local bike shops rent trailers to tow your kids. The pier has lots of bars. Better to stay away on holiday weekends when large crowds are drinking. Otherwise great for families.,2018familytrip

40,This is just a plain fishing pier but still nice for taking a walk.,I visited Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Pier's today and of the two Manhattan Beach was nicer as Hermosa is just a simple fishing pier. That said it was still a nice pier to take a walk on and there are plenty of bench seats on which you can take a rest and watch the fishing and surfing action. There are no facilities on the pier itself but the area at the entrance to the pier is crowded with bars and restaurants and a few surf / gift shops. The Pier Hours are from 6:00 am until 10:00 pm,Roberts69
50,Pier,"I love Hermosa Beach Pier area. There are several restaurants within walking distance of the pier itself. The price range from moderate to expensive. Several types of restaurants like burgers, seafood, and American food. Very family friendly, clean, and safe.",Jack

50,Big Green Men,The first time i visited Hermosa Pier was St Patrick's Day. It was the first time I'd seen how big this is in America. Walking down the pier I encountered a group of young Latino men head to foot in bright green suits and bright green top hats. Beneath the comedy outfits they looked quite serious. It was mid afternoon and the sun was burning. I was hot in my shorts and vest. These guys looked sort of cool and simultaneously uncool. It was a confusing experience for the tourist. That night the pier was rocking. Irishness everywhere. Except for the accents. That was all local LA. Funny old world.,major_rawls
50,Fiesta Hermosa!!!!,We stopped for fiesta Hermosa. It was awesome. The booths were very cool and the bands were great!!! Walked out to the beach and it did not disappoint!! Would recommend for any age kids!!,JOhhnyutah
50,Great pier to take a stroll. Jog. Or rollerblade,Hermosa Pier was rebuilt a few years ago. It is solid. Lighted well. And fun to take a stroll after dinner. Or after playing at the beach. We also take our kids down here to sand sled during the winter.And of course now famous for LaLa Land,NickellFamilyTravel
40,Fiesta Hermosa 🎉🎊around Pier Ave 😎,"During Memorial and Labor Day Weekends, the Fiesta Hermosa is held around Pier Avenue and Hermosa Avenue between 10th and 14th Streets. Fiesta Hermosa marks the beginning and end of sumner. These streets are blocked off to cars to allow local vendors the opportunity to sell their products. People are able to walk on the streets to support the local economy. There are different types of vendors here, including food, arts and crafts, jewelry, home improvement, household goods, etc, My favorite booth was the artist recycling old surfboards into an art piece to hang on the wall. There is a booth to allow for cat and dog adoption. There is a pop up amusement park with rides and food for the kids. This is definitely worth coming out for if the weather is cool and sunny. The only problem is finding parking. Be prepared to walk a bit as certain streets are blocked off to vehicles. It’s also worth walking down to The Pier for more people and surfer watching. Sunset is the best time to get to the end of the pier to see the sun slowly set below the horizon.",MarktheWay
40,Watch the surfers ride the waves,Great place to amble and sit and catch the views along the beach. If you wander to the end of the pier there’s always fisherman happy to have a chat about their daily catch.,joshuabella

50,Beautiful pier with lots of restaurants,We walked down to the pier before our hotel room was ready. It was a chilly day but some folks were still in the surf. There were a lot of people playing volleyball in the sand. We got a drink at a nearby restaurant. The pier was not overly crowded and there were plenty of benches to sit on and look out at the Pacific ocean.,Urban1026

50,Wander and Spend Some Time Here,There is a local parking ramp which makes access to this beach area easier. The plaza area is loaded with shop and restaurants including the site of the jazz club featured in La La Land. The walkway at the beach provides a great way to wander up and down this beach (though you share it with bikers). It is a gorgeous wide beach with a walk out pier. It would be a great place to hang out and enjoyed a nice day by the ocean while in the LA area.,ReadRibbet
40,Saw a sea lion!,Went to the beach prior to sunset. Nothing really special about the pier itself but there was a sea lion at the end of the pier and that was awesome. It swam around the entire time we were there stealing fish from the fishermen. When they would pull the lines out of the water the fish would sometimes fall off the line and the sea lion was there to catch it.,FindBeautyInNature
50,Surf Culture,"I really love Hermosa Beach and make a point to stop every time I'm in town. The pier is a nice walk, not as built up as others, and has a Surfer's Hall of Fame walk along it. A must-visit for anyone into California surf culture.",psvann
50,Beautiful Pier. Great sunsets!!!,The pier is situated right off a great section of town that is full of great bars and restaurants. The pier seems a little longer than most that I have been to.

Get out and enjoy!,ThePoundcake

50,Lots of Action even in February!,"We stayed at the Beach House, and had a perfect view of the pier from our room. Even though there was a huge rain storm which caused flooding havoc in some parts of the state, it created a dramatic show at the pier with huge waves crashing through the pilings and on the beach. Even that didn't keep people away. The sunny days brought out lot of people to watch the drum circle, surfers, fishers, volleyball players, and sea life which can all be seen from the pier. There are plenty of restaurants and shops nearby, and everything is within walking distance.",Penny C

It overlooks the beaches from Rendondo to Manhattan Beaches and the 2 gigantic power stations (at either end of those respective beaches).Watch beach volleyballers of all shapes and sizes going about trying to play....The pier is pleasant, can get breezy but my choice would be to walk the beach path and mingle with a myriad of LA'ers.

My favorite place to eat out was the Newport Beach Yacht Club in Newport Beach, up the street a way. I enjoyed everything about my life while living in Hermosa Beach and never felt so safe and carefree. The pier is a pier - what can I say about it really. I've been to many piers in the Orange County and Los Angeles County areas. If I was ever dramatically impressed with any waterfront activity - it was the first time I visited the Queen Mary and later the Spruce Goose in Long Beach. A oceanfront bar Ripples was a favorite place to hang out in Long Beach - but without a designated driver the cab fare back to Hermosa Beach was wicked.",Aerial N

Our Hawkeyes didn't quite do as well as we expected, but Hermosa Beach was as fun as we remembered. We prefer staying in this area when visiting coastal southern California. It is close enough to drive in to L.A., but has a unique vibe compared to the other beach towns. We don't care for some of the other nearby piers. When we return, this is where we'll go.",LovesIowa

40,Local View,"The Pier is a good one to watch the sunrise over Hermosa and get a birds eye view of the surfers early morning sessions. The wind wind tends to pick up in the afternoon but you will be sure to view dolphin, seals and the occasional sunfish or shark. Looking north you will see the Manhattan Beach Pier and south the Redondo Breakwall and Pier.

Lots of people sunbathing, playing volleyball on the beach. You can rent or bring bicycles and ride along the beach. Hermosa beach pier extends into the Pacific Ocean. It's so relaxing to walk along the pier while enjoying the sea breeze and beautiful view of the beach.

Long Sandy beach that runs for a few miles, and about 1/2 mile wade.. no shortage of sand here or sun. With all the best restaurants and bars you could imagine.. great for the single life, or families, something for everyone, and don't forget about the Strand.. it runs along the beach from Redondo Beach to Malibu. Great for those who like to run or go for a leisurely ride on a beach cruiser or just to walk the dog.. I've traveled all over the world and there is no place in the world like Hermosa Beach!!!",joelg2020
40,nice way to spend part of your day,Nice to get away from the craziness of LA and decompress with some time laying in the sand or riding a bike down the strand. The strand can get pretty busy and not sure why they allow road cyclists going 15+ MPH on it but other than that its a nice relaxing ride. The surf on one side and great seaside houses on the other.,bill C

As the sun goes down the tempo picks up fast. Still sunset great for a stroll and view of the coast on the pier. Earlier best for families , later for singles. Much later for partiers. Manahattan Beach only a mile north and an upper scale vibe. Redondo pier a mile and half south for relaxed vibe plus Friday nights between 5 and 8 Rubys has a car cruise in. Lots of cool cars and nice people.",tlakeusa

40,Beach City Vibe with Booming Night Life,"Hermosa Beach is known for many things including surfing, beach volleyball (as one of the stops of the AVP during summer), an abundance of bars and restaurants including a premier comedy club, and of course...FIESTA HERMOSA.On this reivew, I'd like to focus on one of the best weekends to visit Hermosa Beach Pier - MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND!MEMORIAL DAY 2016As my wife and I dreadfully head towards the South Bay beaches, (dreadfully for me because I'm dreading the crazy parking situations that is a characteristic of this particular weekend being the unofficial start of summer) I see a sign that says ""Fiesta Parking"" by the South Bay Galleria on Hawthorne Blvd and Artesia. And it came to mind that I did spend some Memorial Day weekends in my past (with my past...lol) at.... FIESTA HERMOSA!!!!! YAAAYYYYYY!!!!!This means, I don't have to struggle with parking. I can park either at the Aviation and Marine lot, or at Mira Costa High School, and simply take the free shuttle to the pier! Yay!!!! Of course there is a long wait for the shuttle, especially for the Mira Costa lot, because there are more buses that go to the Aviation lot, like a 1 to 4 ratio of buses. The shuttle stops need to be organized better...But the event itself was as good as I remember. Rides, Vendors, Live Music, Free Giveaways, and of course...FOOOOOOOOODDDD!!!!!! There's also ample bike parking on the sand.TIP: COME EARLY!!! Why? Because...1.) You won't have to be in the back of a really long line to get into a bus.2.) Chance are, June Gloom in late May (otherwise known as the Marine Layer) will still be lingering and you won't get too burnt if like me you're not a huge fan of being under direct sunlight for an extended period of time without getting into the water.3.) NO LINES TO GET FOOD!!!!!!! You'll beat the crowd. You can be heading back to your parking lot just as people are starting to swarm in. The walkway/aisles around the vendor booths are really narrow. When 2 strollers are stopped beside each other, which happened quite a few times, you literally can no longer pass.If you have no plans to join the millions of travelers on 2-lane highways going North or East, then visit Hermosa Beach during Memorial Day weekend and have a great time on the strand and on the sand.",Patrick Jason M

40,"Parking anywhere near the pier can be tough in Hermosa beach, but the place is worth a little time to get there.","The pier area has some well attended restaurants and bars, and the beach is very wide and quite clean. Lots of volleyball courts, this is one of the prime spots for all levels of volleyball. Lots of lifeguard service for those who want to swim or surf.

50,I've only been here once,"I came on the 4th of July in 2014 and I loved it! It was a clean beach, but of course that day was packed! There was music and lots of families. We played soccer and got inside the water. It was kid-friendly, aside from there being lots of college students.",Graice C
50,"Hermosa Beach, California Memorial Day","Hermosa Beach is amazing on Memorial Day and Labor Day. Fiesta Hermosa is the largest arts and crafts festival in California. The 42-yr old event has an estimate of 150,000 visitors visit on those weekends. The fair includes a carnival, petting zoo, beer garden, live bands, pristine beach and amazing views. Parking is limited but free offsite parking and shuttles at Northrup Grumman near Aviation Blvd and Space Park is available. Your family will not be disappointed in the many offerings.",David L
40,Peaceful Hermosa Beach,"Hermosa Beach is a quieter, more sedate beach for those people who don't find Venice Beach to their liking. The pier gives you a beautiful view of the Pacific. On our visit it was a sunny Sunday afternoon. We found metered parking just a couple of blocks away from the boardwalk, no problem. There is a smattering of shops, much more respectable as well than Venice though not nearly as interesting. It was worth the trip to get a different beach experience",Susan G
50,One of my favourites,"This is one of my favourite beaches, love walking along the Strand, eating at one of the restaurants on the side. The sand is really nice here.",girlieduke

50,Fun little area with a lot to do in Hermosa Beach!,"We loved this area of Hermosa Beach and stopped almost every time we walked on the Strand. Whether it was to stop at the plaza for Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner, or just have cocktails while the sun was setting, it was a great spot to slow down and take in the beautiful scenery. Plenty of stores to walk in and out, and of course a pier to walk out on and fish or just stroll around.",mousefansmom
50,Great views!,"Hermosa Beach is usually very quiet, which means great views of the sand. The pier was very windy when we walked up but we had fun watching the fishing at the end and looking back up the coast.

50,Voted as the happiest beach town recently!,"Hermosa Beach is everything that Manhattan Beach is not..Somehow, it has retained some of its early bohemian atmosphere and is a bit more south from LAX, closer to Redondo Beach and Palos Verdes which is like a huge St Tropez! Malibu is nothing compared to those beach towns south of LAX.As a Travel Facilitator-Interpreter who has lived in both beach towns for the last 45 years , I conduct a lot of private tours to Palos Verdes for foreign tourists.For those tourists who are staying at hotels near the Airport, there is a shuttle that takes them to Manhattan Beach and from there they can either stay in Manhattan or walk south and spend the day in Hermosa. The tickets, I believe can be purchased at the front desk of their hotel. Have fun...",Rosemary G
40,It's a pier!,"Long, clean and fun. It was interesting to walk out and see the folks fishing at the end. Fun to look out at all the beach goers and what they are up to.",Lance B

50,"Not just a party town, there is jazz and surfing history here.","Hermosa Beach Pier and Pier Plaza is a place I love to go to. I live about 8 miles away inland. It is a great place to go if you're visiting town, and if you live anywhere nearby, a great place to bring your relatives, friends, significant other, dogs, (not necessarily in that order), skateboards, bicycles, frisbees, fishing pole, swim suit, money etc. There are some restaurants such as Hennessey's that have outdoor dining with water bowls for dogs just the other side of the metal rail of the dining area so Fido can hang with you by the beach as you down Margarita's or beers etc. There are tons of restaurants and stores things others will mention no doubt I couldn't possibly name them all, but if you're a Jazz music fan there are plaques to many jazz greats in stone in the middle of the Pier plaza maybe 50 yards from the world famous Lighthouse Cafe where you can can still hear jazz I think during Sunday brunch times and maybe one other weeknight, otherwise it'll be reggae or rock etc. Hermosa Beach also has surfing history and you can look that up too it's less familiar to me than the jazz. I have many a story taking place in Hermosa I could tell but I don't think Trip Advisor would advise me to mention some of that;) I will conclude by saying go there for the healing properties of the invigorating ocean breeze, the big sky that may be bright or cloudy, and the sound of the waves.",FO19

40,Can't go wrong,We love Hermosa. It's like a slice of heaven in the middle of the madness of LA.There's a reason there's not any global hotel chains here. It's special. So we are uber lucky to have a friend that takes us in from the frigid tundra of Minnesota.,Hermit55
30,A beautiful view...,"If your in the area, it is definitely worth checking out and walking doea, especially during sunset.... however there are no attractions, just a beautiful view from the water. I am jot sure I would go not of my way just to see the pier.",bendreview

There is no speed limit for people on foot.You can take your own pace from strolling, watching beach volleyball on the ocean side and the houses on the other side, or you can jog or run. It is fun to walk up the Strand which connects to Manhattan Beach and Pier. Beyond halfway, the pedestrian walkway is separated from the bike trail thus providing extra peace of mind and safety. If you feel like more exercise you can continue for miles.",ResponsibleTraveler

50,A Walker's Delight,"It's impossible to describe the Hermosa Beach Pier without including the Strand, a lovely walkway along the beach that stretches for miles. If you're a walker, biker, skater, skate boarder or just a casual stroller and people watcher. it is the place to be. Walking north, one has a large and lovely stretch of beach on the left and multimillion dollar homes on the right, most of which with large windows for whatever level of voyeurism exists in each of us. It is also a dog-friendly avenue where your pet can acquaint himself/herself with others of the same species. Water fountains for humans and dogs are also interspersed along the strand as are restroom facilities.Pier St, leading down to the physical pier is replete with shops, bars and eateries to suit any palate. It is also a place to sit and people watch. At the extreme west end lies the pier, another great place to walk, watch surfers and swimmers on each side and sachet up to its end where numerous anglers hope to catch their prize for the day. One can also bring a bag of bread or popcorn for the gulls which also frequent the place.All-in-all it's never closed and always provides an interesting and scenic place to visit and since it faces west, the sunsets are often spectacular.",PAAbee

The sunset view is often spectacular.A couple of notes: the Pier is smoke free (as are other public places in Hermosa Beach).The Beach Cities transit (BCT) 109 connects the breach cities, LAX bus center and the Metro green line.Bathroom and change facilities at the beach end of the pier - nothing on the pier itself.The area is good for biking and there are several bike shops where you can hire a bike. Be aware that you are meant to walk your bike along the path 2 blocks north and south of the pier - locals speak of $80 fine. You can take you bike onto the pier but i have never seen anyone ride on the pier.",DoesNotGetOutMuch

A great view of all the beaches, not to mention some of the most beautiful sunsets Mother Nature has to offer. There are many fine eateries just steps away from the pier.

50,Best Pier,"This is the best pier I have had the opportunity to walk on. It is clean, they provide many benches for you to sit on and enjoy the scenery, and they have good looking trash cans that say ""Hermosa Beach"" on them. I was happy to finally find a beach with the same thought I have always had for ages... provide trash cans and the beach will be cleaner! And It works! Just steps from the pier you will find numerous volley ball nets on the sand, a clean bathroom facility, and a large variety of bars, restaurants, and shops, and The Strand. The Strand is a paved boardwalk that is well maintained. On the Strand you can enjoy skating, biking, jogging, etc., but watch out if you are walking at a moderate pace. We almost got ran over a few times. There is a large parking structure one street west of Pier Ave. I also found out Hermosa Beach Pier is a popular nightlife spot and many of the bars have music or live entertainment.

40,"Great atmosphere, clean and safe!","This is a fun and safe place filled with families with small children as well as many young adults and the not so young anymore....Parking can be limited so going early or using Uber service is recommended. Uber services not only gives you that peace of mind but it's not expensive at all (cheaper than parking sometimes and definitely cheaper than DUI).Early during the day is family style and people working out but then later at night it turns into a party house so there is a little of everything for everyone.Bring your surf board, rollerblades or skateboard and enjoy your day here, or simply run along the beach or play volleyball at one of the many open nets there are here.Restrooms are available so no worries for that either.Most of the crowd here at night are well educated, medium to upper class so parties here are fun and loud yet not crazy. I see many young professionals that are either single or married without children.We personally like the fun without the loud noises so we come mostly during daylight and enjoy the fresh air, the nice view and relaxing atmosphere that we enjoy so much here with a cold and fresh brew of coffee or beer :)Live, laugh, love!You'll find this sign at the pier, and it's a good advise to follow.",TheFoodTraveler

40,Out on the Ocean,"Something about this pier gives me the feeling of being less on a pier and more out over the ocean. Is it narrower, higher, different railings than other piers? I don't know, but it always feels great out there. The views back toward the shore are inspiring, the devoted fishers and lack of commercial enterprises make it simple, pure and authentic.",DLMS_3
40,Nice Beach and Pier.,"We hung out at Hermosa Beach on a Friday afternoon after eating at Killer Shrimp. There weren't many people on the beach so we had plenty of room. The beach was clean but watch out for the seagulls. There were going through a beach bag near us trying to get the food that was inside. We even saw one carry away a small bag of chips. We also walked the pier which was nice. There were quite a few fisherman and they pretty much monopolized the area at the end of the pier. The boardwalk was a nice walk and provided plenty of room for bikers, walkers, and skaters. There were bathrooms along the beach near the boardwalk and at the beginning of the pier.",Andrew K

While it's a popular place, parking is not too difficult to find, but be careful; take note of any limited parking signs and where they are posted so a ticket doesn't become a souvenir. The neighborhood shops and restaurants provide some comfort food and casual atmosphere. Wonderful views and fun to walk or bike along the beach path.",pattikb

40,Long pier.,Great pier lots to look at on the beach. Looks like it'd be good to fish off. Except the sign that says posious fish.,William242014
30,Nice Views but Not Much to Do,"This is a nice walk out to the end of the pier but unless you fish, there's not much else to do. There are benches to sit and watch the sunset/sunrise. No bikes, skates, or scooters allowed.",KniteRiter

50,Love HB Pier,"I love Hermosa Beach Pier for its simplicity. The only things on the actual pier are benches, lifeguard station, and usually fishermen. As you walk down the pier to the end,it feels like you are far away from the city. If you want the stores & restaurants, they are only steps away on the plaza. I'm glad Hermosa used the KISS theory when rebuilding their pier.",Sue H
50,Visit the Hermosa Beach Pier,"I grew up in Hermosa, and the pier has changed just slightly (for the better) since the 70s. I love it because it's just a pier - no rides, no snack stand - so it's perfect for walking and sightseeing. I come and sit on a bench and watch the surfers, or just stroll to the end and take in the sun and scenery. I'm biased, but it's my favorite of the South Bay piers.",AlexandraFunFit
50,Fun area of the South Bay,Lots of restaurants and bars plus one of the finest sandy beaches in the world! The pier itself is a lovely place to sit and look out to sea. Aaaahhhhhh.....,Kim F
50,Great beach,"The beach was very clean - lots of places to eat and park nearby. Walked from Hermosa Beach Pier to Manhattan Beach Pier alongside the water and saw a group of dolphins riding the waves, very close to the shore - what an amazing thing to see! Appreciated the pedestrian walkway between the beach and the residences - out of the way and still a great view of the beautiful ocean-facing homes. Also appreciated the nice, clean public restrooms.",polkadots_eve
50,Nice beach,"Very nice and clean. Soft sand the water is cold but great place to see. Pier ave has good shopping, bars, and restraunts. We went to Manhattan beach and didn't find it to be as nice or clean I recommend Hermosa over it.",Whitney R
40,Great views,"Great views of the beach and the pier goes a long way out so plenty to see. Lots of benches along the pier too which was nice. When we were there the fishermen were being played with by a seal who was stealing the bait off their lines, very funny to watch.",behappy222
40,lots of fun and laid back,"We live on Vancouver Island (west coast, British Colombia, Canada) and this area really reminded me of home, only with palm trees.

50,Walking on the ocean,"Actually, it's over the ocean. With a great breeze, and a great view back to shore and Pier Plaza, it is a great place to spend some time on a warm day.",DJRTravel
50,Prime people watching and more,"A stroll or jog on the Strand starting at the Hermosa Beach provides fabulous ocean breezes and view soon one side and a look at beautiful unique homes on the other. Volleyball games, skaters, dog walkers, and a variety of locals and tourists make it fun to just look around. Walk out on the pier for a closer look at surfers and paddlers, and you might even see a dolphin or sea lion!",Pat D
10,Watch out for parking tickets,"We had just arrived at LAX, got our rental car and headed towards a beach on an early Monday am. Most of the shops were closed, but we saw a little coffee shop (which was really great) on the pier. We parked on the street and saw a parking meter, that we didn't fully understand the directions (our fault), but saw that the meter only took quarters?!! So we couldn't have paid if we wanted to since we don't carry around a roll of quarters. We ran over to the shop, got a cup of coffee and ran back out to find a pretty yellow ticket for $50+! Wow, really? We could have spent so much more cash in this beach town, but that put such a bad taste in my mouth and there are miles of beaches just minutes away. So, we paid the ticket and drove on down the road and enjoyed SoCal beaches ticket free! Please be warned that they have patrols specifically for parking violations. There are no warnings and your quick stop for coffee can turn into a $60 trip quick.",Peacelovevacation
40,A Lovely Seaside Town,"A beautiful area to spend a day walking around. Lots of restaurants to choose from in the main downtown area by the Strand. A great place to go and people watch and admire the gorgeous homes. There was one right on the beach for sale. Out of curiosity, we searched online for the listing price: $8.5 million - ouch!!! A lovely place to live if you can afford it.",Santorini Dreamin'
50,Huge beach and cleanest pier I've seen,Stopped here for a leg stretch as driving through the area and walked out on the pier. This pier has to be the cleanest pier I have ever seen anywhere! Do they power-hose it down daily? No (very little) bird poop from the gulls or fish guts (from fisherman) anywhere. Most piers are covered in the white stuff and fishing junk on the rails but not this one!The immediate area has nice little restaurants and the beach is huge and wide.,ItchyFeet

50,"Watch the waves, the people, the architecture",The strand opens up to all things relaxation and entertainment. You never get tired of the ocean and the active locals. The paved path can get slick with sand so running traction is tricky.,Jennifer V
40,Best of the South Bay beach communities,Hermosa offers a wide variety of activities in a very friendly and cozy atmosphere. It is a great place to spend the day or have dinner or just spend some time on the beach or walking the streets and enjoying the oceanside setting.,buffalojim67
50,What's not to like?,"The weather was in the upper 70s in late December! There's a nice multi-use path alongside the ocean for walking for riding a rented beach cruiser bike. Seems to be a great place for surfing, playing volleyball or just sitting on the beach. Plenty of good places to eat nearby. (The Christmas tree at the pier was nice touch!)",ultracyclist
50,Such a beautiful place,"My friend and I stayed in Hermosa in summer and fell in love, its such a beautiful chilled place, we like walking out on the piers and along the paved path that goes right along the californian beaches. There was a lot of eye candy on the way with the volleyball courts set up on the beach ;)",Ingrids24

Restaurants with a view include Scotty's Hennessey's, Good Stuff, La Playita.",TinkerFan90254
50,hot hermosa housewives!,"its the kind of place where you see fitness moms, hot bikini babes, & hot dudes running around town in tight fitness apparel or not much clothing at all.

Live Music at"" St. Rocke"" or Hang out at Palmilla"" for the cool tequila bar . Feel like a kid again, as all age groups mingle well here. Hermosa beach, in Spanish means ""beautiful beach"" and it is!",gina Shakti
50,Wouldn't want to live anywhere else!,"Great place! As soon as I'm home, the car stays in the garage. A place that is perfect for walking and riding strand cruisers. The bike path is ideal as is the wide sand beach and all the volleyball courts. The restaurant scene is picking up. It could still be better but it is heading in a good direction in my opinion. A bit of advice…stay away from the pier at night. It's kind of a d-bag scene.",Greggellate
50,Great cycle ride,"We rode from Hermosa to Santa Monica pier for Route 66 final sign on our trip 15 miles each way and it was great a really good cycle path just a small section had any cars the rest was pure cycle lanes along the beach , we saw sea lions and dolphins at the same time how lucky where we , great trip 30 miles and a sore bum were worth it.",Robert B

50,Beautiful California Beach!!,This beach was amazing. We traveled there for a girl's weekend and could not have been more pleased. The beach was huge with so many activities available during the day. We rented bikes and rode up the Strand to Manahattan Beach. There were plenty of beach volleyball nets and the restaurants on Pier Ave were great for lunch. The only complaint was that there was not a stand up paddleboard rental location close to the beach. It was several blocks away. The nightlife was also fantastic. An absolute gem!!,LydiaVirginia
50,Lots of Action,"We went as a family. During our stay they were holding a large volleyball tournament for all ages, so that was cool to watch. We love walking The Strand - see the houses along and all the people walking, running, riding their bikes.",JeffB32

50,Marvelously relaxing!,"The entire area was clean, well-patrolled, loaded with very nice businesses and yet remarkably quiet. It provided the consummate beach vacation setting for us!

50,True Beach Town,"As a life long resident I'm biased but the beach here is one of the best in world - and I've been all over it surfing and exploring. I keep coming home, not because of the waves, but the small town, beach life wonder that's Hermosa - the Spanish word says it all.",Greg A

50,"Clean, family friendly, wonderful beach close to LA","I've been to Hermosa beach many times because my sister lives nearby. It is really one of the best beaches in the area. Here's why:1. A very large sandy beach area means that even on the busiest weekends you will have space to spread out. (Unlike Laguna or Santa Monica)2. Great biking/running trail. (Though this trail goes from Malibu to Long Beach!)3. Great, relaxed restaurants and stores near the peer, but not all along the beach itself. And not too many.4. The bathrooms! Well spread out, with drinking fountains, very modern, clean, civilized.5. Lifeguards.6. If you are vacationing, Hermosa beach is very central to the attractions in Los Angeles as well as in Orange County (like disneyland).7. 15 minutes Max to LAX.8. Great range of lodging options, from the Sea Sprite (cheapie right on the beach), tons of beachfront or steps from beach condos, to utter luxury.Go to Hermosa and Enjoy!",ClintWorldWide

The beaches are vast and clean and there are all kinds of sports going on. We grew up surfing and playing beach volleyball and so there are courts everywhere.The pier 'plaza', I think they call it now, is a great place to hang out with fun bars and restaurants and even a surf shop and some other shops. You can rent bikes, skates etc. at the pier. I suggest you do. You can bike all the way to Malibu.Research parking before you come in. There is a parking structure near the pier but I assume it fills up on busy days. Always metered parking within a few blocks of the beach - read the signs carefully.

50,A true taste of the California life,"Miles of clean white beaches and over 20 beach volleyball courts makes Pier Avenue in Hermosa Beach a must see for people wanting a taste of the California lifestyle. The boardwalk allows for great people watching with bicycles, roller skaters, walkers and dogs using this strip of pavement with an ocean view for daily exercise. Stop into one of the many restaurants and bars before you leave. The food is good and the happy hours are even better.",roxy099

50,Amazing Place,"Hermosa Beach is just a fun little beach community in Southern California. We were enticed to the area due to our daughter moving there some 2+ years ago. There are things -a-plety to do: sun on the beach, volley ball in the sand, run, walk or bike on the ""Strand"" which is a concrete walkway running through the community from Redondo Beach all the way to Santa Monica. The Hermosa Pier seems to always have something happening. This past weekend was the Fiesta Days. Hords of people, but very enjoyable..coming from a cranky older dude! Several bands were playing, food courts, craft booths and beer gardens were the flavors of the day. Of course it seems the weather is just...nice, most of the year. On non-event weekends, the place is busy, but not too annoying. Parkikng is a nightmare, like all beach communities. So bring quarters, lots of quarters and be aware of your meter times or spring for an all day parking lot. Cheaper than a parking ticket. Do not park on residential streets more than one hour, May 25-Spet 15. It is for residents with resident passes only and you WILL be cited.Come enjoy this little gem. You will enjoy it. The locals are also some of the friendliest folks anywhere. Not stuffy and always willing to give tips on where to go and where to eat.TIP***Good Stuff Restautant on the strand and Rok Sushi Kitchen on Hermosa Beach Ave at Pier Ave are a must.",Mauisron
50,great pier!,what a lovely festival during memorial day weekend! the stands were high end and the restaurants were open and packed! Great day!,sportspup
50,Laid Back Beach Town Feel,"We stayed at the south end of Hermosa Beach right on the strand in a privately owned condo in mid June.The area was very clean and quiet for the most part. We had no issues with noise even though the strand was literally right out front. A street sweeper came down the strand each morning to clear any sand and debris. This area of the strand is all concrete and has a concrete wall separating it from the sand. After traveling to all of the surrounding beach cities we felt that Hermosa's strand section was the prettiest. The strand is shared by all; pedestrians, cyclist, skateboard, rollerbladers, etc. in this area. It was quite entertaining to watch all the different people stroll by. We saw dogs in strollers and even one dog riding a skateboard!We felt very safe for our entire stay. The locals were very friendly and we felt right at home. We watched several people play volleyball right from our balcony. Most people seemed happy and friendly. It made me want to make Hermosa Beach my permanent home.We ate several times along Hermosa Ave and at the pier and were very happy with the food and service. Our favorite place was Mickey's Deli on Hermosa. It was right behind our condo and made HUGE sandwiches any way you wanted. They also had several other food choices. It's just a small little place but all the employees were extremely friendly and made you feel like a local.You can rent bicycles at Hermosa Cyclery at the pier by the hour or day. From here you have miles of beachfront paved strand to ride without going out into traffic to the north. If you head south to Redondo Beach you will ride in a bike lane on the road for a distance once you leave the Hermosa portion of the strand.The weather is beautiful in June but a bit more chilly than we expected. We did wear sweatshirts, pants and jackets at least in the mornings. The ocean water is also pretty cold this time of year also. Coming from the midwest this was a surprise for us, as we usually vacation on the east coast where it is extremely warm in June. I didn't put on a bathing suit during my whole trip!The beach is wide and quite a walk to the waters edge here. There are plenty of volleyball nets if you care to try your hand at beach volleyball. And, at least at the time we visited, there was hardly anyone on the beach away from the pier. It was surprising but very nice and quiet.All in all I would certainly recommend Hermosa Beach as a vacation destination. It has that small town feel with enough dining and recreation around to avoid using a car once you are there. What a great place to vacation! We can't wait to go back!",CoastalDreamer70
40,Nice beach and boardwalk,"I visited Hermosa Beach for the first time this month. It's wonderful! You can totally just sit out and watch the array of different people (and their dogs) go up and down the boardwalk. People seem happy, fit (someone is always running, jogging, bouncing, riding, something!). The sand seems endless before you get to the water. And the folks over at hermosa beach take volleyball seriously!!! I love it so much more than Santa Monica which is TERRIBLY over crowded.. just like NYC.",EnGee1976
50,"Sun, sand, surf... :)","Just a really nice stretch of California beach from Hermosa to Manhatten Beach. Can be hectic by the plaza and vollyball courts but a walk to waters edge is a different world. Keep an eye open for various wildlife. Minutes off the Pacific Coast Highway, about 15-20 from LAX. Walk the strand and enjoy the sights. May 11 wasted a few hours enjoying warm sand and sun prior to catching flight home.",VAN-BC-Traveller
30,Great Weekend Getaway Choice,We stayed at a Hampton Inn one weekend so we could attend an evening at Boogaloo. We were able to walk to the strand for the evening where we had a nice dinner and saw Arthur Adams at the Boogaloo. We felt safe most of the time even though we didn't get back to the hotel until after midnight and there was a lot of people out since it was Saturday night.,GlendaleGirl1
30,"Nice beach, not much else.","The beach is really nice, the pier was closed when I was there, so can't comment.The bars in the pier area (a small boulevard of about a dozen bars) are tacky and resemble a small cheap holiday resort",Rufus64
50,Family Friendly,"Great beach with wide open access. Kids go wild. A fantastic walking sidewalk on the sand although you do need to watch out for bikes competing for the space you walk on. Parking is not bad although it may be a few blocks away. For a true beach experience eat at Scotty's on the strand sidewalk/sand. Parking is free in the back and easy. Cheap and plenty of food but nothing fancy--basic American. One of the oldest jazz clubs in the United States is located on the pier (The Lighthouse) and the Comedy Club, where Jay Leno practices his routines weekly, is one block off the strand. Young singles and couples will especially like the night scene on the Pier.",BobWE
50,The Most Exciting Beach in Los Angeles County,"Having grown up in Santa Monica, I enjoyed going to the pier and amusement parks dating back to Pacific Ocean Park in the 1950s. We moved to Hermosa Beach in 2001 after hearing from friends about their experiences here. The parking sucks, but that's a good thing. It means that the beach is enjoyed more by locals and not by the other 10 million inhabitants of metropolitan L.A. Also, the freeways don't come right down to the beach as they do in other areas.As a result, the crowds are much smaller (except on July 4th). The surfing and volleyball is first rate and the Strand (bike path) becomes a parade of happy beach-goers.There's always something going on in the city -- Fiesta Hermosa is a huge arts and crafts fair that takes place every Memorial Day and Labor Day weekend. Volleyball and surfing tournaments abound. And in the evening, there are scores of restaurants, bars, and music venues to serve the young population.In many ways, Hermosa Beach is where young people come after they graduate from college to continue the party life.",tomslyck

No sidewalk vendors, no T-shirt shops, no sunglass stores, no marijuana clinics. Just a dozen restaurants/bars clustered around Pier Avenue (don't miss Good Stuff, a block north, or Martha's on 22nd Street), a great beach of sugar-soft sand and a never-ending stream of locals in various stages of dress and undress enjoying the sun and salt air.Stroll the entire length, from the Redondo Beach line to the Manhattan Beach line (about 30 minutes one way at a leisurely pace) and soak it all in. Critique the multi-million-dollar homes along the Strand on lots which sold for $30,000 more or less in the sixties. Too bad that 30 grand was an impossible number for most of us back then.Recover from your bout of ""if-only"" with a drink and a snack, then snooze on the beach, or watch a volleyball game or a sunset, and ponder Eliot's comment that mankind cannot bear very much reality.",JTMRPV
50,Great beach town!!,"We loved staying in Hermosa. It is the perfect beach town for a quiet, active, fun get-away. There is plenty to keep you busy or you could just hangout at the pier or on the beach. Lots of great restaurants and bars. The locals are inviting and the service is outstanding in all the venues we visited.",PAM77
50,Our Favorite Beach,"We come here every year to play on the beach, watch the surfers, skate/bike on the strand, eat great food and relax. Parking isn't a problem for us because we have parking at the hotel. We love it here.It's very self-contained with lots of great food, great entertainment. We come and don't get in our car for days at a time. Also, great shops, great people, great volleyball!!Try to avoid party times like 4th of July, etc. The college crowd can be heavy and hard.Instead, go ANY other time. We highly recommend Hermosa Beach.",AthleticTouchMom
30,Kinda wants to be Venice,"The town is quaint but the shops there try to mimic Venice Beach. I wish that some originality would take over. The Beach is trashed and over run parking is a pain, lots of gwaking people and cars. Go north up the road to Venice.",tj4diving

30,welcome party animals,"The beach is beautiful, the strand will give you an eyeful. Its a great beach city which has a few too many bars if you are over the age of 25. Granted there are some fabulous restaurants with great menus that will please all ages. There is so much variety when it comes to food choices and bar choices and boutiques..its great in that respect. Whether its a plus or a minus in your book...its really a party town....Pier Avenue is bar after bar after bar and as can be expected if you are there at night...you will encounter the patrons who have had a few too many. Again, if you are of that mindset...go for it. Family friendly? Make sure you can cover their eyes if need be.",Yvettetravels
50,Friendly Beach,"My favorite part of Hermosa Beach, is the wide boardwalk. It is actually divided in half for direction of travel, then again for walkers and those on bikes or other types of wheels. You can go in one direction towards Manhatton Beach, or the other direction towards Redondo. The beach houses are fun to look at and there are public restrooms all along the way. The beach itself is very wide. In fact, if you have heavy or cumbersome things to carry, I suggest a backpack of sorts. The waves are totally kid friendly, yet there is a section of beach by the pier that is just for surfing. The waves are modest, so you can usually see a bunch of beginners getting lessons. There is usually a slight breeze near the water, that is clean and fresh because of the no smoking law. The beach is cleaned and raked daily and is pretty wide open in the fall, which is when I went. Temps in the 70's, sunshine and friendly people. You can even get free wifi or rent a bike. I love this beach! There is a wide selection of restaurants by the pier, but no little store for quick snacks or drinks. There are also plenty of sand volleyball nets set up. On weekends it is fun to see teams of young people playing.",Jodie D
50,Lovely beach and people,"Just had a nice 6 mile run on the very pedestrian friendly beach walk (separate bike path along a long section toward Manhattan Beach). Maybe because it is quiet October, but people smile and it feels like a community not a resort. A wonderful place.",CTE

50,"Beautiful beach, no smokers, free wifi","This is a gorgeous beach. Beautiful white sands, a lovely wide pomenade for walking and riding, plenty of public toilets and - I can't believe this - free wifi. The beach is also smoke free.I spent a leisurely couple of hours walking up and down, admiring the waterfront houses and watching the parade of characters. Clearly, the french bulldog is the fashion accessory of choice at the moment. I spent another couple of hours reading under the pier, enjoying the quiet and lack of crowds.One of the days I visited there was a volleyball contest of some kind, and people were wandering around in strange team costumes - think bright tutus, ties, braces or knee high socks. I got some great photos. Despite the competition, the noise levels remained low and everyone was very civil.Parking is plentiful, and although you have to pay, it is not overly expensive (about 1.50 an hour, from memory). There are a lot of nice restaurants and cafes.Highly recommended. A much calmer, more mellow atmosphere than crowded Santa Monica and sleazy Venice Beach.",HAR77au

50,I love it which is why I moved here :),"I grew up in southern California and have to say this is one of the best beach towns in Socal. The main attraction is of course the beach, but the reason it gets hype is because the Pier is filled with restaurants, bars, shops, and people just walking around having a good time. During the week the beach is quiter, yiu'll have tons of beach (and volleyball courts) to yourself, on the weekend it fills up although but you will never have a hard time finding a private spot on the sand as the beach is HUGE. One plus to this area is there is no freeway that takes you right into the Southbay (Manhattan, South Redondo and Hermosa) so it's mainly filled with locals and in no way feels touristy.There are volleyball nets set up everywhere as well as a couple beach tennis courts which are very fun. Everyone is pretty friendly so if your solo, ask someone if you can hop in on a game most people are pretty friendly. I love riding my beach cruiser up and down the strand going to either Manhattan or Redondo for lunch, they are both only 10 minutes on a bike, you can rent bikes just behind a place called the Poop Deck (a bar :)) on the strand.As far as restaraunts some personal favorites are:Intimate date night: Buona Vita is a cute italian place on Pier OR The Bottle Inn, which can be a little pricier but is on Sundays and Mondays during the summer they offer the ""sunset dinner"" which is a very nice 3 course dinner for about $13 and yoiu can sit outisdeHamburger and beer: Rockefeller on Pier AveSeafood: Unfortunately noone really shines in this category, take a bike ride to Redondo and get visit Captain KidsIce Cream: Paciugo, fresh Gelato!Breakfast: Martha's! (Expect a wait if your going on the weekends) or Brothers for breakfast burritos!Laid back bar with pool, darts and flip flops: UndergroundCappucino, people watching, crepes & accents ;): Creme de La CrepeMexican: As a local I am sad to say we don't have any great laid back authentic mexican places. :(...La Palmilla just opened on the pier and while the food is actually really good it is too expensive! It's a fancier place so if you feel like splurging (or want a more upbeat place for date night) and are wanting to go in the Mexican direction you won't be dissapointed with the food.Live Music: Saint Rocke",TrvlrChk

Great food at the local spots, fun surf shops and the people watching is very AMUSING. You are sure to get some laughs... The beach volleyball brings in world class players as well as groups of friends having a good time. Surfers, boogie boards, sunsets...it is all good!

One of the locals joked about how tourists are astounded by the beach (while they take it for granted.)

50,One of SoCal's nicer beaches,"South of LAX are three beach communities-Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, and Redondo Beach. This review is about the actual beach on the Pacific Ocean at Hermosa Beach.The center of this beach is where Pier Avenue meets the ocean, but the beach stretches to the north and south, connecting to the other two communities mentioned earlier.On our visit, the sand was meticulously clean, the area felt very safe, and the other beach goers were friendly. Lifeguards are placed all along the beach. Swimming seems pretty safe.Along the beach runs ""the strand"", which is a paved path for bikes, walkers, etc. (but no cars).Hermosa Beach is big on beach volleyball. I don't know the setup for who plays where, but feel free to watch, if nothing else.There are several parking facilities within a short walking distance of the beach.
