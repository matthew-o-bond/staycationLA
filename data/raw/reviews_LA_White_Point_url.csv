50,Real treasure!,"Came here looking for tidepools and were not disappointed! Originally tried Fermin but the walk down the bluffs did not look safe at all. Drove north and just discovered this—a steep road leads down and let’s you park right below the bluffs, where a magical system of sandy beaches and small sandy or rocky pools appears at low tide. We arrived 2 hours before low tide and it was perfect. Abundant if typical marine life in great health, plus sun warmed wading pools with sandy floors for the kids to splash in. Plus gorgeous scenery, many pelicans, Catalina in the distance, large ships passing, and a sighting of a zeppelin, which apparently moors nearby.Read about the sad history, too. Farms and businesses owned by Japanese Americans, seized by the government in 1942 when they were interred in camps. Foundations of old buildings here—not sure if that is connected to the original spa?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joryn1
50,Love this park!,"When I visit California, the ocean is a big draw (I'm from the Midwest). I especially like to explore tide pools. This beach is great for that, especially since you can drive down near the elevation of the beach. Even if you have physical limitations, you can see some tide pools here. Bring your binoculars too - oceangoing traffic (freighters, cruise ships, etc) is fun to watch. If you can, time it so that you'll be there at sunset. The part of the park at the top of the hill has a great view, and there are bathrooms you can use as well. Bring $3 cash or a credit card - that's what it costs to park at the lower parking area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cello12345
50,Royal Palms,Royal Palms is a beautiful location and definitely has a extravagant view of Catalina go ahead and grab some food and use one of those BBQs down at the firepit you will really enjoy this location tons of surfers be sure to wear your wetsuit if you do surf it gets sort of cold,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PercyJackson9
50,Cool tide pools,"I'd been to abalone cove before, and didn't like the hike down, so i tried this place at the recommendation of friends much easier to get to, parking at the bottom makes for an easy walk to the tide pools. Make sure to go at low tide and bring foot protection because the rocks are sharp.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RPVTravelmore
50,"Lots to see, awesome for a walk",Great location for a walk down the beach.Good for kids has a small play area.Free parking is available but limited also paid parking right next to the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/877lawrenced
50,Beautiful Sunset,Try to get to the lowest level as the sun goes down and watch the sunset. The wave crashing the rocks makes for some great video. Local police told us be gone by dark as the dealers take over after that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmattship
50,Dolphins and Classic Cars - Scenic White Point,"We very much enjoyed the vista views of the Pacific Ocean at White Point. We also saw dolphins swimming in the water. There is nice desert foliage. On the way out of the park, we saw classic cars arriving.There is a fee for parking. One pays at the parking fee meter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
50,Lots to see and great exercise,"We climbed among the rocks along the beach and found sea hares, starfish, crabs, sea urchin and, of course, barnacles and mussels. (Our muscles were quite sore the next day.) Watched the birds grab the sea urchins and eat the insides, leaving the purple ""skeleton"" behind. Bring your hand sanitizer and sturdy shoes that you won't mind getting wet. You might want a change of clothes in case you stand too close to the edge of the cliff where the waves crash over. My son did. Porta potties are on site and we brought our own snacks. I didn't notice any food for sale. I think parking may have been about $7 and we stayed about 2 hours at low tide. We probably would have taken advantage of the hiking trails also if we had come earlier in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7seekers
40,Great for short hikes with great vistas,"White Point is a fairly small state park that extends from the hillside butting up against homes down to the state beach, but it offers incredible views from nearly any point. What amazes me every time I stare out into the Pacific is the proximity of Catalina Island. The park provides easy terrain for hiking with mild elevation. Most of the park can be hiked within 2 hours and it makes a great early morning or late afternoon/evening destination to get a walk in. Great place to catch a sunset as well. Flora and fauna are in abundance as this park is in the middle of a project to reclaim its more natural state after being used as a military defense point up through the 70s. The defense structures that still exist are definitely worth checking out. I've yet to make it down to the tide pools across the road but plan to at some point. The visitor center is only open on Wednesdays and the weekends. White Point State Park is where a large stretch of W. Paseo Del Mar Road collapsed to the beach and sea below. The only route to get here is down Western Ave. now. A great aspect about this park is the sparse population, and most of them being locals. It doesn't draw the crowds that Portuguese Bend does up the road, and its vistas are just as amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freekarma
