50,A Beautiful well laid out museum in the heart of downtown LA,"I have been to La Plaza de Cultura y Artes a few times, each time to see a different exhibit of Mexican American history and art. It is free to the public and always has interesting displays of the historical contributions of the Mexican American in California. One exhibit that was of interest to me was the Mexican American baseball teams that were very active in the 50's in the Southwest. These baseball leagues were a big part of Sunday afternoons at the local parks in Boyle Heights. This exhibit brought back many old memories for me of watching my Dad play ball in these leagues. Another exhibit featured the Walk Outs of the high school students of the Los Angeles Unified School District in 1968. Every visit to this gem of a museum offers a glimpse of the history of Los Angeles and its ties to the Mexican American Culture. A must see not only for Latinos but for those visiting Los Angeles and those that live here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Estmarie65
50,An interactive experience for the whole family!,"I found out that this museum was free, so I decided to go and visit this place. I honestly had low expectations... turns out it was one of the best museums in all of LA! There was so much information that really shocked me but it opens your eyes to the reality of what used to be. The history I never heard, now being shown to me. What made it so memorable to me was that it had so many interactive sections, including many where you are actually free to write your thoughts about things. The staff here are super friendly, and it is actually a very engaging experience! You can smell things, try on things, draw, write, and more. I definitely see myself coming back!! Make sure to donate at the end!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fistoflight

50,Wonderful Museum,"We really enjoyed our visit. The permanent exhibits are very well done and informative. The two temporary exhibits; a photography exhibit ""Landscapes and Land Dwellers"" and ""Ya Basta!"", the history of the 1968 student walkout were fantastic. The museum is free, and also open on Mondays, when most museums are closed. There is not much signage out front, so it's easy to miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cnd324
40,Premier center of Mexican American culture,"Located in El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument, LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes better known as La Plaza, is a project of LA County and a Smithsonian Affiliate. It occupies the ground and first floor of the 1888 Vickrey-Brunswig Building and the 1883 Plaza House at El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Monument.The building is adjacent to La Placita Church across Main Street, directly in line with the gazebo in the Old Plaza. Despite its Spanish name and its focus on the Mexican and Mexican-American experience, the exhibits are largely in English.La Plaza showcases the story of Mexican Americans in Los Angeles and is the premier center of Mexican American culture. It aims to celebrate and cultivate an appreciation for the influence of Mexican culture, especially with reference to its manifestation in Los Angeles and Southern California.It celebrates the past and energizes the future by sharing the stories of history, culture, values, traditions of Mexicans, Mexican Americans and all Latinos in the founding and ongoing evolution of Southern California.The vehicles it uses for this purpose are exhibitions, public programmes and educational programmes.

50,"Fascinating museum, beautifully presented",This museum and gallery was not in my plans when I visited downtown LA but I am so glad I stumbled upon it. I learned so much from the exhibits and clearly presented information. Upstairs were two specialist exhibitions including a fascinating history of the school walk outs of 1968 and an interactive guide to life in the 1920s. This is a little gem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lasydaisymoo
50,Free museum !!,Great museum. Rotating exhibits relating to Mexican American and Los Angeles history. Donations optional. Museum events are free and their gift store holds unique items. Highly recommended spot if you would like to know more about la history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y2520YIstacys
50,"The Best Small, Free Museum in the area!","LA Plaza De Culturas y Artes (LA Plaza for short) is a very cool free museum! It is a Mexican American museum and cultural center. There are a ton of free museums in the area, but I think this one wins for best experience. It is much bigger than it looks and there is a lot of information! I wish the Italian American Museum upped their game to rival this one in size. We really enjoyed ourselves here. The staff member was SUPER nice and charming too.The Gateway to Nature is a small nature center with various activities or children to learn about nature. It's pretty cool as they're not trying to sell you anything... they just want you to come in, learn and have a good time. My toddler was getting a bit antsy from all the museums we were visiting, so this was a nice break where he could go in, sit down and color 'til his heart was content. He was even given a free comic book about Smokey The Bear!This isn't a huge place, but I'm very thankful that this was here.Make this into a day trip! My toddler and I literally visited 6 museums! There are small museums all around here and almost all of them are free! Start your journey with a walk down Olvera Street! Catch the Avila Adobe, maybe have lunch or a snack. Then walk across the way and visit The Chinese American Museum, the Plaza Firehouse Museum and the new Gateway to Nature (which is a nature center full of things for kids to do). Then walk across the street to La Plaza De Culturas y Artes museum. Maybe poke your head into Our Lady of Angeles Church. I'm very Atheist, but this is historic as it's literally what named and started Los Angeles. Then continue down Main street and hit up the American Tropical Historical Museum and end with the Italian American Museum! There are a few other things in there too I think I missed. A great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
50,Must go to La Plaza,Amazingly informative and pleasant experience. The information was displayed attractively and I was totally engaged for over an hour. Amazing for me. The location near Pico Building and the el pueblo de Los Angeles area is well worth exploring. Well worth seeing for all tourists to educate about history of Mexicans in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiceylulu
50,Mexican art and history,My knowledge of US/ Mexican history is limited so this was a great place to start. I had no idea that Mexicans has inhabited LA for fifteen thousand years. This whole area is really interesting. The exhibitions were great too. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandralydia
50,"Amazing, Well Organized, Beautiful Museum","December 31, 2016 - The La Plaza de Cultura Y Artes has only been open for a couple of years and admission is by contribution. This is a professional grade gallery but it is more than a gallery. Various exhibits trace the history of Los Angeles intertwined with the history of Mexico and it is all expertly presented. There are also exhibits that include Anthony Quinn, who was born in Chihuahua, Mexico; although many people believe he was Greek since he played Zorba the Greek.There exhibits showing the interaction and tensions between young Mexicans and Los Angeles police during the 1960s. One exhibition includes pictures from the 1978 Latino musical, ""Zoot Suite"" and, coincidentally, the musical is being revived during early 2017 by the Los Angeles Center Theater Group. Another exhibit introduces the visitor to the school segregation policies that existed in Las Angeles towards Latinos. Many of the exhibits have a combination of written, video and audio to allow the visitor to better absorb the message.In addition to the incredible exhibits, there is also an area on the second floor where visitors can put on various hats and have someone in their group take their picture with various backgrounds. Also, on the second floor is an audio area where one can listen to various older Latino songs and music.I would rate this museum as one of the best I have visited because of its professional quality and various exhibits that allows you to immerse yourself into the history of Mexicans and Latinos in shaping the City of Angels.You should not miss the chance to visit La Plaza de Cultura Y Artes on your journey to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryH9905
50,Very well done gallery and gift shop,"I can't say enough about how well done this gallery is. All artwork had stories about the artist and the art piece. Galleries dealt with subjects as diverse as Mexican and East LA wrestling, East LA baseball clubs, early LA life, and more. The gift shop was exceptional too and offered unique items that were perfectly connected to the artwork in the galleries. The staff members were super helpful and friendly. If you find yourself near Union Station in LA, don't miss it and please leave some money in the donation box. This gallery/museum deserves to be supported. They are doing everything right and contributing a wonderful service to the community and tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowlander46
50,Great work being done at LA Plaza!,"hosts a very interesting two-level museum with an interactive section for younger children, has a garden outside, and they do a lot of mazing work in the community by hosting film screenings, talks, food vendors, etc. Great place to learn about the history and legacy of Mexicans and Mexican Americans in LA. and its free of charge!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oscarh4
50,Undiscovered Museum,"I discovered this museum by accident about 8 months ago. Most people have yet to discover this little gem. I didn't have time then but made it back to finally visit. The museum covers the history and culture of Mexicans in Los Angeles.On the day that I visited, we saw and exhibit on City Counsel member Gloria Molina, an early Latina leader. On the second floor was a stylized street lined with shops and a model city for children to work with. One case had a ram's horn polished like a jewel that I found fascinating. There were other exhibits on history, culture, and art. Admission is by donation making this a fine little gem when visiting Olvera Street just a few hundred feet away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
