40,Nice Theater,I was here on a Friday night to watch a friend's special screening. The theater shares parking garage with the mall but the entrance isn't inside the mall. It's a really nice theater. Holds maybe 300 seats. Good sound. Lobby for gathering before or after the show. Like I said it's connected to the mall parking garage so parking isn't an issue at all. Great views from all seats.,Polaroids & Drinkin Stories
50,Great little theatre,Seats only 250 but a lovely place to see a play. Many restaurants in walking distance. We say a fun play called “Waikiki Chica’s”. There’s not a bad seat in the house. Facilities are very clean and very nice people help you to your seat.,Skyros7
40,Small Theater,Great seats anywhere in the venue. Parking is free...shares a parking lot with Macy's. If you're early wander around Macy's.,Leon S
50,Great Theater To See A Show,"All seats are good seats. Great place to see a show. We thoroughly enjoyed My Mother's Italian, My Father's Jewish & I'm In Therapy.The rows are a bit narrow. Cnsider an aisle seat.",TravelinAlan
40,Very Enjoyable Local Theater,We have been Colony subscribers for more than 10 years and usually find that most of the productions are excellent. Even the lesser ones typically have strong performances -- it's just that the material is either weak or not to our taste. The price for season subscriptions is reasonable and there are only good seats (given the size of the theater and how it is laid out).,David E
50,One of Los Angeles Prized smaller theatres,"I've been to the Colony many times. The productions are first rate with casts you'll recognize from theatre, film and television. One of the city's jewels.",K C
50,"""Best of Enemies"" at the Colony is Must-See Theater","People associate Los Angeles with the movies and TV, but there's a lot of live theater there, too. Perhaps it's because of all the actors hoping to make it in Hollywood, but no matter -- audiences benefit from the abundant pool of talent.The Colony Theater was founded 40 years ago by just such a group and has produced many excellent shows since then. The one we saw last night was particularly good -- the acting, the production, and the play itself -- as well as timely. So If you'll be in LA before October 18th (2015) and love theater, I urge you to see it.""Best of Enemies"" is based on a true story and may sound too heavy to some people, but don't let the topic scare you off. The divide at the heart of the story is race, but it could be anything -- religion, or nationality, or political party. And, like the best plays, it entertains while making an important point -- opposites who try to find common ground will discover that they aren't so different after all. You'll spend much of the evening laughing and will leave feeling uplifted.",WoodsResidents
40,It's a nice place to see a good play,"sometimes the parking is hard to find, but well worth going. They always put on good plays. The theater is always clean, and the staff always greet you with a smile.",happytravels202
40,Long time subscriber,"My wife and I have been season subscribers to The Colony Theater for many years, dating back to their start on Riverside Dr in Los Angeles. Mostly, we have attended with another couple, who have changed over the years. The present location in Burbank is very nice and convenient, with free parking next to the theater and many restaurants within walking distance. A recent funding crisis has been resolved, so the future looks good for now. The productions vary from musicals to heavy social themes, and are usually quite good. The ear phones supplied for hard of hearing customers are not very satisfactory, since the sound source is the stage mics and can be noisy. (Unlike those in movie theaters, which use the sound track.)",Francis S
50,Hidden Gem!,"The Colony Theatre is a hidden gem on the edge of the Burbank Mall. Winner of many Ovation nominations and awards, they house outstanding theater productions with a varied season each year. Every seat in the house is truly great, with an intimate closeness. Season ticket holders will feel like a part of the theater family. The overall quality of the production, design, lights, sound and performances is of top caliber. Well worth the trip to Burbank!",Alexandra H
50,Great Theater,This is a lovely smaller professional theater that does wonderful works. Stadium seating so there is no problem with being visually blocked. Nice thrust stage. This is probably one of my favorite theaters around.,krosmon
50,"If you are looking for some local fun, then look no further","I used to voluntier here for a Regional Occupational Program. This theater is awsome! They really enjoy what they do and it shows. If you are looking to try something new or you into the performing arts, then you will be glad you gave this palce a chance.",riley c
50,Better than many of the bigger name theaters in L.A.,"A friend and I have been subscribers at the Colony for a number of years. The shows are consistently good. We had season tickets at the Geffen and the Taper but their offerings were so variable that we gave them up. The stage at the Colony is small so they tend to select shows with a small cast but they choose well. Give them a try and support a small, local theater!",valleytrekker
40,Great Community Theatre,"We always enjoy the Colony. The shows are uniformly excellent, the staff welcoming, not a bad seat, and great value for the money.We are committed, ling-term season ticket holders!",David E
40,Slightly upscale small theater,"A couple of good things about Colony--they usually have good casts and there are no bad seats. And oh yes, there is a parking garage right next to the theater",joerussin
50,AN EXCELLENT SMALL THEATER,"The Colony is a beatifully appointed mid-size theater in Burbank. It has a very good reputation and occassionally produces superior plays. They are not consistent, however, so I suggest reading reviews before attending.",Kris W
