10,Notoriously dangerous.,"I'm not sure why this university is listed on this site? This university is notoriously dangerous. It's dangerous because several of the leaders protect the problem doers or chose to look the other way. The FBI finally has gotten involved even though there is a long history of problems.On any given day there are protests against people who identify under protected groups.The leaders of Veterans office are just as bad.Considering that this college is known for their arts program, it is simply pure intellectual deficiencies to copy and build a blue pyramid. It promotes violations in creative rights.I definitely would look to hire from other universities long before this university would ever have the chance of being considered.Thankfully the problems on this campus have finally been taken seriously by the FBI.",Alejandro O

50,Hidden Treasure the Garden,Both my children went to CSULB so I spent a lot of time on campus since I made them live there. We lived close but part of the college experience is being involved on campus as much as possible. It's so much easier to get involved when you live at school and interact with people from out of your area. This is when I discovered the Japanese Gardens on campus. What a great way to relax and enjoy a beautiful day in Long Beach!,ginahicks921
50,Amazing College,I am an alumni of CSULB. The campus has so much to offer besides the education. The Japanese gardens are stunning. I still swim at the pool between 12-1pm almost every day and the charge is 1$ where as other public pools are 3$. Beautiful campus too.Go expolore!!!!,SteveFawley

40,Did my Undergrad Work Here. Nice campus.,"I went here in the 1980's. It's a great school. At the time, tuition prices weren't insurmountable. Now, students need to win the lottery if they have any hope of paying off their debt.I stopped here to walk around after a crappy date. It's still as nice as it was back in the 1980's. It's a sprawling campus and has plenty of amenities for students.I don't know if I would base part of a trip here, but the university does have a very nice performing arts center, that features some very talented groups.If anything, the university is a great place to walk around and get some exercise. The stairs from lower campus to upper campus are perfect to tone up those glutes and legs.",LucianoLeon

The chairs are very roomy and the armrest are big. No elbow fighting with the person next to you. There's not a bad seat in the whole house and the Isles are big enough for people to pass by you getting into the seats. Refreshments were very reasonable and I like the fact that you can pre-order your refreshments on intermission. Prices for more than reasonable through Goldstar,Johnny V
40,Great Campus - Great School,"Both my wife (70's) and my son (00's) are alum's. The campus covers a lot of ground, but is very walk/bike friendly. You get a nice sense on on campus community, but since it is in the middle of a large city (Long Beach) and next to an even larger city (LA) you are close to everything.We go back for a walk-through every time we are in southern California.",Mike B

50,Underrated Campus Compared to Most State Schools,"As a 1964 grad I still have fond memories of Cal-State Long Beach (Long Beach State when I started. The campus has faired quite well with the pyramid a real plus. It was crowded with the 9,000 students when I graduated and at 35,000 + I can imagine how crowded it is now. When I attended we referred to it as the ""mausoleum on the hill"" forthe lack of political efficacy of the ""Silent Generation"" students. Overall, the campus still looks good although additional buildings have chopped up the vast expanse of lawn. I did not find my brick this trip but will be back to locate it with its inscription: Tom Barnes, Social Science, 1964.",Lighthouse2006
50,Quick College Visit,Long Beach State has a historic reputation. The Iconic Blue pyramid set a picturesque back drop as we did a quick drive by visit. We will register for the self guided tour.,Calana G

50,Future college visit!,"I took my 16 year old daughter for a self guided tour of the campus. So beautiful. It was Easter Break so there were no students, but the campus is so nice. My daughter is thrilled and can not wait to apply. The self guided tour was nice but it would have been nicer if they actually still gave tours. Last time I checked, the site side due to budget cuts they weren't doing campus tours anymore. That is a bummer.",Robin M
40,Better than you think,"Long Beach State, as we knew it back in the 60's will never be known as one of the most beautiful college campus' in the world, but it ain't bad. Park where you can and stroll the campus. It's a really nice school. Considering there are so many students, it's actually pretty quiet. Most of them are tapping on their phones.",Mike
40,Loved This School,"I really enjoyed my time at CSULB and if it weren't for the high tuition cost I would have gone back to try to get a Master's. The school's atmosphere is just positive overall and I think it has something to do with the fact that it's near the beach so you get a good breeze and can smell the saltiness of the ocean. Yeah parking can be a pain but the walk through the campus is nice, especially in the spring when everything is in bloom on the trees. I graduated in 2011 so I'm not sure what new buildings/restaurants/etc have opened up since then but I do remember it was cool to be able to grab a pint at the pub on campus! That really helped on the days I had to do class presentations :)",Tamara V

40,It's a college...,"I see some people on here complaining about customer service... Guys it's a school not a hotel or restaurant please get real. Obviously you'll get a government response because it's..... Government run. ? Any ways, it's a lovely college campus I gave it a 4 not a 5 because with the new colleges it sucks being a guniea pig (like me!) and having to do trial and errors with your counselor- took me an extra semester and a huge hit to my GPA to graduate :/ I suggest if you know what you need to do do it or go to experienced advisors even if it's not in your discipline. Mine sucked. But the school is gorgeous, love the vibes, love the new TAP system for the bus, parking is parking it sucks every where get over it- overall great school great people. They offer many activities/clubs, a remodeled library, an awesome Japanese garden, and at least in my discipline advisors help with internships- you get you're typical DGAF professors but then you come across the gems-",layownee
50,CSULB - my home sweet home,"CSULB is like a big out-of-state expensive college without the price tag. The whole layout of the campus is cozy and easy to access.CSULB is a tiny city in itself with; dorms, well-equipped student Union, a Japanese garden, a state-of-the-arts gym, full-staffed police station, professional tennis courts, world known soccer fields, famous blue 18-story Walter pyramid and an Olympic size swimming pool.In campus you can find many fast food restaurants, a children's day care and three performance art centers. And if you need a job, multiple job fairs come to campus during the year.The bookstore is well stacked with everything from books, computers, stationery, snacks, an extensive trendy wardrobe and even t-shirts for your dog. At the end of the semesters, the art students sell their works of art at a bargain. Who knows you could own a future Auguste Rodin piece of art?I love CSULB, So much fun and camaraderie among the students.",mellymacias
