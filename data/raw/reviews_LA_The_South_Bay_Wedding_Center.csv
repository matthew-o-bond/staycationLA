50,My whole family was so happy with every thing,I recently attended a wedding at The South Bay Wedding Center. It was amazing. A wall full of flowers from floor to ceiling. Jesse the new onsite Management and onsite coordinator was great! On the day of my sisters wedding we were greeted in a welcoming and friendly manner. Reverend Peter did my sisters ceremony. I was so moved by all his words and emotions that I broke down crying minutes into the ceremony. My whole family was so happy with every thing that I decided to book my wedding here in 2021. These place is so beautiful and the event staff is one of the best. My cousin got married at Guadalupes weedding chapel in los angeles. that place doesn't even come close to the level of service that this place provides. I can keep going on and on they were so good. The South Bay Wedding Chapel is the place to go. See you guys in July 2021!,Stephanie G

50,The best Destination Wedding Ever!,"Where do I begin...Robin, the coordinator, was Amazing! She not only helped me plan this from Mobile but she was professional, sweet as pie, and very flexible with last minute updates and changes. The venue is gorgeous. She made my family feel welcomed since they were coordinating for me in the West. Although i haven't seen my pictures yet...i know they will be awesome because the photographer was simply amazing. DO NOT HIRE A PHOTOGRAPHER FOR THIS VENUE...SHE KNOWS HER STUFF...from the lighting to the poses...she was on it. My family csn be a little demanding, yet this photographer handled it like a champ with excellent time management. I can go on and on about why you should go with this fabulous team...but there is simply not enough time. Robin, I would do business with you anytime. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts!The Sloans",Michelle M
50,I was happy...but not now,"The services was great. I got married in May of this year and everything was great.It has now been six months and still no marriage certificate. After placing several calls and going by and leaving voice mails, still no help. I was told that there was an error on certificate. There was no error. Robin was very particular to where to sign and how to sign. My copy did not match their copy. the box to change name was clearly marked. Was told to go to Hall of records and get it myself. (that's was what the $15.00 fee was for)",Philojan Z
