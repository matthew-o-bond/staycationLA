10,The Museum of Failure has Failed!,I was just by. The sign to the Hollywood and Highland location has been removed and the front door is locked. The place has closed up. They are also a failure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Burgerwars
10,A failure in itself,"I turned up at the museum at 9:10, as judging by TripAdvisor reviews it takes around an hour to look around. However it was closed and a sign on the door stated that last entry was at 8pm. Two questions: 1) Why is last entry 2 hours before closing time, and 2) If this is the case why not state it on your website?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/junaid_alvi
40,A one off museum,"Located very near the Chinese theatre this was easy to find. Yes, it is small and basic but it passed an enjoyable hour. Kids learned a few things and grown ups had memories revived. Not sure I agree segway was a failure (as a mass market produce perhaps) but it opened a few interesting debates in the car home. We were blessed that the lady on reception let our 3 students in on a reduction, none of them had their student IDs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/350madem
30,Kind of Minimalist,"The Museum of Failure is a unique idea: a museum of mostly failed commercial and electronic products over the past century. There are no large displays-only small displays, with a cute placard describing the failed idea, such as the classic Edsal or Trump Steaks. At the end there is a Confessional Room, in which you are invited to post your own personal failures on the wall with a sticky note--to accompany the hundreds that are already there--that's a cute and sometimes poignant touch. Many of Trump's failures are there: T Airlines, T Steaks, T casinos, T University. This museum is different and fun. Allow 30-45 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebelVirginia
30,"Unique, but Overpriced","I stumbled upon the sign for this museum as I was walking around Hollywood & Highland. Intrigued by the name, I decided to splurge. So, it's basically a one-room museum, and it was close to $20 for general admission. I was able to carefully read every single placard in the entire museum in about an hour. While there's a lot of variety and thoughtful musings on why each product failed (I definitely learned new information), I'm not 100% sure it was worth the price. Still, it's certainly a different sort of museum and a great conversation starter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crsgrl1223
20,Not very interesting,"A very small exhibit , just a few items have a proper explanation, it won’t take one more then half an hour to explore, some things are better explained then other.Summing it up , it’s not worthing the drive especially on a weekend when parking is terrible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bugasm101
40,Interesting and Different Museum in Downtown,I visited this interesting museum with my girlfriend as another girlfriend had recommended it to us. It is in a very different type of museum and I really liked it. The items that were on display each had a nice information card next to them that was informative with a sense of humor. There were a couple of TV's of interesting ads of items that had failed and it was a shame that the picture on the TV was blurry and of poor quality. The museum takes about an hour to complete if you read all the information cards.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeannieD_12
