50,This is the nicest mall in the area.,"There is a nice variety of shops in this mall with good security and adequate parking. I've visited recently to have a meal at BJs and I notice new restaurants coming in. The shopping is still good here as there has not been an exodus of businesses leaving this mall. I still do a lot of my Christmas shopping and last minute items for my daughter - swimsuit, new shirt, shoes to fit since she's outgrown her old pairs....",RangerBobN
40,Improved shopping options,"Actually, there have been additions of newer stores like H&M and Cotton On to give younger and trendy shoppers better options. While a lot of the teens still like to venture over to Arcadia- Santa Anita Fashion Park Mall, the Shops at Montebello is a closer alternative for the southern SGV folks.In addition, this mall is a great place to walk in the morning before the stores open. Many of the local residents come here to get their steps and since it's indoors, it is great for rainy or cold days and hot days, too!",Christine H
40,The best Mall in the area,"I live near by and this Mall is still thriving while most are not. The shops and food court is good and offers good shopping and eats. You'll find the location to be very accessible off the Pomona fwy., with plenty of parking and an enjoyable experience.",165Oldtimer
30,"Basic Mall, not a lot going on","It's a pretty standard mall and gets the job done if you need a mall. JC Penny's, Macy's, the usual shops. I tend to visit if I need to do a Macy's run. If I want to spend some serious mall time, I'll go to the Westfield in Santa Ana.",Debbie L

What a lovely two-level mall!!!My husband is short and slender and rarely able to find jeans. At the huge, lovely Macy's he found them! He got two pair!!! The jeans were organized sooo well and a huge selection.If we are in the area again, we would come and shop (or walk) at this mall.",LoveGetAways70

40,Montebello CA Joy,Its a different kind of experience to be here. I enjoyed browsing through the windows of shops. Had nice lunch at the café. There are places to sit down and relax. Enjoyed watching the mountains nearby from the mall.,Mohan K
50,"Very large and attractive, with store for moderate incomes","One walkable block from Town Center Inn and Doubletree Rosemead. JCP and Penneys are the anchor stores with numerous others for every taste, not just teens. Convenient seating areas and rest rooms scattered throughout this immense place. We found Chinese massage place just outside second floor Macy's, a pleasure during travel. Downstairs is a very large Mexican-oriented market with great pastries, take out, and meat-fish counter, etc. We were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed these discoveries along with long smog free walks.",pipilo2015
30,"Easy to find, find what you need","This mall is just off the the 60 freeway, so very easy to find if you are out of town. There are Department Stores JC Penney and Macy's. There are Sears and Cotsco just up the street. There is a food court with many of the usual choices--several Asian choices, burgers Italian, and Middle Eastern. There is a Marie Callendar's inside the mall and an Olive Garden that shares the parking lot. There is a Watch shop where I usually get my watch battery every couple of years. There are a number gift specialty stores and specialty clothing stores. So, if you are here from out of state and need an item of clothing or a quick gift, you probably can find something acceptable and get something decent to eat while you are there. Not above average, but everything clean and comfortable.",Brenda G
