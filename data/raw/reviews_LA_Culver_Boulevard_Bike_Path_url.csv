50,Great place to walk,My husband and I use the walking path down Culver Boulevard on a regular basis. We usually go early evening and enjoy it very much. Not a lot of traffic at that time so we can walk briskly without interference. Nice atmosphere. Lots of greenery and plants and trees.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/111CindyB
50,Convenient route to the beach,Very easy way to the beach that's well maintained. This path is a good way to avoid cars on streets. It's safe during the daytime.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMOgal
50,Perfect path for safety,The Culver Bike Path has become the routine on weekends whether riding our bikes to Venice or out running for exercise. The path creates a safe area for cyclists and walkers and dogs alike. Keeping the traffic away from foot traffic and making a space away from cars and anything that could occur... thanks to the city for implementing such a great space and path for people to do leisure safely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kvnoodle

50,"a peaceful, beautiful, delightful ride!","This is one of our favorite ""go-to"" places. We hitch our bikes to our car, park nearby, and go off on the bike path from Centinela to Playa del Rey or sometimes Manhattan Beach. We stop to eat at a little place off the path in Playa del Rey, then continue on our way or turn back. You coast along the canal and then off you are on the beautiful beach. People are polite, the energy is lovely...a real gift.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miriyam
40,nice re-purposing of old railroad track,A nice way to walk your dog and move around this part of Culver City. It sets you apart from the traffic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CulverCityA
40,"Perfect bike path, flat, no crowds, great place to teach a youngster","There are other bike paths in the Culver City West Los Angeles area, including the more well-known Ballona Creek path which is less than one mile away. This one though is completely flat, runs 2 1/2 miles (or 5 miles round trip), and is absolutely perfect for beginner riders. Took a beginner 8 year old on the path, and he loved it. Need a flat place to teach someone to ride? This is it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/like_national_parks
