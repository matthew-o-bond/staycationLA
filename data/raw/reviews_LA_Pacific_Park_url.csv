40,Fun time for family and kids,"Visited this place on US trip with SOTC group. Pacific Park is an oceanfront amusement park located on the Santa Monica pier, California. The park is directly out on the Pacific Ocean, in the direction of Catalina Island. It is the only amusement park on the West Coast of the United States located on a pier and LA's only admission-free park. There are a total many rides in the Pacific Park including the world's first and only solar powered Ferris wheel that provides a view of the Pacific Ocean and a roller coaster that circles the majority of the park. The park was very busy with people during our visit. The park has appeared in many movies and television shows. Great place for family and specially kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cp_0010
40,Busy,"This is something you should see once, but be aware it is very crowded and touristy 100% of the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BRRTS19
40,Fun afternoon activity,"Small but fun, specially for smaller kids as there are a lot of rides for them. I wish I’d read the reviews prior to going because I agree, get the unlimited wristband for everyone going. We got our kiddo a wristband because we figured she’d go on her own in all the kiddie rides and we shelled out $36 so us two adults could do the sharknado and Ferris wheel. After doing the sharknado once i regretted not doing the wristband because it was so fun that I’d easily would have ridden it two or three more times. Soooo just pull the trigger, have fun, get the wristband!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellielgstl
30,Small and compact,Not keen on fairground rides but we had time to kill so had walk around the park. There are a lot of the expected rides they use different names for them in the USA than they do in the UK but the rides are much the same. The Big Wheel gives you the opportunity to get fantastic view across the the town and the coast/beach. Suitable for all ages but not so sure about all abilities I did not see any one getting assistance and couldn't see adapted rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holiday-view23-7-11
50,Really cool place 👌!,"This brings back memories of childhood places! Great place to remince,an enjoy things there to do. Bring a big wallet you'll need to spend some $$$$ here. Enjoy it I did....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onehotdj
40,Nice Small Amusement Park,"This is a nice small amusement park with a few rides (roller coaster, ferris wheel...) as well as an arcade. It's a neat place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark42139
30,Amusement park along the pier,There are a number of rides surrounding the pier including a ferris wheel which gives you a nice view of the ocean. There are about 10 or more rides here. Rides range between $5-$10 or you can purchase a wrist band that will give you unlimited rides during your visit. The wrist band is about $30.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharmainD_12
50,Great pier,Santa Monica pier is a great pier to walk down. It has a number of shops and restaurants along the pier. It can get very busy most days but it is worth the effort to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m-byrne-6
30,"Fun amusement park, but small and cramped","Stopped by Pacific Park with the family while exploring Santa Monica Pier by day. We did a couple of the rides and those were great fun for both kids and adults, but the park is small and crowded so getting around and waiting was less enjoyable.Pacific Park is a typical small amusement park that packs in a variety of rides in very small space. The ones we enjoyed most were the roller coaster and the shark frenzy. The lines were fine and even when waiting to get into the coaster, it was nice to enjoy the views of the beach and the ocean. The tricky part was that there was no good place to hang between rides for those not going on all the rides. The park therefore works fine for teenagers hopping between rides but not as well for a family with different needs for different kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EagleFlyer
50,Fun rides & great views!,"This was a great afternoon out for all of us. We had some food & drinks whilst checking out the view of the ocean and of the beach, then went on some of the rides. The ferris wheel and the carousel were particularly special. Well worth doing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatalieY641
40,Trade mark of Santa Monica,"We visited Pacific Park on our first day arriving from Europe. Obviously in the early morning hour, none of the rides are opened. But the ambience and surrounding is captivating and really beautiful. It's definitely a trade mark of Santa Monica and must see. Would have been better to ride some of them at 11 am but the queue had been very long. We were happy just looking around and taking pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dewie112
40,A must see. Iconic.,"What's not to love? A world famous pier, on a great beach and ocean in a great city.Plenty to see and do including: coasters and rides, shops, street acts, restaurants/cafes and bars.Best of all; the amazing views. Simply a must do if you go to California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardN28
50,Great rides on the pier,"Santa Monica Pier has a wealth of things ot spend your money on or just enjoy the view but the rides at Pacific Park are well maintained and good fun, try at least the roller coaster or Ferris wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
30,Lovely Lights at Night,I think the SM pier is a victim of it'sown success. I remember years ago it was a great place to visit. Now it is clogged with tourists and overpriced souvenir shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sundancer93003
40,Incredibly clean,As we walked the area we were amazed at the cleanliness of the area. It was a real treat to see how well it was taken care of.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wkcb
50,Thrills on the roller coaster,"We always enjoy the thrill of a roller coaster ride and the one here provided an exhilarating experience. Especially when after the first circuit another go was offered, that was accepted with shrieks of delight.A great atmosphere pervaded the whole park. Late afternoon and it was filled with excited kids of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
40,Great,What a great evening. Go to the Santa Monica pier enjoy the sunset. Then let the grandchildren enjoy some great rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/449mathewb
50,Nice Family Friendly Spot,"Tons of rides & carnival games, convenient to other attractions.The Ferris wheel is an LA icon, whether you ride it or just enjoy the LED show after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zapprint
40,The End of the Trail for Route 66,"That last leg of the route 66 trip I started years ago.I really like that the Pacific Park had free admission. Rides do cost money, if you plan on riding the roller coaster and Ferris Wheel more than once, then get the wrist band.The park is small but a great place to take the kids for the afternoon.Carnival food is included as are games to show your skill.Stop on by, it's a good bucket list point of interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deborah_SKK
50,Wowww,Amazing thrilling experience when we take the Rides. Merry Go Round at the Pier was among the best amused experience I ever had. You can actually have the City view on one side & Giant Sea view on other side.Awesome :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gparlie
50,Cute little amusement park!,"Perfect place to take young kids to have a little fun. There’s a little roller coaster, Ferris wheels and lots of other little rides and games.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buttacup_k
50,Great carousel!,"Visitors of all ages will enjoy the beautiful carousel at the Santa Monica pier. And it’s a great deal at $2 a ride. There are horses, stationary seats for toddlers, and several farm animals to ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N7169OFlarryb
40,Oldie but Goodie,"If you are going to the pier anyway and have kids in tow, this is a great little place to let them have a little fun on some rides. There is a surprising number of rides considering the same place. The tickets are expensive but that comes as no surprise. It is more about the old school amusement park atmosphere on a world famous pier then hitting the big thrill rides. I would not go to the pier for the rides only, but to also visit the beach, grab a bite to eat, visit a few shops and just enjoy the views from the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RCMommy
40,Nice at Sunset.,"People goes to the pier at sunset, to enjoy the sea, the breeze the colors, sometimes crowdy, but still good to take at least a picture for your memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robye144
20,Old Park,Old expensive park who's only thing is that it is on the pier. Otherwise nobody would visit it. Not worth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alejandroz292
20,Overcrowded and expensive,"Very overcrowded and expensive ride. Ride are basic costing premium price, better to buy a Go City LA card and get the rides for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dilbhaglanda
40,Fun time and great views at Pacific Park! Kid-friendly!,"I visited Santa Monica with my family in August, and after spending time at the beach in the afternoon, Pacific Park was a great way to end the day! It was significantly busier in the evening, but the lines for the rides were very short and it didn't feel too crowded despite the smaller size of the park. On the other hand, tickets for the rides could get pricey! The individual rides were around $8 per person, and a wristband for unlimited access to all the rides were $35. If you get the Go Card though, like we did, you get the unlimited rides deal included! If you are looking for thrill rides, Pacific Park isn't exactly the place to be, but we all still found Pacific Park quite enjoyable! There are several rides that younger kids would enjoy, though we only went on around 5 or 6, plus the Ferris wheel. The Ferris wheel gave a lovely view of the sunset from the top and of the pier and the beach! It was absolutely stunning.We didn't eat at Pacific Park, but there were several options for snack foods around the park. We didn't play at any of the arcade games either, but they looked really fun! There's plenty to do around here for an evening for all ages. And the views!!Oh, I will mention though that if you're wheelchair bound or have a stroller to push, it may become difficult on your way out of the park as the path goes uphill to reach street-level. A person in our party chose not to come for that reason!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellie20201
40,Fun time on Santa Monica Pier - go early!!,"I took my 2 adult daughters to the Santa Monica Pier on a Monday. We mainly went to see the beach and sea lions that swim around at the end of the pier. Our Lyft dropped us off at the pier around 10:30am, which gave us time to check everything out, take some pix and see the sea lions. We were also there when the Pacific Park rides opened and the ticket line was lite. I did notice as the day went on, the line got bigger. I knew there were rides, but didn't think they'd want to ride them. They did. I paid $35 pp for the all-you-can-ride wristband, which was the most cost effective choice, as most a la carte tickets for the ""big kids"" rides were $8 each . There are 12 rides in total and my kids rode about 8 of them (the 4 exceptions being kiddie rides). One bummer was the Gyro Loop - it's not included in the ""all-you-can-ride"" ticket. Apparently, it's an ""attraction"" - whatever that means!?? You have to pay $8pp separately to ride it. A rip-off for sure! My kids were disappointed, but got over it soon enough. There were plenty of other rides to ride.Later, we went to the outdoor mall area (across Ocean Ave and up the street heading away from the Pier). We had a late lunch on the rooftop at Cheesecake Factory. Hard to go wrong there and the view / breeze was nice! I would've liked to rent beach bikes to ride the beach path to Venice Beach, but it was getting late (4:30pm) and after the amusement rides, beach combing, late lunch and shopping, we were all pretty tired.TIP: Make sure you get to the pier before 11am. It's much less crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/necowgirl
50,Mrs. Baer,The kids and I and my significant other had a blast would do it all over again only thing is we lost my 5 year old she was supposed to be holding my pant buckle and let go and wonder off the the kids airplane ride,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hollywoods1979
50,Worth the time and cost - good experience.,"Compared to some of the other optiions in southern califiornia, this is by far the best choice. It is smaller than a theme park, but the kids have a good time. The boardwalk amd the beach combination is a highlight. Have to get there early to park on the pier, but there is usually plenty of parking in the lot by the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P601AHdavidb
40,Fun experience,I brought my kids here for the roller coaster. It isn't a thrill roller coaster and it is very friendly for younger kids. It has a variety of other rides like the ferris wheel and a two seater ride that spins up and down however we didn't do those rides. The lines are not too long and are pretty reasonable. There is also a food shop that sells dippin dots ice cream next to the park where my kids got some nice ice cream!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siobhaindoyle
30,Went only for the ferris wheel,"We decided to only pay for the ferris wheel because we didn't want to go on the other rides. Buying for individual rides isn't very economical, but it ended up being around $10 each. The view was lovely of the sunset. The park was very crowded, but if you want to spend a day at an amusement park, this one would be perfect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmill42894
50,Fun place with younger children,"Our family spent the entire day at Pacific Park during a recent trip. I located a promo online and was able to buy two adult unlimited ride wristbands for $24 each and then two children bands online from their website for $17 each. Cheaper than the price at the gate and MUCH cheaper than paying per ride. I had read other reviews and knew the price of the rides was high and since we planned to spend hours there, then buying the wristbands was the best idea for us. We more than got our money worth with the bands.We went with the intention of spending the morning in the park and changing to hit the beach in the afternoon. We arrived early and were able to park right on the pier. The hourly rate for parking is $3.75, but the max is $18 for the day. It's pricey, but the parking location can not be beat! We parked right next to the entire to the park. We had a cooler with us full of drinks and snacks, so we'd ride for a bit then return to our car (which was literally right there) for a drink, snack, more sun screen and then go back for more rides. We'll worth it! It was also nice that at the end of the day when we were hot and tired, we didn't have to walk up the pier or to our ride.In the end, we spent 7 hours riding the rides and enjoying the pier. Our daughter is 6 and tall enough for all rides (either alone or with an adult). Our son is 4 and sadly was not tall enough for the coaster, but was tall enough for everything else (either alone or with an adult).The unlimited band does not include the games, but we held strong and told the kids no. The park was a lot of fun for ride loving kids. They rode everything multiple times!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briaj86
40,Summer awaits 🌞,"Pacific Park - Must visit if you have kids! Amazing rides, just next to the sea. Beautiful view and brilliant food options will make your day memorable!Must visit place in summers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sanaahyd
50,Kids paradise!!,"Took the kids to Pacific Park for a little evening fun after the beach and they loved it. So much to do! The wrist bands are a little expensive but just buy them!! Buying individual rides is expensive too, so just buy the wrist bands and then they can do them all!! All the kids screaming and laughing as the rides spin them around is just good medicine:) Plan to spend at least 2-3 hours here to catch all the rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarthaWK
40,Not sure the difference between pacific park and santa monica pier...,"We had our Lyft driver drop us off at the Pier after the US women won the semi final world cup soccer game. We were in good spirits. The kids wanted to ride the ferris wheel and roller coaster. It's a bit steep at $10 each, but they didn't want to ride more so we skipped the $35 unlimited ride bracelet. I decided to ride the ferris wheel with them. They were annoyed at me but it was nice to take some pics of them and the view of the beach was really neat to see. I skipped the coaster which they said was so boring. Their favorite thing to do was just past the pier and swing on the rings and climb the ropes and that cost me $0. We then leisurely walked back to Venice Beach which is 3 miles and a good hour if you walk it straight, but we stopped for drinks and snacks along the way so it didn't seem so long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carrie9678
30,It’s alright,"Visited the pier at night just to see what it’s all about, and it’s pretty. Very crowded. As for the park, I only went on the roller coaster which is $10 per person if you only want to do that. The coaster doesn’t go very fast and it’s literally a less than 2min ride. They do let you go around twice at least. Cool for a one time experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lakeishamason
40,Fun afternoon,"As Santa Monica locals we were looking for something fun to take a visiting child to. The pier, although quite crowded was the perfect two hour event. The lines for the rides weren’t long. An average sized six year old was big enough to ride all of them. This is by no means a replacement for Disneyland, Universal Studios or a Magic Mountain, but remains a fun and less expensive local alternative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cabana4Us
30,Small pier park surrounded by beautiful ocean,Well we were going to a number of other parks in California primarily to ride roller coasters... we saw that Pacific Park had a roller coaster. We decided to stop by. There were a few parking lots that were about $2/half hour. Once you get to the park...there’s about a dozen rides in all. You can get an “all you can ride” wristband for about $35. We decided to just get a single ride on the roller coaster for $10. The roller coaster West Coaster is nothing special. Although most of the rides here seem to be based on kids there were plenty of food choices and the Santa Monica pier is very historic and beautiful as well as the surrounding ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twhiffen
30,Pacific park,"Was not as good as expected, rides were not very interesting and cost a lot. The Ferris wheel was nice, but it was really cold out by the time we were able to ride it. Overall, the trip was worth it, but I wouldn’t go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VBG876
50,Old school,"Not sure it’s the best value attraction out there, but you on rides and the top of a big wheel watching the sun come down onto the beach. You’d be very hard pressed not to smile!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClanClark
10,"Sorry it only gets one star, but the few rides they have are so expensive......","The Pacific Park Roller Coaster is really short and costs $10.00 to ride it once! The Wrist Band is on sale right now for $31.45, but there's only 12 rides in the whole place, some of those are for small children, and there's NO dark ride at all...Honestly, just go to Knott's Berry Farm if you want a HUGELY better Value... It's as low as $49 for an adult to get into Knott's!! That's $17.55 more for three amazing rides with Animatronics, a very nice Ghost Town with authentic buildings from an actual Ghost Town, several of the best roller coasters anywhere, and more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffN898
50,We love it!,"Dear friends,The park has much more than just rides, there are lots of places to eat and if you go all the way to the end you can sit down by the stairs and watch the see lions in the water.We always love to watch them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petraalmutawa
10,Discriminated for being a solo visiter,"This rating is for the Pacific Wheel specifically & the customer experience I received. They do not allow single people to ride the wheel & although I said I was happy to share, they said it was my responsibility to find people to share with. I expressed that I didn’t-feel comfortable approaching random strangers to ask this & didn’t receive a response. Really disappointing (& embarrassing) especially as the time I visited was quiet & the wheel was running half full.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thisislyndsey
40,GTA V Dell Perro Experience!,"Well, the place is very crowded and the rides are just okay. We were happy to do the rollercoaster ride as we do that all the time virtually in GTA V !!The place could get smelly as there are people who love fishing on the pier! The park rides are for kids mostly. Food and tickets are priced on the higher side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akhilpwalia
40,"We rode the Pacific Wheel, which was very nice",While I think this park was a little pricey it was fun. For this reason we just rode the Ferris Wheel here which was nice because you get amazing views of the surrounding area. My kids and I really enjoyed it and would recommend to others.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesselodge
50,Fun place,The place is small but full of rides and games. We just did the rollercoaster and the wheel and both were super fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcisinthehouse
40,Fun day for kids,"we did spend about 4 hours on the pier with our kids riding rides. It was a lot of fun, but my recommendation is to be there at 11. It gets much more crowded as the day went on. When we first got there, we didn't even have to exit the rides. We could just go multiple times because no one was waiting. By 3:30, there were lines at all the rides. The rides are expensive and very short so I would encourage you to get an unlimited wrist band. The ferris wheel is $10 for 5 cycles so if you are riding multiple rides, the wrist band is well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brooke014
50,Theme Park on the Pier,Yes it is small and touristy but how many other times are you going to get to ride a rollercoaster and look out at the Pacific Ocean! The coaster goes around twice. I was a bit upset that I did not get to ride the ferris wheel as they do not allow solo riders. Have fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Americanflygirl

40,Great little amusement park on the historic pier!,"This compact little amusement park on the pier has a lot of solid rides that for the price of a wristband makes it worth the price of admission. Great solar-powered Ferris wheel overlooking the pacific, and a surprisingly thrilling roller-coaster along with an assortment of other rides and amusement games make this a classic. Definitely stop in here if you are anywhere in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddone1
40,Kids Had Fun!,"Our kids (ages 15, 13, 11, and 9) had a blast! Short lines, great rides. The all-you-can-ride wristbands were worth it. And parking was nearby and relatively inexpensive. Drawbacks: Wintry breeze from the ocean made it very chilly even during the noon hour. Also, a few homeless people mingled through the park, but were basically harmless and treated with respect. Overall rating: Would go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcandn
50,Family Friendly Fun!,"I had seen and read so much online about Pacific Park that I couldn't wait to visit!

Must go there,"If you are planning a trip to Los Angeles, Pacific Park is a must.You can take an electric scooter (Bird, Uber scooters, etc) and have a ride by the seaside of Santa Monica, ending your tour at the entrance of the Pier.You will find tons of restaurantes, souvenirs store, artist, and some delicious japanesse hot dogs that I'd recommend.Almost at the end of the Pier, you will see the classical hoarding of the Pacific Park. If you grew up in the 90's, you will remember the mythical TV serie Rocket Power, whose episodes happened in Pacific City (here).The park is colorful and people from all the ages will have lots of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidatraveller

30,Great vibes but extortionate prices,"We had fun here and loved walking around the pier in the day and night, however, the prices for the rides are EXTORTIONATE!The roller coaster is only tiny and they charge $10 for 1 ride per person along with the wheel. Even the scrambler ride was £8. The wrist bands are $35. I found this too expensive for what the rides are. We did do a couple of them just to say we had done it. It was great fun but takes a big chunk out of your pocket!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simontR2320TT
50,Family day at Pier,"Great time for 6 and up. We attended on a Friday so ride lines were minimal and kids could ride and jump in the next or following turn.

50,Very Popular Place to Visit,"Plenty of vendors with variety of things to purchase including food, rides, and arcade. Many people come and go while you on walking on the boardwalk. Some restaurants on the Pier with great views of the beach while you eat.Parking is available if you don't mind walking a couple of blocks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nichfam
30,Pricey amusement park on the pier,"This is an amusement park on the pier at Santa Monica. It is pretty much a tourist trap. The wristbands for unlimited rides cost $30 and there are only about ten rides. There are also mid-way games that are an additional cost.That said, you can buy ride tickets separately and the Ferris Wheel is definitely worth the time to ride. You can see all the way to Malibu from the top, very nice view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericw824
40,Best view from the ferris wheel,It was lots of fun being at the park. Very expensive though! You pay per ride. We bought 7 rides for $70. You can buy a bracelet for unlimited rides but we only stayed for an hour. It was really cool to see the sun set.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcietrainor
40,Important part of the pier,"Whilst not into the rides, glad that Pacific Park exists - it helps make the pier into the iconic landmark that we enjoy and are there to experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harrison-F-Carter
40,A pleasant diversion,"Disneyland or Six Flags this is not, although that's not necessarily a bad thing. There isn't enough to do for an entire day but the rides at Pacific Park are reason enough to spend another hour or two in Santa Monica. Most of the rides are small and geared towards the smaller members of the family, but there are some adult rides as well- who can resist a Ferris wheel offering amazing aerial views of the area, or a Tilt-A-Whirl with shark-themed cars? The park's flagship attraction, the West Coaster, is a decent-sized roller coaster that's tame enough for the little ones while offering a few thrills for adults. Paying for individual rides isn't cheap, so you best take a walk around to see if there's enough to warrant the purchase of a pay-one-price plan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamPidge
30,Average carnival,"Kind of cool that it's on the pier but rides and games are nothing special. In fact they are kind of expensive too. But it certainly adds to the fun atmosphere on the Pier,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skiang
50,A fun park on the pier,"This is a small amusement park on the Santa Monica Pier. It has a ferris wheel and other rides. It isn't Disneyland, but it is still lots of old fashioned fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/494samuelm
50,Super Fun Time for the Entire Family,"For the price, this place was off the charts. Never waited more than 15 minutes for a ride. We went on the rides several times and always had a smile. My son is 10 and experienced a roller coaster for the first time, he loved it. The views are breathtaking. The food was a bit pricey, but its a tourist destination so I expected that. There were lots of stores to buy nik nacks in. The beginning of our day was the pier, the middle, the beach and then back to the pier. Super Fun Day!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heathernelson445
50,Fun for the WHOLE family!,"Want to truly enjoy the circus by the ocean? This is for you! Kids/adults ALL will have a blast! A ""Don't Miss"" if in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneG514
50,"Day trip to Santa Monica, Pacific Park Pier","This is such a fun place! I had my three teens with me, bought them wrist bands at I think a decent price, and we spent from 5:00-11:00 pm at the pier! The rides were very fun, and any lines they stood in went pretty fast. It was such a fun night! We stopped for dinner too, but of course the kids got Dippin Dots in the Pier too! It may have been a crowded summer night, but it didn’t make any difference. The whole place was pretty clean and well staffed- friendly kids st the ticket booth and running the rides... it felt completely safe and very family friendly. We will definitely do that again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristinkeith2018
50,Busy but nice experience,"Got the metro (45minutes) from central station to the pier it was great to see, but was quiet busy. You can get wristbands for most of the rides but we where just interested in the rollercoaster 😁 $10 pp they let us ride the coater twice as it was over quick enough, so delighted about that! Great area and ambiance about the place unfortunately was just to busy for my likings!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ceallachain
40,Can’t Go Wrong with a Day at the Beach,"Although the rides are far from the “thrill” variety you’d find at Magic Mountain (or even Disneyland or Knotts Berry Farm), for about the price of one adult Disneyland admission ticket, a whole family of 4 can have unlimited-ride wristbands, which includes most of the attractions, including their legendary and iconic Ferris Wheel.There are also your standard hard-to-win carnival games at which you can blow through $40 in 10 minutes with nothing to show for it except frustrated kids & parents, and MAYBE a small stuffed emoji face. Although there is at least ONE exception (at least as of when we visited) that even a small kid can win something at: the game in which you toss bean bags at balloons. There are pins behind the balloons so as long as the bean bag can make it into one of the squares and mildly tap an inflated balloon, it will likely pop, allowing the tosser to claim at least a small victory & reclaim a slice of self-esteem after previously tossing 50 tiny rings (& probably $25) in a frustratingly futile attempt to get at least ONE ring to land over the top of at least ONE of the bottles.And like other amusement parks, there’s an assortment of overpriced junk food, although nicer (albeit mostly more expensive) eateries are on the pier nearby.Especially combined with the usual wonderfully pleasant weather and overall joyousness of being next to the Pacific Ocean, it’s hard to go wrong as a local or a tourist spending the day at the pier (and when you’re done at Pacific Park, go check out the Heal the Bay Aquarium under the carrousel).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SpencerP0721
50,Great experience and fun times for all!,"Were there on a Thursday afternoon and evening. Two teenagers more than got their monies worth on wristband. Not crowded at all, everyone having fun, staff very helpful. Was much cleaner than we expected. Overall very good time and would return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillC_ATX
40,Nice Place to Hang out at Night or on a Sunny Day,"The Santa Monica Pier is an iconic spot for good reason, there's good food, great spots to take pictures, typical fair-style rides and other cool places like Venice Beach or downtown Santa Monica spots nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aneil4lom
40,Lots of fun in the sun... or under the stars!,"If you're in Santa Monica with a bunch of friends, then Pacific Park is a great place to while away a few hours.There's a ferris wheel, roller coasters, games arcades and more!Lots to do to keep you occupied.Good photo opportunities too. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mmoo73
50,Simply an experience!,During my weekend visit to see my girlfriend I planned one night to end here at Pacific Park. Everything worked out perfectly. If you want to make a date night out of your visit I highly recommend trying to time a ride on the ferris wheel with the sunset. The lights turned on just before we got on and it was definitely a magical experience that somehow worked out perfectly.Many people mention the high prices but honestly I think it is more of a quick visit than a full day experience. I had planned out our time before to be on the beach and then we ended here with the ferris wheel and the dragon ride. It wasn't too expensive for the memories that were made with the two of us.It definitely now holds a special place in my heart!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VegasZach
40,Great views from pacific wheel,"We stopped on a visit to the Santa Monica pier to ride the Pacific Wheel Ferris wheel. Though the price of $10 per rider is a little steep, considering it was for a single ride, the views from the top are excellent. One can see up the coast to Malibu in one direction, along the beautiful beach, and out into the Pacific Ocean. The attendants let everyone ride the Ferris wheel for about 10 or 12 rotations, making the price seem more reasonable. We visited early in the morning, so we barely had to wait in line, which was wonderful. The Pacific Wheel was a good addition to our trip to Santa Monica pier. As for the rest of Pacific park, I can't really say much, as we only rode the Ferris wheel, but it seems to be a fun little amusement park by the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler2901
30,Fun but Pricey for what it has to offer,"Pacific Park is a little pricey for what it has to offer. It's fun, but the attractions seem old and outdated. It was about $30 for an unlimited day pass but $3-$10 per ride which is absolutely insane if you were going to pay per ride. The places to line up were sorta confusing but the lines were pretty short and overall a fun experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uniashkie
50,Fun fun fun,Unique amusement park in great atmosphere. The rides are expensive if only riding one or two rides. The multi ride tickets are the best value.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/285debc

50,Fun area to come in Santa Monica,"I like the Pacific Park in Santa Monica. There are so many things to see and do while at the park. Park is on the coast of Santa Monica, so it's walking distance to the Santa Monica Pier or to the Third Street Promenade. Both have many places to eat and shop at, while the Pier has rides for every age. Great overall place to go while in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcorbin560
40,Very good but also very busy !,We came here on our way to LAX airport. We had a late flight so decided to stop by here for the afternoon and relax. Parking was the first challenge and after finding a parking garage about 2 blocks away and parking on the 5th floor we made our way down the streets to the Pier. It was literally packed with people from edge to edge. We decided to go to Pacific Park and got a ticket (unlimited one - best value) for our two kids and the wife (I'm not one for things spinning round and round). They managed to go on most rides (even our 2 year old) - which was more than he could go at Universal and Disneyland. We did the big wheel (with a weird photograph for a shark attack at the bottom). Overall we enjoyed ourselves and spent a good 2 hours here...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HypnoWarrior
40,"Good rides, like the individual ride feature","Enjoy some good rides, without having to stand in extremely long lines. The other games are fun as well. Good way to spend the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rohanc708
50,Nana and Grandson Adventure Day,"Today was the second time my 6-year old grandson and I spent about 4 hours at Pacific Park in Santa Monica.We get the wristband (AAA gives you a 10% discount) and go on ride after ride after ride. We also do some of the games although most of the time we don't win anything. But, it's just so beautiful to be on the pier looking out at the Pacific Ocean on a nice Southern California day. Get there early for easy parking and no lines. The park opens at 11:00 so we get there around 10:30 am and everything is easy. Find your inner-kid and have FUN!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandyS40
40,Park still open at midnight!,There were still people on the rides at midnight. The arcade was super busy too. The food booths were still selling food but the shops were closed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boymomdfw
50,Reminded me of Coney Island,What a great location for a long time carnival-type atmosphere! Out on the vibrant Santa Monica Pier this attraction catches your eye immediately. The Ferris wheel is not the biggest but fits right in here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DjDan48
40,Fun way to lose a few hours....,"Located on the Santa Monica Pier, this small amusement park has about a dozen rides and several midway games. The main attraction is the Ferris wheel... it gives you an incredible view of the Pacific.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lwj

40,Park right off boardwalk $3. Per hour,"Same reviews at Sonya Monica Pier. Fun and very clean place to visit and enjoy the rides, carnival type games, the scenery and people. Spend a few hours and as we did, eat at Buba Gumps or Mariasol Mexican. The area is always crowded, but as we found people are more polite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MMandSM
40,Lively and fun for families,It has an old fashioned atmosphere about it. If I were English I'd say it feels like walking around Blackpool holiday area except with warmer weather (even in April) and a better view. The park has a lively atmosphere and was reasonably busy when we visited it in April when it was still quite cool weather-wise. The rides aren't cheap but the view around the park is beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
40,Noisy and lively,"A small amusement park and games arcade along with some dining opportunities located on top of a pier, Pacific Park is a lively, noisy spot to enjoy a carefree atmosphere. The arcade deserves some extra points for having some all time classics from the 1980's as still functioning games among its selection.If rides and such aren't your thing, you can still check out the ocean view or just peoplewatch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDSor
50,Enjoy the Rides,"You can just walk around the park, go on specific rides or get a pass to go in every ride.I would say to just walk around, take some nice pictures, easy something and choose the best ride for you.I recommend the Ferris Wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelcT6463ZR
40,So many fun things to do!,"We had the LA Go Card so we got unlimited rides which was nice. Some lines seemed to move quicker than others, but that's typical for any kind of amusement park. It was a beautiful location, especially when you are at the top of the Ferris wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reacah
50,Saturday Pier visit with daughter & 3 Grand kids,"Got there at 10:00 before park rides opened at 11:00, walked around people watching, ate lunch at Bubba Gump, rode the roller coaster, Ferris Wheel, played arcade and had miniature face sculptures done on way out - fun but rather expensive adventure",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amynjim
30,Fun for all . . at a price,"The roller coaster is fun but not very long or high. Some of the other attractions are strictly for the kiddies. The rides are not cheap . . somewhere between $5 and $8. The arcade games can be enjoyable . . as long as you understand that even if you ""win"", you are getting a cheap stuffed animal for a higher investment. All in all, worth checking out . . for an hour or less . . and then on to the bicycle path and the other sights in the People's Republic of Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincemc

50,Great time,"It was fun which we all enjoyed. Plenty of rides, plenty to eat, plenty of things to do. If you don't want to do anything just people watch, this place is amazing. We came here in the afternoon and stayed to see the sunset which was phenomenal.The Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier is wonderful x",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad5522
40,Great place to spend the day with family,Had a blast walking the pier and boardwalk. Visited the slack park and ate Buzz Pop Cocktails on the beach. Weather was perfect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joseph_Isaacs
40,The Unlimited Ride Wristband is the way to go,"Twelve rides are included in the unlimited ride wristband and I think it is a rip-off if you don't have it, unless you only plan to ride the Ferris wheel. If you plan to spend a few hours at the pier, the wristband is definitely the way to go. Check out the Pacific Park website and Groupon to find deals. While it is no Tivoli Gardens, if you visit Santa Monica (especially with kids), it's one of the things you must do. Then, go get a corn dog at Hot Dog on a Stick (the original), ride the carousel (a few dollars extra), eat ice cream at the old fashion soda jerk housed in the same building of the carousel, and visit the teeny tiny aquarium under the pier too (it's underwhelming, but can round out a day for young kids). With a walk and meal along Palisades Park and 3rd St Promenade, you have a full day worth of true Santa Monica activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattisr2018
50,Nice park on pier,"This park is a amusement park on santa monica pier. You can try all of the rides and you can order hamburger , pizza and tacobell",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/upontheair1

50,Awesome place any day! Cool rides with a lot of people watching! Great location for rides! Night time light show!,"We always cruise threw this cool park located on the Santa Monica pier! They have a cool light show every night. There are many places to fish at the end of the pier. All the rides are Oldschool and cool. They even have a carousel. The park is centered at amusing kids, but us adults can have a great time too. You can see just about anything if you just stop and look. Love the diverse atmosphere and beach boardwalks! Anything on wheels goes on the boardwalk! This is a big tourist attraction by far. During the week would be the best time to go. Thank you to all the employees of the park that keep things running smoothly!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yehbut
50,Fun,"Nice, fun, entertaining and very nice for and evening activities. It is really nice for all the family members and their is a lot of activities to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurarQ6580LC
40,Old school,Santa Monica pier is one of the last surviving entertainment piers in Southern California. It is definitely old school and that's a good thing. You can still play games and eat cotton candy and snow cones. You can still go in an arcade and shoot baskets and play bumper pool. You can still ride a ferris wheel and roller coaster as well as bumper cars. No high end restaurants but that's a good thing. Big crowds in the summer. Nice views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morrisk446
30,Tiny Park for Kids on the Santa Monica Pier!,"I have been to Pacific Park several times. It's a cute amusement park that features 12 rides mostly aimed for kids and families; very few of them are thrilling. That's okay because 1) it's a tiny park that occupies a very small piece of pier real estate and 2) it's a legendary piece of Americana that is a must-visit for anyone while in Los Angeles!The park has two iconic attractions that HAVE to be ridden if you find yourself visiting for the first time: the Pacific Wheel and the West Coaster. Both of these attractions have been featured in countless movies and TV shows and are the main draws for the park itself. Both are small and mellow enough that all ages can ride them, provided riders meet the 42 inch height requirement to ride (under 42 inches with parent for the Pacific Wheel). Parking for Pacific Park is very hard to find on busy days, as the Santa Monica Pier parking lots fill up fast and the streets are very difficult to find parking along. Many of the oceanfront hotels have underground parking, but you will pay dearly for that privilege: I've paid $25+ to use their garages. Rides are pay-as-you-go, and you either buy tickets for each attraction (which cost between $5-$10 per ride), or you can buy an wristband for around $33 at the park (or several dollars less online). If you're planning on riding both the Pacific Wheel and the West Coaster, I recommend buying the wristband, as riding both attractions twice saves you money vs paying for tickets. Numerous options for food are available, both at Pacific Park as well as all along the Santa Monica Pier.The park looks absolutely magical after dark, with the bright lights, music, exciting carnival atmosphere and the crashing of the waves on Santa Monica Beach creating that classic nighttime fair environment reminiscent of traditional seaside amusement parks of yesteryear.If you're at the Santa Monica Pier, take it upon yourself to walk through the tiny but charming Pacific Park. Buy a wristband for everyone in your party and go take a few spins on the Pacific Wheel and the West Coaster (which allows guests to ride twice in a row on one ticket). It is a lovely and truly memorable location, and an evening (or afternoon) spent there will be remembered for a lifetime! Also perfect for date nights!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakeg485
50,Great visit to an Iconic place,Must see spot in California. fun rides classic arcade games. great atmosphere. Celebrity spotting. Saw Juliette Lewis when I was here. Really enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_In_Ulster
40,Just chose Ferris wheel and roller coaster,We were pleased to make it to Santa Monica to see the iconic Ferris wheel and have a ride -it was great! We also just chose the roller coaster as you can chose individual rides. The staff were kind and because it was quiet let us go on the roller coaster twice! It’s part of the fun of being here in Santa Monica. After the hustle and bustle of Disney and Universal this wee park was quaint.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CNWgtnNZ

40,Fun but expensive,"My boyfriend and I went on the ferris wheel on a saturday night. It was very crowded, but we did not have to wait too long.We enjoyed our ride and the view we had on the park, the waves and the beach from above. I am not giving five stars because I found it a little expensive even though I expected it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R41GAvanessab
30,A must visit location with some caution,"I really like the place and I have been coming 30 plus years. It is classic southern California and in the evening it is picture perfect. I also love the guys with parrots or iguanas on their head posing with tourists. The problem is the homeless are becoming very aggressive and are defecating and urinating in public even on the walkways. Many visitors are dropping their litter all over the beach - bottles, pizza boxes, food wrappers, not good. SM - you have to address this!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lawrenceburkef
40,Night-Time Fun with a Young Teenager!,"My 13 year old daughter begged me to take her here on a misty, cool afternoon during her winter school break. Because of the cooler weather, and because it was got dark early, it was not very crowded at all. The colorful lights, as well as the night-time beach and ocean views, combined to create a fun and memorable experience. It was worth getting unlimited ride bracelets for $32.95 as we went on all 12 of the rides, including the kiddie rides. We went on the Scrambler and Shark Frenzy (#5 spins the fastest!) several times. At first, the Ferris wheel was closed due to the weather, which was very disappointing, but they finally decided to open the ride, which made us very happy! The ride was smooth and the views were fantastic! The roller coaster was also very smooth and the ride operators looked like they were having a blast! My daughter's favorite ride was the Pacific Plunge. We paid an extra $8 for her to ride the Gyro Loop on her own, which was a perfect ride for her to control and flip around as much as she wanted. We ate dinner at Bubba Gump's, where we got seated right away. We didn't try any of the games or arcade, but they looked like fun. Most of the snack stands (churros, dippin' dots, funnel cakes) were closed for the day. In conclusion, my daughter had fun and I was pleasantly surprised that I could go on all the rides with her and have fun, too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/874almam
50,Friendly family fun!,"Our early morning winters walk sent us to the end of the pier! We saw two sea lions on the south side of the pier! A local fisherman advised us the low tide makes the break wall rocks look like some sort of animal. Just rocks between the northern 2nd and 3rd buoy markers! It is a pier, watch your ankles! The boardwalk is bumpy for strollers, wheelchairs, and wheeled items. Love the ambience! End of the Road for Route 66!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlyingMommy2013
30,Great fun but can be expensive,"Novelty type of visit really... Based on the token system. Best of checking it out online realisticly.

50,Iconic Location with Family Friendly Nightlife,"As I was in California for the first time over the weekend, I decided that I had to see this iconic spot. I was not disappointed. While parking was expensive, the local musicians, atmosphere, and attractions on the pier made it worth the price. The wheel was lit up, and made for some great photos to post on my Instagram. Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. was busy, but the wait wasn't bad. Security was cracking down on photographers with tripods.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joncwyatt
50,Iconic Must See,If you are in Santa Monica you need to visit Pacific Park. They offer plenty of carnival style games that are easy to win prizes. The ferris wheel is a MUST just so you can see the landscape while on it. Tons of entertainment from dancers and singers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momof2lovestraveling
30,Dissapointing Fairground but worthy of a First-time Look & See,"The Park was not operating on the 2 occasions we came to the Pier, therefore it did appear to be very in-interesting without people and operating rides. From what I could see, this Park would entertain the younger kids, as opposed to 12-14 upwards.If only for its historic value, worth getting ""up close & personal"" with the famous Ferris Wheel of Santa Monica Pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristinaMCGM
30,Has seen better days,"Road the roller coaster as it was the only thing that seemed worth doing, is very old now and alot of it was shut when i visited, i really wouldn't reccomend it at you have to pay $8 for one ride that lasts all of 2 mins if that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KelvinR749
40,Great family fun,"A great place to have family fun on the Pier. Although I thought the prices were a bit expensive, there is an unlimited pass you can purchase which makes it more affordable if you plan to spend the whole day here. During the week not all attractions are open, but there is still heaps of fun to be had",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Livetotravel747
40,A Real Traditional Gem,The Park is a classic of old style rides and pier end fun.Kids will love it and enjoy the simple fun available.Yes it is a bit tired but that is also its charm.Worth a short explore and a ride or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YorkTraveller1962
40,Must do tourist attraction,"Firstly, the Santa Monica Pier is a must see for tourists. Lots of quirky shops, attractions, eats etc. Great experience for those visiting from overseas like ourselves who want to get a better feel for the area and the people. I have reviewed the actual Pier as a specific attraction if people want more details.Pacific Park is an old school theme park based at the end of the Pier. From a theme park perspective, it is okay, bit outdated and the prices are mildly high for what you get. You can either buy individual ride tickets or an unlimited pass.The reason for attending is that this is iconic of Santa Monica and once there, you lose yourself in the atmosphere. It has rides for all ages. The Ferris Wheel provides a great view of the coastline and great photo opportunity. My family had a great time, which I think related to the location/atmosphere more than the specific rides themselves.We probably only spent a few hours here, but that was certainly enough. Make it part of your trip if coming to the Pier or staying nearby. I probably wouldn't bother travelling all the away from LA to Santa Monica just for this though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenFC
30,"Vintage, nostaligic fun.","The rides are dated and old, but that's the point of Pacific Park. It's a throwback to the old-fashioned days on the pier. Besides, there is no room for a record-breaking roller coaster.But, it did have everything you could expect from a carnival-like atmosphere: games, old rides, performers.Parking is not free., and there is no smoking allowed on the pier (as it is all wood, duh).It's worth checking out once :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmhuett
40,Santa Monica Pier,Free to walk along pier. Fantastic watching sun set over the ocean. Expensive rides- but bought group tickets and the children ran around trying the rides that were open (some closed in the afternoon). But the children had a great time. All children were less then 10. Asked the kids- they had a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewjpatten

50,Great for adults and kids,Beautiful pier and rides for the kids and a nice walk on an iconic site with great oceans views for adults. The lights are beautiful at night. A great day out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z1378YBmarkd
30,Just Okay,"Overpriced rides but it's a must do if you are in Santa Monica. After all, how many amusement parks are on a pier like that...!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bossy075
50,Pacific Park,Pacific Park is sea side and beach. is very nice and have a lot of beach activity .we went their and the weather a bit cold though you can find many people there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aymanninja
30,mini leisure park on Santa Monica Pier,"It's good for children and an interesting location, on the Pier of Santa Monica. The entrance is free, you pay for each and every ride separately.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/609maximilianh
40,something for everyone,"did not know it was called pacific park, I always called it the Santa Monica pier. plenty to do and see. Go see what the fisherman are catching at the end. Maybe go for trapeze lessons! Get a bite to eat. watch the perfect sunset! Its free! except for the attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Misonix
50,Loved it!,"Myself and my husband are scared of high roller coasters. But this place just blew us off the fear of rides. If you are like us (scared of roller caosters and other breath taking rides), then this is the place for you to start.We went onto all the rides and thoroughly enjoyed each and every ride.The board walk was awesome especially during the evenings!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anambitioustraveler
40,It's... good.,"It's really fun and everything there is cool and stuff, it's just going more than once is a stretch. I might just be saying this because I live in Santa Monica, but the rides get SUPER old. The rollercoaster is small, the dragon is- well, the dragon is just the dragon, and the ferris wheel is- a ferris wheel. The scrambler is the best ride there in my opinion. The first time is the best time. Trust me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/battlewing101
30,Touristy and expensive but worth walking through at night.,Pacific Park is very touristy but is worth walking through in the evening after dinner. The rides and food are very expensive. The rides are standard carnival style rides - the look safe enough but are really more for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G2866ZUjustinh
30,Overpriced,The amusement has indeed a great location and you really pay for that. The rides are average and very expensive to the point that Disneyland is cheap compared ! Also food and drinks around has steep prices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabercas
50,Simply beautiful,"Pacific Park is a beautiful place that you must visit if staying in Santa Monica. With lots of options for fun and eating and drinking nearby, this place really worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PezFish
40,Touristy Place,"I've been several times to this place, love the rides, of course its no Disney or universal but is fun and great for a good time. Depending on the season, it can be very crowded on summer months. You can pay per ride or get the unlimited band. Teens love this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellistics
40,Okay,Very similar to coney Island in Brooklyn NY. It has amusement rides and things like shooting water into a clowns face to bust the balloon first and win a prize....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TREK39
40,"Fun in the sun, especially for the younger kids","Pacific park was fun, but would be better suited for younger kids (say 10 yo or less). My 14 yo teens were only interested in three rides, the West Coaster, Pacific (Ferris) Wheel and the Sea Dragon. There are the usual carnival games, popcorn/candy carts, etc. It's not an all day park, maybe only a couple hours if that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chucks-World
50,Just like in the movies,"As soon as you get there you recall ALL the movies you Saw that there was a place, a pier, with a Ferris Wheel. Not a chance you miss It. Very beautiful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felipearrudabd
30,Interesting place to visit at night,We did not go on any ride but did the whole walk around the park. There were lot of interesting stuff to see (street performers) and souvenir to purchase if you're into collecting magnets.Remember to bring a light jacket at night because it could be windy during night time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F8953UNtimc
30,Iconic Location,"I don't have a huge amount to say about Pacific Park. It's certainly an iconic location and an impressive set up to have on a pier.I went on the roller coaster which was decent if a little tame. I had hoped to go on the ferris wheel, but travelling alone was told it was three riders minimum per carriage and that I should go and find some people if I wanted to use the ride.A fantastic experience for families I'm sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanP82
40,Fun Rides for the Kids,Kind of pricey to ride very many rides you may as well get the wristband and pay one time so we limited our kids to just 2 rides. They really enjoyed this little amusement park after being in the Disney world for two days.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyHumbleOpinion
50,A Fun Place,A fun place for families its free entry and you can pay as you go or else buy a wrist band which gets you on all the rides. Enjoyed a walk along the beach and around the pier. Kids will enjoy a day here..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347jackie
50,Great fun,"Pacific Park on Santa Monica Pier is an iconic location. The park is dominated by the Ferris Wheel which is Solar Powered. We could not resist and bought tickets for a ride on the wheel. Although I am by no means scared of heights, the sensation was a little scary as the gondolas swing from side to side and there is a sensation that you are going to get up ended and tossed out of your seats.Whilst the wheel is in motion you get a really good view of the beach and Santa Monica from the top.This is an expensive experience as two rides cost $17.00 / or £6.70 per person. The ride does last a good while and provided the price is not prohibitive represents a good fun value for money time.We had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinG476
50,Fun for all the family,"A fun place for families. Entry is free and you can either pay for each ride you go on or buy a wristband that gets you on them all. This is a great system if you're like me and not into all the big thrill rides. I highly recommend the ferris wheel, as it gives you great views from the the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenBezzo
40,Santa Monica Pier,"Games for the kids, nice views for adults, stores (too many ppl tho) for food and shopping. Enjoy the sun and the active California beach style.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jorgesT4959VW
50,So Much Fun,"My son and I came here while visiting the LA area from Florida and had so much fun. This place has all the classic fun fair you would expect at a Beach Pier. Great rides, great views and fun games. They even have a really cool Arcade which my son loved. The roller coaster is also awesome. We rode it almost 10 times!! Highly recommend coming here. It's great for kids and adults of any age. Just a fun place to have a good time right on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tedlong29
40,Stroll the beach,We enjoyed a walk on the beach & around the pier. Lots to see. Places to eat dinner or just watch the sunset. We happened upon a free live concert.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammynicola
40,Fun rides for kids,"My family (wife with two kids aged 10 and 12) visited here in July 2017.We arrived early (for biking down to beach to Venice) so we were able to get a parking spot right at the Pier parking lot.We bought the passes for the kids as it was definitely cheaper than buying per ride. We spend about two hours letting them go on rides. They had a great time.Had to look to find any shade from the hot afternoon sun.Not a major theme park, but fun nonetheless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dms666
40,"""Central Park"" version on a Pier","Unique experience with live (""volunteer"") performers. One girl set up a camera to record herself singing on the pier, while others just smiled and played, some were selling their CD's. It's the combination of ice cream, carnival food, and simple rides that resemble Central Park, but instead on pier.Route 66 ended here in a movie (though the real end to route 66 is downtown).We parked in the huge parking lot just north of the pier for a flat rate of $12. There were many parking spots (we were there about noontime on a Monday). All the parking spots seemed a little close together, so don't be surprised if someone parks really close to you.Just a ferris wheel ride is $8, but it's not the ferris wheel line was long, it was the actual place where you have to buy ride tickets. Yet, different to experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/718gregoryj
50,best thing to do in a few hours,"The park is small but we had all the fun it had such as the West Coaster, Ferris Wheel, and etc also the restaurants around the park were great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyndona511
50,great!,we enjoyed a lovely afternoon at pacific park. The old carousel is a true treasure of the park and our teenagers couldn't wait to hop on for a ride. at $1 it was a bargain! the atmosphere is great and the pier itself is lovely to stroll along. Really enjoyed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/75ks
50,Fun Place to see!,This Park is very nice! Great views of the beach and ocean! It is very busy especially on weekends but it was fun to explore! Hopefully next time we are there we will get a chance to enjoy the rides!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indians95
30,Nice enough for a couple of hours,"Nice friendly staff, very low tech rides (nothing wrong with that). We had this as part of a Go Card and whilst it's probably better for small children for us it was a distraction for a couple of hours and rack rate wouldn't have been worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephanies15
30,Good place for kids,"This park is suitable only for kids. It has a few children entertainment games, where the kids can have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntoNic7
40,For the kids but the carousel is for the adults,"We are used to Boardwalk Rides. The kids enjoyed the coaster, scrambler, shark frenzy. If I was here as an adult, I would skip it.As adults, we were happy to see the Merry Go Round/Carousel. It was seen in Dirty Harry and each horse is hand carved and worth $2 million a piece.It is housed in the orange building and says Merry Go Round.Again, we went for the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connief517
50,Fun time,"What a great place to have fun and enjoy your beloveds. I do recommend stop by specially with kids. You will love it. It is good for children or adults, great place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanessacarolinah
30,Quirky. Fun in the sun,We visited in the evening & was surprised how busy the area was. You can either pay for each individual ride but obviously works out cheaper paying for a full pass which means you can go on all the rides.I recommend you get there early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashbobs1211
40,Very cool,"We made sure to check out the Pacific Park on the Santa Monica Pier while we were checking out Santa Monica. We went on the Ferris wheel which is pretty cool, the views at night are great. A bit expensive but that is expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/150jacobm
40,Very interesting and fun piece of Americana that's a must experience,"Tips for visiting the Pier and Pacific Park: Arrive before noon; park in the garages near the Promenade and walk to the ramp for the pier (cheaper and easier to get in and out); make your dining reservation before leaving the hotel or else you’ll stand in line for hours; buy wrist bands for the rides instead of single tickets because the lines are often short and you can repeat ride quickly as the actual ride time is rather short, once you get past the peak visit hours. There is one ride that is priced separately. Show your disdain by not riding it. And yes, the g force of the rides is tame compared to thrill ride parks, but hey, you're on a pier over the ocean and there's only 1 Santa Monica Pier, so enjoy anyway. There are tons of street performers – with a variety of talent levels, so pause a moment as you walk by. The end of the pier has 2 levels for fishing and the rail has bait cutting boards built in every 10 feet or so. The saddest part of the Pier experience is all the trash on the ground and in the water. No one seems to be willing to carry their trash to the receptacle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/down2xroads
50,No lines,Beautiful older amusement park. It gets busy on weekends but during the week there is usually no wait lines for rides which is amazing with kids. Get the unlimited bracelet since the individual ride passes are complicated and not good value.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barclay1974
20,Save your money for other things,Rides are geared to little kids. The roller coaster is the slowest my teens have ever been on. I wouldn't purchase the wristband. Maybe just go on the Ferris wheel for pictures and the view. Belmont Park in San Diego is much better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karleys2013
40,Fun rides,"Grandkids totally enjoyed all the rides. Bought them unlimited wristbands and the kids went at least a couple of times on a few of the rides. Were more into the rides than the beach. Tons of people, plenty of places to eat and great to see the ocean when you come from the desert. Went on a Wednesday about 1pm and found parking easily at the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelinglina
40,"Fun, and more Fun!","When in Santa Monica, if you have time for a little fun, this is the place to be. Its great for the entire family. There is lots to do for everyone. And while you are here, take a photo next to one of the lifeguard stations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/estanleym
50,Visit at Night!,We went to the Pier a few times during our visit. Our favorite time was after dinner as the sun was setting. It was just beautiful and there was music & the rides were all lit up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicatT3897KX
50,Fun with the kids,"This is a small, local amusement park on the Santa Monica Pier. It has a small roller coaster that is great fun and not too scary for the little ones. There are games, food and a toddler section with rides for 3-5 year olds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenn565
40,Only Rode The Ferris Wheel,"During out last visit to LA in August we did not do the Ferris Wheel and regretted it, so this time in late May, it was on our list to do! There was no line or crowd on the Tuesday we went in late May. We got our own cart to sit in which was good because of all the Instagram photos I was forced to take! Meanwhile, in between pictures, there was plenty of time to enjoy the awesome views. They stop you at the top at least 2-3 times so you can take in the ocean and beaches. I am sort of chicken when it comes to heights, but the carts you sit in are big and stable. I never felt any fear of heights. I was tempted to go a second ride, but we had many other sights to see. This was the only ride we did in the park. Easy enough to just buy a ticket to the Ferris Wheel if that's what you want to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donna224488
40,Great place to people watch and have a good time.,We didn't ride any of the rides. We just hung out and walked along the pier. There were a lot of interesting people and small vendors. You could also fish off the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/237JenniferS237
40,Amusement park at pier,"Amusement park at Santa Monica pier in LA. Good, but pricey fun. Single ride 5,50/8,50, adult pass 32,50$ (if i remember right). Our parking was 12$.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmikko
30,Not cheap. But fun,"The prices are really high for so few ride options, but it's a must for the pier and they know that. The employees are typical young kids who clearly hate their job, just like any other park like this.BUT the coaster is more fun than you would think and the Ferris-wheel is absolutely wonderful!We went during the week so there were no lines and we were able to move around easily. That would be difficult on a weekend.The Ferris wheel is a can't miss. The rest? Give or take.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thechelle218
40,Fun Night on the Pier,"Not big on rides and they are smaller in scope anyway. The fun is in the arcade and carnival booths, walking over the ocean on a warm evening and chilling. Outside, there is a real iced custard shop that is fab. This is an old time California experience. Good for the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hencat
40,a must go to beach,a beautiful beach with shops at the pier and restrooms. the beach is clean and parking fee is reasonable. you have to love it because the beach is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/494mcc

40,Classic California,"This is one of those places you have to say you've been. What else is there to be said...it's a fairground, on a pier, on Santa Monica Beach, at the end of Route 66. Yep, go, have fun and tick that box! Good fun, good eats...GREAT sunsets!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LolaandBess
30,A nice park,A good park on the Santa Monica Pier for children to enjoy their time. It does not have rides for toddlers as such.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mansi_Vij
40,Great place to visit,Lots of people so be warned it gets very busy on weekends.Not a huge amount of rides but enough to keep the kids entertained for a couple of hours. Several places to eat or buy an expensive souvenir.Be sure to watch the sunset from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ROSCO_Perth
30,Pacific Park/Santa Monica Pier - same thing,See reviews for Santa Monica Pier because Pacific Park is what the ride area is called. So-so and not terribly impressive although the beach and area views are lovely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DL9022
50,Step back in time,Pacific Park is like the amusement parks of yesterday year. All the favourites rides with endless ocean views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bellsie17
30,"Lively visitors, good scene","The Santa Monica pier is lively and vibrant. The scenic views from the rides are inspiring. Rides are average at best, but as is typical for a small carnival. Pricing is pretty high for the return on the rides, but if you are a tourist, it really is an iconic stop that should be experienced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CK251
50,Fun,Lovely spot and the views from the Ferris wheel are amazing looking up towards Malibu and down to Venice Manhattan Beaches,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bronwen1122
50,So much fun!,"This is our second time visiting Pacific Park, and we have had so much fun both times! We bought ride passes that also included meal vouchers from Groupon. The food was good, and the tides were so much fun.The beach is easily accessible there at Pier of course, so we also spent time playing in the ocean. It was a great day, and even our teenagers had fun!❤❤❤",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1vy
30,Crowded on the weekends!,"It used to be a very sweet attraction prior to expansion. It's very crowded, noisy, not the greatest place to be during the day but nice to see the sunset from. I'm not into any rides the park offers but the giant Ferris Wheel. And that's where you should be to see the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAVict0ria
50,Pacific Park,"This is a famous place to visit. You see it on TV a lot. There are places to eat and rides to ride. Good place for the family or a group of people. Visit Bubba Gump's to eat, fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/true1172

40,Pacific Park belongs to Santa Monica Pier,"The Pacific Park is one of the center element of the Santa Monica Pier, so a must see if you ask me. It's not huge but if offers quite a lot of different rides, I can recommend the west coaster and the pacific wheel, from which you get the most beautiful view over Santa Monica and the beaches. You pay for each ride separately, so there is no entry fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lolo-to-be
40,Can't Hate on Pacific Park,"Although it's nothing more than a rinky little carnival, it's such a cool, nostalgic place. Fun to visit, although I'm not sure it should be a major destination. However, linked with the pier and the beach and Venice, it makes for a fun day! Check this place out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eluper
50,Great coffee!,"Stopped in this coffee shop on the pier. It was just what I needed once the sun went down. The baristas were incredibly pleasant & helpful in making my decision.

10,Total disappointment,Aquarium is a joke. The pier and amusement park are a quick walk and not worth the expense. Waste of time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R9774AVmichellef
40,Fun for the Kids,"Pacific Park is a tiny ""amusement park"" at the end of Santa Monica Pier. It is obviously targeted to children since the rides are all child-friendly. The roller coaster is so tame that an adult could probably stand on the seat during the ride and not fall off!! The ferris wheel ride is a nice ride to take in the sights of the surrounding area. The cost of the rides are expensive (for single rides), but you can also buy an all-day ticket that is worthwhile.As is the case at all ""amusement parks"", the prices for food and merchandise are really high. But, if you're visiting the Santa Monica Pier anyway, Pacific Park is worth checking out...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SgtBuffy
30,This place got pricey,"The price per person per ride is outrageous. Unless you have the time to spend the day here and get the wristband, it is not worth the cost. The park is so crowded as well; you are better off driving south and going to a much less crowded quaint amusement park for a similar price! The rides are fun enough here for children, but not enough to entertain an adult for more than 30 minutes or so. Great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanaN1111
30,Tiny Amusement Park on Santa Monica Pier,"The only positive was the parking rate at $2/hr to a max of $10/day. The amusements are rather small and ultra expensive, especially if you want food. Don't see any need to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gla_Rangers

40,Fun Amusement Park on Santa Monica Pier!,"Pacific Park is a small amusement park located directly on the Santa Monica Pier. Admission is free, and you can purchase single-ride tickets or a wristband for unlimited ride access. If you love amusement park rides the unlimited access is quite reasonable. The main attractions are the solar-powered ferris wheel and the roller-coaster. There are also games-of-chance and tasty food treats available. You can't beat the experience when the rides are all lit up on a beautiful California evening. Fun for all ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKTBE

20,$50 to take my nephew on a couple really pretty cheesy rides?,"I wish I had better things to say about the park. The quality of the rides, the bang for your buck. It's such a beautiful location. I made the mistake of getting the unlimited passes which were expensive and after waiting 20 minutes for each ride, we'd had enough. My advice, buy individual tickets for the Ferris Wheel and enjoy the ride. At $8 a ticket for that, you may choose lunch instead!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unprocessed_cook
20,Strange and Grimy,"A good place to walk and peoplewatch, but I wouldn't touch anything. Grimy and early morning walks you will be surrounded by homeless people. One to miss - just stay on the promenade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/844pattis
30,Iconic but regular amusement park,"Special for this amusement park? The Ferris Wheel runs by solar power, that what it says in the history text. This amusement park is located in the middle of the pier and it is on the extended boardwalk. It looks just like any other amusement park you see elsewhere. The pier is generally so crowded, this place will give kids and parents a break from the walking pier. Come and enjoy the rides and eating burgers and ice cream.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrawetJ

30,Underwhelming and Over-Priced,"Not many rides to choose from here, mostly kiddie stuff. I know it's on a pier and there isn't much space, but something for adults would be nice. However, even if there was a good selection of adult rides, I still would not pay what they are charging to ride them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jsgirl44
50,Lovely Place,This was a lovely area with great views of the ocean and beach and access to the pier. The vendors had something for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royce1517
50,Family vacay,My kids always beg to go to Pacific Park whenever we are in LA. The kids love it. The Ferris wheel is a must with great views. Great rides which are all suitable for young kids (6 & 9). Kids always seem to win a stuffed toy from the games.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccarT8236KS
50,Ferris Wheel and Roller Coaster,"So glad we paid the money to ride these two. $48 for three of us, but happy we decided to do it! Lots of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobbiFair
30,A very crowded place,I found this amusement park to be at a wonderful location which makes it really accessable to larger masses. Therefore there is lot of public all year arround. Park itself is ok. They charge extra for some of the activities but you can choose your own thing or can also can buy a band that include most acitvities. But apart from crowd parking is super expensive and hard to find .So not my favourite place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rs243
40,Full of energy,"Always fun to walk the pier, lots to see, though some souvenir places a rip off re prices, especially the worst shop that charged $27 for a Christmas tree ornament. No wonder people were shaking there heads reading their prices, and walking out. Rusty's restaurant is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jan_S163
40,Fun Rides and fun games,"There are some carnival type rides, and lots of games to play. It is like going to an old time mountain fair. You can actually walk around and browse and pay nothing, but if you want to ride any rides or play any games, you have to purchase tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyl523

40,Free but crowded,"There is no admission to enter the park - it is free to walk right in. However, you do have to pay if you want to ride the rides. It was so crowded on the night we were there that we didn't want to stand in the lines for the rides. In fact, even the lines for funnel cakes were too long! But it's definitely pretty to be there at night when all of the lights are on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
30,Crowded amusement park,"There were lots of people in this amusement park. It's typical with rides, fast food and that carnival atmosphere.

40,Ferris Wheel,"We visited Pacific Park on a Friday night. Admission to the park was free. We went on the West Coaster ($8/person) and the Ferris Wheel ($8/person). You can purchase adult wristbands which give you unlimited rides for $30 ($18 for children under the age of 7). The line ups were really short and the waiting time was minimal.I highly recommend taking a ride on the Ferris Wheel - magnificent view of the ocean, beach, and city skyline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeep_girl_00
40,Lots of Fun for Kids,"We took our two kids (12 and 15) here and they had a blast. It's a fun day trip if you're in the area, and the views of the Pacific are gorgeous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KTD9
40,Funny moment,Very classic attraction in Santa Monica Pier. Buy the unlimited bracelet is recommended to access all the games. Kids have a great time and a visit to the park and the harbor is a must at evening specially on weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edmundo_osorio
40,IF YOU DON'T MIND CROWDS,"Fun touristy place to hang out for a couple of hours. Lots of fast food places and food trucks on the Pacific Coast Hightway. I'd say that anything you wanted from hot dogs, burgers, funnel cake, and drinks can be found there. This is the place to go with kids, the amusement park rides are tame but just right for the youngsters.The view from the pier is really great, even when it's cloudy. There are all kinds of performance artists and the ones I likes best were the head spinnning break dancers.The view of the beach and ocean is beautiful. If you can go there during the week, it's much less crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_DeMulle
30,Worth a look,"Pacific park is inside the Santa Monica pier. We had teenagers who weren't that fussed with the rides' but still enjoyed seeing it as they have seen it on so many tv shows. The ride to do singularly are quite expensive, so cheaper to get a ride pass. Not sure what of the prices though. Ferris wheel was good",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872gabrielleb
50,Go on the Ferris Wheel,"Whatever your age, a trip on the Ferris Wheel is a must. the views of the beach and the Pacific are fabulous from the top.And it isn't expensive",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/723sallys
30,Really touristy .... but still a nice way to pass some time in L.A.,Really touristy .... but still a nice way to pass some time in L.A. The rides and the fact that it is a carnival right next to Pacific Ocean is pretty cool and one of the best ways to pass a nice time in L.A. or Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/METRUN360
50,many attractions,The pacific park is very inside of the santa monica bay. There are many attractions you can join that you can feel child again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/191semiha
50,Made me feel like a kid again,"We visited when we were at the pier. If you plan to ride multiple rides buy the wristbands, if not its per ride and can be fairly pricy. We rode the farris wheel at sunset. My sister had never been in Calif before and this was the perfect opportunity for her. It was a nice long ride, very smooth and the view was quite nice. Highly suggest to take your date here!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0601sonjab
30,Not all that,"Just a rather average amusement park, but does what it is supposed to. The staff were actually really good and did seem to enjoy what they were doing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grabul
30,Fun for Kids,"So I used to go to the pier when I was a kid and adored it, I have very fond memories of the ferris wheel, bumper cars and arcade. So the new Pacific Park is not quite the same. It has more rides and games and is a lot more expensive. That being said, the kids still totally enjoy it. The arcade is still a little old school and I can still find some familiar games from my childhood. The park and arcade can be crowded on busy days and weekends so keep a tight hold on your little ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happyowl97
30,Meh,"I was sooo excited to come to Pacific park and see the great Santa Monica pier. If you're on the north side looking at the pier and it looks PACKED, not to worry, that side is just the pier, the south side is the park.We were here the Saturday if Labor Day weekend. It wasn't too bad, not too busy like we thought, didn't really have to wait for rides.We had the LA go pass and to make it worth the money we had to go on 4 rides. We didn't know that the rides are not as thrilling as advertised, at least for adults. We did the roller coaster, twice because it was quiet and they let us. Not the most exciting roller coaster in the world...Did a spinny ride which was a bit of fun, and the famous Ferris wheel. The one ride I really liked the look of was not included with the unlimited rides band and was $5 so we didn't do it. We wasted money on games and won a toy. The two pirate ship rides looked alright when advertised, one a little kiddy, they were both kiddy. We didn't bother trying them out.Night time is a completely different story. We came back to do the Ferris wheel again and see the lights, the park was PACKED! It was had to walk anywhere between all the people and prams, there was a bit of shoving to get through and the line for the Ferris wheel was huge. The wait wasn't too bad, beautiful from up the top, but getting off meant fighting through that crowd again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R0wi3
50,Iconic attraction!,"This is a must see stop in Santa Monica, there are numerous restaurants to choose from, arcade games and Pac Park with the big wheel and roller coaster, fab in the evening around sunset to watch the sun go down behind the Santa Monica mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyS3439

40,Make time to visit,We walked out onto the pier with the specific aim of going on the Ferris wheel. The views from the wheel were fabulous and it was a lovely way to spend a few minutes enjoying the views and the breeze. There are lots of other rides and stalls/shops to look at but make sure to walk to the end where they fish. There were pelicans sat posing along with a seal that just swam around for people to photograph. Some of the buskers were brilliant. Wheelchair access is good though it can be a little bumpy due to the uneven planking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidG745
30,Pricey if you're riding rides,"The rides are a bit expensive, so I suggest getting a wristband and spending alot of time there to make it worth the money. Food isn't cheap either and the souvenir shops are expensive as well. The location is wonderful and views are breathtaking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelnmom31
40,Fun afternoon,We spent a couple of hours at the Pacific Park Pier. We enjoyed all the sights and a couple of the rides. The views from the ferris wheel were spectacular.

They have some great rides, roller coaster, another types of amusement types of rides including ones for the smaller kids. They also have the world's on solar powered ferris wheel. With great LED light that can be seen for miles with unique themed light patterns.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaCapt
30,Better for little ones,"I took my 10 yo son and a friend. They didn't find much to ride after the roller coaster. Seemed like they had more rides for little ones, which is actually nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/32655Kim
40,Great Park,The park next to the Pier is very nice and very well kept up. Open 5 AM to 12 AM. Nice walk area and benches. Across the street are shops and restaurants. Look for the beginning of US Highway 10 which starts here.. Nice relaxing place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimK751

40,Amusement Park on Pier!!!,there is something special about the Pier which has been the backdrop for many movies and shows. It only has about 10 or 11 rides and only two that were open for 2 teenagers. The Ferris Wheel and Rollercoaster. Several more for younger kids. A couple of good games to play...Have to hit the Park when in Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J0hnPM10

The park, located on the Santa Monica Pier, looks directly out on the Pacific Ocean, in the direction of Catalina Island. It is the only amusement park on the West Coast of the United States located on a pier. There are a total of thirteen rides in Pacific Park, including the world's only solar powered Ferris wheel that provides a view of the Pacific Ocean and a roller coaster that circles the majority of the park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gmeredith

40,World famous!,I was visiting LA and decided to play tourist so I drove up to Santa Monica and Venice beach to check it out.The pier and pacific park is nice. Not too many people (came on a Wednesday) and you have the famous bubba gump restaurant and the chowder restaurant with the bread bowl.Check it out and take it off your bucket list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaysuhn12
40,Seemed like it was missing something,"I personally thought this was a very enjoyable park, but I thought is was also missing something. I don't know what it was, though. Anyway, super enjoyable for anyone. My favorite ride there was the iconic Ferris wheel. (Pokemon GO players) The Park is also a great spot for Pokemon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosC709
40,Quick Visit! Great place!,We stopped at the pier for a quick visit and allow the kids to dip their feet in the Pacific. They wanted to ride the Roller Coaster. It was good to see that they offer price per ride as well as full ride tickets and bracelets. Kids did the roller coaster and played some of the games. Typical Midway style prices. We got the kids names painted on poster boards. Was a great deal at $1 per letter of their name. Lots to things to do. Would recommend this to families!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Labradorman
50,Great for the kids!!,Fun times. Great for families and kids! Had lots of fun. Lots of shopping and good eats. Great views especially for travelers!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissKiaBaby
50,Fun and games with amazing views.,"If you're visiting with kids, you can't miss Pacific Park and the Santa Monica Pier. The kids will enjoy the games and rides, and the adults will enjoy the beautiful views and great photo spots. The pier tends to be very crowded, but if you go earlier in the day, you can avoid some of the crowds and longer lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ERFSU82
30,Fun for kids!,"Our kids enjoyed Pacific Park. The are only a few rides and the cost of tickets are somewhat pricey. We bought the Go Los Angeles card which includes an all-inclusive ride bracelet. This is the ideal way to go, considering each ride is about $8.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gutt12
40,Long queues,Enjoyed atmosphere of being on the pier. The queues for the main attractions were too long for us to bother. The kids did go on the rather odd bumper car type ride and thought it was crazy but wouldn't do it again. It's also quite expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandacE1861TB
40,The ferris wheel has outstanding views!,"Pacific Park doesn't have a lot of rides, but hey, it's on a pier!! They have a cool rollercoaster, spacious ferris wheel, a historic merry-go-round, and more! You can pay admission for just one ride, or get the special all-day pass, which is great for kids. For me, it was the experience of enjoying rides on a famous pier. Worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynsha
50,A Carnie on the Water,"This was an interesting place. To be honest, I was surprised it was so big. I thought it was, for the most part, a ferris wheel and little more from what little I had saw on TV, but that is not the case. They have plenty of rides jammed on this little pier to keep you busy. It was nice to take the ferris wheel and get a view down of the ocean and coast line. A bit windy for those afraid of heights, but I had fun. Recommended for a lazy evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
50,Beautiful & Shiny beach,"In daytime, people is crowded to relax on the beach. in nighttime, also here is crowded to watch the sunset. Here is always crowded place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kazuakim2015
40,Good outing for kids and adults,"My cousins and their kids came into town and we wanted a way to entertain them. We got a deal on a discount site for all ride wrist bands. Parking is a bit difficult to get in and out of but there are parking structures close as long as you don't mind walking a block or so. Will a few popular restaurants on the pier, there will always be somewhat of a crowd. Saturdays are extremely busy since the pier stays open longer, however the lines for the rides die down as it gets dark and they do move pretty quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b4sence2000
50,Great Rides and lost of good activities for whole family!,We have a great time here on rides and the food there is good too. It is a must goto place to see if you are visiting California! Please try it out!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffJenny88
50,Rides for kids of all ages..,"I'm not a big fan of roller coaster rides, BUT LOVE there junior coaster! My 7 year old son & I have had a BLAST every time we've went to Pacific Park. The unlimited ride wristband is well worth it if you know you'll be at the SM Pier for a couple of hours. The sun setting is absolutely breathtaking from the Ferris Wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharkInAFishTank
50,Lots of fun!,"This reminds me of a fair, except with a roller coaster and on a pier. It is fun to do with your family and especially young kids. Just make sure you arrive around the time it opens in order to beat the crowd! Bubba Gump's is located on the pier and it is very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Launan49
40,Great Place for Fam,Had a great time at Pac Park with our fam and 4 year old. Got the day pass and rode most everything multiple times. The Ferris wheel is iconic and has great views. Be careful as a not so good element at the park and around pier in general but great place to visit and must do in Cali.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christopherv223
50,just beautiful and being upgraded,"This is truly one of the most beautiful places in the world. Sad that there are always homeless people with no place to live and be treated for their issues, but the city seems to have taken some steps to clean up the place a bit from previous visits.THe park on the north end past Washington is really just gorgeous and so pleasant. Love it here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Irvinggetthecar
50,A must visit,Great place to visit and take the kids. Lots to do and see. Plenty of stuff to by and bring home for the family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertwA1285MD
50,Nice family time,"One of the best park, old school style. Right at the beach, very family oriented. Every time we are at LA area, my knows that he has to go there as a destination to have fun. He loved the roller coaster and the dragon rides. Great views from the Ferris wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucianoa623
40,Great Family Fun,"I had seen pictures of Pacific Park but to see it in person was really amazing! It is a fun, old style amusement park that reminds me a lot of carnivals that spring up at county fairs on the East Coast.I visited with my brother, sister in law, and a 6 year old, 5 year old and 15 month old. I bought wrist bands for my brother and wife and the 2 oldest kids. It is definitely the way to go if you plan to ride at least 2 rides.The kids and my brother (who is still a big kid himself!) had a great time on the rides! The staff seemed attentive and fun and never impatient.It gets REALLY crowded on a Saturday afternoon and you will often see street performers and musicians lining the pier. There are also the Santa Monica beaches on either side of the pier.Parking was tight - people were stalking us for a parking space when we left! Also, the parking spaces aren't very wide so it works well with a mini-van (with doors that slide back) rather than doors that swing open. Parking for the day was $12 for the day, which is a pretty good price (from where I'm from!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susangT922VG
50,fun fun fun,"first of all its location, second the wonderful rides. You might feel you are in Disney but with an ocean view!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/El_expl0rad0r
40,Great deal if you get a groupon/discount for a wrist band. Not many rides but good fan fun with great view,"The reg price for rides or wristband is ridiculous for what they have to offer but if you get a discount, it can be a good time for a few hours! Rides cater to all ages... some kiddie rides for the wee ones as well as a few good ones for an adventurous adult. Great views - esp from the big wheel. Just wish they offered the discount more often for the locals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westsidecarrie

40,"Fun, not an all day plan","Considering this is on a pier, there isn't many rides. It's not somewhere that yoy would spend a day at. Having said that, it is a nice place to spend a couple hours. It is free to walk through, which is a big bonus if there are people with you who don't like to ride. Suggestion: walk through first to see what rides everyone will go on before you purchase tickets or the day pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cld1966
40,The Icon of the Santa Monica Pier,"Pacific Park on the Santa Monica Pier is just a place you must visit when you are in Southern California. It is just that synonymous with Los Angeles and the ocean.You have to be on the pier or near it for a sunset. In the summer the sun will set into the mountains toward Malibu and in the winter you will see it set into the water.New lights have just been added to the ferris wheel and the roller coaster which makes for great night and dusk photos. If you have a few clouds you will have a great addition to your backdrop for the photo. Try to get on the south side of the pier for a beach photo/pier/sunset/lights.The rides are rather 'tame' compared to a Magic Mountain but good for the kids and old folks. The atmosphere is old circus/carnie without the animals.Allow 2-3 hours for parking, walking, waiting in lines and playing a few games.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MITCHELN
30,Something fun to do,"I wouldn't say this is a must see or do attraction. We had a 'free' pass from our LA GOCARD and very much enjoyed ourselves (two adults). But there were a couple of rides that weren't covered by the unlimited pass and you had to pay an additional $5 for which was disappointing. The close time wasn't well advised as it can fluctuate apparently, so we missed out on a ferris wheel as we stopped for dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcimo_NZ
30,crowded,A good place to spend the day with kids. Lots of rides and games booths. Many restaurant choices with expected tourist prices. The end of the pier can get quite windy but view is nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawnCA
40,Great place to walk around and check out!,"The view is amazing... The prices for the all day ride tickets are a little pricey $17 for kids and $30 for adults. Mostly carnival rides, did not do any of them, but I am sure the kids would love it. Lots of vendors and little shops with all kinds of things. I loved the billboard with the vintage Route 66 pictures on it at the end of the pier. Good take in for an hour or two well worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lsmith1338
40,My kids LOVED the Park but it is small compared to a state fair.,"I recommend the All-Inclusive wrist band. It pays for itself in four rides. My kids thought this place was the awesome. We went at night which was fairly spectacular as the lights came on. We had free tickets from our hotel for the ferris wheel. This was a really neat ride. You get a very good view of the beach and coastline at the top. The kids did ride all the rides but liked the roller coaster and the one that spins around sideways but the seat (for two) also spins. My daughter can get very nauseous (even as a 16 year old) but she had NO problem on any of these. Be aware, the roller coaster ride only lasts about 30 seconds! I give this 3.5 stars and rounded up just because it is a memorable location that I recommend you see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douglaspahl
50,Fun place to hang out with friends and family,"Nice amusement park on Santa Monica Pier with food court and tables with benches, some with umbrellas. Moderately priced, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf is there as are other restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1061SNlb
40,Not bad,Enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Street performers made it enjoyable because I am not interested in the rides. Lots of food and souvenirs available for purchase. The beach looked amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pr0ject1
40,Fun times for a little bit of green,"Pacific Park is a prime example of a boardwalk amusement park. The nice thing is that you can pay for rides as you go, which can also be a not as nice thing because that can add up. There aren't a lot of rides, and most are for the under 8 set, but it's clean, and the lines move quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jelizaa
30,Neat place.,"This place can be a bit chaotic especially on weekends. We were able to find ocean-level parking for $12. (cash and credit accepted). We went here on a visit while vacationing in California because I thought it would be neat for the kids to ride a roller coaster right on the Pacific Ocean. We all rode the Ferris Wheel (max of 6 people in one carriage). We did have to wait quite a while while they were testing the ride. Not sure what that was about. Our kids went to ride the roller coaster, but they shut that down temporarily for testing as well. Again, not sure what that was about, but they opened the ride again eventually. Our littlest daughter rode the bumper cars which I thought were pretty lame, but she had fun. One of the control handles came off in her hand while she was attempting to drive the thing. The pier had a few liver performers on it. One was ""Dancing Dave"" a really strange kereoke guy and another was a girl who was a pretty talented musician, but she talked too much instead of playing and lost her crowd. They have pier fishing, swimming, vendors, restaurants, games, and rides, etc. If you want souvenirs I would recommend Venice Beach though because there are more vendors and cheaper prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USAExplorer_2010
30,"Busy, tiny, but iconic","You can't have Santa Monica Pier without Pacific Park, even if it is kind of small. You don't get this kind of atmosphere everywhere, but it is key to the pier. There were tons of people around (Spring Break) we didn't actually ride any rides because of the cost, but it seemed like kids were having fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbmusic
50,"Great Pier, Great Rides, A Must for Visitors.","Pacific Park is part of the Santa Monica Pier. It is fun and a great way to spend the day while on Vacation in Los Angeles. A wrist band is about 29$ and the rides are fun, there are not a ton, it is all on the pier, but enough to keep you busy. There are carnival games on the pier as well as the old Carousel that has been there forever. There are great snack shops and a couple of really great eateries. You will find a large building with video and all sorts of games. Have a great time. Parking is for a fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
30,"Similar to other tiny amusement parks, unique for its location","This cute little amusement park is perched on top of the Santa Monica pier, and has an assortment of favorite carnival rides, including a Ferris Wheel and a small roller coaster. You can get your game on in the arcade or try your luck at at the games of skill that you will most likely lose at before winning that huge stuffed animal you have your eyes on. Have a corn dog, some curly fries, and an ice cream, and the failure will soon fade from your memory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dunadan

40,Really fun little amusement park,"OK, this is fun.It is small, yes.It is expensive (for what you get), yes.BUT....When I was there (May) there were no lines, got on anything I wanted as many times as I wanted and really enjoyed it. If you are looking for 6 flags, you are going to be disappointed. If you are looking for a fun diversion, and can choke the cost down - go for it.Like I said, it is a lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerryElvers

40,Fun but pricey,"When visiting the Santa Monica Pier, you can't help but to see Pacific Park. It's a mini carnival on a pier in the ocean. What's not to love about that? It's a fun area with a ferris wheel, mini roller coaster, carnival games and most importantly - carnival food! :) Ride the ferris wheel, eat something you shouldn't but will really enjoy and just take the whole area in. It's a cool family hangout kind of place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssy24
40,Nice and Safe,place to spend time with the family. I used to go here with my wife and daughter when she was young and it was the perfect place close to home. you can feel the breeze from the ocean. Even on a hot day it is still tolerable.I would get there early and buy the wristband. If time is limited then tickets are fine. This place is for small kids and teens. Teens go there to hang with friends but they don't really bother you.Seniors can also have a good time here by watching and relaxing....it is also on the pier so they can also stroll on that if they get bored.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeLinCPA
40,Classic American pier funfair,"We had a day on the pier and the funfair is a great little add on.There is a couple of small rides, a big wheel and a small rollercoaster.The wristbands aren't to expensive for kids and we well priced for adults at about $29 for the unlimited wristband. A classic little fairground would be a good afternoon of fun for the kids and the big wheel and rollercoaster are worth a go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glenc360
40,Fun,"Went when my sister was visiting with her kids. When we rode the Ferris wheel the fog started to roll it what made it fun and the view was beautiful. We enjoyed the rides, games and street artists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jujied
40,New Year's Eve,"Visited there twice on our trip but the good time was New Year's Eve, got there about 10pm and spent the next few hours with the unlimited ride wrist band hitting the rides with the family. Great was to see out one year and in the other.Wee bit cold bring winter but could have been worse, take a jersey just in case.Walked down to the end of the pier for the count down with just about everyone else there.Family friendly even at that hour of the night.The unlimited rides band is very good value.Very good views at night of Te city from the Ferris wheel.Good value parking available with plenty of spaces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daz233
50,End of Route 66,"Ended our Route 66 trip here and had lots of fun. The park is right on the edge of the ocean. There are several rides, arcades, and shops. There are artists on the pier painting, sculpting and providing music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nana196
50,Photographer's delight at sunet,"This is the second time I've managed to be here at sunset. This time, three of us came, each armed with a camera. They went out on the pier. I stayed on the beach. The pier, ferris wheel, and roller coaster make a magnificent photo subject at sunset. The pier can be fun too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoPegasus
40,Fun but if a solo traveller you can't go on the wheel,Nice little attraction but if you are solo you can't go on the wheel! I find that odd? They refused to sell me a ticket. Must be a solution!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EssexAngelDelight
30,Lots of tourist,The activities there are more for children than adults. The new city train will stop a block away from the pier and it will definitely be more congested.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vpd
30,Amusement Park on the Ocean,"A tidy park with rides, entertainment, and other amusements on the Santa Monica Pier. Roller coaster, ferris wheel, spinning rides, and much more. A bit pricey, and the park can be crowded. Ample parking in the adjacent pay lot. Be ready for cold, windy weather at any time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oceansidedaddy
50,Very fun!,My wife and I had a great time on the Ferris Wheel! We even ate at Bubba Gumps and walked to our hotel that was 1 block away!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesuscY2120DT

Running path is nearby.Easy walk to 3rd Street promenade or santa monica pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1traveladdictblog
40,A fun place for all but expensive rides!,Fun place to spend few hours with your friends or family but each single ride tickets are not chip unless you buy unlimited wrist band for $27.00,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/624David
30,Very over priced for rides,"Best bet is to look for coupons etc before your trip! It's $30 for a all-ride bracelet ...luckily my son loved most of them and went on a few of them over and over, but I did find better deals on our last day.The Ferris Wheel is very cool though...especially if you are there at sunset...you can get an incredible view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaH1820
40,Great little park,"This is a review for the Pacific Park, not the pier (they are separate). The park is small, but there's a great selection of rides including the rollercoaster and Ferris wheel. If you're on the pier, there's no reason not to visit the park - it's free entry - but you pay for the rides. Nearby there are places to eat, and of course, great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UkMuse

40,Enjoyable day out.,"I'd been before and brought the family this time - taking in the pier, the beach and Pacific Park for a few hours. My three year old very much enjoyed the rides, the ferris wheel is excellent. Lines not too long. Toilets are pretty clean. A number of options for eating although seating is limited. Wished we'd stayed to the evening to see it all lit up. Likely you're driving - you can wait in line to park at the beach but there is a great, cheap multi-story carpark not 5 mins away that you have to pass if you're coming off the freeway - better option to park there imo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andymwood
50,Great amusement park without long lines,"If your idea of going to an amusement park is to pay a lot of money to spend most of your time in the line then this is not for you. But if you like to get on the rides without delay and have a great time, go here!!! We spent 3 hours here and we all managed many more rides than at the famous parks all day. It's also in a beautiful spot that is hard to beat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tomcsa
30,"Trendy, tourist trap, yet iconic","A must see attraction...beautifully lit up at night. Ferris wheel and roller coaster reflecting off the Pacific are thrilling. But, there is a major transient element that might make some uncomfortable here. We were never threatened in any way, but I would be uncomfortable bringing small children here. Great cheesy date night stop for sure though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RandallM566
50,Amazing amusement park!,"Specifically enjoyed the West Coast Ferris Wheel.It's in a great location on the Santa Monica Pier, near the aquarium and End of the Trail Rte 66!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/105marcys
40,"Fun for young kids, happy memories, and majestic sunset over Pacific Ocean","We arrived at Santa Monica Pier at around 3pm and had fun, family time at Pacific Park for a few hours. Kids rode their favorite rides multiple times, and there were hardly any lines! For an eight-years old and a six-years old, this place is as fun as Disney World, and it's their joyous laughter that makes it worth the visit. My favorite ride is the Ferris Wheel overlooking the Santa Monica beach and the Pacific Ocean. We ended the visit with the sunset over the ocean at 5:40pm which is spectacular and only available in California/West Coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalTravelerKim
50,Fun visit for kids and adults,"Yes, it's touristy but locals seem to love it, too. It appeals to kids and adults alike. Fun for little ones, and also a great date night. Junk food, coffee shop, souvenir shops and rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bailarina5678
40,Amazing sunset,"It was almost 2 years ago, but i still remember how amazing the sunset is from the pier. Also enjoied a ride on the wheel, which opened a great view over the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsvetle
50,Visiting for the first time or repeat visits both are great,"We visited Pacific Park as a repeat visit but brought along someone who was seeing it for the first time. We all enjoyed the visit. The shop called ""Pacific Park"" which has various items has friendly service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LV_Lee
50,Nice,Beautiful place to hang and enjoy your time near almost every thing the sea and the food court .. games .. historical memorial .. 👍 just loved it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fatimafaraj123
30,A Bit Creepy,"The rides are goofy and it's kinda what you'd expect. However, it has a strangely creepy feeling which I enjoyed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KamranNezami
40,Fun place to spend a few hours,"We had a day layover in LA so we thought we'd check out the Santa Monica Pier again. We wandered around the pier for awhile looking at the buskers and a few artists, which was pretty entertaining in itself. Them we decided to hit a couple rides in the park. The ferris wheel was great for getting a nice high perspective and take a few photos from, but they're not that exciting. We did the roller coaster and the ship ride as well, which are both a little more exciting. Things aren't too badly priced and it was fun to hop on a few rides. There are a bunch of midway games and rides for small kids as well.It was a good starting point for spending the day in the area. Worth a visit for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/533codyp
40,Fun in the Sun,Pacific Park has some basic rides for entertainment. You can pay per ride or buy an unlimited ride pass. My son and I wanted to ride the roller coaster and the Ferris wheel. Both of which cost $8 per person per ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielleH106
40,Fun for the little one,Our toddler had a great time on the rides. Reasonable prices. Plenty of parking and bathroom facilities. Great weather and beautiful views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachbumHB
40,Fun Day,We spent the day going on rides in the park. The ride passes were about $28 pp but if you look online you can get a discount coupon to save your self a few bucks. The rides are ok and the games we skipped. Most line ups were less than 10 minutes which for a Saturday during the Holidays we thought was pretty good. Definitely got our moneys worth and had a great day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onip1969
50,A pier must!!,"If you take the time to go to the Santa Monica Pier, You have to ride the rides at Pacific Park.Pacific Park is located on the pier itself. Ride the Scrambler, bumper cars, pirate ship the roller coaster and take some great pictures at the top of the ferris wheel.Buy an unlimited ride pass. It works all day, and you'll want to ride all of them more than once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/korndogizard
40,"The Ferry is great, but needs at least 2 people","I decided to visit the Feris Wheel, but when I lined at the counter they told me that I couldn't ride alone.Luckily they had just turned away another person so we could go together but it's best you're awar before you get to the front. It'd be good if their were signs.The view from the the wheel was nice though even if it seemed to turn very fast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/370rachelp
40,Worth a Visit,We took a ride on the ferris wheel and the views from the top were wonderful. This would be a great place for children. Rides are around $8 each.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EliseH9
30,Not Sure What the Fuss is About,"We landed in LA after a 15 hour flight, booked into our accommodation and went straight down to Santa Monica Pacific Park. It was mid afternoon, on a week day and to be perfectly frank, thought it was very average.There weren't that many people around, except beggars and school kids. We had cheap, but good take away from the pier stalls, which we enjoyed, but something (a buzz?) was missing.Maybe we were over tired from a long flight, but we just couldn't work out why this area has become such an international icon.The views of the ocean and nearby mountains were breathtaking and when the mist starts rolling in we were gobsmacked by the beauty.Maybe we visited at the wrong time of the year, but it seemed to lack vitality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O1472VRjamesf
50,A wonderful mix of busy and relaxing,Love this place -- there is always a great buzz on the Pier and that combined with the calm relaxation of the views of the sea is an amazing combination. To go here are sun set is incredible with unobstructed view of the sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeDeenor
50,the atmosphere,"The pier is a beautiful and exciting place to visit. We went both day and evening, and the atmosphere both times was completely different. There is so much to see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelamc75
40,Good for what it is,"Simple carnival rides. Not so busy that kids can't ride multiple times. I would recommend the unlimited ride pass. There is a email subscription to get coupons that make the pass $15 or so. If you have to eat, go for the hot dog or snacks like popcorn or bring something and eat it on the beach. The fast food stalls take a long time to get your order out and are very pricey. Overall a great place to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeDude

50,Great place for Kids!,We are locals and many of my mom-friends and I love coming here with our kids. Its great for kids - especially the 3-9 age group - lots of good kiddie rids. Check the hight requirement so you know if your little one can get on all the rides. There are coupons online for discounts off the wristbands. Its definitely less crowded on week days and non-summer months.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalabasasTraveler
50,SO FUN,"Went at night, lots of lights and music, a full moon, starts and WIDE beach. Awesome. The rides were a wee bit expensive, but so worth it when my son laughed his head off!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJBradley74
50,Such a fun way to spend an afternoon,"We had such a great time at the Park. We bought an unlimited ride wristband, $6 worth of games each, and a meal each through Viator so we were all set for our day. However our day was cut a little short when we played the ring toss and both one -- so had two MASSIVE (four-foot) soft toys to cart around. Hard to take those on the rollercoaster! I would absolutely recommend doing Pacific Park, I had such a fun time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariajaneb
50,Must visit when in Santa Monica,"Historic location that you've probably seen many times on tv and movies. Walk the whole pier, stop in the shops, talk to the venders, Tyra restaurant and bar or two. Ride the Ferris wheel for an incredible view of the whole area and beyond on a clear night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark60187
30,"Nice fairground, quite pricey","We are fans of thrill rides and we knew we wouldn't find any here, but we thought it would be nice to ride the big wheel as it looked relaxing. However $8 per ride was too expensive in our opinion and so we didn't bother.The park seems well maintained and is nice to photograph as it's very colourful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pip-F1

50,Fun for kids,"Old school amusement park with fun rides for kids and carnival type games. Our daughter had the time of her life here. We spent the day riding rides,playing games and eating ice cream and funnel cakes. She told us ""it was her best day ever."" A win for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieTigers
30,Retro experience,"Reminder of days gone by. Roller coaster, Ferris Wheel, game booths, snack foods. Very small carnival area attached to the Santa Monica Pier. Lots of families and date couples. Adds to the fun of the pier. Worth a visit. Lights on the rides are particularly striking at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJR55
50,Not back to the Future just plain old fashioned pleasure,We took our Grandchildren the Carousel always the first call then on to the Arcade very popular and always busy can be expensive but enjoyable when you see the delight on young children's faces there are quite a few rides for very young children but just a few for Adults but that aside it is a must to visit if you are in Santa Monica it has a happy holiday atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulineT780
40,Fun,We enjoyed the Pacific wheel. The world's largest solar powered Ferris wheel. The ride seemed to stop a lot to let passengers off and on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherrySwirl
40,Quick stop,Quite a few rides for how small of a venue. My son and his girlfriend rode the ferris wheel. They were hoping for a nice sunset,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10ringtraveler
30,Small but a little something for all.,"Not many rides but if you are at Santa Monica Pier and can catch a groupon, give it a try. The $28.95 for unlimited rides is way to pricey. I found a groupon deal for $15 so it was a decent deal. The staff were all very cordial.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/007Beaner
40,Quaint Amusement Park,Suggest the ferris wheel at night. Great sights. Nice spot for the kids to enjoy and get a break since they are just not into the historical pieces.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyE376
40,Iconic LA location that was good fun too!,Probably one of the best amusement park locations in the world. The rides are average but enough to keep kids entertained for a couple of hours. Roller coaster looks scarier than it is.Unless you are only going to ride the iconic Ferris wheel then the all day wrist bands are the best value for sure. You can download discount coupons on the website.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/442darthd
50,Great attraction!,We went on a Monday afternoon after a bike ride and had a great time. We went on all the rides and played some of the carnival games!

40,Grand day out,We visited on our honeymoon on a day out to Santa Monica beach. We visited the carnival ground and had a go at the stalls. It was fun to goof around. We also tried the Ferris wheel. Nice views over the beach and pier. Genuinely worth the money I paid. Thanks for a good time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hwnew
40,Carnies and freaks....in a gorgeous setting,"Filled with families and carnies...it's a carnival and beach all in one. The food is typical carnival fare and the rides and games are pretty and have lots of lights and sounds. The backdrop is gorgeous -- the Pacific ocean and Santa Monica. So when you ignore the screaming kids and freaks of nature walking along the pier, you see it's a beautiful coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/44JL44
40,Fun but more fun for kids,"It's actually pretty enjoyable for anyone but it's better for kids. Even so, just take a walk around, I'm sure you'll find it fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/e125angel

40,The Pier Park in Santa Monica...,"Santa Monica has, and maintains, a quite nice Pier facility with multiple amusement areas, restaurants, snack shops & souvenir areas. Great for all ages, especially children...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Fun way to enjoy the pier,"Pretty fun, we got a groupon for the park and spent a little time on the rollercoaster before we went to see Cirque du Soleil. It's a really unique view from the pier and I'd say a memorable way to burn an hour or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SongDog007
50,Great Fun for Kids,We recently spent a few days at the beach and my nieces (ages 6 and 9) really enjoyed our evening at Pacific Park. They are the perfect ages to enjoy the level of rides that are available and it is totally worth it to buy the wristband ($15-$30 each depending on age). Sitting at the top of the Ferris wheel looking out over the ocean was the perfect ending to our sisters trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BasinBarrett
30,Cute but small.,"This park is cute but very small. It might be nice for very, very young children but it is not all the special. Nice views of the ocean though on the coaster.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephanieg978
50,BOARDWALK FUN,"Fun, throw-back Boardwalk experience. A leisurely stroll to the end of the pier to watch the sun set is well worth the time and effort. Rides and games and carny-style food enrich the experience. Great fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArnoldSher
40,Small but very nice,A classic place and a must visit.Just a few rides but they are in good shape an a great nostalgic experience.A great experience and we had some good fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAMAN1951
50,Small but great!,"Only a small park, but plenty to do! The Ferris wheel was great and the views from it were stunning. Older child enjoyed the rollercoaster while you gets one enjoyed trying to win teddies! A lovely day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KerryO893
40,Small park but a must go!,The kids had to do the coaster on their form their bucket list. It was busy on a Friday afternoon and would suggest the wristband which allows all day riding. Get in early for parking and maximize time on the rides. Easy to keep track of the kids. The Santa Cruz boardwalk amusement park is much larger but more expensive as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NematodeT
20,Overrated,"The pier is very run down. Rides are old. Other attractions, like the arcade, are all rather dirty. It's worth visiting just for the reputation it has, but definitely not a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/young1helpingu
50,Hectic holiday fun,"Always thronged with holiday makers and tourists this place is fun, if not restful. The rollercoaster is a highlight as is the ferris wheel. Food is expensive but it's all part of the experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anamshaz
40,Ferris Wheel!,We took a Ferris Wheel ride to take in the great views of Santa Monica! Staff are pleasant and helpful. Lots of rides for people of all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Care2scrap
50,Good for dates and families!,"I love to bring the kids down to the beach and, just every once in a while, indulge in the instant joy of the roller coaster or the ferris wheel. Or for date night, sometimes I convince the husband to take me up on a romantic ferris wheel ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/792kellieh
30,"Small, but still fun","This is a rather small park inside the pier. It has a good amount of games just like the fair. It's fun watching everyone play. It's just a cute place to be at, and the only thing I really got excited about was the Ferris wheel. The Ferris wheel makes the pier. But Pacific Park is alright.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicale1
30,TOOOOOOOO BUSY!!!!,"I guess if you are a tourist (like we were) you would have to make a quick stop there to say you went you saw ....and you left! Too many people, to hard to walk through, rides are old and for young kids and LONG lines!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pitaa69
50,By far my favorite place to visit!,"Pacific Park is one of my favorite places I've ever been to (and I have been all around North America and Europe). Even in our 20s, my friend and I have a blast on all the rides and just spending time at the pier.This year was actually our third year going in a row all the way from Canada because we love it so much. This was our first time of the three visits where we actually stayed until nightfall/closing, which was AMAZING! The rides were x5 better at night, and the lines were even shorter! (Not that they're even that long to begin with-- max waiting time on a ride was about 2-5 minutes!) We literally spent all three of our days in Santa Monica on the pier from 10am-10pm with all-day ride wristbands. Seriously so much fun!The only downside is lack of seating areas for food, but that doesn't affect my five star love for this place! Will see you again next year, Santa Monica!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderlustExplorerr
50,Awesome place!,The best place to relax after a long day at work or just to chill with friends over the weekend. definitely a go to place for locals and tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gio_1985
40,great fun on the pier,We had the all day bracelets thanks to our GO LA pass and that is the best way to hit the rides (which are $4 and 8 each). I thought kids might not like it after Universal and Six Flags earlier in the week but they still had a lot of fun. Barely any lines on a Thursday so that made it more fun. Great sunset about 8 ish.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love-to-wander-Mom
30,Good for younger kids,We got the Go LA pass which included the rides on the pier. My kids are 10 and 8 They really liked the sea dragon ride but the others were a little tame for them. Not worth the ticket price unless you get coupons or use the pass. We went around 5:30 on a Thursday night and only had to wait for one or two ride cycles before we got on a ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franb752
30,"Fun rides, but expensive","We were driving around Santa Monica and decided to stop off at the pier. My friends and I all love rides, and Pacific Park has a handful of them. The West Coaster, Plunge Drop Tower (I don't know what it is called) and the Sea Serpent were our favourites. West Coaster is a mild, slow speed coaster compared to other ones. It's good for the kids and the teens. Sea Serpent is by far the best thrill ride you'll find, going back and forth at a high speed. The Drop Tower may be found scary for younger children, because of the height. There is the Frog Drop Tower for the young ones. The wrist band is expensive to us, because we had a lot of us going to the park, and it's 29 dollars per person. The West Coaster is also slow, because the ride operator pauses for one minute, then lets the same car go again. Overall, I think it's average.Overall - 3/5",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kidsreviewa
30,Not so interesting.,I took my kids here. It seemed pretty cool being on the pier. But really that's the only attraction. It's small as expected. But the rides are just ok. Not all that great. And the beach is right there. My kids liked that a lot better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LostALot22
30,Worth a stop while you are at the beach,"A smallish attractions park set on the iconic Santa Monica Pier, this has a few rides targeted at younger children (rollercoasters, merry go-rounds, etc). Tickets per ride range from $4-$8. If you have very small kids who will stay for long and do several rides, it may be worthwhile buying the day package for around $20, which gives them unlimited rides. Otherwise, this is a small pit stop while you are wandering around the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripasucks
40,Attractive Fairground - Free Access,"Pacific Park is an attractive fairground/carnival on the iconic Santa Monica Pier. Access is free although the attractions come at a price. However on other piers such as Galveston you already have to pay to get access!Parking is possible at the foot of the pier, just drive Santa Monica boulevard all the way till the end (which is coincidentally also the end of Route 66!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hermes_NL
40,Good Place With High Prices,We visited pacific park because it was recommended to us by family. We were slightly surprised by the $8 per ride for the big rides (Ferris Wheel and Roller Coaster etc) and $4 for the smaller rides!. The views at the top of the Ferris wheel were sublime and the twists and turns of the big orange roller coaster were thrilling. We recommend going to Pacific Park but be whiling to spend if you want to go on more than 3 rides!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zm4
40,Recommendation,Great place to visit. There is not that many people than for example in some bigger places. No queuing. You can almost walk to the machine you want to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerhiJM
40,Fun place for kids,It's adjoining the Santa Monica Pier and there are some good rides and games for kids.The whole place is buzzing with street dancers and musicians performing there in the evenings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pgs21
40,Fun for the family,The Park is fun for all ages and well set up. The rides are fairly priced and the lines are dealt with well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P6531NYsusanw
50,Great time with small kids,Had a great time with my 7 and 3 year old. We purchased the unlimited ride band which was worth it. The park was small but that is what made it manageable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaDPT
40,Beautiful View!,"Beautiful strolling park with a fabulous view...great for people watching. It's right across the street from Fairmont Miramar Hotel - where we stay whenever we go to Santa Monica, and also a short stroll to Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tag-about
50,Clean Great Fun,This is a must if you live here are visiting or with family or friends. Pacifist c park is clean great games and a choice of rides for adults and children of all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AARDVARKKILLER
50,Good Park,I don't do it much since my kids are too small for most of the rides but its fun to hang around at. I come with my family for the games.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354jeannettev
40,Fun in the sun.,This place isvery good for families with little kids. The small kids rides are very nice and oriented toward little kids from one to five or six. There is other rides for older kids plus some games for kids and adults. Plenty of fast food choices and restaurants are available also.i love Santa Monica pier it's fun for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/571MarieD
40,Fun park at a price!,Excellent location and fun for all but gets costly if you want to experience it all. Try to find parking to the left of the pier that charges $1 per hour if you don't plan on staying long as the day rate is $12-$15.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheldonSteyn
40,Good time,"We had a good time last year and decided to come back. Iconic rides on perfect setting on Santa Monica Pier. You'll pay $12 for nearby parking but worth it vs walking several blocks.We did the unlimited rides wristband for $28 for kids 12 and older. It was $16 for 7 and youngerThey have old style carnival games but I wouldn't recommend wasting your money. They have typical carnival food choices am that cost $$.Overall recommend this for any family, just bring ur own drink and snacks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasontraci2006
40,Sun 'n surf!,"A great place to walk, soak in the pacific and people watch. Overlooking the wide beaches of Santa Monica you can relax and enjoy the never ending waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannj703
50,"Fun, must do in Santa Monica","We stayed in Venice beach and our walk on the very famous beach naturally led us to this amusement park on the Santa Monica pier. Of course we had to go ty the roller coaster, which is kind of tame, but the view was amazing. They give you two runs at it so you have your money's worth. I like the fact that you get to custom buy your ride experience, only got tockets for the roller coaster and the ferris wheel. The view from the top is just amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clprefon
50,Family fun,"We visited the park on a day trip to the pier area with an 18 year old, 12 year old and a 4 year old. The park has no entry fee. The rides were expensive unless you buy the unlimited bands. We even found a 20% off coupon on our phones. The kids rode rides for 3 hrs. The games were pretty much the same as you find at most carnivals and theme parks. The ferris wheel is a must even if it's the only ride you ride.!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hutchens74
40,A must do,"Fun little place and just a hype at night. Looks stunning at night! Ride are of plenty, however costly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Burd1mil
50,Fun for the whole family,Our kids loved Pacific Park. They were able to ride the rides over and over without waiting in long lines. The staff is very friendly. There are alot of restaurants to choose from nearby. The view is amazing especially from the ferris wheel. The vendors on the pier do beautiful art work. I highly suggest a visit to everybody.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Romanmommy85
40,Designed for children,"Designed more for children, but the view of the sunset is beautiful if you can time it just right! The rides aren't too expensive. Pretty at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Silkysecret
40,a good atmosphere,considering attractions the park is more for kids. in the night time the park is light up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J359jncd
40,Good Fun,"We just went on the roller coaster and played some of the carnival games, was good fun and not too expensive. A great way to spend a few hours. We were there in the morning and were surprised how quite it was!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BTM39
50,Overpriced--but that's LA!,"We traveled here from Ireland and spent some time at the Pacific Park and the Pier. Quite enjoyed it, although we found the rides to be a bit pricey really for what they are. The ferris wheel was a blast though! Bit scary going over the Pacific Ocean, but a real thrill! Love the proximity to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/307christopherj
40,Amusement-Park on the Pier,Nice little amusement-park on the Santa Monica Pier. The entry is free but you have to pay for the different rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laheuereuse
50,I could come here every day,"I loved the park on the pier. We spent the day here from open to close. It was a little windy but gorgeous. We used an online coupon for unlimited ride wristbands and it was well worth it. We rode the bigger rides countless times. It is so confined that you can jump from one ride to the next very easily. All the rides were working and the employees were pretty friendly.They would send the coaster around twice instead of just once. The lines were non-existent. The views while on the ferris wheel and coaster are stunning. There are several food choices, mostly fast food, but the wait wasn't long. Prices are steep for Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. They serve Coke products though so it made up for it. The icecream was delicious. We got icecream twice. The shops have souvenirs with decent prices, a lot of stuff was fairly inexpensive.Walking out on the pier and watching the water at sunset was amazing. The views are spectacular all around you. The sign for the end of Route 66 is at the beginning of the pier. I will definitely be returning in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luv-that-farm
30,Amusement park for tourists?,"If you’ve made the effort to get to Santa Monica pier, then you might as well look around the amusement park called Pacific Park - unless you have young children of course, in which case you’ll have no choice. But I’m sure you realise that this is a prime tourist area, with everything that goes along with that, like crowds, overpricing, and keep your pockets closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/40JeffP
20,Fairground,Pacific Park is very picturesque but like a lot of fairground rides built on piers it tends to feel like an overpriced tourist trap. My kids went on the rollercoaster and the Big Wheel was popular but I would rather go to one of the better theme parks in the LA area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
40,Pacific Park,They have created a magical space utilizing very little real estate.There are rides and games for all age groups.Definitely fun for the whole family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheValleytoTheWorld
20,Jersey Shore Ripoff!!,"There are very limited rides at the Pacific Park; and they are very expensive for each ride ($8 or $4 per ride). So, we purchased the unlimited ride wristband for $29 each for our kids (aged 11 & 8). However, the rides weren't even that good. Especially the West Coaster (roller coaster). I guess some people go on these rides because of the views? I would highly recommend saving your money then paying for these rides, unless you just want to tell people that you've been to the Santa Monica Pier / Pacific Park. I think a previous reviewer said it perfectly, that this place is a tourist trap!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelsWFamilyAlways
50,Local Excitement,"We live down the street from this best day of fun packed with excitement and laughter. I'm not sure what the negative reviews are about, but going on the Santa MonicaPier is a highlight and treat for not only my daughter but for me too. Love the rides, atmosphere and arcade area. A must see and must vent for all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mandeemay
40,Tourist Trap - But great for sunset,Crowded and high prices with the typical tourist attractions of a local amusement park. Location location location - it is on Santa Monica Pier and it is a place you must see once especially right at sunset,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taharaja
50,Awesome for families,"The kids loved Santa Monica Pier and Pacific Park. The subset view from the Ferris wheel was absolutely breathtaking. The midway games were so much fun, too, so take a few hours and play. Be sure to take lots of pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdkmdm
50,Incredible view and relaxing yet great people watching,amazing ocean fron park on Ocean Ave in Santa monica with perfly manicured greens and room for bikers joggers and those out for a stroll. Definitely catch the sunset. Awesome restraraunt choices and several rooftop bars close by..Enjoy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LorieM659
50,Fun,A trip to the pier isnt complete with out a visit and a ride at Pacific park and playing the games and walking around the pier or the rides fun fun fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luna6373
20,"Nothing exciting, was a let down","This place was candy for the eyes...so colorful and fun and also GREAT for photos but thats where it ended. The entire place felt dirty and old, and the ground was scary to walk on. It just overall felt like it needed an update BADLY but no one wanted to put the time into it. Went with some friends who are local to the area and rode the ferris wheel which was fun. It was not somewhere where I'd want to hang out past doing whatever we came for though. It was not crowded when we went and that was good since it's very cramped feeling. Parking was very nice and easy and at $2 felt right for what you get. Would not return but probably will when I visit the area again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChiReviewQueen
50,Should visit,Pacific park is definitely family friendly. The people there are extremley nice and helpful. Truly an awesome experience to have an amusement park right infront of the beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franklinc666
40,"Busy, but fun!","We visited on a Saturday night - so it was packed. After an hour drive to get there...I wish it was open later in the evening. The kids had fun, even with long line ups - it wasn't too bad. Parking sucks though....pricey and hard to find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmmw11
40,Fun beachside amusement park,"Nice little amusement park for the kids. Right now all of our three kids are 6 and under,  and there are few rides for the little ones which is nice. The tickets for the rides seem to be on the pricey side,  but as kind as the kids are having fun then it's all good. Next time I'll probably go the unlimited bracelet route for them. The park was busy but the wait times for the rides weren't too bad. Overall everyone had a fun time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tygerstile
50,Cheap and Good,The rides were cheap and it was really cool to go on the rides. The Ferris wheel is a must do and the rollercoaster. As it was quiet the staff gave us two rides on the rollercoaster for the price of one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/862jakes
30,Great view - but somewhat understaffed,"As many have said, you can't beat the views from the rides at Pacific Park. When we went (Friday afternoon in March), the lines were surprisingly short. Despite this, we had to wait almost 10 minutes to get on a ride. It seems that there aren't enough staff for each ride, so they are ""shared"" among the rides. So we had to wait until the ride operator was done operating two other rides before we had a chance to ride ours. Perhaps they increase the number of staff during busier times? I hope so, because this would make for a VERY long wait if staff are shared at all hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMToronto29
40,Great way to spend an afternoon,"We came here right from the airport on a Saturday in late February. I had purchased a Groupon for an unlimited ride wristband (which I recommend if you want to ride more than a couple rides).Pros:+ A lot of people here but not an annoying amount of people- we never waited more than a few minutes for a ride. And GREAT place for people watching+ Rides were fun even for adults (me)- fun roller coaster, dragon ride, etc. If you get the unlimited wrist band you'd probably ride each ride 1-3 times before you got tired of them.+ Views from the ferris wheel are AMAZING- this is literally ON the pier so you're looking out onto the ocean+ Relatively clean considering how many people come here+ Lots of food options+ Decent bathrooms!!Cons:+ Noisy- lots of children (to be expected)+ If I didn't have the Groupon, I'd say the attractions were a little pricey.Overall:Go here if you want to spend some time at the beach and kill a few hours having fun! If you don't like rides, you can spend some time souvenir shopping, watching street performers, and chowing down on some good food!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rkomenski
40,Good views,"This is a good green space where you can see all the way to the water and over the pier in Santa Monica. We came up here after we spent time at the Pier..Its a good place to hangout, sit on a bench, and enjoy some views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Byrondwyer
40,A must in Santa Monica,"I used to live in Los Angeles but never had the chance to visit Pacific Park. Finally I had my chance at the insistence of my kid.We came on the afternoon of a weekday. There were very few people so no wait at all. We did all the kiddie stuff first then did a few more dangerous rides. My kid loves it but I was kinda scared.The Ferris wheel was definitely the highlight for me. The view is amazing on a clear sunny warm February day. I kept thinking iron man was going to fly by...I suppose these types of carnivals/fun fairs on a seaside broad walk is classical American. At pacific park, it is augmented to another level because of the famous ocean view. A must if you are visiting Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinnieY_13
50,One of the nicest!,"A must see if you have not seen it ,or if you are planing to visit southern California! The grass is always green, and the skies are blue. The Ocean is always there and the views change with the times. Plenty of parking( just don't forget to feed the meter , no forgiveness in Santa Monica) benches every where to sit and take the view in. Bring a good Camera, and the one you love, because you would want to share it with some one dear. Palm trees all along, and the Pier across the waters with its Farris wheel .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barry684
50,Fun in the sun!,"This was included on our Go LA card, unlimited rides. We had great fun and enjoyed the views from the solar powered Ferris wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeAdelaide
50,"Crowded, nice small venue in a great location","what more can you want? you're right on the pier above the breaking surf of the ocean. parking can be tough, and the crowds of course, but a very fun place to walk around and a heaven for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pandpCalifornia
40,Lively carnival feel,"We enjoyed walking around Pacific Park while we were visiting Santa Monica Pier. We were here to watch the sunset. When it started getting dark, the lights of Pacific Park were gorgeous. The ferris wheel and roller coaster were especially lit up in many pretty colors (see pics). The bright lights and the screams of joy from riders made me feel like a kid at a carnival again. We didn't ride any of the rides so I'm not sure about prices. The lines actually scared us away since we had a limited amount of time. There were several options for food and several of the restaurants smelled really good even though we had just finished dinner. There's no fee to walk around the park! This would definitely be a place I'd return to if I am back in California some day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
30,Great views of the Pacific,"We got the unlimited ride wristband as a part of the GO Los Angeles card. If not for that, the wristband is too expensive for the amount and quality of rides available. On a busy Saturday night, the roller coaster had the longest line. Ride operators let you go around twice to make the ride worth it. Other typical boardwalk/state fair type rides available. Workers here are friendly and seem to enjoy their jobs. Enough rides to pass a couple of hours..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/delaware-veg
50,Fun for the kids !,"Went with low expectation but surprisingly my kids (10 and 7 years old) had a fantastic time here, they enjoyed the park more than Disneyland without the crowd and the snaky long queue. Get the all day unlimited ride wristbands, a better deal than just paying for the individual ride. Trust me, the kids loved the rides so much that they got onto it multiple times, making the deal more worthy. Most of the rides are more for kiddies but that doesn't stop the adults from having fun too with the gorgeous beach, dining, stalls and entertainment. Just walking around the pier to soak in the carnival atmosphere is an enjoyable experience, remember to bring sunglasses, hats and sun-block.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sillypie
50,Almost as fun as Disney,"Okay, it's not Disney, but our family had a blast here! The setting is beautiful, right on the Santa Monica pier. We bought the all day unlimited ride wristbands, which considering the price of paying for each individual ride, was a great deal. The rides are awesome! And, the views from that gorgeous solar-powered ferris wheel are absolutely breathtaking! The light show on the ferris wheel is equally spectacular!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaym177
50,*Fun Fun Fun*,Fun day for the kids at the Santa Monica pier after entering the park to eat ice cream all the kids scream we need to go on the big wheel and play with the rides so we end up spending around 3 hours inside the park and it's must visit if you got kids in your trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GENA2010
50,Love to walk here - day and night,"A pier to enjoy and remember. Fun fun zone, unique Ferris Wheel, if you like to fish or watch someone fish - almost always someone at the end of the pier, diverse vendors - and then there's the Famous Carousel - The Sting. Wide range of dining, games. Nothing like walking on top of the ocean and listening to the waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/askworldtraveler
40,A fun family evening,"The ambience at night with the lights is awesome. Rides for the little ones as well as the bigger ones. Most of them really weren't for me so I just got a ticket for the rollercoaster and unlimited wrist bands for the kids. Rollercoaster was fun and you get a great view of the pier and the beach, got a second go around as not a busy night. We purchased a ride photo of us on the rollercoaster - great souvenir :) The scrambler looks really fast, but my kids enjoyed it. Big variety of food nearby. Total novelty for us Aussies to be in an amusement park on a pier over the ocean - we don't have anything like this at home :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4Fun2014
50,Great for everything,"Take a whiff of the Pacific Ocean! People are fishing, basking in the sun, building sand castles, flying kites and frolicking in the water right next to you.I've always gone to Santa Monica Pier, it's conveniently located by los angeles, and walking distance of 3rd Street Promenade. It's also festive and great for tourists. In the past, I've walked around the pier numerous times, played some arcade, gone on the ferris wheel and roller coaster. However, it was all too overpriced for what it is. Rides are not cheap. Their arcade selection is mediocre, nothing you can't get at D&Bs. The ferris wheel is awesome and its psychedelic lights are solar powered!Found street parking on Ocean. A good amount of human traffic when we got there, fortunately, lines were not too long. The only one we had to line up for was the ferris wheel the first time, for only about 10 minutes. We went right after dinner and went on Inkie's Scrambler first since it had no line. Very dizzy, made me want to yak. The fact that I was taking photos on the ride contributed to that.Secondly the Pacific Plunge. Not too high of a 9-story drop, but it's not as kiddy as it seems! It does come down a couple times. Played some carnival games after, that's always fun, albeit $$Lined up for the Ferris Wheel, where a women was puking her hearts out before the photos, probably the Inkie Scrambler. So you have been warned! A very cheesy photo, but the Ferris Wheel is great. No windows, just the ocean breeze. Going there during the summer meant it was comfortably cool. Great views of the park and you have the pacific ocean as your backdrop. breathtaking! Definitely regret only going on it twice!The rollercoaster was speedy at 35mph but relatively short of a ride, they let us go on a second time so that was nice of them, and I was snapping away again!The pirate ship could also be nauseating for some. it does rotate nearly 180 degrees when you sit at the top. Not for the faint of heart kids. My butt was airbourne every time we were at the top. Pretty decent ride time, as my boyfriend felt himself getting sick after.***Tip: For the pacific plunge, I really enjoyed the ocean view. Some games offer wristband special.Favourites: Ferris wheel is a must! very photogenic place. Lack of linesDo not want: coffee bean is a little overpriced. Rides and games are overpricedLast words: Take a date, your kids here. Tourists trap but a tourist must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faerie87
50,Great day out,We went to kill a day as we had an unexpected layover in California. Bought an unlimited wristband at the ticket booth and went on everything. Great photos of the beach from the Ferris Wheel. The rollercoaster they let you stay on for a second go if the queue is short. You can wander out and get a bite to eat and come back for more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittleMissTasha
40,Great for the Kids,"Get an unlimited pass and your kids might actually behave. The rides are great, the staff is clean, the location is superb...check it out, ride the Ferris wheel, win a prize!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danzaviva
40,Great fun!,"Rode the ferris wheel with my wife when we were there as part of our 30th anniversary celebrations. It was perhaps a little pricey at six bucks each, but we only wanted to do this one ride. You can buy multiple tickets or an unlimited wristband if you want to do more. Good old-fashioned fun on the pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TOM-C--LIVERPOOL
40,Great for families,"Went with my wife in July 2014Had fun in the roller coaster and enjoyed the great view!It's best suited for families with kids, otherwise give it about 1 hour tops and move on to one of the beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EladAvigan
40,A Day with the Kids or a Ride with a Date,"The wristband that allows for unlimited rides, pays for itself after about three or four rids. The rides are big enough to be fun for both kids and adults and even smaller kids can ride the bigger rides when a taller kid or adult rides with them.Easy to google ""Pacific Park Discounts"" and find/ print up a %10 off coupon good for up to 4 people per coupon.Open late and the entire Pier, Beach and even Venice Beach is there to make a full day event out of going there. The staff are friendly... not often the case in SoCal, and the lines move quickly compared to most amusement parks.Also nice to just take a date on the Ferris Wheel at sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat

20,limited childrens funfair,"Pacific Park is just a small funfair, mainly geared towards children, on the Santa Monica Pier. Even the roller coaster (West Coaster) is little more than a kiddie coasterI don't feel it would even keep children amused for long",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_fatdonut

40,Summer vacation,This location was one of our stops on our road trip from Texas to California. We enjoyed the boardwalk and entertainment. We ate funnel cakes and pizza while watching the various performers. Our boys ages 10 & 12 enjoyed the rides and arcade. The beach was crowded as well as the walk onto the boardwalk. There was plenty of seating and beautiful views of the ocean. We made many memories and enjoyed this day trip to Santa Monica one of the many various locations we visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonR288

40,Good views,$6 per ride is a little expensive but definitely worth it for the roller coaster even though it was dodgy at times and the amazing views from the Ferris wheel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Altomatum
50,Get scrambled on the pier.,"Pacific Park is located on the Santa Monica pier. You can actually ride rides on planks over the ocean. The rides are a little pricey but jeez, on a pier? Why wouldn't you? Get yourself on the Pacific Wheel. Its the Ferris wheel and its a west side icon. We also love the scrambler. its fun. We also love to go down there on our day off and play foosball and air hockey. Great people watching on the pier as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackS181
40,lots of fun,"This place is lots of fun for those who are looking for an amusement park. This location is a little small and fairly crowded on the weekends. It is better on the week days. They have some nice rides to fit anyone's fancy. There is a large ferris wheel, there is a small roller coaster and some smaller rides that can be stomach turning.There are lots of lights and carnival like food. The lines seem to be doable. We waited about 15 minutes to get on the Ferris Wheel, but not long for the roller coaster.Keep in mind that this park is on the pier and thus is limited in size. If you think you are going to be able to entertain yourself on the rides for 10 hours, you won't be able to. It will take 2 maybe 3 hours if you ride the rides multiple times and then you will likely be through. There are carnival games like throwing baseballs in buckets or basketballs in baskets too. After that, there is always the beach:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/battmast
50,A Magical blast from the past,"Pacific Park at the Santa Monica Pier is a whimsical blast from the past. Make sure if you don't like crowds, you go on a week day. The Magical vintage carousel will just transport you to older, simpler times...The rides are so fun and if you're into it and have children, make sure to stop by the local Aquarium underneath it. Stay for Sunset: It'll be a moment you'll forever hold in your heart!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alikeller7
40,a very nice place to spend a couple of hours,"This place has very good beach. But if you're tired of spending time on the beach, they have a lot of fun stuff to do on their huge pier.First a tip on parking: if you're spending only an hour or two, you can pay $3 per hour. Use the parking right next to the pier. If you use other parking a few blocks north, they charge $12 flat.There is a nice boardwalk next to the beach with restrooms.Overall a very lively place for a family. We enjoyed our visit. Had some dippin dots on our way back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaryDesi
30,"Fun, but Small","Pacific Park on the Santa Monica Pier is fun for about an hour or so. You can buy ride tickets or get a wrist band (which is worthwhile if you plan to ride the rides more than once). There is a big kid area and a little kid area. My kids really enjoyed the roller coaster, but were done within a couple hours. It's sort of expensive especially considering the parking cost ($12 in 2014). After the kids were done with the rides, we went to the beach and they played in the water for the rest of the day. I think they enjoyed the water better than the rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoofamily
40,Fun on the Pier,"The rides were very fun especially the ferris wheel. The views were absolutely amazing! We rode the roller coaster too. It was fun but nothing extremely memorable. Those were the only rides we made and like I said, the views were worth every penny spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamablum
40,Fun- & Action-Packed,"This small amusement park is fun packed for the whole family. It’s small all right, being on the pier, but makes for perfect entertainment. Its food court is a great chance to get food that is NOT as overprices as the restaurants on the pier. Ok, it’s fast food, but still highly recommendable for a quick snack and especially drink during the day.

40,Nice time,"It's a nice park located at the Santa Monica pier, wish we went earlier and got to go on the beach because it looked so great. The park was nice And had games and rides, it is very chilly so bring sweaters for sure. We had to buy one there because it was so cold. Go if you get a chance it is a good attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fareesha
30,"OK place, good for an hour or so, if there are kids in your group.","lots of different rides, a small roller coaster as well. this place is unique since its on the pier with great view all around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/135a
10,Why do you close so early???,"My wife and I tried to ride the ferris wheel on the pier, but we arrived about 7:40PM and were told that they were closing for the night. Supposedly, they run through 8PM, but the ticket office was already closed when we arrived, and they wouldn't let us pay to do the ride. Why on earth would a tourist attraction like this close so early???",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradleybeers
50,Unique and must try once,If you are in santa monica you must try the ferris wheel and the roller coaster. Great views from the ferris wheel and why not ride a roller coaster over the ocean. It also has an arcade and many skills game to win prices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frogster14
30,"Looks great, offers less",The rollercoaster is a lot of fun (as an experience and to get a nice view) but there are few attractions and it's rather expensive.Take a stroll through the park instead and enjoy just being there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/42hannap
30,Typical carnival rides,"It's neat that it's all on a Pier. It was very busy when we were there. Apparently it was school break for kids (we're from out of country so we did not know this), so maybe it would have been better on another week when the crowds weren't so big. Ferris Wheel is a must for the views. Other wise, just your typical carnival rides and screaming kids;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roblyn0718

30,"Fun place to go, especially for kids.","It's like a mini-amusement park on a pier. I bet kids would have a lot of fun here. Everyone's gotta do the ferris wheel though, right? Between parking and the cost for the rides, it's not cheap. Nice to walk all the way down the pier though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizGage
40,Great little amusement park with fabulous ocean views,"Pacific Park is the little amusement park that could. It's what every beach city should have. Located on the Santa Monica Pier, this local gem includes a roller coaster, lots of games, cotton candy and the nation's first solar-powered ferris wheel. The ferris wheel at dusk is a must. The lights are a glow, the views of the Santa Monica mountains, Pacific Ocean, City of Santa Monica and beach are second to none. You can stroll the Park for free. Tickets for the rides are all very affordable and family passes are available. It's a fun outing for all ages. Even the City of Santa Monica staff chose this location for their annual holiday parties! It's where the locals enjoy going, too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/88jet88
40,Nice experience,My boyfriend and I are here from miami celebrating my bday and anniversary. It felt like the best date night ever. It is so beautiful at night. You get a view of the pier AND pacific park. The arcade is alright. Games outdated. It was still fun though. The rides were fun. Carnival games were fun too. Its like a mini fair. Definitely going back before we leave.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshleyBiancaJ
40,Good family fun!,"The rides looked really fun. We sent our nephew on them, and he loved them. I thought the pricing was appropriate for the location. No entry fee, just a ride fee. The only thing I didn’t like was the condition of the pier. The boards were very uneven and difficult to push a stroller over. It looked like they were beginning a year-long process for repairs and upgrades. I would like to come back after it’s done to re-review. Other than that, it was a very pleasant visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DW-Surprise
50,Incredible views from fun park,"Our family of 8, 4 adults and 4 kids 2-6 stopped off here on our way from Long Beach to Santa Barbara during our recent vacation. Lots of fun rides for kids and beautiful beach and views to make the experience extra pleasant. We didn't realize you could park right there by the venue, so we wasted a bunch of time driving around the busy city blocks before figuring out that parking was not only close by, but also reasonable!! We recommend this as a fun afternoon adventure for the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flowerfriendly
40,Great family rides,"Excellent amusement park for those who don't like really scary rides. Roller coaster was fun but not scary, Dragon boat was the most thrill. Ferris Wheel views were to die for! Be sure to book ahead online or get AAA discount for wristband.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/244path
40,Old style American amusements!,"We visited here during a day trip to Santa Monica. The rides aren't anything nail biting, but me and my family loved the authentic feel of the place. Went on the big wheel, it's a must for great views of the Pacific and over the beach. Also liked all the photo booths dotted around to commemorate the visit. I loved the park, although we didn't go on many rides, the whole park just makes you feel like you're in an old style movie!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KMxGlasgow
40,Lots of fun,My children aged 15 & 12 loved this little amusement park. They wouldn't have enough of the rides. Being just next to the ocean is simply magic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AstridArrow
50,A must do and see,"The rides aren't thrillers, but there's just something about the old school feel of this a theme park on a pier that needs experienced. Bring your credit card, it's not cheap to ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/memphomomma
30,"Safe and clean, includes a refreshing stroll on the pier","Has the look and feel of an East Coast 'Atlantic City' atmosphere with essential California touches, such as year-round comfort. The Santa Monica pier is clean and safe for all adults and supervised children to take a refreshing stroll about ⅓ of a mile out over the Ocean. There are just the right amount of souvenir shops and other attractions. I did detect the odor of marijuana but there were no apparent problems during our two-hour visit. An official-looking person confirmed my guess that most law enforcement on the pier were plain-clothes.Parking is both expensive and rare here and I would encourage leaving your car several blocks away or use public transit. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and could almost hear the late, great Tejano music icon Selena swaying to the Bidi Bidi Bom Bom beat, where its music video was actually filmed. There is also a Route 66 monument noting the final few feet of The Mother Road.My primary complaint was that fast food on the pier was of poor quality and way over-priced. A hamburger joint near the roller coaster entrance totally messed up our order for which we waited nearly 30 minutes. It really wasn't that crowded. I recommend that for food, you stick to the few real restaurants on the pier, back on shore or in the nearby 3rd St Promenade area. Bottom line: Great for families, free fun, fine views and party atmosphere. Not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonkeyOnTheWing
30,"Fun simple rides, better for young kids",My teens got bracelets and enjoyed but a couple hours was enough for them. Lots of little kid rides and things to see on the pier though. The ferris wheel was especially fun when it lit up at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMF568
20,A place for families with kids,"We just walked around in the park. We didn't take any rides as they were not exciting enough. They were just too ordinary and too boring. If you had been a visitor of some big theme parks, such as Disney Land and Ocean Park, Pacific Park might be not your cup of tea. I might be too old to have fun there.One thing good about this park is that that you can buy food and drinks inside the park. There are some restaurants where you could see beautiful scenic views. Having fun from the rides is not the only thing that you can do there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diana_Chow

10,Only just bearable,"Awful really. Packed, pricy, tacky, not that clean. We went the week between Xmas and New Year. Queued for an age for tx for rides then queued longer for actual ride. Compared to other ""piers of the world"", leave it out. Views OF the pier from elsewhere iconic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WenchOnABench
50,Fun rides,"Lots of fun rides. It was very crowded, but really nice to be out on the water. The ferris wheel was so much fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosangelasx80
30,Pricey With Not Much To Do,"We visited Pacific Park on a recent trip to CA primarily to ride the coaster. The first issue we had was finding parking. There is a lot of beach parking nearby but almost all of it closes very early even though the pier is open late, so it took us about 45 minutes to find somewhere that we could actually park.Pacific Park does not charge an admission - it is simply pay per ride or you can get an all-day wristband. We chose to pay per ride since we were only there to ride one ride. While it was not too bad for just one ride, if you were riding multiple rides, either option would add up fast. The wristbands are expensive and there really are not many rides in the park - take into account that you probably don't want to ride every single one of them over and over and the value drops significantly.There was only one place to purchase tickets/wristbands that we found. The line was long and they moved pretty slowly. After getting our tickets, we had a difficult time finding the entrance to the coaster because of how cramped and oddly laid out the park is. Everything is right on top of everything else and when it is busy, it is difficult to find your way around (and to actually get through once you know where you're going).Another issue was the lack of a gift shop or any merchandise. There was no Pacific Park merchandise to be found anywhere and when I asked multiple employees, none of them were even sure whether there was a gift shop or not (turns out, there is not).The park is very picturesque with a beautiful setting at the pier. With some decent crowd control and better pricing, I think this would be a really nice seaside park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swacer
50,So much fun!,"This place was so much fun!! It's basically like a huge carnival but with the Santa Monica Beach right next door!! The views were amazing!! There were rides for my toddler, teen and my hubby and I. We enjoyed this very much! The food was also good!! The tickets are purchased 4 to a ride or you can purchase the bracelet and ride unlimited rides for unlimited times worth the extra!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rocharocha2018
30,So overpriced,"I guess you're paying for the experience... I don't know. It's not that we didn't have fun, but it came with a price! $25 for 4 kids and 2 adults to ride the Ferris wheel, another $20 for 3 kids and 1 adult to ride the not-so-thrillng and very short ""roller coaster"", and $12 for 4 kids to ride the little kids bumper cars (Which I didn't think was such a bad value.). And that would've been fine if the rides were exceptional, but they really weren't. Maybe we're spoiled, we do frequently visit a lot of great theme parks. I guess if you've never ridden a roller coaster or Ferris wheel before you'd think this was great, but it just seemed over priced to me and not really worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCBosh
50,great time at the park and beach,"If you plan on going on the rides, definitely stop by a local Costco. You can buy unlimited ride passes for 2/$25. You will exchange these at Pacific Park for the actual wristband. You do not have to use both of them on the same day. If you have an odd number of people, you can save one for another day. They might expire, so make sure you know when you must use these passes. I would divide the rides into 3 different sections. There's the kiddie section with about 6 rides. There's 3 rides that I think the older kids (9+) would enjoy. But most are for the 5-10 year olds. The roller coaster is very mild, but still fun if you have little ones. Weekdays in the summer are busy with all the nearby day camps. Weekends get busy in the afternoon. Parking at the nearby lots are more expensive on the weekends. Food at the pier is expensive, so if you can, pack a lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustAMomOf2

30,Kids enjoyed it!,Nice little amusement park. You can purchase an all day ticket or individual ride tickets. We decided to go with the individual rides because the kids only wanted to ride 3 rides. I think there approximately 15 rides all together. It was a nice day and the kids enjoyed it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/we_out
40,Very fun :),"I had a lot of fun at Pacific Park. There was good food and I had a great time. The only downside is that if you dont like spinny rides, there is not much to do. I only rode the roller coaster and ferris wheel. That plus eating and walking around lasted a few hours so it's all ok. :) You definately can't go to Santa Monica or Venice without going here though. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurenG107
40,Great for kids,"We just returned from a vacation to LA to visit our 9 year old twin grand daughters. We took them to Pacific Park on the Santa Monica pier. It is crowded and while there is not an admission charge it is a little pricy. The rides are expensive & the food is amusement park type food that is also overpriced. But, it is California. On a positive note the kids had a great time. It was fun walking the entire length (365 ft long) & was a nice walk to the end to watch the fisherman trying to land a big one. The beach is nice and well groomed with lifeguards on duty. You can rent bikes to ride on nice bike paths. There is a Bubba Bumps restaurant on the pier if you want a sit down place to eat that is quite nice with great ocean views. The end of the pier has a sit down restraint also. I would recommend the park for kids of all sizes & adults to. There is also ample parking close by but try to arrive before noon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daler225

40,"We had a fun evening with a 5 year old girl, be sure to see the Merry-Go-Round, too","Wanting to spare a 5 year old girl from a tedious dinner at a local fancy restaurant, we volunteered to take her to the Santa Monica Pier for the evening. We all had a great time, starting with a couple of rides on the carousel - you must take a look at the beautifully restored horses on the Merry-Go-Round.Like many evening near the coast, a heavy wind and fog arrived, sweater weather, and miss 5 year old did not have a sweater. No problem, I found a pretty pink sweater for sale on the pier at a fair price. Next stop: the arcade games, then a bouncing good time on a big Trampoline, a roller-coaster ride, and of course the Ferris Wheel.A good time was had by all. My one complaint: The Pier Restrooms should be cleaned more often - our five-year old demanded a changed of clothes after her skirt touched the smelly floor of the pier privy.RIdes are priced between $3 to $5, and all -day passes are sold for about $14 (children), $20 (adults). Check Costco or other discounters for special pricing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappySurfer

30,"Crowded and touristy, but fun once","This is one of those things we always saw when we went to the Santa Monica pier, but never did. We lived here, and assumed it was too touristy. Upon visiting back we thought the roller coaster was one of those things you have to do once. It's the trademark look of the pier along with the Ferris wheel. To our pleasant surprise a ticket to ride was only $5 which we thought was more than reasonable. You even get to ride the coaster twice. The only downside, and its a big one, is the line. We went on a weekend which was not the best idea and it was packed. We waited about 45 minutes to ride the coaster, but we were in good spirits so we didn't let that get us down. It's one of those things you have to try once and then not again. The biggest plus side is that the prices are surprisingly affordable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HanKelly
30,It's one of those places you experience as a tourist - esp the kids!,"I can't say this place is great or bad but I think when traveling with kids it is very easy to get caught up in the excitement of being on the world famous Santa Monica Pier so yes, for the memories, ride the ferris wheel and rollercoaster. The old school arcade is also a lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dalessiopietro
40,I saw the Space Shuttle go by here.,"Pacific Park is on the Santa Monica Pier...it has a Roller Coaster, Ferris Wheel, and tons of other rides, plus a ton of carnival type food. You buy a certain amount of tickets at a ticket booth that you use towards the attractions you want to ride. The Ferris Wheel is very cool as you get a view of the entire city and into West Los Angeles, plus the ocean. It is one way to enjoy Santa Monica Pier. There is an arcade right next door for kids to play video games. The beach is right below you, The Lobster restaurant is on one end of the Pier, plus there is Mariasol, Bubba Gump Shrimp, and tons of easy quick food. Pacific Park is a landmark that is seen in multiple movies and television shows, who hasn't seen the Ferris Wheel in Iron Man? I saw the Space Shuttle Endeavor fly over from here, it was incredible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/651CathyA
50,Pacific Park has some pretty good rides,My aunt and I arrived at Pacific Park early enough where there weren't a lot of people. We rode the Pacific Wheel. Spectacular views from way above.

40,Pacific Park @ Santa Monica,"I have driven past this place at least 150 times over my lifetime in Southern California. So this time we decided to stop and take in all that the place had to offer. There are enough rides for ages 3 - 100 to enjoy. The area is small but you can enjoy the beach, views, attractions and food all in one central area. It is a bit pricey but if you are visiting from out of town, then I say you should at least take a walk on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michellee67
40,Family vacation,Pacific Park is located on Santa Monica Pier and is very similar to Sydney's Luna Park. The rides are approx US$5 each or you can buy an all day pass for approx US$20 which is better value for money. It's a nice safe place to visit with kids just be prepared to spend money on all the sideshow attractions. Nice place to visit after a day exploring LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quinnd69
30,No Big Deal,"Went to Santa Monica because it was a stopping point for other tours in the area. Stopped by Santa Monica Pier and Pacific Park because it was convenient. The ferris wheel lights make it very pretty at night, but the amusement park only has about 10 rides - and they are all either $4 or $5 per ride. Not worth it as a primary destination, but if you have a couple of hours to fill in, it is fun to walk the pier, eat at Pier Burgers, and get your feet wet at the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/278Helen1963278

Great place to kill a few hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luxbizman
40,Great for kids,It's a section of the Santa Monica pier that has a huge arcade and rides like a Ferris wheel and a small roller coaster. The rides and arcade do cost money but worth it. The views from the Ferris wheel are stunning!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bward27
30,Very crowded but beautiful view,We purchased a Groupon for 4 unlimited ride wristbands for $44. This is the only way I would do it.

They do offer all day wristbands which is probably a better way to go but in the winter, I wouldn't recommend it as it gets very cold at night. The food here is also overpriced and I think most parents tolerate the chaos but none really look all too happy to be here.

50,A must-do !,"This is the third time I am going there and I still love it. There are three main pieces of advice I can give you :1) Park in the public parking lot near 5th avenue, the first two hours are free (at least during the day for sure).2) If you want to have your money worth, plan to stay for at least 2 hours : you can buy a 25 dollars bracelet (not sure whether or not it is 20 or 25, but around those prices) that is valid for the main rides. If you go on 5 rides, you get you money worth.3) Make sure you know until what time it is open- one of the times I went there, it closed 10 mins after so the ticket booth-which closes 30 minutes before the park does-was not open.I loved the Ferris Wheel- it has a wonderful view. 5 people can go in a car and sit comfortably. The wait, when I went at night, was not even that bad. Maybe around sunset it'll be worse as people might try to catch the view of the Pacific ocean during the sunset.The roller-coaster is pretty mild. I sometimes get hazy from other ones but this one was not too bad, but good enough for me and my fiance to have fun :).However, the park might not be for people on a budget. I think it was 5 dollars per ride. If you go with someone, it's already $10. You can do the maths for a family of four and I can't imagine trying to do all of the attractions with 4 people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngieStevens

50,A hidden gem of Southern California!,"After shopping at Mitsuwa and Marukai with my sister and dad (my mom and brother went to Universal Studios) to get Pretty Cure candy toys, my dad suggested we look at the ocean. When we get out to look at the ocean, I spy an amusement park in the distance and ask to go there. We do, and we see all of these rides, games, and even an arcade. We were only limited to one ride during this visit, so I chose the roller coaster. It was awesome and went around twice. My sister went on the drop tower and I think she enjoyed it, especially when a boy on her ride said ""I regret this! Goodbye to you all!"" because the boy thought he would die on this ride. I would come here again, even though on this visit, I didn't ride all the rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshleyShimmer
30,"Great location, average rides","The locaion is much cooler than the actual attractions - I went on the ferris wheel and found out two things: 1. It's not very high, and the views are less interesting than I hoped and 2. They have some kind of policy that doesn't allow you to ride by yourself, and at the same time, they are hesitant to ask other people to let you join a cabin with them lest you destroy any romantic moments - but unfortunately, they only told me this when I already had my (pricey) ticket and was about to get on board. Luckily a father and daughter agreed to let them join me, but I think this policy should be announced whenever someone buys a single ticket - I guess this is some kind of suicide prevention concept but that may not be obvious to the non-suicidal visitors.To be honest, I found the neon lights more interesting when seen at night from the beach than the actual park. Maybe fun with kids (but expensive).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnkeS502
40,Old time fun,"Pacific Park on Santa Monica Pier doesn't have the huge, amazing rides one would find at a Six Flags but it has more of a carnival atmosphere. Be prepared to pay $10.00 to park on the pier. Great for skee ball, people watching, and strolling. Nice Mexican restaurant further up the pier, plus Bubba Gumps is there as well. Nice place to bring out of town guests for a taste of Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PasadenaTess
40,Fun Place to visit in LA,my husband and i enjoyed the rides and the pretty views of sta. monica beach. lines were long but moving kind of fast enough. we had a good time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristineW886
50,Ferris Wheel,The Ferris Wheel is awesome. It is so good to get up high and see around. Good amount of rides for all ages,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cdeeper
20,Don't waste your money on the full day wristband,"I paid for Pacific Park all inclusive wristbands for my children as part of the Go LA card - and even though they were discounted over the full price, I still decided they were a rip off. Not only is Pacific Park old and pretty average as far as pier amusement parks go, there are a number of rides on the pier (and part of Pacific Park) that are excluded from the all-day ticket.My kids rode on the roller coaster a couple of times, once on the ferris wheel (couldn't wait to get off), and a couple of times on the pirate ship, and that was about it. I think there were only about 2 other rides that were included in the ticket price.They paid additional money for a midway style ring toss game, and surprisingly won a huge 4-foot high stuffed gorilla - but it was made so cheaply that the stuffing was as hard as a rock and almost impossible to carry around so we ended up giving it away to a young family walking on the Pier, who were able to carry it on their baby stroller.If you or your kids want to go on any rides, pay for them individually. It is highly unlikely you will get good value out of the all day pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/780brettm
20,Overpriced Tourist Trap,Crowded and dirty but a good spot to people watch or take in the excellent coastal views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HB_CA_Native
40,Great for everyone!,This is definitely an experience that everyone can enjoy. The Pacific Wheel is a nice attraction that has a beautiful view at the top. I highly recommend it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divaheart06
30,Great way to spend an afternoon,"My family just spent the day at the Pacific Park, this was our second time here. We all had a great time. My children (5 & 7) love it here. There is a nice mix of rides so the kids can have fun, and some more adventurous rides for the big kid in us.The best ride, and if you do one, do this one, is the ferris wheel. It is a nice way to relax and you get some incredible views. If you like you can even get a souvenir picture for $16.There are midway games, and plenty of eating/snacks locations on the boardwalk.Unlimited ride wristband are $22 for adults and $16 for kids under 7. There are about 3 rides that are not included with the wristband, and you have to pay extra to ride. The wristband also does not include the midway games.My only negative comment about the park is the staff. Some of the employees look like they don't care about their jobs or if you are having a good time or not. No smiles or greetings, some of them look as if they are being forced to work there. Other than that everything else is very fun.I would definitely recommend this park to my family and friends, and we look forward to retuning soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SNAFU23
50,Great Fun & Great Views,"The pier is just the greatest thing about Santa Monica for me. The sights and sounds are fantastic. We start our days on the pier and finish our days on the pier when in Santa Monica! Check out the guy playing piano in the mornings, Terry Prince. Watch the sea and listen to TP, a great way to start the day! People are so friendly in California, we can't wait to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smasher1
40,Love the Place,"From the amazing sights from the Ferris Wheel, and the sunshine, I have never had a bad experience at Pacific Park. Even the Hot Dog on A stick is tasty. Also there's always something to watch at Muscle Beach, a film crew or two knocking around, and, if your lucky, the odd celeb! Can't wait to go back there later in the year",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310GeorgeH
40,ok little amusement park,on santa monica pier. Nothing special but a way to pass time with little kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chingachgook
40,Great Views from Ferris Wheel!,"Pacific Park is a pretty cool amusement park. The Ferris wheel was brilliant! the views from the top are the best! The staff are friendly too. the West Coaster (name of the roller-coaster) operator let us go around twice because there wasn't many other people in line waiting, which was nice of him. Make sure you take your camera because there are some great photo opportunities. Also bring a lot of cash, there are some cool arcade games as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/284BrianT
40,A nostalgic return to a great amusement park in a great location!,"Easy to find, easy to visit, OK parking, and plenty of fun for families with kids! One of my spouse's relatives was one of the management team, but I would rate this venue the same even if the familial relationship did not exist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amercorp
50,The kids did not want to leave!,"The views are spectacular while you have fun on the rides. Definitely get the unlimited rides! You can walk up to the 3rd St Promenade for a little shopping and something to eat, and then come back and ride some more. Also, we just park in the main lot at the pier. It's $10 for all day.At the park, the unlimited rides are 21.95 / 8 & over and 15.95 /7 yrs & under.Online (http://www.pacpark.com/), there is a discount ... $18.95 / 8 & over and $13.95 / 7 yrs & under.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calgal405
40,Charming!,"I don't understand some of the negative reviews below. What were those people expecting, Disneyland? The Santa Monica pier is charming and good fun! Some of the rides were expensive, but the Ferris Wheel offered great views and it was very romantic, despite the chilly september night. We played air hockey, and my finger got squished! So we ran to stall where the hubby got a corndog and some ice for my pinky. Still I managed to beat him at basketball with 26-12! Old-fashioned entertaintment, and there is even a display that tells the history of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoisonedIvy

30,A theme park on a pier,"It's quaint and charming, but not impressive. It seems like a lot of local teens hang out there. It has games and rides. The roller coaster is fun enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppetgirldotnet
30,Good for a old dirty amusement park,This place would be extremely better if they would clean up the place. The place needs more adequate lighting and the rides need to be updated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmarquez99
50,Views are great,Brilliant views from the top of the ferris wheel. We had a ball in Santa Monica and Venice beach. Hire a bike and go for a ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/252michaelc
30,Decent park,They have wristbands to let you ride all day long and it pretty much rocks. The coaster is a kiddie coaster but they let you ride twice and blow snow on you as you climb the lift hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grangerdanger
50,"More than just an Amusement Park, left a deep impression!!!","We timed to go there at 3+ in the afternoon on a Saturday. Perfect! Had time to walk around, ate some food, enjoyed the breeze & saw the spectular sunset at 4.45pm. In fact, we captured the sunset moments in our camera - Sunset Moments In Santa Monica!!!With the December wind from the ocean, it was cold but we were prepared with layers which included a good windbreaker so as to enjoy ourselves. The park is very clean & looks stunning when the lights are turned on. The rides were enjoyable. Pacific Park left a deep mark in our memory & we will remember this place in a long long time. Will definitely come back when we do visit LA again!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyFamilySingapore
30,Pacific Park has lost its shine,"When I was younger and living in LA, I always loved going to Pacific Park. There was something magical about it. Now I am not so sure. It seemed noisy, over-crowded with both people and games, and generally worn out. My fiance and I are big fans of Skee-Ball, and the Skee-Ball machines kept breaking. I don't enjoy having to hunt down the repair man after every 3-4 games because it ate my money. And I am fairly certain that the equipment was not keeping proper track of the scores. Anyway, at $0.50 per play, I think it's worth a couple bucks, but not to spend a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisono_11
40,"Lots of rides, might as well get a wristband","This park was perfect for the kids. Good number of rides, that my just newly 42"" daughter could ride alone. Nice little roller coaster. We definitely got our money out of the rides. If you don't buy the wristband, you will spend $5 per ride for bigger rides, and $3 per ride for smaller rides. My kids rode the drop ride, 5 times alone. And then there were cool little bumper cars for little kids, girls loved that as well. Nice place, well kept and clean. Good restrooms. Would recommend it for families. The pier also has this beautiful carousel, For $1 per kid, it was worth it. So nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null
50,Pacific Park Rocks!,"Pacific Park is amazing. We can make a family day out of it and take our young children, or have a romantic night with just my husband and I, or a girls night out with my friend. Whatever you decide to do there, it will be fun. I highly recommend getting the unlimited ride wristbands, and also getting dinner and a margarita at the restaurant at the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PSPhotography
40,A Fun way to spend the afternoon!,"Yes, if you are comparing this place to Disneyland, it will come out on the short end... but if you look at it for what it is, it was a nice way to spend the afternoon. As we were walking up to the pier after picnicking in the park, my three boys (ages 9, 6, and 4) said, ""Wouldn't it be great if we could go on those rides?"" with a wishful note in their voices. And even though I'd pre-purchased our wristband tickets on-line, I said, ""I think we could arrange it, if you really want to!"" Of course they jumped up and down with excitement and anticipation, and I felt like the world's best mom.So I explained we could only do a few rides, but their favorite was the roller coaster and the bumper cars so they didn't mind missing the climbing wall or the bungee jump that wasn't included in the wristband. They did all the rides they wanted for as many times as they wanted, we shared a funnel cake, and they all had a great time.I had read the reviews here before I went so I was prepared for homeless people, but I didn't notice any. I did let the boys play 2 games each, explaining beforehand that the game was geared for us to lose, so the fun is in trying, so they didn't care if they lost, and they were glad they got to try.I liked the history lesson in pictures near the end of the pier (although not part of Pacific Park). There is no entrance fee to the Pier so if you only wanted to ride the ferris wheel, for instance, you could for $5 each. The Pier is the official end of Route 66, so it was fun to have our picture taken by the sign.The weather was perfect, the scenery spectacular (especially from the top of the ferris wheel), and the shark necklaces near the beginning of the pier were cheap ($5.50) but fun souvenirs of our day at the World Famous Santa Monica Pier.Special note: We spent some time playing in the waves to the north of the pier afterwards and although the boys had wonderful fun, we all had some tar attached to our body when we left (and I didn't even get in the water). It was sticky and smelled like oil, so water shoes might have prevented a messy clean-up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgn5cs
50,Amazing place to have a teen birthday party!,"I've lived in LA for 25 years and when my daughter wanted to celebrate her 13th birthday here I almost collapsed because I couldn't think of a worse place to spend my Friday night. Boy was I wrong. Not only are the party planning sevices amazing, the cost was incredibley reasonalbe for a private cabana and a person that helps you with everything and stays with the party all night. I even paid the extra $50 to have my daughters name light up the Ferris Wheel for the entire night. Because the kids are 13 we let them run around on their own. The general pier atmosphere has been entirely cleaned up and we felt very very safe letting the kids run around on their own especially because they always had a place to come back and hang. This ended up being the best and easiest party we ever through for our daughter and she and her friends were ecstatic. Even ""Inky"" the Octopus came by to say hello which the teens loved believe it or not! I would highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for an easy place to have a party. Now every time we drive by the Santa Monica pier it will always have a special meaning to her!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yellowsunfish61
40,A fun time.,"Our family purchased the GO Card:Los Angeles while on a recent trip to California. One of the attractions included with this card was Pacific Park. After enjoying lunch at Bubba Gump's, our family redeemed their ride all day passes for the park while waiting for our Starline Tour. The rides are very expensive when purchased individually. We probably would not have purchased tickets or passes if we had to pay for them without a discount, but this attraction was well worth the cost because it was included in the cost of the GO Card. We enjoyed hopping on quite a few rides for about an hour and a half. It was a good time filler before our next attraction. Look into purchasing a GO Card while in Los Angeles (and other major cities). You can do as many attractions in a day as you can fit for one low price. We visited three major attractions for about $70 which would have cost us well over $100 if purchased seperately.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Margie123789
10,Beware the Birthday Party Rip-off,"A birthday party at the Santa Monica Pier sounded like a great idea for our 6 year old's party. We inquired via phone, only to get an answering machine message that directed us to their website. At first look the prices aren't too bad so we went ahead and booked our party online.That is when things turned for the worst. Regardless of which package(s) you choose you will have an 18% service fee added to the total bill. I am familiar with extra charges if certain number thresholds are met, not the case here. They have minimums and if you meet them they will still charge you the 18%. On top of all this they have a nasty policy of refunding none of the required 50% deposit.The ride wristbands don't work for ""games"" or ""special rides"" like rock climbing or the bungy bounce.Why they don't advertise the actual price is to begin with.Why do they need to keep our entire deposit when we try to cancel 2 weeks in advance. The pier did not purchase anything special for us or have any expenses due to our plans.In closing it is sad to see a place promote itself as family friendly while it engages in predatory and deceptive practices. Shame on them. Lesson learned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eXploreSantaMonica
40,Nice to Visit,"Pacific Park has more rides geared towards children, so if you are a couple in your 20's and 30's with no children, there isn't too much to ride. We rode the ferris wheel (had to ride it after seeing it so many times on TV) and the roller coaster. The roller coaster wasn't much, but I wanted to say that I rode a roller coaster on a pier in my lifetime. The rides were a bit pricey, but sometimes you can find deals or buy an all-day pass if you are going to ride on lots of rides. We just purchased individual tickets since we were only riding on the two rides. Overall, it's a better place for children since many of the rides are like carnival rides, but I would greatly recommend the ferris wheel to everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pilotgirl21
40,Nice for an afternoon,"The park is well maintained. We felt the ride tickets were pricey, there wasn't much variety and there is a parking fee as well. But the beach and restrooms were clean. Ride the ferris wheel and you'll get fabulous views of the ocean. There were performers on the pier, some entertaining, others not so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PRprincess76
40,A few rides for something to do with younger children 6-14.,"I was here Halloween eve. It shut down a bit early due to a small crowd. I was there the last 2 hours and could ride any of the 6 rides as often and sit about where I wanted to everytime. It has a Ferris Wheel, Plunger, Mixer, Dragon that swings back and forth, a roller coaster that goes around (not upside down and only 3 time a bump or speed) and also 1 other ride. They have many throw the ring- darts- prize winning stations. I recommend the unlimited ride if you are able to ride more the 4 rides.The arcade was quite busy later in the evening. It is right on the beach and a in a pleasant area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IvanDF
20,Nickle and Dime You and Rude Staff,"We bought the Internet special through AAA--$12.95 but only for two kids for unlimited rides. They make you buy more tickets for the rides for adults if the kids are don't meet the height requirement for some rides. At $5 for some of the larger rides, this adds up. The staff was also rude to my 7 year old niece because she was wearing flip flops in which a lot of other folks were wearing as well. Earlier in the day, no one said anything. She wouldn't let her on the ride after waiting for about 10 minutes. Then, one of the wrist bands for unlimited rides got torn and the date was not legible so this idiot told my other niece that she was ""disqualified"" as well. (They could’ve suggested going to the ticket booth to check the scan to see if we did purchase them that day—it felt like they were accusing us of trying to get on rides for free). There are some really young or lousy people working the rides. We talked to management and they had the attitude that the workers are always right. Far from the treatment we received at Disneyland the day before where they want you to be happy. Also, like other games at carnivals, stay away from them. They are a rip off. I recommend not bringing your kids to this place based on our experience. Stay at the beach and enjoy the pier but don’t waste your time and money at Pacific Park. Bottom Line: Unfair and not suitable for kids unless you like to see them cry and being treated badly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skeets22
40,Day at the pier,"I have gone to the pier with my own child many times over the years and I have also taken several of my students there as well. (5 year olds) I guess because I live in the San Fernando Valley I am used to seeing all types of people all of the time. I love the pier, and have never felt frightened or in danger. Things are a bit overpriced to be sure, as are all amusement parks and attractions, but I usually get unlimited ride passes online for half price, and we always have a great time.And as a side note, last time I went with 4 little girls there were several children with an octopus stuffed animal, which is the park mascot. They were not for sale and part of a private birthday party package/goody bag. When I asked the employee if they had any we could buy, he went back and brought four of them for my students. They were thrilled.My experiences have always been pleasant and about what I would expect in an urban area with a diverse population.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissMichellerenee
30,OK,"We went to the pier over Easter break on a weekday. We pre-paid for our tickets over the internet and received the internet special rate (as advertised on television): $10 per person for unlimited rides. There are about 5 or 6 rides for older children, so $10 is a very reasonable price.The pier is not necessarily the nicest place. It does attract unusual types. I had been last year and there were definitely gang-types. This year, to avoid gang members, we went early in the day and only stayed a few hours.This year (unlike the previous year) lines were almost non-existent.I wouldn't put the pier on the top of things to do while in Santa Monica. But if you have children and can get there early, the children can spend a few hours having fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearless802728
10,What a scary dump!,"We had heard so much about the Santa Monica Pier that we made it a part of our LA trip. The Pier is a disgrace, and Pacific Park is the ugliest, dirtiest, most unfriendly rip off EVER! The rides are a joke, the games are worse than those at a roadside carnival, and IT IS INFESTED WITH GANGS.What a shame - they should tear it down and leave that poor pier alone.NEVER GO THERE AT NIGHT!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightseer5655
