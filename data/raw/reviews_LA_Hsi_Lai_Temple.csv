50,Serene and beautiful,"I am not religious, but consider myself to be very spiritual. I was totally lost in myself as I walked around the grounds here. I had politely declined the audio tour, as I like to look, see, read and ingest. The atmosphere was calm, serene and peaceful.There are a lot of stairs, but after taking them on, I felt good in myself (there is a lift / elevator for the less able) the architecture and statues were simply stunning, and the view is one that money could not buy.They offer a simpe vegetarian lunch (only $8) so you can sit and rest for a while, before carrying on your journey of discovery.Words will fail me as I try to describe the pictures, I hope I can be forgiven for this. No matter your race, creed, colour, orientation or religion, go visit, take time out of your life, and relax, enjoy the beauty.a life changing experience....",Surveyor47

50,Breathtaking Beaty!,"Our visit to His Lai Temple was somewhat of an afterthought. We took a day trip from LA to visit The Workman and Temple Family Homestead museum. We then stopped off at the Puente Hills Mall, which is ""Twin Pines Mall"" from Back to the Future. Looking at what else was around us, we decided to check out the His Lai Temple and am SO glad we did! It is breathtaking! The view up there is amazing and the first structure you get to is UNREAL! I thought that was it... but nope! You walk around the corner and then there is ANOTHER temple that dwarfs the first one! I'm as atheist as they come, so this wasn't a religious experience for me, but the beauty here is such that anyone can appreciate. There is plenty to do for all ages, and we didn't come close to taking advantage of all of it. We basically walked around to see what there is to see. The largest temple is unreal. They halve multiple cool fountains. There is a tea room and gift shop.I think it's important to know that they are open for the public and visitors are TOTALLY welcome. I've been a bit hesitant to visit some of the cool temples around at the risk of seeming like an intruder or outsider, but this place is TOTALLY welcoming and I think the tourist really help them out. Don't be afraid... check it out! They are kid friendly (within reason... we prepped our 4 year old, telling him that this whole place was a like a library and you need to be quiet and respectful - and it worked)! Check it out!",Michael T

Next to it is a cafeteria that serves vegan buffet for $8.00. There is free parking on the premises and surroundings. If you park on the street it would be a steep climb to the temple. Come early to avoid the crowd and to be able to take lots of solo photos. Taking pictures/videos are not allowed inside the temple, pagoda and cafeteria though. I would come back with friends and family.",Maria2628

50,"Peace, Tranquility & Good Food","If you want a real Chinese experience without the 15 hour plane ride - this is the place for you. It reminded me of temples I visited in China. I found a parking spot right up front on a Sunday at 1 p.m. I made a beeline to the Dining Hall to catch the buffet before it closed at 2:30. Itâ€™s located on the bottom floor directly under the Main Shrine. Iâ€™m a vegetarian and thought the food was delicious. I walked off my lunch taking in the grounds and enjoying the beautiful day. Various Buddhaâ€™s line each side of the courtyard. They each have a written description of who they are what they represent. I also went in the Main Shrine to pray and meditate. People were lighting incense and making offerings. No photos are allowed inside the Shrines. Also, itâ€™s best not to photograph the Monks you see walking around. Itâ€™s just out of respect. Please Dress appropriately. Remember this is a place of worship. There are many steps to the main Shrine. I advise walking them at an angle so you donâ€™t get tired. If youâ€™re ever looking for a new experience please consider taking the time to visit. It a tranquil, serene place tucked in the hillside but not far off the 60 freeway. I loved it and thatâ€™s my Big Fat Opinion.",Marty G

There is a front shrine (They called it ""Bodhisattva Hall"") and a main shrine. Many people didn't know there is another shrine after the front Bodhisattva Hall and totally missed it. Make sure you go pass the walkway by either side of the Bodhisattva Hall which leads you toward the courtyard where you will see the main shrine.",Janice C

I spent almost 4 hours here just absorbing all the different history of the different Buddhist deities and their background.The museum was also very nice with ample amount of exhibits. The dining hall that serves vegetarian meal was huge and the vegetarian buffet selection also looked pretty good.Although there were a lot of visitors when I was there, they kept the toilets and the grounds really clean.

There are English explanations on large boards here and there. My favorite part is going to the main building in the back to pray with incense. It's one free incense per person. It's very peaceful and view from the top is just gorgeous!There's also a vegetarian lunch buffet if you want to do that also. Please make sure that you eat everything that you take and not be wasteful.",caliiitrav

If you don't want that, you are free to walk around at your own pace, spend an hour or a day! On Sunday, you are welcome to take part in the ceremonies, services, chanting, classes. Out of respect, sleeveless tops and shorts are discouraged, but don't let that stop you from going! It is a very welcoming, friendly and upbeat place. Take a couple of rolls of pennies to try your luck at ""ringing the bell"" of fortune! Kids love this. Go hungry! Mon-Fri between 11:30-1:30, there is a vegetarian buffet that is different every time, but always very tasty with tempura veggies, soups, tea, rice, noodles, and some ""meats"" made from bean curd (it really tastes like meat!) If the kids are not veggie eaters, you can mention that and pay only a couple bucks for them. Be sure to be at the cafeteria by 11:30 to avoid the longest lines. On weekends, it is open from 11:30-2:30 and the dishes change as the meal goes on. Please go here! It is very worth it. No, I am not a Buddhist but this place is special!tasty. At $8 ""donation"" pp, you can't go wrong. If your kids won't eat veggies, preferring only the rice and or noodles, explain this at the desk and just pay a couple of dollars for them.

It is fascinating to come on weekends or during festivals that are posted on their website. However, my favorite time is to come during the week when there are very few people here. Parking is easy - not always the case on weekends or holidays. It is easy to walk around and enjoy the gardens and to sit quietly inside the temple. One of the special treats is lunch. It is an all-you-can-eat vegan buffet that has many selections. Food is fresh and hot. And the cost was only $8. It is tasty even for meat-eaters!. People are friendly and helpful. There is a small gift shop and tea room near the dining room that is worth a visit. They also have an exhibit area where they request a $1 fee. .

50,Come take a look,"Buddhists are open minded about other religions and you do not have to be Buddhist to visit this place. Buddhists do not recruit or sell you their religion.

There is a information center where you can watch TV and get tea/coffee. You can find out what classes are being offered in English and in Chinese and what activities are going on. You can also find out the activity schedule on hsilai.org website calendar. There is a museum that features changing display about every few months on art, crafts, etc There is a cafeteria that features lunch buffet. Lunch time is from 11 to 2:30PM. Right outside the cafeteria is the gift shop. If you want to learn Buddhism, I suggest asking the receptionist in the information center when classes are being offered. Usually the English class are offered Sunday morning 10:00AM.Don't wear shorts, tank tops, flip flops or skimpy clothes if you are going into the main shrine. Dress conservatively. Don't show skins.

If the line isn't too long, the red bean or custard muffins are a nice treat. I stopped in a tea room that had a big screen with a Buddhist monk talking about their beliefs. I didn't know who he was but I found it interesting and entertaining. I find the Buddhist monks have a great sense of humor. I visited the main temple, shirts and my tank tops are not allowed. I was fortunate enough to catch the end of a tour. The tour guide was friendly and informative. The museum costs $1.00 and is a must see. There were drawings and writings smaller than a penny, you have to see them through a magnifying glass. AWESOME. There are free pamphlets about Buddhism. A great way to learn more about Byddhism.

The grounds & areas are well maintained with very good signage - it is a ""living"" temple and hidden away coming up a small hill.We visited this place twice before & came back this month briefly as SIL & Mrs. wanted to stop in for an offering & say their prayers - it is truly a place for those with religious belief, buddhism and/or otherwise - to seek inner peace, spiritual guidance, comfort, and say their prayers, etc. while making their offerings - as donations, however small & symbolic are welcomed - just drop them in the box.My understanding is that there is always a vegetarian meal offered & available - just beware that it is especially busy & crowded on the 1st. & 15th day of each month of the lunar Chinese calendar - call ahead & confirm to plan your visit accordingly. From the parking lot, you can look downhill & across the valley and enjoy the scenic settings - they do ask that no photography be taken inside their religious malls (the open & outdoor space, grounds & ""pubic"" area within their grounds are fine, be respectful of other's privacy & needs.)

When I have guest in town and if they have a flexible schedule and want to get away from the hustle and bustle of LA I take them here. It is amazing. They have tours, classes, food and plenty of things to see, read and take pictures. You must bring good walking shoes and don't wear shorts out of respect. Donations are accepted. The crowd is mainly Chinese. My wife is Chinese and she is very impressed with this Temple. I would do your research on the website before coming and take advantage of the tour. They have volunteer tour guides that are American and Chinese/Taiwanese. Bring your camera and bottle of water! Parking is free. The views are amazing from the parking lot or outside the front steps.",jdreynoldsjr
