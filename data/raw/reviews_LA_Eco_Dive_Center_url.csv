50,Internet Purchase.,"I have been looking for a specific DSMB for scuba diving at all of our local Canadian shops,but only found it here.The dive center shop was very easy to deal with and they offered a lot of specials .Most important free shipping to Montreal.I was happy with their system so I already purchased another item.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dancomontreal
50,Friendly service - good prices,"I stopped in after dropping a friend off at LAX - shopping for a BCD. I walked out with a new Zeagle Ranger. Not exactly what I was looking for, but Rick showed me how it was made and all the features and I was sold. Beth rang me up and I ended up paying a nice price. The store has a great selection and if I was a cold water diver I would definitely sign up for one of their boat trips. Prices for the trips are really reasonable. Easy to find, easy to park - worth the stop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsimonis
50,Great Neighborhood Dive store,"I have been buying our scuba gear here for several years now, and after so many good sales experiences, and so many good deals, and so much good advice, I am really not interested in shopping any where else.The owners Ron and Beth have managed to hire wonderful workers that seem to be there year after year. Truly nice people that never seem to try to upsell me, and who truly love scuba diving .All of these people are in it for the love of sharing the underwater environment. They always seem to have what I am looking for , and if they don’t, they take time to order it accurately.I feel so lucky to have them in my neighborhood, but I would drive a long way to get them if I had to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blakeh346
10,Horrible dive center,"I don't know why they day it is a good diving center.But i paid for guided dives and instead they didn't send anyone, they sent a new diver that failed to go down to be my buddy.Totally not a safe place to dive with cause even their instructors didn't want me to join them Tim and Jackson, both are their just to give courses and that's it. So i took full responsibility for a new diver and i am an Advanced PADI.The boat was nice and that was the only thing good about them. That can give them this one star.Bad attitude that their instructors refuse to take their tank to their shop. I drove to drop it myself.I wanted to dive sidemount two tanks and thet even refused, so why u left me as a solo diver to dive with single while no one their and my body ended the dive in 21 min for finishing his air. Adding to that he was happy to see an orange fish. So looks like he is fresh.So, make sure you expect the below.No safetyNo efficiencyBad attitude from instructors jackson and tim. I don't want to say rude.No one will help you in anything.Yah forgot to say, jackson the instructor told me go away while he was giving a briefing about the day.I ended up sleeping in the boat till 5 pm cause of there is no use of talking or explaining or even fighting, u dive to enjoy but that's not the friendly environment place that you will expect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohamedaQ7679BH
50,Excellent all around dive center,"The instructors are all very knowledgeable and helpful. It's a vey busy shop, but if you have questions they will take the time to help.They focus on teaching all levels, not just punching through ow, which makes continuing education with them much easier than waiting until there's enough people to fill a class.I've learned a lot from the instructors and staff there so far and look forward to more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/w0lfgh0st
20,Bad attitudes. Decent gear.,"If you scroll down to the other negative reviews you will see a running theme. Decent gear and classes, but boy oh boy the horrible attitude coming from some of the staff is remarkable. It trickles down from the top. I've bought a lot of gear and was certified through Rescue at Eco, and the encounters have all been hit or miss. Ether you get a good one, or a seriously surprisingly arrogant and curt experience.I just recently brought some gear in for service (about $1000 worth that I purchased there), and after being told they weren't sure they still serviced that brand, I was told to pay an amount and that if there was an additional charge someone would call me. I went to pick it up and was told by the owner I owed an additional amount, almost double what I had paid. I had no problem paying, so I pulled out my wallet and was handing the cashier my card when I noted that no one had called me as promised. Well the owner started in with his arrogant argument ""no one said that!"" (he wasn't there when I dropped off), and ""you should have read our terms on the web site!"" (Huh? That's a requirement? Maybe live up to your word that someone would call?). He kept giving me sour notes. I told him I just wanted to pay and leave, when he said, in the most smarmy way possible ""I'll pay your charges"", obviously trying to guilt me for some strange reason. I said ""sure!"" And left.Over the years people have asked me where to shop and get certified. I've mentioned Eco, and half of about 20 people have said they heard there was an attitude problem, and that they didn't feel comfortable going through a learning process where they need to trust someone with a company who exhibits anger and sarcasm. I see what they mean and agree. Go somewhere else is my recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmprod
10,Failed to refund my $400 deposit,Asked Ron in dive shop to refund my deposit. He claims he sent the check. It's been over a month. Be care dealing with this business,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bacwoods
50,Excellent dive show in LA,"Did my PADI Open Water certification there and later the Advanced Open Water and had a great experience. We did local diving trips as a part of the course — went to Catalina and Anacapa islands and had a lot of fun dives as well as couple beach dives in Redondo.The variety of local wildlife in California is stunning with all kinds of fish, rays, octopuses, crabs and lobsters and even seen a baby seal.The dive boat (Explorer) was excellent and staff was friendly and helpful and served us great meals too. The captain took us to several nice spots around the Anacapa island.The instructors (Colleen and Jason) were knowledgeable, friendly and fun, provided a lot of valuable tips besides the standard course and willing to walk and extra mile to make our experience enjoyable and fun. The shop runs a lot of various certification classes all the time. Also check out their Facebook page — the shop organizes a lot of community events and interesting presentations. Overall highly recommend to anyone who wants to achieve PADI certification.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlegB90230
50,Best SCUBA outfitter and learning center,"Super nice people running a first class operation. The owner Ron is a fantastic instructor and this store does not try to get you in the most expensive hear but the right gear. Prices are comparable but if you consider the customer service and support, the prices are fantastic.They have continuous scuba classes and certification courses everyday it seems. They organize fantastic dive trips locally and internationally.no matter your diving ability, this place will not discriminate or try to take advantage of you. GOOD PEOPLE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CavalryS
30,Excellent staff and boat; false advertising from main shop,"I'm PADI certified Advanced Open Water and I've done about 25 dives in Honduras, Palau and Hawaii. I go on a dive trip about once every 6 months, not quite often enough to feel totally confident in the water, especially in a new environment. This was my first cold water dive trip, and there was a lot to get used to.I was visiting California for work and I was excited to see a ""Reef and Kelp"" dive listed on a weekend day that I could make it out (this was in June 2015). I've wanted to see California's giant kelp forests for a while and I was excited to get this chance. The trip was to Santa Catalina Island, about a 2-hr boat ride each way, on the Magician. There were about 18-20 divers on the boat, maybe a bit more than half OW students and the rest were experienced divers.The Magician and its staff were great. Food was plentiful and high quality. Assistance from Mica, who helped us into and out of the water and did tank fills and I'm sure managed a bunch of other details I didn't see, was excellent. The crew were extremely courteous and helpful in all respects. The EDC staff were also quite good, though because my prior experience was mainly tropical diving I didn't realize that the custom in California is not to have a dive guide, so I expected a little more guidance than I got. Fortunately some of the other experienced divers had hired a guide from EDC, and they agreed to let me join their group. This turned out to be quite handy since among other things, I blew an o-ring on my (rented) tank and I wasn't carrying spares; my new guide had some spares and luckily one of them fit. (This was the first time I had to bring my own tank - again, most of my experience is in tropical areas, not resorts, but operations where the operator offers a much higher level of service - and frankly it had never occurred to me to bring my own spare o-rings. Lesson learned.)The big disappointment for me was that the dive was advertised as a ""Reef and Kelp"" dive (at Santa Catalina Island) but I was informed, once on the boat, that there are no kelp forests on or near Santa Catalina at this time - they died back in summer 2014 due to unusually warm ocean temperatures. They informed me that the closest kelp forests right now are offshore Santa Barbara Island (5 hr boat ride) and no one is sure when the forests off Catalina will come back. Since my entire reason to dive in CA was to see the kelp forests, I would not have bothered to dive there if I'd known that the chance of seeing kelp forests was zero all along. Unfortunately, they give no indication of this whatsoever. The website where they would describe the dive (linked from the ""boat dive schedule"" page) is broken - there is an error on the page which creates an error message in my internet browser (endless redirect or something like that). But I eventually found a page elsewhere on the Eco Dive Center site where they do describe the diving at Santa Catalina Island. It has the title ""Amazing Kelp Forests and Reefs"" and states that the area has ""great kelp beds"" among other attractions.I suppose I could have called the dive shop in advance to ask ""are there any good kelp forests on the reef and kelp dive, which your website states has amazing kelp forests""... but it seems kind of self-explanatory given the advertising. And since the operator goes to Catalina every week, they obviously knew the kelp forests weren't there, and haven't been there for a long time.So, a decent enough dive, with nice staff and a nice boat. I would give the staff and the boat 5 stars. But in terms of truth in advertising, the operation seems poorly managed. If I'd known that there is no kelp around, despite the advertisement of ""Amazing Kelp Forests"", I would have skipped it and spent more time on land.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wigglyh
50,True Dive Pros,"Recently, I was headed to Fiji for a week of amazing diving.......after boarding the plane from Portland to Los Angeles for our connecting flight, I realized I had left my dive boots at home! Nice way to start the trip...!!Anyway, our layover in L.A. was 6 hours, so my wife and I checked nearby dive shops and found Ron at the Eco Dive Center. Not only did he understand my dilemma, but he squared me away pronto....I really appreciated all the help, service and professionalism!!The shop looks really well stocked with everything you would need for an awesome dive experience and the staff are knowledgeable and super friendly. I would recommend them highly for anything dive related.Good to do business with!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMEIV
50,Excellent dive shop that is welcoming to all levels of divers,"I have been diving for 15 years and, in that time, have walked through the front door of many a dive shop. Eco Dive Center, a family business run by Ron and Beth, continues to amaze me.Eco Dive Center lacks the pretentious attitude that some shops have and makes everyone feel welcome and excited to participate in the sport of scuba diving. This culture is embodied by an excellent and knowledgeable staff including (but not limited too) Zac, Jason, Josh and Cullen.You can tell that Ron and Beth have a true passion for the underwater world. For instance, on the first Tuesday of every month, they host an after-hours taco dinner and lecture by various underwater experts (last month it was a great discussion on Ocean Acidification by a marine biologist from Scripps Institute). These types of events and social-media outreach are a great way to meet friends and dive buddies.The store's selection is excellent and if they don't have something in stock, they can get it for you very quickly. They won't try to oversell you on stuff you don't need and the prices are about 25% more than online dive shops, which I think is completely reasonable given the extra services that only your local dive shop can offer.I highly recommend Eco Dive Center as the place to go for scuba diving on the Westside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelo491
50,My favorite dive shop in Los Angeles!,These guys are terrific! Been diving with Eco for over 5 years! You will find very knowledgable experienced staff well supported by the shop owners. Dive certification is a serious undertaking but they routinely make it fun (I've certified myself and my kids here). Local boat dives are available via charter or they are happy to rent equipment to you for your own plans. My favorite dive shop in Los Angeles!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnc_19
10,Very poor service,"This year I organized a trip to the US with my 2 kids and, we planned to make one or two dives in California. As a diving professional myself, I tried to find a professional reliable and nice Dive center and choose Eco Dive Center in Culver City.As for all the other activities I planned with my two kids, I made my reservations via email and had several people answering my questions. Even if the emails were not specially friendly I decided to book two dives, with full equipment for my two boys and I and a Divemaster to show us the beauty of the ocean.To make it very short, the day we booked, we arrived at the Eco Dive Center and nobody was waiting for us. No Divemaster available, ne reservation was found for us and... no dive was possible.As we planned many activities with the kids, we were not able to make those dives another day and the result of the poor service of Eco Dive Center was that my kids and I were not able to dive in California.We were all very disappointed and, unfortunately, for me Eco Dive Center ruined our Californian diving experience.When I read the other reviews, I see that we were very unlucky and probably had to deal with non professional poorly trained staff.Next time I travel to the USA, I'll try to dive with another company and definitely, I wouldn't recommend Eco Dive Center for your diving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maccisco
50,Great dive shop,Eco has been great to me. I've never dealt with the owner but have taken lessons with both Tim and Zac and both have been great! Zac also works at the shop so he's the only person ive really dealt with there but everyone is super friendly and helpful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scubachrism

40,Helpful and Fun,I went in to buy some accessories for my daughter when she got her certification and it was great. So I booked the two of us on a two dive boat trip with them out to Catalina. The two dive masters with Eco Dive had students along and they were both great. Very helpful to my daughter and I as well. And we had to rent some gear from them and they went out of their way to help us with that. We had great dives and a good time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adriantm
40,"Good, active dive shop","They run a lot of students through this place. I was amazed at the amount of instructors and classes going at the same time. That's not a bad thing. If they weren't good they wouldn't be this busy. What I didn't like was my son had three different instructors. I would have liked some continuity for him rather than him adapt to three different teaching styles.Anyway, I've bought gear there before, dealt with the owners before, and even though its nowhere near my home, in fact I live a mile from a Sport Chalet (The Evil Empire) but can't stand them, I keep going back because I get a good vibe from the place. They have a dive club and have organized dives all the time.I will continue to use Eco Dive Center and recommend them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ual95
40,Nice dive shop. Great energy here,"it's rare to walk in a dive shop and come out feeling re-energized to dive again. Went in and walked out with a scuba refresher book and guided dive scheduled for March to dive with sealions? Good staff, tons of product and lots of trips. I'm excited. Thanks Eco Dive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explor2001
50,BEST DIVE SHOP IN LA - HANDS DOWN!,"I started diving with Ron and Beth (owners of Eco) seven years ago, when they were at another scuba shop, and when they started Eco Dive Center, I happily left that shop and switched over to Eco, as they were the reason I was continuing to dive in the first place. Ron and Beth have nurtured the most fun, educational and constantly evolving group of instructors, scuba divers and fans I have had the pleasure of meeting. I have thoroughly enjoyed every local and tropical boat trip and dive they have organized and through them have met some of the best people I have ever known. This is not just a business, it's a family. The dive club meetings on Tuesday nights are a blast and have really cool and interesting speakers, not to mention they raffle of amazing gifts like dive computers and boat trips too! Through one of their dive club meetings, I was introduced to a fantastic volunteer diving program at the California Science Center that has been one of the greatest experiences of my life. I have bought all my gear at Eco, and with the exception of one defective computer (which I bought used, but which was immediately replaced with a new one for free), I have never had any issues with gear I have rented or purchased. Eco Dive Center also strives to promote their message of preserving the oceans, which I think is truly admirable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/idontwaitinline
50,The Best Dive Shop in Southern California!,"My husband and I decided to get our open water certification for our honeymoon to Bora Bora in the summer of 2009. I called a few local dive shops and Eco's friendly and knowledgeable staff, competitive prices and class schedule flexibility made our decision easy. We are so happy with this decision! Since our open water certification in 2009, we have slowly purchased all of our dive gear through Eco (wet suits, dry suits, BC's, Regs, Dive Computers, bags, etc). If you are considering buying any dive equipment, CALL ECO...their prices can't be beat! We have also continued our education all through Eco. My husband has completed Rescue and is currently in the dive master class. We love that Eco puts safety as a top priority, but also knows how to have fun. The staff at eco is truly a great group of people. We have so much fun on the Eco chartered dive trips -- from Catalina to wreck weekends in San Diego to Santa Barbara, it's always a blast. We also hope to join them on one of their tropical trips someday! Eco also has a great dive club which meets monthly featuring speakers relating to the diving. It is always a great time. We couldn't be happier with our initial decision to take our open water class through Eco. It has been so rewarding and has brought us to an amazing dive community of new friends and great experiences above and below the water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindsay426
50,A Great shop,The shop is large but still has a really nice mom-n-pop feel. The staff are friendly and take the time to talk to you about your needs and wants. The dive instructors on top notch and are always helpful and do everything to make sure your dive experience is enjoyable and safe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luman16
50,Fantastic dive shop and PADI certification course,"Ron and the team at Eco Dive Center are the best. I was Open Water certified through their Life Guard course and the experience couldn't have been better. My classmates and I, being life guards, are all familiar with the water, something that we take for granted, as a lot of the non-lifeguard course deals with remaining calm under water and having the endurance to actually swim.Instead of a course spread over two weekends, we did everything in one weekend. We studied the book at home and on Friday night had a three hour class where we reviewed each chapter and took tests to apply the knowledge we'd learned. Out instructor Jessica explained the SCUBA math very easily ensuring everyone could figure out de-co times. We all passed easily.Saturday AM found us in the Culver City pool from 7:30-10:30am, learning the basic skills that we would apply to our two shore dives later that day. Jessica was fantastic and very thorough, though admittedly, we were a great class and flew through each underwater test.LThe two shore dives were in Redondo Beach at Vets Park. The first time you walk in the ocean with what feels like 50 extra pounds of gear is a little daunting but Jessica and our other instructor Dan gave us the confidence to power through the waves and prepare to descend. That first dive, the vis was incredible (our instructors' words). We all had no problem descending and completing the various tests needed. Everyone was very excited after that first dive and Jessica and Dan were happy that we were doing so well.The vis on the second dive wasn't as great, and Jessica warned us to stay close to our buddy as it would be the first time we were under water without great visibility. Despite the different conditions, we finished that dive's tests with ease and made the long trek back to our cars for a wrap-up discussion. Jessica and Dan were pleased that we were all doing so well. She told us how to best recover from all the work we'd done today and how rest and hydration was especially important so we didn't feel like rubbish for our three Sunday dives off Catalina.Sunday morning, we left out of Long Beach for the three Catalina dives. The dives were incredible! I'd never seen kelp forests and man, it was a trip. So much life down there! The boat Eco chartered was great. The people not taking classes were friendly and eager to share dive stories. The food served between each dive was delicious; I still have dreams about the french toast our chef made! After we completed our fourth dive, we were officially certified Open Water divers! For our fifth dive, we were able to go with just a buddy. It's pretty amazing to think that Friday night I'm walking in a door with just book knowledge and by Sunday afternoon, I've learned the basic skill sets and my buddy and I now have the confidence to dive at 65ft without an instructor present. It's a testament to Eco's thorough instruction. And throughout the whole weekend, Jessica's enthusiasm for diving really infected the whole class. She was such a positive influence and as a result, we all had such a good time learning SCUBA and hanging out with each other.After the weekend, Ron told us that he would give us a deal; if we wanted to purchase the rental gear we had used all weekend, tank included, we could do so at an AMAZING price. Three people in the class (myself included) took advantage and I couldn't be happier about it.I would recommend Eco Dive Center to anyone interested in learning how to SCUBA from a friendly, energetic and knowledgeable staff. They really are the best!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brifo99
50,Probably the most active dive shop in LA!,"I frequent Eco for all my diving needs, the staff is always friendly and ready to help, and they have dive boats going out every weekend, including trips to Catalina and the Channel Islands and even more advanced diving trips around Southern California! The instructors there know their stuff and with a full calendar of classes they always have something going on. If you're looking to go diving around LA definitely stop by Eco Dive Center first!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KEDickinson
20,Mixed feelings...,"I had some problems with one of the instructors at ECO, but the owner did contact me to clear some things up and the equipment I was able to rent/buy was fine... here's the good, bad, and ugly...Starting with the bad, my first class was supposed to be a few weeks ago and the instructor postponed the class by calling us shortly before it was supposed to begin because she had an emergency (emergencies happen, but I would have rather she found another instructor to fill in for her--I live far away from the dive site and was almost there by the time I got her call).In my second class, it rained the previous day and the instructor cancelled the class right before we were supposed to begin because she doesn't like going in the ocean the day after a rain... the water was fine and I and dozens of other people (divers, swimmers, surfers, etc.) went in and had no problem... once again, I drove a long way to the dive site and would have preferred that the instructor cancel the class well in advance to save me a drive... it's not like she didn't know in advance that it rained the previous day.Our third class was a lecture that was supposed to be at one site, but a half hour before the class was supposed to begin the instructor texted us that she was moving that lecture to another site, so we had to drive further. When we got there, she had us watch a DVD that was so damaged that it kept stopping and skipping, so we ended up only being able to watch a portion of it.In two of our other dive sessions in open water, the instructor forgot to bring some of the necessary equipment, so we weren't able to completely do the drills that were promised previously.Now for the ugly, our final dive was cancelled because the instructor said she had to leave and teach another diving class. She said we can call her to do another dive with her some other day, but deciding to cancel one class to go teach another is ridiculously disorganized and unprofessional.When I received my SCUBA certification card in the mail, some of the information on it was wrong because she entered the wrong data into the computer, so I had to contact her to process a new certification card.But on the good side, I spoke with the owner about all of this and he apologized for the difficulties, asked me how he can address the problem, and he said he was going to council that instructor and/or work with higher quality people in the future. The gear that I was able to rent/buy at the shop was fine, but I obviously was unlucky in having to deal with an unprofessional/disorganized person there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outdoorperson_10
