It is lokated in a small roundhouse and what I heard it is run by volunteers. They do their best and were very enthusiastic in explaining.

20,not all open in January,"This is a good spot for children to learn about what lives under the water locally. Admission is by donation, and it's fine to just walk in without donating. It's quite small. On a Sunday afternoon in January, only the downstairs was open, so it only took fifteen minutes to see everything. You will notice more if you wait by each exhibit for a couple of minutes and the sea life starts doing things, but it still takes just fifteen minutes to see everything downstairs. It did look a little down in the tooth, all the more reason to donate, so children can learn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/920sl
40,"Small, well maintained? Interesting stop","We wandered by the aquarium with our two teen boys. We took 10-15 minutes to walk around both downstairs and upstairs.

Upstairs has a play area for small children with books a coloring books.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zlch0c

40,Always a fun place to visit with young guests.,"While this is certainly not a huge, modern, snazzy hi-tech aquarium of the Baltimore or Monterey kind, it's a wonderful little gem at the end of the pier to show to smaller children who are visiting. Educational and always with friendly and knowledgable staff nearby, kids I've taken have enjoyed themselves and, I'm sure, learned a little or a lot our friends in the sea.

20,Small aquarium in bad condition,"I finally visited the aquarium. Unfortunately, things were not so nice. First, the marine animals look stressed and probably have diseases. The staff does not seem to care much about anything. I really hope that there is more money spent to improve the situation there. Also, don't go there when there are many kids, you experience total chaos.Not much to see but the giant eels and the leopard shark were cool. Also, you can touch starfishes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pureumk

40,Fun for the young ones!,"Kids will enjoy this small but information packed marine learning center! They can touch, see, explore small to medium size sea life.

Some days you may even be fortunate enough to see dolphins or whales just out beyond the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EAWH77

40,Fun place for kids to get acquainted with local sealife!,"The Roundhouse Aquarium is a fixture in Manhattan Beach. If you plan to visit our little town and have children, I highly recommend this as a low key, quick visit while you are enjoying the downtown area or the beach. It is the small building out on the end of the Manhattan Beach Pier . . .there are several exhibits, touch tanks, opportunities to ask questions .. . because it is small, it is ideal for young children, in particular, who may not have the patience for a longer visit to a big aquarium. Our children loved to visit it every time we went for a walk on the pier and it has just gotten better and better. The last time I checked, there was no ""admission fee"" but the Roundhouse survives on donations, so please think about feeding the donation box. Our children REALLY enjoyed the Sleep with the Sharks events . . . . an opportunity to sleep in the Roundhouse and see the beach at night when no one is there. If you are local, I highly recommend it! Our children were ~8/9 when they did it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GandC71187

20,A small diversion...once.,"So, to be clear, I don't have a problem with zoos or aquariums or anything of that nature. I do, however, have a problem with it when the zoo or aquarium doesn't keep the habitats clean. The first habitat that you see when you walk in is for a pair of good sized eels. There was an abundance of algae growing on the tank walls and a fair amount on the rocks and eels themselves. Eels also like to have a place to hide...this habitat did not allow for that. The touch tanks were pretty neat, but the shelled animals in those tanks could also use a cleaning. There is also a second floor with some smaller tanks that don't seem to have the algae issues, but the larger tanks below are open at the top and dust, dirt and debris is all built up around the openings. There are some other interesting items such as Orca and Porpoise skulls and a preserved squid as well. This may be worth a quick trip in to get out of the sun and to let the kids enjoy the fish, but nothing more. This attraction has the potential to be amazing, but it was not this time, at least in my opinion...someone who has grown up with the Miami Seaquarium, Sea World and the Atlanta Aquarium setting my standards for an ""Aquarium"". I hope the owners consider giving this unique place a face lift in the near future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S_Sullivan186

50,Fishies!,"This was a fun quick pop in thing to do at the end of the Manhattan Beach Pier. A donation is suggested, but it can be anything. I loved looking at all the fish and eels I'd never see anywhere else. The stingrays were awesome, especially the little guy that spent his time just trying to jump out of his tank. It was a fun impromptu 15 minute stop once we walked to the end of the pier. If you have kids I definitely would recommend it, there is even a little kid area upstairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeepchic20
40,Nice for what it is,"Compared to other aquariums on the West Coast, it is not much. For what space, resources, etc., this is a nice little gem located at the end of the Manhattan Beach Pier. It looks something a person would have in the garage but a bit bigger. It is very hands on for kids. It is 'free' but a little donation is nice. It is a great place to spend a little time inside away from the sun and see what life is around and under the pier.

30,A Nice Tiny Aquarium,Nothing out of this world here. There are about 7 relatively small tanks with various marine life to be seen. It is a nice little distraction on the pier and I imagine kids would love it. It is free to enter but a $2-5 donation is encouraged.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chumito10
50,Must visit if you are in Manhattan Beach,"They're open 10-Sunset on weekends, 3-Sunset weekdays and most holidays..... Great for kids and adults alike... No charge, just donation jar at the door. Worth the walk down the pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/539MattF
50,Great place for families,"Took the kids here on a recommendation by a friend while we were visiting southern California. The aquarium is free, but they do ask for donations. I was happy to give them $10.00 so that they could keep this really sweet spot open to the public! It's nothing fancy, but they do have some really neat fish and sea life for the kids. I would highly recommend stopping by this spot if you are in Manhattan Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveJaxx

50,Small but mighty! Definitely worth a visit!,"While you are strolling along The Strand in Manhattan Beach, do not miss the chance to walk out and visit this charming petite aquarium located inside the Roundhouse at the end of the pier. Founded in 1979 and only charging a suggested donation of $2 per person, this tiny aquarium focuses on educating and showcasing mostly local sealife, including starfish, eels, sea anemones, seahorses, marine reptiles, coral and more. The Volunteers are so friendly and knowledgeable and love chatting about all the interesting creatures housed here. An absolutely dynamite activity for kids of all ages! Don't forget to take a picture of yourself next to, or captured by the shark prop just outside the front door! It will be the cutest, safest shark picture you will ever snap of you and your loved ones! Just around the other side of the building, you can grab a snack or hot chocolate too. Makes for a truly fantastic day at the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyM265
