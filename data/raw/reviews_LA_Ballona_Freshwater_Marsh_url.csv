40,"Short, but nice walking trail near wetlands","We came here looking for the freshwater marsh, since the salt marsh is under restoration. Parking on Jefferson required a few u-turns to get to the correct side but is the best place to access the walking path around the wetlands. we had to use the ergo for our infant, since the path isn't paved for our stroller. Saw a large crane, several mallards and other birds in the marsh but several sections were coated with a thick, green layer of duckweed. Next time I'll set up a docent led tour and visit the riparian path, since it seems like there's more to see than we were able to find. Signage on where to park/find the trail could be improved, but overall a great place to walk and learn from the informative placards posted by Friends of the Ballona wetlands.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3695TCjessicaj
40,Great birdwatching close to LA International Airport,"Who would have thought you could catch a cab from LA's ultrabusy airport to marsh wetalnds...in just 10 minutes? Great way to spend a few hours if you are waiting for a flight. This was our second visit in the last 2-3 years, and the volunteers have done a lot. We stayed at the Custom Hotel, which is a 20 minute walk to the entrance, then a walk along the fence which encircles the wetlands. We were a bit naughty and jumped a locked gate to get us into the center of the wetlands. (We were not alone!). We spotted a dozen or so species (early in the afternoon...not the best time). Lots of waterfowl, flycatchers, a nice American Kestrel.As a suggestion...better access to the wetlands would be good, and some signposts would be handy. I'd like to see a few more identification boards for those of us who are not too familiar with North American species.Great to see preservation of local ecology. This small area has been spared the impact of the property developers. Hooray.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisbF2741HY
