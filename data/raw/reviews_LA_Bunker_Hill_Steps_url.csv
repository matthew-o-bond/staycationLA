50,Cute steps with water,"Next tot the Oue tower are the Bunker hill steps which have a cut water feature running down the middle of them and a stature at the top flight, which offers a good view of the roof top of the central library",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
30,Worth a glance but not a detour,"They are just steps. Steps with a few landings that have places to sit and enjoy a coffee and view the central library’s art deco pyramid roof. Essentially it’s a little plaza.There are also a bank of escalators, tucked off to the side, for those who find the exertion of climb a large number of steps to much.The first landing (closest to the library) provides direct access to a ticketing booth for the glass slide that sticks out of the upper floors of the US Bank tower.Provides a good shortcut from the Central Library to the Wells Fargo tower.5 to 10 minutes would more than cover the amount of time you need to spend at this “attraction.”",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markv399
30,Hadn't realised they were an attraction,"Hadn't realised they were an attraction, but do remember at the time, being on them, thinking - these are nice steps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harrison-F-Carter
50,"Steadily, weave, climb Bunker Hill!","Steadily, weave, climb Bunker Hill! A landscape architectural marvel on the realm of the Spanish Steps in Rome. Going from the Los Angeles Library, a marvel in itself to the plaza and restaurants at the top. Great walk and a way to get from the Pershing Square Metro to the offices and hotels. A worthy pedestrian route across the city. The best way down is Angels Flight, when it is operating. Or perhaps wander over to the Broad or the Disney Hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
30,Steep Steps,Lots of steep steps to get you up the hill to the huge office buildings on top. A bit of a tribute the the way the landscape used to be before the development of downtown. Now it's all lost in modern development that lacks much friendly design.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
30,They're Steps,Had a walk up the Bunker Hill Steps during my downtown walkabout but I can't really see why they are classed as an attraction. Nice and clean though with a couple of resting places on your way up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newspapertaxi
40,Step up,We saw these steps coming out of the public library. A nice work out. Nicely done with a man made water feature running down the center. There are escalators for those who want to ride up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/875jl
50,A step up,"If you're too tired, ok, you can ride the escalator. But walking up is great exercise, right? Stopping briefly along the way let's you see how garden space was created. A sweet simple break from your corporate indoor life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drtike
50,Downtown walk,Just was walking downtown LA and just wanted to hit some places I thought would be good for my taste in stuff. Was a good was the stairs are cool and he area was nice. Did have construction on the buildings but other than that was peaceful walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569bobbyg
40,Amazing Steps ...,The Bunker Hill Steps are actually amazing as you'll see when you visit / walk them. They are long - seemingly 3-4 stories tall as you ascend or descend them! Special. The watercourse in the center adds beauty and peacefulness. Fortunately there's an escalator beside them when you're just too tired. Fun to visit. ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Nice to see lights!!,Beautiful scenery! It's just nice to get away and have a nice look at the lights very nice to just walk around the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TVlittleTK
40,Whew,"If you start at the bottom, you'll be exhausted half way through. If you start at the top, this won't happen until the end. Beautifully executed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
50,"Beautiful, great for photos...","As one who lives in Los Angeles, I always enjoy seeing the lovely Bunker Hill Steps. They are four stories tall and have a slender waterfall coming down the center of the wide steps. Also, there is beautiful landscaping...flowers and trees along the side of the steps and on each level. Off to the side, there is an escalator for those who prefer not to walk the four stories.The Bunker Hill Steps are located across the street from the Richard Riordan Library in downtown L.A. There are good views from the steps and also a very interesting fountain/sculpture at the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loveLA
