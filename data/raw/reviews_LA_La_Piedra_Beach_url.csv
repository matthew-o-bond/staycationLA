40,Lovely!,"This is probably my favorite of the string of beaches north of Malibu. Awesome views! Not for the faint of heart, though - the hike down to the beach is steep and treacherous. Especially this year, when it appears that a couple of the rudimentary ""steps"" that had been in place washed out. They did put a ladder at the bottom, which is an improvement. (Keeps the crowds down, though...) At low tide, this beach is great for tidepooling. At this visit, unlike our visits in years past, we picked up a lot of tar on our feet. Not sure what's up with that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cello12345
40,Lunch on the Pier in Malibu,"Enjoy the PCH to get to Malibu and stop by the Pier for a seafood lunch. Enjoy crab cakes, fish of salads with a view of the Ocean",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drmojo48
30,Another small pocket beach,"No facilities, no lifeguards, no bathrooms, extremely limited parking, most locals only go there once. Otherwise, it's great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
50,Sunscreen and a beach chair...life is very good in Malibu,"Trail to beach is by restrooms and parking machine. Relatively easy trail for most people but would want to help elderly or care very young kids on it.Parking lot holds 15 or 20 cars and best use pay the parking machine because enforcement does patrol and will ticket.La Piedra is another beautiful Malibu beach and cove.I enjoy the lil beaches and coves--hate the sunburned masses of people.Park, pay, hike down to the sand for a great day at the beach.Sunscreen and a beach chair...life is very good in Malibu.Beach is sandy at a lower tide.No lifeguard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
40,"Difficult beach to reach, but offers quiet and solitude.","Beach Overview: La Piedra is the quietest of the three beaches (El Pescador, La Piedra, El Matador) that make up this section of the Malibu coast. This is the beach to go to, if you want to have it mostly to yourself, and don’t care about raw scenic beauty (El Matador). We arrived on a Friday morning at about 10AM and had the beach to ourselves till about noon, when about 3 other groups showed up. That was it. Privacy and quiet are the beaches two greatest assets. And by quiet, I mean not just lack of crowds, but also if you lay your blankets down close to the cliff, you can get a bit of respite from the crashing of the waves.Suitable for: Almost everyone seeking solitude. For the mobility impaired, it will be impossible climbing down to the beach. It is NOT wheelchair accessible. Otherwise, I would recommend this beach for anyone who is seeking quiet and solitude.Parking: Parking lot is tiny and like others have said, costs $8 at an automated machine that accepts cash and credit cards. Some roadside free parking is available, but be careful where, because there are also no parking signs. Regardless, finding space in the lot should not be a problem.Getting to the down to the beach: This beach is a challenge to get to. Steep climb on a path which is in poor shape – some areas where you need to step down a foot or more. Bottom of the path is very eroded, and you have to make a bit of a jump down to the beach. On the beach level, you are at a large rocky area and need to climb over the rocks for about 50 feet before you get to the sandy portion of the beach.Facilities: 2 porta potties are located at the parking lot. Because of the challenging nature of the climb to the beach, make sure you use them before going down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhiteZB
40,Loved the quiet,Seems like all so cal beaches are wonderful but this one was nice and quiet. Great to get away from the crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMF568
20,Not worth it,"In Malibu, besides Zuma and Surfrider beaches, there are little state beaches like La Piedra sprinkled along the coast. This one has practically no parking and the steep walk down is not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryMon
50,One of the best beaches,It has a lot of wildlife and an occassional nude running around. Watch for parking violations if you don't submit the fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelgarcia
50,ITS ALIIIIIIVE,"Its a little hard to find, but that is what makes coming here soooo worth it. At first, I didnt want to review, honestly, because this is my favourite beach because NO ONE IS EVER THERE, also, like i stated in the title ITS LITERALLY ALIVE, from sea stars, to anemones, little shrimps, to the moss covered cliff sides, every rock on this beach is teaming with life <3 and the pretty kind too. It would be a wonderful date spot, but I come here with friends when we need to wind down from a long weekend. I recommend travelling to the right of the path, because thats where all the pretty junk is. Also you have to pay to park there, it goes to the upkeep of the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7Ashley7Boo7
