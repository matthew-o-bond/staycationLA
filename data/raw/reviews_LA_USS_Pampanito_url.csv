50,Immersive!,"A great opportunity to explore a submarine which served in WW2 - we were lucky enough to visit on a day when a veteran submariner was on board to walk visitors through the vessel, explaining what life was actually like working and living on a submarine. Could have spent the whole day in there! You can get up-close to the workings of the vessel, touch the levers and dials etc - however, being able to speak with someone who actually served on board made my day. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrellb53
50,One-of-a-kind experience,"If you love history and submarines you need to take an audio tour in USS Pampanito. And even if you donâ€™t know anything about second world war and submarines, take the tour. Awesome experience. There was also a volunteer veteran telling stories and asking questions. Very friendly staff at the ticket counter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Climber762461
