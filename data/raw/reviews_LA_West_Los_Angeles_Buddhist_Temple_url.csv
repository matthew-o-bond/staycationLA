50,Obon,"I love to come here every year to experience the Obon festival. The food is good there are games for the children, and at dusk the dancing begins. What I really enjoy is the fact that all ages participate in the activities, including the dancing. Young, old, teens in all manner of dress, who ask those who came to observe to join in. It is always peaceful and relaxing and all are made to feel welcome. Parking for free a couple of blocks up in their parking garage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TERESAM439

Located a few blocks off Sawtelle in the previously near all Japanese area, now is universal w Japanese influence. The temple itself is housed within the main building & is quite nice. Obon Festival time is on Saturday & Sunday with robed dancers from temples all across California, nice folks. The grounds house food booths & activities, games for children. Very enjoyable! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
