50,One of the finest art galleries in Los Angeles,"Craig Krull Gallery is one of Los Angeles's finest galleries of established and emerging artists, most of whom are associated with Southern California art. The gallery is helmed by Craig Krull who has been a gallerist for over 30 years and his assistant Beth who is also a fine artist herself.I have known Craig since he worked at the Jan Turner Gallery in the eighties and he is extremely knowledgeable about Los Angeles art history and has a fine eye recognizing emerging artists with the assistance of Beth. He is perhaps the best dealer of quality pieces of Carlos Almaraz who is having his long overdue retrospective at LACMA in fall 2017 as part of the Getty's Pacific Standard Time. He also has a strong program of photography.The galleries artists include Dan McCleary, Peter Alexander and a recent find Caroline Larsen, works of which are shown on their website and of which I attached a few.Any tour of art galleries in Los Angeles should include a visit to the Craig Krull Gallery.",Ron O

I've been coming here for a number of years - never disappoints. Has a number of Woods Davy pieces also. Lots of fine Contemporary art galleries at Bergamont, plus a Cafe for a break. You'll enjoy! ...",David B L

50,An exceptional Gallerist with an impeccable eye and concrete integrity.,"Craig Krull Gallery, as a venue for the creative expression of our times, is a shining light of primarily contemporary California artists who have a profound relationship with their sense of place, local environment, light, and form. Gallery artists comprise a who's who of some of the finest Southern California artists of both local endearment and international stature. The Gallery is known for its clean and modern lines, its understated sensibility, quality and beauty, which is demonstrated in the exhibitions it creates, its publications, and the relationship Craig has between himself, the artists, and the public. Visiting the Gallery and having a chat with Craig about a current, past, or future exhibition is a wonderful reason to take some time out and head on over to Bergamot Station.From the depths of his soul, Craig loves learning from artists and the public just as much as he loves supporting artists in sharing their vision and creativity with the world while assisting the public to come into their own path of experiencing creative expression in new and exciting ways. If you are really lucky, you might even be able to talk him into a game of ping pong, so I encourage you to budget some extra time for your visit.",travelerstraveler_11
