50,Go around twice and take the family,"Our eldest daughter found this place on Instagram before we travelled and we agreed to add it to our planning and I must say we were not disapointed.If you want to go somewhere, act like an idiot and take loads of pictures of yourself and the family then this is the place to go.From the moment you walk up the stairs there are photo opportunities everywhere from oversized food to weird eye tricks that look great on your camera roll.We found the first time around you try to get everything in and spend a lot of time taking a photo and moving on however, when you get to the shop at the end simply go around again and have some more fun with the attractions.Youll only spend a few hours here and, as with the rest of Hollywood parking is at a preium so Lyft it to a side street near the attraction and have some fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonotDreamJustTravel
40,"super great, be prepared if you go by yourself","before I booked my ticket I asked them if there will be a person to help me to take picture and they said no, so for me it's not a big deal as long as I know that tripods are allowed and they said yes ! so if you are planning to come by yourself take your photo equipement> This place is super cool because not crowded at all, I went at 4 pm until 6 pm and it was a blastit's possible to let your bag in the gift shop, for no charge,I really had good time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancybN4723AM
50,Fun! if You like to have cool pictures to share! A good family time. You make your own fun!,"My daughter requested to go here and She had so much fun! Imagination on Extreme here! You will enjoy it just bring your camera, selfie stick and smile. Note we spent about 1 -1.5 hours here just taking our time taking pictures.We had half off of our entrance for dressing up. Check out the discounts first. Also its near the museum of illusions and again a sketchy area in Hollywood. Have Fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreanicu
50,Heaps of fun to be had here!,"The Museum Of Selfies was a lot of fun. We had a staff team member to assist us with some selfies and make some suggestions for us along the way. It was well worth the time there, as there are not places like this in our city. I have so many pics, and memories but cant post too many as it will spoil your fun time there! Good little escape time out of sight seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarinnaCraig
40,And the Selfie Award goes to ðŸ˜ƒ,I thought my wife was the Queen of selfies. But honestly I may have had more fun here than she did. They have some interesting displays. When we went it was a very busy Saturday night so we got to watch some other people do their thing which gave for some interesting ideas. If youâ€™re timid or shy donâ€™t worry. All the people waiting and watching you take pictures are there for the same thing. Everyone just wants to have fun and get some cool pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCoxygenman
50,Very fun museum,"A nice surprise to discover this museum and take a lot of fun pictures. The staff was very helpful with ideas, thank you! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeWereBornToTravel
50,Awesome,"First and foremost I am from Orange County, California and decided to have a tourist day in LA. Best decision. I had so much fun visiting this museum. Very inexpensive and super creative inside. Very detailed on the stories of the selfie. Plus who doesn't love a good selfie. Loved it and highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dayzers_
50,Definitely one of a kind,"With the modern trend of selfies flourishing, it's no surprise that this everlasting phenomenon finally gets a dedicated space. Each section is carefully curated to encourage a shameless addiction to selfies while giving you a unique photo-op. While you're on Hollywood Blvd, it's definitely worth checking out displays and the unique history of selfies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthafambam
50,One trip isn't enough,"I feel like I have to return to the Museum with more outfits to change into to really get some cute photos for my feed. I came alone to check out the place, but I didn't get to really get the full experience out of it! I definitely need to come back with my S.O. because there were so many memorable cute sets to work with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janmomodo
50,Still full of emotions,"It was my first trip to the US,so I am full of emotions! And one of the strongest is after visiting this Museum! Highly recommend to everyone, you will never forget this sightseeing in LA. Thanks to the management of such a wonderful entertainment!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Szwiejk
50,Awesome photos,"This place is unique, i havenâ€™t seen something like it for quite a while. i think itâ€™s great for both, big companies and just spending some quality time alone because it really keeps you entertained. The owners are really nice and friendly :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kto9l

50,Fun Day Getting Great Photos!,"I spent about an hour here by myself just taking a ton of selfies. The music was great and I was energized and just had a ball! I am using the selfies for my social media, the backgrounds are super cool, so you can get some great shots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/642marlam
50,Lot of fun!,"Ok Museum of Selfies is real fun, although it's called a museum, it has nothing to do with standing in silence and observing exhibits passively. It's a place with lots of activity and interactive installations to play with and create awesome pics!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rudolf1983
50,My daughter's absolutely loved this place,"My girls loved this place. Had no idea it existed but they saw their favorite YouTubers come here so they wanted to see it too. They loved Emoji Ball Pit as well as the original Upside Down room. If you have your own little ones too, I highly recommend coming here. The staff was great and the physical props were awesome. It's clearly a great place for families looking to take unique photos; and we definitely got them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JishwuhDun
50,Top Notch Attraction,"Wow! Was very impressive right from the get go. Everything was hands on and you could take your own pictures with everything. The place is great to visit, especially with family or friends. good quality props, the setting and environment overall, including the staff. To get the best enjoyment and long lasting fun, be sure to go with a friend (that knows how to use a camera). Take all the pics that you want. My daughter went with us on this trip and it was much more fun than I anticipated! I would highly recommend this especially for teens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_Q377TL
50,Worth a Visit,"We enjoyed the museum and thought it was great because no one told you not to take pictures, no one was shouting rules, and we were welcomed to use the props around the rooms. The entire place is interactive and it was so much fun! Really good customer service, very cute place to take pictures with a group of friends or a date night. This place is really great for all different ages. My friend and I went and took a bunch of fun photos. We have been to other museums in the city but this one certainly is the most fun and most interactive. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsmylife2015
50,Selfie forever,"Unique experience you wonâ€™t get anywhere elseVery interactive, and itâ€™s fun to see others just being crazy and having fun! We loved our visit, so many cool photo opportunities, including a giant tub of money and gold! Well worth a visit in our opinion. Very much my style of museum where you don't just go to look at things. Very fun for kids and still interesting for adults. Didn't need to spend too much time there to get the full experience. Takes about 45 - 60 mins, depending on how many pictures you take. Lots of fun and laughter, everyone was enjoying themselves. We had a blast! Staff was great with helping to take pics!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliannazzy
50,Fun place,"What a fun place to visit, you can take as many pictures as you'd like and they even have a person there assisting you group pictures. There are some neat set ups for unique pictures, we spent about an hour and a half and it went by really fast. I highly recommend it. They also have student discounts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damiz2013

50,Your new favorite profile pic awaits...,"The amazing Museum of Selfies is the one place you can go where you can feel absolutely zero shame about taking duck lipped photos of yourself. This kitschy, fun and strangely informative museum in Hollywood takes you through the history of the selfie (yep, that's a thing) and then injects you into several perfectly curated selfie scenes where you can go just nuts with the props. Itâ€™s a lot of fun, and will definitely up your instagram game ðŸ’¯.Full video review on my youtube channel TravelClast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/therealserrini
50,fun for all ages,Fun place to go but I think it's a little pricey and kids and adult are same price.Despite that we liked it very much,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/624shadik
50,Truly an amazing and fun experience!,"A group of 4 girlfriends went one Sunday morning....and I can honestly tell you I had so much fun and have never laughed so much in 2 hours! Best time! The staff was amazing and so friendly! and Joshua is over the top a rock star! Helped with our selfie sticks....gave suggestions on angles, and what is best pic angle etc. Amazing fun, and would highly recommend!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GingerN633
50,Interactive fun at tourist area,Situated at Hollywood Blvd walk of fame along with other tourist spots. Walking distance from historic Grauman's Chinese Theater. No need to get back in your car to drive to this place. It is a fun interactive museum to take selfies with the various exhibits. They even lend you a selfie stick for free. Spent almost two hours to get that perfect selfie photo. Be aware that steep stairs to enter and there is no elevator. Check online third party sites for discounted tickets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maria2628
