10,God Awful-staff is rude,"FYI management at the NOVO is god awful, when floor admission reaches “x” amount which is no where near full they stop letting people in. Multiple people keep complaining because their website is not transparent about the rules and guidelines of the venue. It’s 100% Upper management’s fault, it’s terrible and all their staff treats you very poorly. Nothing you can do but while venue is nice, the experience is sub par",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donovank761
50,GREAT venue !,"Obviously, I cant tell you about any specific act there, but, what I CAN tell you is that the venue itself is wonderful - not a bad seat in the house.INSIDE the venue, food choices are limited but, plan just a little in advance, get there a little early, and you have your choice of places to eat in LA Live.All in all, if you have an opportunity to see a band here, by all means do so - much more fun than a mega-venue like the Forum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffB45
30,Great Sightlines BUT Poor Sound System,"Attended a concert, X & Los Lobos. The seat views were awesome for this relatively small venue. However, the sound system and overall acoustics needs some work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1WorldTraveler9
10,Awful Sound,"Went to Twiddle and SOJA in this place. Sound was awful. If a band is coming to this venue be prepared to have to rig this place yourself, which will take a pretty serious configuration. It's a shame, beautiful venue. But, with bad sound what good is it. If your band does not have some serious gear to rig this place *SELECT ANOTHER VENUE.Really think a refund from the venue is in order. Twiddle and SOJA were great, in a venue with awful house sound. Wouldn't want this to happen to other bands and their audiences. Steer clear from the NOVO.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertsO6230NR
50,Overall great experience!,"One of my favorite bands of all time played at this venue, Killswitch Engage and it was an awesome experience. I loved the venue set up, the sound, the views, the bar and the outdoor patio. It was nice to step outside and get some fresh air before the main attraction came on stage. I highly recommend everyone to experience a show here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/r0bin323
10,"Strict security, OK venue","My girlfriend and I went to a ticketed show at The Novo and got kicked out because my girlfriend ""bumped into wall"" walking into the bathroom right before the main act. Its been a few months and its still bothering me that I didn't get to see my favorite artist because my girlfriend bumped into a wall. If we had known the guards would be such sticklers we would have gone sober. I just want to warn anyone that plans on drinking at The Novo to be very careful and walk in straight lines everywhere (even in the bathroom)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sgeoff
50,Great Venue,"I've been here for a 2 concerts now and each time has been great. Great place and parking is easy to find. Lots of places to eat around too. We got pit tickets and were front row for both concerts. It did not feel crowded at all. I got to meet a lot of friendly people and leaving the concert venue we did not get as much traffic as we expected, totally easy to get back on the highway. The second concert we went to we parked at a different area than last time but the staff there was super nice and it was at a different area. Lots of security and and lighting all around. I know what to expect when i go to concerts here and look forward to going back each time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyt238
30,Great Venue But Too Smokey!,"My husband and I took our son and his friend to a concert at The Novo. It's a newish venue in the Staples Center area. Great place, sound was incredible, and didn't feel too crowded for over 2500 people. However, there were people smoking inside, lighting up in front of security guards and on stage and not one of them said anything. When I asked if they allowed smoking (because I thought it was illegal) they said no but they couldn't stop everyone from doing it. Well, I'd suggest start with those you see doing it. They did have a smoking patio, which no one used ...Honestly, it ruined the experience. I know it sounds whiny, but if you don't smoke, you're more sensitive to the smell. Anyway, we were all sick for a few days after the concert and I felt like I had smoked a pack myself.I've been to many concerts, in many venues across the US, and have not had that happen. So, it was disappointing. Otherwise, if not for that, the venue was super nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/54JenniferG
