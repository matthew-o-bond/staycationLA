40,"Vault Tour could be much, much better","This museum has a General Admission area with quite a lot of mainly custom vehicles. Then there is a basement packed with interesting cars called the ""vault"".The first area you pay your money and wander at will. For the vault it is a very structured tour at extra cost which takes about an hour. The structured nature of the vault tour somewhat spoils the experience. You are herded along looking at the cars the tour guide deems you will be interested in while there are many other cars of merit that are ignored. If you paused to look at other cars you are hurried along by the tail end charlie dragon lady. Tour takes an hour but you would need at least 3 hours to do the vault justice.Therefore disappointing. Also expensive.Had lunch in the restaurant which was nice until you get the bill and there is a 10% service charge not mentioned at all beforehand or on the menu. Food was good but portions small.Brought a leather jacket in the souvenir shop was good value for money considering the rest of the place.Good museum but could be so much better.I have read this is the best car museum in the world. It certainly is not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fredbloggs2014
40,Great Car Museum,"I expected to be so bored. I had no desire to go to the Peterson Auto Museum, but my grandson saw it on one of our drives so in we went. I thought this will be easy, I won't be reviewing it because I know I won't care for it, so best I keep my opinion to myself. I was so wrong.This place is super cool. They have every car you can imagine and more. There is a 2.4 million dollar car, whose name escapes me, but that car looks fast. They have low riders, which I love, and great futuristic cars.If you don't care that much for cars but like art, there is something here for you. Some of these cars have the coolest art work, from fantasy to just funny and all of it done perfectly. Whoever owed these painted cars must have loved them dearly.They have 2 fees and you can pick which one. There is this area called the ""vault"" and since we were there, I paid the higher price for the entire museum. I found it to be a fair value. Parking is pricey, which I hate and good luck finding street parking.All in all it was a fun time and we learned quite a bit. The people that work there are kind and know everything. So, as often happens my little grandson says, ""Bubbie stop the car"" and I think what he wants he gets and I will just pretend to love it. I am wrong more often than I can count. The kid should be a tour guide of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
50,Petersen Auto Museum,"Not our first visit. What we particularly enjoy about this museum is that every time we go (on family visits to LA) the curators have switched things up. In the half dozen times we have been, we have never seen identical exhibits so it’s always a fresh experience.The limited time exhibits, such as the current (at time of writing) James Hetfield of Metallica’s customized american cars and trucks, are always worth seeing. In addition, the Hollywood movie vehicle exhibit is varied and extensive. The display of EV evolution was timely and particularly interesting to my kids who are learning a lot about climate and social responsibility so it was very engaging.Never get bored of this place. I haven’t seen the famous vault collection yet but as a huge car enthusiast, will do next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11dragon64
50,The STARS are the cars,"Our day @ Knotts got washed out by the wx, so we retooled and decided to visit the Petersen Auto museum on a lark...more like a Skylark...Now, this museum isnt for everyone, but if you have anyone in the family who luves auto tech/auto designs, and the evolution of the motorcar, this ones for you. Total car celebs viewing with autos ranging from the vintage batmobile, the green hornet, bubblebee, back to the future, jurassic park, newer batman, and just about every cool car or truck used in the movies last 20-30 years. Some formula one and some NASCAR too..Yes some cars are in the vault in the basement and that requires additional fee, but for the two hours and pretty reasonable fee we had a blast and tons of memorable pics too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VicS906

50,Awesome Place to Visit!,"Our family (Mum, Dad, 2 daughters 10 and 15) visited because my husband is a car fanatic. It's fair to say the girls and I were sceptical we would be interested. We were wrong! The Petersen is a brilliant place for everyone to visit, there are movie cars, the Ironman suit, Pixar cars, cars from the earliest of days to the future!The shop and staff in the shop were brilliant and I regret not having bought more as I ended up shipping in stuff once we got back to New Zealand!It is a quick uber to The Grove for lunch and LACMA is across the street along with the La Brea Tar Pits. You can definitely spend a day in this area with the Petersen as your main port of call.This is a great stop for families and of course anyone who loves cars.My husband also did a vault tour and highly recommends it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808StephB-NZ
20,Pretty much not worth it,"Only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the cars and displays are actually nice and really cool. But let's talk about the bad stuff about this place... It is OVERLY PRICED!! 18 bucks just for parking after 30 mins... Then add another 16 bucks just for general admission... This place is REALLY small for this amount of money.I wanna add something else, you can walk in without having to pay, they will already have a couple of things on display. Then you have a couple of doors you can walk into. Apparently you then have to pay for general admission, which I did not know by the way. But nobody told me anything as I was walking through. I looked around the 1st and 2nd floor without a problem and even talked to some of their staff asking questions about the displays and cars. When I got to the 3rd floor, I managed to look around 3/4 of the floor. I ran into 1 other staff and he said that I needed to pay. I said I didn't know anything and im sorry. He said I needed to leave. Keep in mind it was 15 mins before closing. I asked him, well I honestly didn't know and I talked to some of your staff and they didn't say a word about having to pay another 16 bucks just for the general admission, neither the staff on the 1st floor told me anything as I was walking through. He said, that I am completely wrong. That I sneaked in and been hiding from his staff. And that either way I need to pay for the general admission or leave with a high nasty tone of voice. I told him, well it's 15 mins till you guys close. I would have paid if I knew. Is it possible if I can just finish seeing these last few displays? In a extremely rude way he said ""you need to get the hell out!"" I couldn't control myself but I had to say that ""it's funny, because you are a literal joke... And started to see my way out.In the end, im glad I never gave them the OVERLY PRICED museum and saw literally almost all of the museum and took all the pics that I wanted, minus literally about 6 or 7 cars before the guy wanted to play dumb***.In the end the only cool thing about this place is the random nice cars and displays they have.But the CON is, that it is OVERLY PRICED for such a small museum. And has one of the rudest and stupidest staff ever. I wish i got his name, but didn't realize to look at his tag. Only go, if you have ran out of things to do and check out in LA. A last resort type of thing if you will.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damianrA3529GF
40,Cool cars!,"This was the very first place that we visited when we got to LA. It was Easter Sunday, so we were happy to see that it was open. We enjoyed seeing the batmobile, the car from “Back to the Future”, among others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moonlady456
50,It’s a must!,What a tour! I’m not into cars but joined my hubby ! That was the best decision ! The museum is for car enthusiasts that’s for sure. I did enjoy it especially the cars from the famous movies!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chickitos
50,A Must for Auto Enthusiasts,"We purchased tickets in advance online to visit the museum and take The Vault tour. I loved the creative exterior architecture of the building. We parked in their covered garage ($16/day) and left our vehicle there while we visited La Brea and Petersen and ate lunch. The main exhibit when we visited was ""Hollywood Dream Machines"", cars featured in motion pictures. As a movie lover, this made the auto museum even more interesting to me than it might have been. I also really enjoyed the gallery on ""Artistry of the Automobile"" with unique sculptural creations by Ed Roth. My husband preferred the exotic sports cars and racing cars. We saw several iconic cars in person that we have seen featured on car culture or hot rod television shows. The vault tour was definitely interesting but pretty intense; two hours of a docent firing info at us to fit in as many cars as possible. It's in the underground concrete garage, so it was cool (wear a sweater) and there was no restroom break. The groups are kept small (about 12-15 people) and you have to stay together close by the docent for security purposes. We learned a lot but it was frustrating that there were still many interesting cars we could see further back in the garage that we couldn't get close to and didn't hear about. I was also disappointed that photography is not allowed in The Vault. The museum has a large souvenir store and a restaurant, but prices at both were expensive in our opinion. The entire building including the vault was wheelchair accessible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrankingChick

50,Simply the best automotive museum we have ever visited.,"We discovered the Petersen by accident! We were on our way to LACMA, and espied the stunning red-walled, stainless-steel wrapped exterior, and saw that it was an automotive museum. We thought we might quickly spend an hour before continuing to our original destination. After a so-so lunch at the on-site restaurant, we began looking at the cars and trucks (and some motorcycles) on display on the three floors. We ended up spending the entire afternoon there, because there was so much to see. We even signed up for the (extra) 5:15 pm Vault Tour (with Donald, the superb docent), which lasted 90 minutes. Frankly, if you are interested in cars, it is worth going to L.A., just to see this incredible museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Professional-Pilgrim
40,Vault Tour was pretty great,"Okay, full disclosure: I don't know the first thing about cars. And I don't care about them much. However, I was traveling with my brother, and he LOVES cars. My brother is GRUMPY. I don't think I've seen him enjoy himself as much in AGES as he was on the Vault Tour at Petersen. He was giddy. When I was planning the trip, I knew he'd geek out here, so I decided to splurge and get tickets to the Vault Tour (a tour of their basement vault: 60,000 square feet, more than 250 special cars not viewable without taking the Vault Tour). The Vault Tour is $39/person, and it includes regular admission. That's a fact I missed when I booked our Vault Tour online. So our tour was at 5:15pm, and we arrived around 4:50. We were told when we checked in for our tour that the museum itself closed at 6, so even though our tour wouldn't be over until after 6, we would only be able to visit the rest of the museum for the next few minutes until our tour began. I wish I'd pay more attention to the information on the website, because we didn't get to spend much time in the museum before our tour began! Like I said, I'm not much of a car person. But this tour seemed to THRILL the car enthusiasts on the tour (my brother included). I got excited a few times when the history of the cars related to famous people (there was a car given to Carole Lombard by Clark Gable, several cars owned by Steve McQueen, U.S. presidents, Saddam Hussein, and other historic figures). I didn't understand about the cars' engineering, but there were plenty of cars that were historic due to their provenance (the last car RFK rode in before he was assassinated) - these were my favorites. My brother was definitely more knowledgeable/interested in the cars for engineering/racing reasons. But we both enjoyed the tour! It was long - our tour started at 5:15 and didn't end until 6:45. I think my brother would have stayed for another hour, but we had dinner plans so I wish I'd known how long the tour was! Our tour guide (I can't remember his name) was so knowledgeable and clearly LOVED giving the Vault Tour. He was funny and seemed to know everything about every car. Even this girl who knows nothing about cars enjoyed the Vault Tour. My brother LOVED it. Definitely a worthwhile tour for car enthusiasts. Worth the money if you love cars (and maybe even if you don't).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisrachelletx

Awesome collection of current popular vehicles including the Batmobile(s), Bat Cycle, vehicles from Star Wars, Blade Runner, Aliens, Clockwork Orange, Super Bee, to custom cars with outrageous paint jobs. Truly a fun time. Good for families and middle age children. There is a restaurant inside where you can get a good Italian meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhiteLakeWanderer
50,Awesome collection. Consider the vault...,"There are some awesome vehicles on display with lots of room to take photos without them getting photobombed. One thing that is very important and disappointing was the prohibition of photos in the vault. The vault is the underground garage. Here they have an amazing collection of some very rare and spectacular vehicles. My only complaint is you can't take a photo and must rely on your memory to recall their beauty. The don't tell you no photos until after you have paid and just about to go on the guided tour. It is worth is, but still a very big disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8947IOrichardb
40,An enjoyable morning,"This was our second time to the museum as we had been her about 10 or so years ago. And somehow I remember it being better back then. Although it is organized into the 3 levels - history, design, and future, it still seemed like a bit of random collection. There’s lots of one offs from movies and TV shows but significant cars like the first Corvette, early 911s, or the first Civic would make more sense. GMs EV-1, VW Beetle, and a replica of the first Benz motor carriage are indeed there so there are some interesting cars for sure.I found it to be a bit pricey as well for a 2 hour visit.However, our family enjoyed our time so no regrets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twindad2013

Many old and new vehicles are on display and make good subjects for photos. Clean Bathrooms on each floor. Nice restaurant in the building.

40,AN INTERESTING AUTOMOTIVE MUSEUM!,We visited Petersen Automotive Museum in 2007 and LOVED the collection of antique classic cars but now the Museum has totally changed. The outside of the building is a fascinating landmark facade. The upstairs collection's entrance fee of $16 has more movie and special effects vehicles which are interesting. But one has to buy an additional $28 ticket to view the Vault with a guide. The Vault has very UNIQUE & ONE OF A KIND VEHICLES which are in IMMACULATE SHOW QUALITY condition. But many more of these vehicles should be displayed in the main upstairs showrooms of the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christenai

I was so impressed on my first visit, I brought my husband and father back for the amazing history of the vehicles in the vault.This is an additional ticket, but well worth it.

50,Ultra high quality and professional museum,"This is a superb museum where you can learn a lot thanks to the way displays are organized and have various explanations. There is a lot of variety in the displays and groupings. The ""vault"" tour was very interesting as it is a small group led by a VERY knowledgeable docent spending one and a half hours describing many cars and their historical and societal impact. The have a superb Italian restaurant that while a fair value, is perhaps high priced and not a good choice for families with children. I'm one of those who does not like the exterior appearance, but inside, everything is very attractive and well organized.

50,Vault Tour is Worth It,"I did the vault tour here, and if you are a car nerd like myself you should absolutely do it. The other cars in the museum are mostly concept art or were film/video game industry cars which are cool but the main attraction in my opinion is the vault tour.

I hope that later there is a more extensive tour of the vault; there are over 100 cars and I would love to go over each and every one of them but I know that's not necessarily feasible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Journey41888864769

50,Must do Vault tour,"Like most parking garages in LA area, I've found, the entrance is easy to drive past, so don't miss it. You can see a few cars before you officially enter the paid area of museum. Luckily I noticed the sign of where to meet for the Vault tour as the people working the desk hardly said two words to me as I showed them my prepaid ticket and collected my wristbands. Be on time for tour, as they won't wait a second longer! The vault tour lasted 90 minutes, so hit bathroom in advance. You see a lot very quickly and the vast majority of cars can only be viewed from front. No pics and no walking in between, which is understandable. Many vehicles of historical significance. You don't need to be a car nerd to appreciate the history of the people associated with the cars or their beauty. Spent about an hour in rest of museum quickly looking, but not reading much or watching videos. So, plan more time if that's your intention. I don't watch action or sci-fi movies, but if you do, there would be lots to see in the main museum area. I've been to about 4 car museums, but this one focused much more on those used in movies and tv. Good selection of race cars, too. Less of a focus on general car history, imo, unless you go to vault.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyjkuss
50,Great surprise,"Believe me not just boring cars on display, this place is well worth a visit as it represents many cars from famous movies and they go back in history showing you some of the first cars and motorcycles, my wife was a bit interested in going here, I persuaded her to come and she loved it, well worth visiting if you are local or a visitor to LA like we are. It’s a very reasonable entry fee.Great experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithg547
40,Fun place to spend part of a day,Not as big as I expected but had lots of nice displays/exhibits. You don't have to be a car fanatic to appreciate this museum. Has a little something for all age groups. I did not know some of the vehicles from current games and movies but I did know the ones from the 70's and 80's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeesaD27
50,A Car Lover's Dream,This place is a must see for any car enthusiast. They have so many cool old cars and historic movie cars too. It's fun for kids to old timers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkute65
40,A crazy modern facade houses cars used in movies,"From futuristic armored vehicles to both Batmobiles and the Shah of Iran's Bugatti, the Petersen will entertain all ages. There are even race-circuit simmulators to try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jarchcun
40,Pretty nice,"It's certainly a very interesting collection of cars. Being in LA it's understandable that there are quite a many movie cars on display but I would have preferred more of the ""real"" cars. Definitely worth a visit anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPAT75
40,Fascinating,"The Peterson Museum was fascinating for us, car aficionados and not so much. The very first car, the Shah’s Bugatti was the highlight...wow, incredible! Then, the historic cars, the movie cars, the race cars and the cars of the future were all so interesting and fascinating. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCtravelerWS
40,Impressive cars but vault group too big,"Worth a visit if you are a car fan. The museum is laid out nicely. The regular price admission allows you to see movie cars, prototypes, and cool cars. The Batmobiles, the Joker Mobile, Back to the Future cars, Too Fast Too Furious are just a few. NASCAR and Indy cars and quite a few motorcycles add to the collections.The Vault is an additional ticket to view impressive car history. Original cars and those of The Pope, Saddam Hussein, Eva Peron, Imelda Marcos, too many celebrities to mention are in the vault. No photos permitted in the vault.To see one of the 5 surviving 60th anniversary Mustangs or to learn history of “it’s a doozy” is worth the admission.Need a break? There is a cafe and gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbbyers67
50,Wheel Watching Wonderland,"All the species of terra firma transportation you can think of displayed under one roof. All the wheeled imaginations of man are on display with written and video histories complementing these sculptures of mechanical motive art. The Petersen has it all from the beauties to the beasties, it’s the Prado of Auto!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevewO1144GP
50,Awsome place not what you would expect,Way way better than i expected When you hear auto museum and instantly think of older cars. This was not the movie cars that were ordered but it also has a lot of the newer movie cars Waymore than I expected it had motorcycles and other vehicles in it as well definitely worth a visit in the money I never expected to see when I sought I figured you would only find these things at Studios,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kemp2002
40,Design excellence,"The Petersen Automotive Museum design is excellence, it looks like the effect of wind over surfaces of a car, only saw from the bus tour, no time to go inside but it does sound good as it looks excellent with the red and silver contrast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
50,One of the Best!,"In a city that loves its cars and makes movies, this museum has plenty of memories of both.From iconic movie famous vehicles to rare one offs, history and race vehicles, plenty to see and fairly good value for entry too. Make a couple of hours spare to get through the 3 levels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rodstarontour
40,Cool museum! Cool cars!,"Beautifully laid out exhibits that give you space to appreciate the range of cars on display. If you have or are an automotive enthusiast, you will definitely enjoy “the vault tour “ ~ letting you see what they don’t have on exhibit floors (my husband was in car heaven!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Athenaex
50,The Cars That Made America,"Set in a magnificent construct we really enjoyed the time here. Previously we had seen the fascinating three part TV series The Cars That Made America. It was great seeing here so many of the cars that featured in the history.Delighted to see some of the earliest motors, particularly the 1886 Benz and Model T Ford from the early 1900s.The former can be regarded as the first practical car and was financed by Benz’s wife Bertha. In fact Bertha made the world’s first long distance car journey of 121 miles to promote the car, refuelling with the hydrocarbon ligroin at pharmacies along the way.Moving through the decades we saw splendid classic, vintage and veteran exemplars. While most are American a number of European ones also feature, particularly Citroen and Bugatti.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia

50,The Vault Tour was Outstanding,"The Petersen is a great museum, the cars and information on the main floors are worth the price of admission, but if you really want to see the very cool and old stuff, a vault tour is a must. Our guide, Peter, was extremely knowledgeable and entertaining. There were only 5 of us on his tour so it was quite a nice experience. He said that at busy times they may have 50 on a tour--with that many it seems like it would be hard to hear his stories. No photos are allowed in the vault.The ""normal"" floors have a lot of cars that will interest kids.My wife, who is not a car person, really liked the vault tour. Peter really did a great job linking the cars to their times.Oh--and the restaurant is excellent. And you never know who you will see in the LA area. A famous actor was there taking a tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevekY201SZ
50,Cool collection/Excellent Staff,"Visited the museum for the first time on 12/6/2019 with my dad. We were blown away by the collection, and enjoy how the vehicles were organized by floor. My dad knows Gene Winfield, so it was cool to check out his work up close. Favorite floor was the third, where we spoke with a very friendly and knowledgable docent Ben. He approached us throughout our visit and sparked up conversation about the collection with some funny anecdotes and historical context. Very impressed by this guy--he deserves recognition for making visitors feel very welcome.The bottom floor was also extremely neat. Loved checking out more cinematic vehicles from films like A Clockwork Orange, Blade runner and Mad Max. The museum is set up well, with a high level of polish--and this collection is insane. We will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmyth90
50,If you love cars you will love this place,"Not your typical auto museum but and an interesting a varied history about cars, racing, technology and movie cars. Kids will enjoy it too. Loved the distinctive outside style of the building and the inside was spacious and well-organized. Ate in the very nice restaurant in the museum and it was very good too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Durbanguy

30,cars vs. movie nostalgia,"There are great cars in this super attractive building. If one is interested in movie memorabilia, one will not be disappointed. If one is interested in sports cars, try instead the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia. My interest in sports cars was not satisfied by this museum where I had to look at batmobiles and such movie artifacts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PascoBob
50,Incredible,Blown away. Exceptional attraction. Professional state of the art facility. The vault tour is a must. Very impressed. Car park is attached so very convenient and the bus stops outside too. So many rare cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottF1827
50,Quality Car Museum Highlight of LA Trip,This is my second visit to this museum. They keep changing exhibits with quality offerings and thoughtful displays. I recommend their new exhibit on electric vehicles. Well documented and worht the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dogwalks
50,Car museum,We combined this trip with a visit to la brea tar pit which is a short walk away. The museum was well worth the trip with historic and futuristic vehicles as well as interactive components. It is worth the inexpensive Uber trip from downtown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orangebowl2014
50,One of a kind!,If you consider yourself a car guy(or gal) then this place is a must see!! So many one of kinds its hard to believe. Very cool and completely interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markrT7685WG
50,Totally worth it,"If you are a car lover, this is a must!! You will see all kind of cars. You will see concept cars, movie cars, race cars, etc.In other words this a paradise and has great history of the automotive industry, it will take 2-3 hours to go through the museum.If you are in L.A stop by the Petersen museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sachi1612
50,Perfect visit for car lovers,I so enjoyed the Petersen museum visit during my last trip to LA. I love cars and that visit was over my expectations. I saw gorgeous classic vintage cars. I am so in love on the Shelby Cobra and other cars in the exhibit. I offered myself. Atour in the vault and I wish I could have taken pics of Steve McQueen's xkss and magnums Ferrari. Some cars deserve to be better exposed just to afford to see face and back but anyway I loved the vault and for sure it worth a additional fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronanb349
50,Entertaining car museum for car enthusiasts and for those who are not.,"I fall into the latter category - I appreciate cars but not to the extent that the husband does, who eats, breathes and sleeps CARS. Many of the cars are associated with some movie or tv show, so they are relatable. There are also many special cars that you would not see anywhere else. There is also a special “Vault” tour that you can sign up for, though the group was a little large. The visit was much more enjoyable than I anticipated and would recommend it to everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vansancopp
10,"Once great, now just a ripoff","I visited several times prior to the rebuild, enjoyed the fine classics and showbiz cars, and each time bought a T-shirt. I was there Nov 10 for the first visit since reopening and was very disappointed. For $16 (plus $16 to park) you now mainly get showbiz and Cal car culture stuff plus concepts, many recent. Where did the Petersen's great collection of classics go? Ah...they're now down in ""the vault"" which costs an extra $44 to see! The redone building is very nice but I go to car museums to see classic cars, not architecture, and not be fleeced for it. This time, no T-shirt. I told a docent my feelings. He leaned in and said, ""I hear that a lot now, sir, sorry to say.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidkP9117MP
50,Best auto museum in the world!!,Well worth a visit. Museum is really well done. Clean environment and helpful staff. The cars are awesome and information is great. Lots of cars from the movie. Really good price and well worth the money. Good parking too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorna12390
50,Amazing!,"We loved this museum - so many cool cars and the building was beautiful. I wish we planned to go through the VIP tour but our timing was off,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JotenLakeAcres
50,Pictures cannot capture the beauty of theses cars,"Took two hour vault tour. Worth it. If I were to do it again I would go through the general admission run through the museum -- 3 floors before going on the vault tour which offers details and history on the vehicles -- so you are primed for the vault. Photos cannot capture the beauty of the paint work, esp. the low rider cars. There's sparkle in the paint that just cannot be pictured and has to be seen in person. There's something for everyone even sci-fi vehicles from Blade Runner, Mad Max, and Back to the Future. Hubby liked the muscle cars, I liked the 50s cars - think American Graffiti. Lunch place not great and outside homeless hanging around, uneasy walking from Petersen to nearby art museum and La Brea tar pits, which is also pleasant in the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pouvoir7
50,Great history of US auto history,"Thanks to the Robert Peterson family, generations will enjoy the history of US auto history, A must see if you’re in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K2057EOjimm
50,If you love cars you cannot miss this place!,"Visited the Porsche exhibit, for a Porsche fan it was a great look at the history of the car and the company. Take the tour of the private collection in the underground garage, cars that made history!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/575troyp
10,Weak exhibition,"I went to see an interesting car museum, unfortunately It was disappointing. Very boring and lean. I expected much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristos2018
30,So So For Us,"We went to the Peterson Auto Museum on November 1 and found it to be different than what we were anticipating. To be honest we did not research the museum before going so deserve what we got with how our experience was. I was thinking classic cars, which they have, but they are in the vault (basement) at $28 pp extra on top of the $16 pp for general admission. There were 3 in our party and paid $14 pp with a CSAA discount that they offer at the door so thought another $84 was silly.Most of the vehicles on display with the general admission were movie related. This was okay but I didn’t realize that would be most of the exhibit. They have the Back to the Future DeLorean, the Tron motorcycle (cool but not an automobile), the Hunger Games ATV parked in the garage and many other vehicles from different movies.There was a paid private event taking place so most of the second floor was closed and not available to paying customers during our visit. This was not very good in our opinion and suggest that private events be held after regular business hours so paying visitors don’t get taken advantage of.Lastly parking here for our one-and-a-half-hour visit was $17. I did look at reviews after our visit and was very surprised by the high rating. Sorry but this place seemed like more of a money grab than anything. This was a bit of a disappointment for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFtravelbugs
50,a must see for car lovers,large collection of cars with really unusual ones. The Vault is a must do if you are going there. Can easily spend hours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/notreallynotagain
50,The Ultimate Auto Museum,"Anyone who loves automobiles or just enjoys viewing a masterful selection of automobiles will love this museum of every type of Automotive type one can imagine. Large, spacious, well maintained and the vehicles on display are excellent, to say the least. A wise choice for spending a day or partial day and definitely worth the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonygW9228EC
40,Pretty cool - wish we did the vault,"So we hit the Petersen before dinner on Friday night and we were impressed. A love letter to the automobile and car culture, this institution founded by the former publisher of Hot Rod Magazine has choice selections that range across both automotive history and pop culture. There's a fun design lab for kids to enjoy, technical exhibits for gearheads and just the right amount of landmark automobiles and movie cars to keep the interest for everyone.However, for serious gearheads, you have to do the vault. We opted not to in an effort to save time and money and we were done in an hour. It's not cheap (an extra $27 I think), but next time I am in LA, I will opt for it and find a meal closer to the Museum. Again, Petersen is great, but I think I would have had an even better time had I done the vault. Mea culpa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKB1701
30,"third visit in 5 years, but I get less enamoured","Cam back for the expanded vault tour. Yes, more cars. But the same dreary Soviet style 'minders' hoverering about, same no photo rule down there (""for security reasons"" - what??) and the guide made a fair amount of factual mistakes discussing the cars I know something about. Heavy focus on the racing stuff - not interesting to me, and the hot rods (at least I get that given the founder's legacy). Upstairs not much changed, though the concept cars are a valuable, appreciated (and rotating) part of history. First floor is the special exhibit space and, while I once saw a great collection of Bugattis, this time was much less interesting - someone's idea of 'cars of the future'. 2nd floor always seems to be movie cars - not my thing. All in all only fair for the price, which is VERY expensive once you include the vault and parking. Will probably skip for the next few years and then make very certain the special exhibit at that time wants attention.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
50,The best thing we did in L.A,We done the Peterson Automotive Museum and Vault tour and it was fantastic. I only wish I did the extended vault tour to get more time down there. This tour is fantastic for both car l9vers and non-car lovers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattbN8406LA
50,Petersen's magnificent Auto museum,"Wow, Wow and more Wow. $16 well worth the money. 3 levels jammed with amazingly kept motor vehicles. a feast for a motor enthusiast's eyes. They also had a tribute on the roof for Jessi Combs which was an absolute honor to attend. The outside of the building is inspiring but the inside is magical. 5 stars from me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quentinm339
40,Very Nice,"All three floors were either race cars or cars from sci-fi movies.. I was expecting more of the classics. I had booked the Vault tour. Guide was fantastic...however she mostly talked about the exotics...Ferraris and such. Great for most...just not my cup o tea. Next time I'm there, I'll go again as I know the exhibits do change. Live and learn. I'll go again and it is recommended....just check ahead",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AhoyGuy
50,The Jessi Combs Memorial at The Petersen Museum,Flew to L.A. from Houston to attend the Jessi Combs Memorial at the Petersen Museum. Terry Madden and crew prepared a great presentation on Jessi's life. Somber time in the Penthouse. Took the time to check out the vehicles on display afterwards. Fascinating building and incredible automotive history. Great staff and very nice atmosphere....A lot has changed since I had been there 10 years previously. I now wish to bring my grandchildren to share. Definitely worth the the trip! I highly recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyloyd25
50,Well Maintained Museum,Very clean museum. More cars than I expected. Unique cars and cars from movies. The descriptions next to each car were very helpful for people who really don't know much about cars!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carrieg1982
50,Full of Historic and Movie Cars!,"I went here one day after hearing good things and I was impressed with all the cars they had, whether it was historic cars like a 1939 Bugatti from the Shah of Iran or iconic movie cars like the DeLorean from Back to the Future, different versions of the Batmobile (Adam West and Michael Keaton eras), the run-down metal machines from Mad Max: Fury Road, and various futuristic cars from movies like Minority Report, AI: Artificial Intelligence and Blade Runner.I also really enjoyed the more modern energy efficient vehicles coming out now, there’s an exhibit on new motorcycles that are fully electric which was fascinating. There were also some avant-garde “disruptor” cars that looked more like black sculptures rather than actual vehicles you could drive.The building is very unique as well and very prominent in Miracle Mile with its steel ribbons. Check this place out even if you’re not a big car fanatic, there’s bound to be something you’ll enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014

50,Fabulous cars,"A lovely few hours looking at cars that have been in the movies and the history of automotive vehicles.There’s a fabulous cafe/ restaurant on site too.Toilets are located on all floors and you start the tour at the top floor and work your way down. There is an extra tour that you can add on that takes you into the vaults, but sorry no under 10’s allowed in that part.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAJMR05

Won't be disappointed checking this place out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KC_Ultraveler
50,Fascinating place,Visited Petersen Automotive Museum with family so much to see. Very impressive layout suitable for all the family. We paid for general tickets but they also offer an additional vault tour containing over 250 additional vehicles which we didnt go for as we were pushed for time sadly. Good play facility for younger kids if needed as well. $16 adults $11 children 4-17Parking on site $20,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ventoraisle
50,A great stop on the Starline bus tour,"We took a chance on getting off our hop on hop off bus tour, which turned out to be a much needed, air conditioned amazing place, on a 30 degree day!Even if you’re not a car enthusiast, but you love the movies, you will love this museum.They have cars from every era and many great movies, along with other memorabilia from movies such as: Bumblebee, Tron, Batman, Blade Runner, Minority Report, the list goes on.There’s a great kids interactive area and a race car simulator area.My husband and our 3 girls all loved this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helthea
50,Auto enthusiast heaven,"We spent over 3 hours easily. My partner took soooo many photos, I am not a huge car buff but loved this museum. Well presented, each exhibit had an information board.

Only disappointment - no taking pictures allowed at the Vault tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thomasero

40,Interesting Cars,"It was good to walk around, when I went there are some concept cars, the Delorian from Back to the Future, a small section of speed cars in a seperate room with a tiny video clip on the screen also. We only did the standard tour which I think was enough. The museum is wheelchair accessible also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BecksPoint
40,Nice but not #1,"We spent a few hours here. Parking is easy as they have a paid garage next door. There were many movie cars all from the same movies. Personally I’d rather see real cars but that’s just me.There were some interesting displays of old car memorabilia, travel maps, pictures, etc.The exterior is the building is unique - you cannot miss it driving by.Spend some time and utilize your already paid for parking and walk across the street and see the La Brea Tar Pits. Also during lunchtime on a weekday there are several food trucks parked on Wilshire.We did all three and it made for a nice day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leahb908
40,"Awesome Museum, but.......","Awesome museum with some insane cars that I never thought i'd get the opportunity to see.I did the extended vault tour, it was just ok. The tour guides are incredibly knowledgeable. My only real advice is if you are interested in pre 1955 cars take the tour. That seems to be whats it's more focused around. There are newer cars down there like mclarens, ferrari's, gold delorean, indycar, nascar & drag cars, concept rx7, and some movie cars but they seemed to not get the spotlight over alot of the old stuff that im not overly interested in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_FennecFox
50,Automobile heaven,"Finally found the time to visit the Petersen. I visited one afternoon during the week. They provide a great parking lot for visitors, with easy access into the Museum.

40,THE place for car lovers,"Lots of vehicles used in the movies - cool, cars from all eras - cool, displays and interactive exhibits - cool. BUT if you really want a great experience take the tour of the vault. If you love cars you don't want to miss this. Small groups are guided through their basement ""vault"" led by very knowledgeable and personable guides. One drawback: they could use more benches you will spend a lot of time on your feet and a plce to sit a spell would be nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GnarlyChef
50,Awesome Museum for the Car Enthusiast,"WOW this place is incredible with many, many, many, motorcycles and cars, from movies, historical, one-of-a kind, etc. Too many to mention.

Unfortunately the tour is not for little ones 8 and and under, but families should enjoy the other 3 floors of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BackPacker557014
40,Cool place to visit during LA trip,"We stopped in the museum on a 'free' day that we had in LA last month. The cars on display were fantastic to see, particularly those from a number of big movies - I liked seeing the cars from Mad Max and 2 Fast 2 Furious.We chose admission tickets to the main museum only which we thought was ample as there was a huge amount of vehicles on display.Worth a visit whether or not you are a car enthusiast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samkuzmar
50,Must see for people who love cars and/or cars in movies,"I am both - grew up in Southern California, son of a mechanic, so had a love of cars of all types, and everything about them - the engineering, the design, what cars symbolized and how they evolved through the years. I also enjoy watching movies, and for some, the car was either an integral part of the movie or helped to create the whole experience. This museum plays to both of those passions. I spent the extra money and took a tour of the vault, and I was in heaven! They have everything in there - from Ford Model T's (and before) to low riders with unbelievable paint jobs to race cars (Can Am, funny cars, F1) to hypercars (the McLaren is a work of art!). And for the cinema car buffs, the regular museum features cars from movies such as ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (I could practically see Max inside the Interceptor on display) to Blade Runner to Minority Report. There is so much more, for those who just want to understand how much Southern California shaped the car culture, this museum does an excellent job.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkr0d
50,If Your A Car Buff,"If you are in the LA area, and a car buff you must make it a point to visit the Peterson Automotive Museum. Spend the extra money and do the 2 hour tour of the vault as you will not be dissapointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregkelliher55
50,A must visit museum,Beautiful display of a wide variety of exceptional automobiles. Facility is well organized and perfectly maintained. Very helpful and well informed staff. Take the tour of the stored cars to add to the experience. We found the restaurant to be terrific as well. I could rationalize a trip across the country just to see this museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BCtravel4fun
50,An outstanding visit,"We visited the Vault on a tour with Jason, who knew his stuff! Wandered through the museum, with our goal to see Big Oly. NICE! Enjoyed all of the cars on display. Friendly staff answered our questions. We then decided to have lunch at DRAGO. Prosciutto and melon was so tasty. Ahi Tuna Salad and the Rib Ravioli were delicious. You do not need to go inside the Museum to eat at DRAGO, there is an entrance from the street. We highly recommend this restaurant. A wonderful day spent at the Petersen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JUNO1975
50,Worth it,The extended vault tour was worth it and Jeff was a very knowledgable tour guide. From seeing the first Ferrari to the latest tech it's worth the price of admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andy9775
50,Amazing Museum,I would highly recommend this museum to young and old and everyone in between. It is an incredible collection of automobiles. Very knowledgeable tour guide in the vault which is a must!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/604karennes
50,Don’t miss this amazing museum!,"Even if you’re not a car buff you will not be disappointed with this huge collection of authentic cars from movies and having belonged to stars and political figures. You’ll see a car from Star Wars, the DeLorean from Back to the Future, old cars, new cars, etc., all beautifully restored. Be sure to take a guided tour and absolutely don’t miss a guided tour of the Vault. No photos are allowed, but we saw a car that Elvis bought and shot (we saw the bullet holes in the steering wheel!), cars owned by Katharine Hepburn, Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, Audrey Hepburn and Dwight Eisenhower’s armored car. There is even a 24k gold car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanneRI
40,Must like cars to go,"There are a large amount of cars from movies and TV shows like the old Batman Bat-mobile and the new Bat-mobile. A bit pricey, and you can add upgraded tickets for a different experience. If there are discount tickets, search first. It was a last minute place to go with kids after seeing the Tar Pits almost across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigEvilBaby
50,amazing,"Great place for car buffs, my husband was in seventh heaven. 3 floors plus a vault of amazing cars and other stuff. good service and friendly staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarieGuelph_Canada
50,Petersen Auto Museum,"Absolutely loved it, well worth the visit and good value for money. Would definitely recommend. Need at least half a day, could spend the whole day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/554veritym
50,4 day stay in LA,Since I dragged my husband to 3 baseball games i had to find something for him that he liked. this was a great surprise. Didn't realize how big this museum. it was amazing. he thoroughly enjoyed it and wished he has another day to go back. The vault 2 hr tour was his favorite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarieGuelph_Canada
50,Fun and interesting,"I never thought of visiting an automotive Museum but I had heard good things. Although I am not a car buff, we really enjoyed our visit. We did the shorter vault tour which my husband loved. It was pretty cool! Just the idea of being behind closed doors and the cavernous area Full of interesting old cars. We also really enjoyed the displays and the augmented reality glasses. Lots of cool things from movies. The restaurant was pretty good too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSQRD1
30,Nice cars,"The place is nice and they are displaying a few very interesting cars. However, the admission fee is a little pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StonedAngel
50,Great Visit,"We decided to check out this museum with our 5 year old, 15 year old son who loves cars and 12 year old daughter. All of our children enjoyed the experience, as did my husband and I. It was entertaining and a great way to kill a couple hours in Los Angeles. Definitely worth the entrance fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBennett82
40,Great collection! But slightly overpriced,This museum has a great selection of cars but it is overpriced for the amount of cars you actually get to see - do it again? probably not.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erin123452019
50,Fantastic museum!,If you're into your movies you'll love that place. All the cars from timeless classic films. You can spend a lot of time here because there's so much to see! Would highly recommend a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradleyp1992
50,Vault Tour is a Must!,"The vault tour is a must in order to see the large number of unique vehicles that are housed in the underground garage. The guide was very knowledgeable and explained the story behind some of the vehicles that hold a specific historical significance. There were a number of funny/interesting/intriguing background stories to the vehicles in the vault that made the tour fly by. This is not just a tour for ""car"" people. Well worth a visit while in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ForeverKauai
50,"If you are into cars, this is a must","Great collection of vehicles included the car from the Jetson's and much more. You should check this out, you can spend hours there looking at cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mitchdsm
10,Vault Tour - BEWARE,"Imagine being 10 years old standing in a huge candy store and only being allowed to be around a handful of displays - SO FRUSTRATING! The majority of the info given by the guide can be obtained online, so the goal of the tour should be to see as many cars as possible. Instead, we stood by one car for 5+ minutes at a time listening to a lecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiggyw2019
50,The Vault is a must see,"Impressive auto museum with great information and interactive exhibits, but the best part of the visit was the extra vault visit for the most spectacular number of cars from ford original, movie star (Lauren Bacall), Pope mobile, presenting cars along with racing cars. The guide was fantastic and his enthusiasm and knowledge for the cars was outstanding",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roz_n_Dave2013
40,"Super museum, beautiful building, you need to know your US car models to truly appreciate it",I visited the museum in late July 2019. It is a beautiful building both inside and out. The cars are well presented and there isn't a speck of dust to be seen. I opted for the 2 hour Vault visit which in hindsight was probably a mistake for me personally. As a European visitor that doesn't have a passion for older American cars much of what I saw wasn't hugely interesting to me. I probably wasn't able to appreciate the quality of what I was looking at!! The guide for our small group was extremely knowledgeable and it was obvious his passion and interest was in the older US cars. While their were a few European cars (some Porsche & Ferrari) in the vault he spent almost no time looking at these.If you want to get the best of the museum I think you will be a a US visitor. If you are passionate and interested in European cars then this probably isn't the place for you. And that is fair enough... it's a US museum!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaddysFamilyOnTour
50,Wonderful experience,The ticket price was only $16 per person and we spent the whole afternoon there. Lots of things to see and we took almost a thousand pictures. A must go place for car lovers. Best part of our LA trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MingTakL1
50,Amazing Collection of cars and movie vehicles,"This is a must!!! I loved every moment and my children loved it too!!! Impressive Batman pieces, Bumblebee of Transformers and amazing vintage car collection.... does Bugatti catch your attention! The Shah of Iran’s car is spectacular ! I want to go again if time permits!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/657keiths
50,Ideal for Car Fanatics!,Took my son and his friend here on our first day in LA. Super Cool! You can do it in less than a couple hours. Some fantastic old and new cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flynnkj
50,Great place. Easy paid parking.,"Loved this place. I’m not a huge car buff, but was very interested in seeing famous cars from famous movies. Very interesting. I paid extra for the volt tour. It took an extra hour but the guide was really good and we got to see some pretty amazing priceless cars.This place has ample, easy safe parking, but you must pay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miss_kell34
50,Like cars? This is your place,"Lots of parking at the lot, but we got lucky and found a spot on the street. The exhibits start near the entrance. Start at the top and work your way down the 3 floors. We decided against the vault tour, but next time I will definitely do that, as there's only a fraction of the cars on the floors. Personally, I'd prefer to see fewer movie-related cars, but there were several very old autos and a great racing exhibit. Looking at cars is fun but there was also an (included in the ticket price) simulator that let you drive a (choice of) fast car around 1 lap of an iconic (choice or) race track. My Maserati was hard to handle and of course I crashed it, but hubby's car was dented everywhere except on the roof when he was done with his. According to the helpful staff, kids do way better than us oldsters on the simulator, but it was a fun change of pace during our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loribbb
50,Amazing Experience,"My family and I toured this museum because I love cars and my wife and mother in law loved the architecture in and out. The second floor has an interactive kids area that my daughter enjoyed. I loved it so much that I became a member! They refunded my ticket when I became a member. I also got free parking for the day with my membership. On my second visit, I took the 2 hour vault tour. That was fascinating as well. Please include that if you have people with patience and an appreciation of all things automotive. Can't wait to go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RagtopmanV8
50,Worth visiting,"Just look at the building is worth visiting. If you like cars, must visit this museum. Great for small kids,too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noelga2000
50,A great and unique experience close to LACMA,"The Petersen Automotive Museum is great for adults and for kids. There are vintage cars, cars from movies and TV shows, and sports cars, too. A favorite of mine is Professor Fate's care from The Great Race, and of course there is a Batmobile and so much more. The outside of the museum is spectacular architecture. It's a great family or even couples experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/477kenr
30,Peterson Automotive Museum,"Been looking forward to visiting here for a very long time (years actually) and I was mildly disappointed on the selection of cars they were displaying. I expected to see a variety of cars down through the history of the automobile. Instead, I saw a whole floor of movie used cars. Commercials for Porsche and Lexus, pretending to be exhibits. The upside was the place was spotlessly clean and everyone we spoke with, that worked there, were extremely friendly. I would go again, after checking to see what new exibits they were offering.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobW686
50,Must visit in LA,"Clearly one of the best attractions in LA, especially for men and children :) a lot of cars and motorbikes from different movies, cartoons, race cars, concepts and many others. Beatiful exhibition! Entrance is 16 usd plus additional 25 usd per person if you want to see a private collection with a guide (250 cars). For us general exhibition was more than enough. Parking on Sunday was 16 usd. Even it was a weekend, the musium was not so crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntonTereshin
50,A must see museum,"Because it was my birthday my wife said “lets go!” When walking up to the museum we were blown away by the architecture of the building itself with the contrasting red and silver aluminum facade. The sheer number of vehicles and the variety on show were really a treat for the eye. And even my wife, who does not have a love for cars that I might have, was very impressed by all they had to offer. From an original Shelby to the several of the original Batmobiles and on and on. We did not have time for the additional vault where they are evidently many others stored that they can’t fit on the other floors. But that will definitely be on our list to see in the future. It was nice that no one hassled us about taking copious amounts of pictures and as long as you did not cross the “lines” or lay hands on any of the vehicles they left us alone to roam.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffg475
50,Great Group Historic Cars,Worth the time! They have a great group of vintage and Hollywood set cars. Not sure The Vault was with the extra $30 per person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreqTravelr
50,Car Fun,This is a great car museum for anyone who enjoys cars. The vault is worth the extra money. This is a must see for anyone who loves cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GretchenN18
50,Great collection of cars,The cars on display date back to the first car invented. We saw a vintage Bugatti on display that used to belong to some royalty back in the seventies. The Batman collection of cars (with the original car Batman and Robin rode). Knight Rider was also there. The list goes on and on. Definitely worth going to,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3nizare
40,Great Automotive History,"I love the history of automobiles and found that they offered everything from early to modern with of course, the Hollywood featured vehicles. Don't just visit the museum...spring for The Vault tour as it'll open your eyes to some amazing vehicles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkuznick
50,So many beautiful cars,"Loved this museum. There were so many cars and bikes we recognized from the movies. So many beautiful old cars, the low riders, I could go on and on. It let our 10 year old enthralled the entire time. I would definitely recommend if you love cars and movies. Eat at the Drago it is fantastic and they validate the parking so we only paid $4 to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZHope
10,"Non-refundable, non-transferable","Couldn't go due to health issues, but couldn't transfer to someone who could use it. I have friends who live there who could have gone instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raquelrH4572HS
50,Awesome and Excellent,The vault tour was well worth it. Would like to know more about other cars down there. Perhaps a self-guided audio tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scloses
50,kid friendly,"great place to take the kids if you have a couple of hours to spare, it is centrally located in LA near hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbarabuilder
40,Nice trip,"Was in town for a family vacation and added this to the agenda. Private tour below was nice, lots of old cars, nothing earth shattering from a modern perspective. The upper part of the museum was nice as well. Again, nothing earth shattering, but a nice collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jws31969
50,On the outside,On the outside this place looks like it could be the Transformers head quarters.Inside it's all boy toys...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyt200
20,Skip the vault tour unless you're a car nut,"The museum itself was fine... Having been to the Henry Ford, all other car museums pale a little bit, but for the general admission, it's fine. Where I was unhappy was that I specifically asked before the tour if a certain car (which they own) was on the tour because my children wanted to see it. I wouldn't have forked over an additional $75 if the one car they wanted to see wasn't displayed, and it wasn't on the tour. Meanwhile, our eyes glazed over as the tour guide got into the minutia of each vehicle. He wasn't that friendly and was kind of abrupt to a kid who answered one of his questions incorrectly. It seems as if he embarrassed the kid in front of everyone. At any rate, I'm not saying there weren't some lovely and unique cars down there, but the presentation, the security guard following the group around, not being able to take photographs in the vault, and being given wrong information ruined the visit. I got an ""Oh, sorry"" when I asked why I was told the car we wanted to see wasn't on display. It just left a bad taste in my mouth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CobbCoGA
50,For the big and little car lovers and movie buffs,Quality displays of movie vehicles and wonderful vintage and special vehicles and motorbikes. Well worth a visit and a stunning architectural building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philipsG8817IM
50,Efficient and easy,"As per above, it was quiet anyway but can see that this is a very efficient system when it is needed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philipsG8817IM
50,Wish Could Sleep In!,"This one of the very few auto exhibits I have ever seen, fulfilling the dreams of anyone in love with historic cars & motorracing - even the Ferrari 125S is there! - too long to list the marvels in there. The exhibits from the 1st floor & above are very interesting, but more is the vault, where, unfortunately, no pics can be taken. One advice during the 90' or 120' guided vault-tour: if you think you have good knowledge of the cars you are admiring - & other visitors are part of the tour to only learn more, don't hesitate to ask the guide to focus on the history of specific cars. I took the 120' tour, and with 30' to go, we were only half-way the tour, ending spending less time on historic cars I really wanted to watch v a few hotrods or transformed cars which may mean less for some of us. Unforgettable & will return next time in town for updated exhibits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8811stevea
10,Park in Garage with EXTREME CAUTION!,"July 25, 2019, we were in the museum for 90 minutes when the crime was committed. During this brief time, in the middle of the day, the rear window of our car was smashed in. Our son’s camera, accessories, and bag, which was hidden from sight and behind darkened windows, were stolen. The museum security personnel were helpful, some more than others, yet were unable to help with attaining video footage, even though we were parked extremely close to the entrance and exit! It seems that our son was targeted. We called the Wilshire Division of LA Police Dept., but that was a dead end, no help to us as this type of crime happens frequently.Although the museum had a variety of cars to view on the three floors, our good time there was thwarted by the parking garage. Park with extreme caution! Do not, for one instance, allow yourself to believe in a false sense of security, or that your belongings or person is safe in the museum’s parking garage!Park at your own risk! The museum is not in a safe neighborhood/area. The security guards mentioned to us that there is a large homeless and gang population in the neighborhood that borders the museum and that this type of crime is common in the parking garage and on-street parking. We only wish they had told us before we drove into their parking garage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y1370VRcathyg
50,Great Museum,If you like vehicles (I use this loosely) you will love this place. It is a must do if you like cars. Would recommend the extended vault tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jarheadscott

50,Great place,Great place to visit with the family. I paid for the vault and it was more than I expected. It's a must have,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ja411758
40,Good stop,"My wife and I stopped in today. This is worthwhile stop if you are close by, not worthy of a special trip.The place is modern and impressively clean. Lots of exhibits but not many that are truly unique. Younger kids would likely enjoy it . Not sure about the wives and girlfriends.I found the descriptions and information signage very difficult to read from both a graphic and location srandpoint.It's worthy of a visit but only if you happen to be in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JR4IU
50,A car lover's paradise,"This trip was a gift. Whatever your dream car is now or was as a child, you'll likely either find it here, or at least discover its origins. Los Angeles offers so many things to do, but if you're a ""gear head"", a lover of cars, or simply a lover of the history that vehicles represent, this place is a must-see!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bugsbass

50,Amazing Cars!,"This was our first time at the Peterson Museum & we thoroughly enjoyed it! We signed up for the Vault Tour, which starts with the oldest cars in the museum (Model T) and works it way forward in time focusing on racing cars. Our guide shared many interesting stories with us about the development of each car, its owners, as well as the cars that failed, succeeded or were ahead of their time. So many cars, so little time! Thankfully, I picked up a Vault brochure, which highlighted some of the cars because no pictures were allowed. If you even like cars, you will enjoy the tour & the museum. You teenagers will love it too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shirleylewlee
50,Amazing!! Just amazing!,"This has to be one of the premier Auto Museums in the world. The vehicles displayed there are iconic, some for their historical significance, others for their cultural contributions. The ""Vault"" tour is equally spectacular. The docents are knowledgeable and friendly. There are exhibits geared to the kids as well. If planning a trip to the LA area, a visit to this museum is a must! My wife is not a ""car person,"" by any stretch, but even she was blown away by the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmmar19

50,5 hour visit wasn't enough!,"We toured the main exhibits in the morning, had a delightful lunch on the terrace, and then took the 2-hour Vault tour. All was very enjoyable, and our Vault guide Steve was very informative and entertaining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeekGirlBKK
50,Every Movie Buffs Dream !,"Im not going to lie i was a little hesitant about going to this museum while in LA. However, my boyfriend is a huge movie fan and i was so glad that we went. There are cars/bikes/vehicles from tons of movies over the last few decades and it was really great to see. It also was only $18 so it was a great deal!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannonm148
50,Well Spent Time,"While my wife and daughter did a bit of shopping i wisely excused myself and headed off to the Pedersen Automotive Museum. I am more of a vintage aircraft buff than auto but spent over two fascinating hours wandering through the museum, appreciating the fine collection.Exhibits from the early days of autos through to modern years, race cars, hand made creations, hot rods and cars that were specially built for television and movies are included in the Pedersen collection. There is truly something for everyone. My favorite is the 1957 Fort Thunderbird. I spent quite a bit of time just walking around and around this beauty.As one who has visited many aviation museums, and volunteered for many years at one which unfortunately had to close, I know the importance of stopping to talk to the volunteers. They always have interesting stories to tell and are eager to share them with visitors. The volunteers as the Pedersen are no exception. i found one standing near the 1939 Bugatti that was custom built for the future Shah or Iran. He captivated me with the story of the car and the many ways its design was well ahead of its time. Things i would never have known had I simply read the descriptive plaque.The Pedersen is a great museum for anyone with even a passing interest in cars. It is well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulS763
50,Great place to visit!,"We visited this from our Starline Tour. We were unaware it was here until we saw it and the Audio Tour advised it what it was! We jumped off at the next stop. Travelling with two teenage boys and a husband it was a MUST SEE. The Museum building itself is spectacular. The entry fee was reasonable and we spent about an hour in here but could have spent longer. Clean, well maintained, A M A Z I N G cars to suit all enthusiasts. Staff were present but not obtrusive allowing you to enjoy the displays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scaasi80

50,"Keeping my ""Favorite Auntie"" status","I took my 15-year-old nephew to the museum. We started with lunch at Drago and then took about an hour to see most of the museum. We rush a little bit, but it gave us just enough time before our 2-hour vault tour. My nephew was happy snapping Instagram photos and checking out the cars that were cool to him. We had the best Vault guide who was more than knowledgeable and kept our interest for the entire 2 hours. You must not leave without taking the vault tour. Such an impressive collection of automotive history - I can't wait to go back in September with my boyfriend. Thank you for an awesome afternoon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/204danielles

50,Summer car museum visit,"If you or your young children or grandchildren like cars, this is the place to visit. I recommend you arrive early in the day since L.A. has so many people visiting and living here. The building was redone a few years ago and the outside is gorgeous. The parking structure is attached to the building, so parking is nice, but not too big. The inside is very clean and easy to maneuver. There are several floors with fantastic cars, some from the turn of the century to modern, There are also some you can touch and sit in. They also have a nice gift shop on the first floor the kids will enjoy checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anniversarytrip10
50,Must see,"This auto museum is very cool. We took the private 90 tour which was worth it! The rare and vintage cars they showcased was unbelievable. I’m not a huge car person, and this was very cool and interesting to learn the history and hear the stories behind the cars. I highly recommend the tour! The rest of the museum is really neat too. Amazing to see the vehicles that were actually in the movies! Thanks for entertaining our family for a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillsavoy31

50,Car Heaven,"I have been wanting to go to the Petersen Automotive Museum for a very long time. It was worth the wait and did not disappoint. The car selection was great and they did a great job sharing key pieces of automotive history. When I go back, and I will, I will do the Vault tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobthePhotographer
50,"Great car museum for kids, clueless adults, and the enthusiast","I have gone with friends and family of all ages that either know nothing about cars, love some cars, or think they know everything.

50,A must-see for an automotive enthusiast.,"The building is interesting. The parking is clean and convenient. The main museum is good. One of the featured exhibits, ""Winning Numbers: The First, The Fastest, and The Famous"" was on opportunity to see a few truly remarkable cars. There was a reasonable variety of cars (and motorcycles). There were kid friendly areas. The paramount exhibit and experience was The Vault. The extra cost for visiting The Vault was worth it to view some truly remarkable automobiles and get a small group experience with a knowledgeable guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnFromKansas
30,Cars were great. Vault docent was clueless.,"It can't be understated how many cool cars there are here. So many significant vehicles from films to drag racing and the vault tour is definitely worth doing. However, if you're walking in with significant prior knowledge of automotive history, the actually tour of the vault might disappoint. There were many incorrect facts from the first production car to Model Ts only coming in black (they didn't). 10 minutes spent on a 2013 Ford Focus but ignoring Hot Rod Magazine cover cars from the 50s. I'd still recommend going for the vehicles, just not the docents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DayTrip60748816615

I understand the policy of the ""no pictures"", but I wish the security personnel made you feel a little less ""in jail"" as you can't wander a little longer looking at a car you couldn't see (because of the large group hiding it) without the guard telling you to move a long almost pushing you with his arms open. You are stared at like you are going to steal a car !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gaelle0927
50,A car for every aspect of Motoring,The museum has an unbelievable amount of cars and history. This is a must see for all car and motorcycle enthusiast. The Ford GT display is Awesome!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/873derricke
40,Really cool museum for car lovers,"Left my wife shopping and went with my 5-year old son who is addicted to cars. We spent about 2.5 hours in there but it could have been more, except we got hungry and had to leave. Really cool place if you like cars. Also a little play area/hands-on for young kids which my son loved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brunoguge
50,Great Way to spend an Hour,"If you’re a car guy, this is for you- and if you love movies with cars, this is really the place for you. Classic cars, movie cars, race cars and motorcycles, what more could ya want except maybe a Jeep? Just seeing the Batmobile from the old tv series was worth it for me. Cars are as American as it gets. Really enjoyed this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660rickd
50,Amazing for all ages,"This auto museum was more then I was expecting. They had me impressed 5 minutes into it when I seen the DeLorean and Bumble bee. We did not go through the vault, but were very impressed with it all. Plan for longer then you think, if you want to really enjoy it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1214KLkimberlyd
50,Interesting Museum,"The museum is small but it offers a great deal of interesting and historically important cars. If you take the vault tour, it makes the trip to the museum much more worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigator19471147551
50,Comprehensive and one of a kind automobiles!,Simply amazing automobiles! The Vault is a must see. Vault guided tour was icing on the cake. This is a great facility with easy access and great displays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V1728RWjamesw
40,The Vault is great but the Museum is just OK,"I am primarily a classic sports car collector and always had the Petersen on my bucket list. We did the Vault Tour and it was very interesting. With that said, it is nothing more than an old parking garage with a couple of cool cars parked inside. There is no signage and the docent taking us through the Vault was only partially correct in many of his explanations. He knew a lot of unique facts to some of the cars but ask him a question about a few of the oddities and it was out of his script. I am a collector of Shelby's, Mustangs, Corvettes and Jaguars but those cars were few and far between in this collection. In fact out of 400 cars in the vault I seem to recall less than an handful of these cars. And, when the vault tour was over the Museum itself (at least in June) was mainly just a display of old movie cars. I was not very interested in the Magnum PI 308, the array of Batmobiles or the KITT car. I really thought it was going to have more of a preservation display. If you go to LA its worth seeing but if you want to see a bunch of beautifully displayed restorations this is not the place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z2168UVericl
50,Vault tour was awesome,Mr Davis conducted a very informative tour of the vault. Museum itself was great. Lots to see. Must go!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessandmona
50,Two Thumbs Up,Visiting the Petersen Automotive Museum was a great way to spend the day with my family. I loved seeing all the famous cars from different movies. The Vault Tour is awesome and worth the $25 fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Relax51038687304
50,Brilliant!,What a wonderful experience for a auto fan. The range of authentic vintage cars was truly first class. An superlative event that should not be missed. I’ll be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/921jpp

50,if you love cars you will love Peterson,"Wow wow wow. Do the vault tour ( 90 minutes is all you need to do) the collection is fantastic and the guides very knowledgeable, and then do a self guided tour throughout the rest of teh museum. You'll be glad you did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sega1964

40,Good but not great,The tour of the general cars and motorcycles was a great display of vehicles. We also selected to go on the vault tour. This was a guided tour which was not what I was expecting. The tour guide gave us his run down of the cars that he liked. The fact that No Pictures was very disappointing. Why pay the extra money and not be able to take pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daydream02583900391
50,Famous Cars interesting for kids,"Famous Cars and other things interesting for kids.Included those in movies and TV series:Back to the future, Cars, superheroes (Batman,...), Transformers, Terminator, Clockwork Orange, Magnum PI (1980s), Green Hornet, The man from UNCLE (1960s), etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RamonFP1
50,Petersen sci-fi cars,Loved the whole display. The attendant told us to start at the top floor and work our way down - great advice. Loved all the vehicles there. Awestruck by some of the finest examples of custom cars ever built. Definitely worth the visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jet17702184302
50,Excellent,Great museum. Nice variety of all eras of automobiles are shown. One of the vault toursis a must do. And the guide said they change things up on the floors so I will be back in the future..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/579bobf
50,Great Experience!,I am visiting from out of town and will definitely be back on my next visit! There were beautiful cars with interesting history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paradise55930263735
50,Wow! Do the Vault tour - it's spectacular!,"I'm somewhat interested in cars, but not a fanatic by any standards. That said, this place is amazing!You can do an additional tour of ""The Vault"" downstairs, which has so many amazing vehicles it's difficult to know where to start. The only negative about The Vault is that you can't take photos, but the stories that your guide shares with you about these amazing cars definitely makes up for this. There's a round-doored Rolls-Royce from the 1930's, Steve McQueen's beater car that he used to take his kids to school in. They've got Greased Lightning from Grease, Bugatti's, Formula One racecars, the list is endless. I would happily go again just to tour the vault. Our guide was so very knowledgeable, and answered all of our questions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aroscoe
50,Just perfect,It was not our first time ... just because we love to go there. It’s the place for the cars lovers. My favorite is the 250 swb 😍😍😍,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4334UMjeremyc

50,Great experience!,"There's something for everyone, young and old, car enthusiast or not. We joined the museum and will be returning many times, I'm sure. We took two hours and saw maybe 25% of the exhibits. Fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AutumnMountainMoon
50,Great overall experience,I’ve been here twice and there’s always something new every time. The staff are very courteous. Good for both young and old.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mimi87654321
50,A Blast from the Past,"Outstanding collection of motor vehicles. Being a true car nut I found the Museum highly interesting and remarkably intriguing. My teen age grandsons were not equally enthralled, but such is the new generation. My thanks for providing unique and esoteric entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Resort49853407969
50,Cool architecture and a great collection,"The building is worth a visit, and the collection of cars and vehicles is quite extensive. This is a great family stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbon2ur

50,The Vault is a must!,"This museum is an absolute gem. The entry fee for the main museum is definitely worth it, but the main attraction is a tour of The Vault. I only took the 90 minute tour, but really wished I'd taken the two hour one instead! It was a fascinating look at automotive history, including some racing machines and exotica. If you're remotely interested in cars, this tour is a must. It's up there with cycling the Golden Gate Bridge and watching Killer whales in San Francisco bay, which I also did during my fortnight in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardmfromSY
40,All the cars you will ever need to see,This museum is for car lovers. Not a place to spend the evening with someone who is not all that intrigued by the history of the automobile. But I took my boys and they enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noeplaya1
50,Must visit if you’re into cars,"The building looks incredible, and the cars inside are even better. So many amazing models through history. Definitely worth a visit. It’s a relatively unknown LA gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bugs1012
50,Excellent Museum!,Lots of interesting cars to see here. The Vault Tour is worth it. It's a little annoying that you have to pay extra for it but it's worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/220kenq
50,Amazing Displays of Autos,The cars are so well displayed. Gorgeous!They rotate the cars/displays from time to time.There are three floors with stairs and elevators.The gift shop has a nice selection of items.Paid parking garage ($16) but parking is validated if you spend $75 or more in the gift shop.Restaurant inside (Drago).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kb397
50,"Think ""beautiful metallic sculpture"" more than ""cars"" and you will be on the right track","The Petersen Automotive Museum is a must for visitors to Los Angeles. I am not much into cars, and have a Nissan Maxima with 117,000 miles on it to prove it. However, the Petersen Automotive Museum is a feast for the eyes. All of the cars are in showroom condition and most stand by themselves as magnificient pieces of art. Don't expect to find any of these cars driving next to you on the freeway. It is very easy to get to and I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thewanderer03
50,"great exhibit, parking, nice diner","If you're into automobiles, this is definitely a great museum to visit. Great collection, interesting exhibits, easy logistics (parking, hours, etc).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lana_Calif
50,enthusiast of auto art,It now is a museum of Kinetic Art not just of history. The exhibits should please experienced and persons with budding interest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Escape18392876141
40,Peterson,"The exhibits were excellent. I liked the Design Center sketches. Also nice to see corporate involvement like from Maserati. The overall cost including parking, vault tour and a meal at Drago was pretty dang high: $128! Also, the T-shirt selection in the gift shop was pretty picked over, nothing in my size. The collection from Curb was outstanding, but again pretty picked over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meander38450959832
50,Fantastic!,"The Petersen is a fantastic and unique place to visit. The displays change frequently enough to provide a different experience each time, and it is setup to spend as much or as little time as you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steverG6702HQ
50,A great way to spend an afternoon and learn!,The Petersen Automotive Museum inside lives up to its striking appearance on the outside! The layout guides visitors to review history and the infuence of the automobile. There is also joy in just looking at the gorgeous cars. The cars that appeared in movies and the alterations to them for the movies was unique and interesting. As grandparents we took several pictures of the Cars movie cars!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beersnobs
50,An unbelievable experience...,"No matter what your automotive interest, this museum is sure to satisfy, as it did my wife and I and our grandchildren! In fact, I would describe it more like a family entertainment destination with exhibits for children, teens, and adults, Plus, it also is incredibly clean and easy to walk through and find the exhibits that are most intriqueing to each member of a group.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel49340136410
40,The definition of the California car scene!,"Petersen's was not what I expected, but I understand the rational. The museum displays what the California car experience has been, from racing, to street rods and electric cars. Don't expect to see a hall filled with restored cars, because if that what you want, you won't find that experience here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arayjr
40,From a photography point of view,"I'm a lifelong car guy and a passionate photographer, to the point that I don't really engage with what I'm seeing unless I have a camera in my hand. The Petersen of course has much to see! But the seeing conditions, photography-wise, leave much to be desired. First there's the lighting... dim. Yes modern cameras have amazing low-light capability, but they can only do so much. What would completely remedy the situation (short of bumping the light levels way up) is allowing the use of tripods. Even monopods would help greatly! What's the problem here? I would not mind paying a significant ticket premium to be allowed to use my tripod. I would even come after hours if I had to. Why not allow this?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Companion54242941580
50,Super!,"It was my son's birthday weekend, and rains prevented us from doing any other outdoor activity, so we thought what could be better than the Petersen Automative Museum for a 9 year old car aficionado. Despite living 10 years in LA county and passing by that striking building a few times, this was our first visit. Would surely go back and keep recommending it to car buffs, too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture01873954494

50,Great visit to Petersen Museum.,"We were visiting L.A. from Toronto, Canada with our 11 year old son and 13 year old daughter. Our son is a car enthusiast and we decided to visit the Petersen Museum during our trip. It was definitely worth the visit. We took a tour of ""the vault"" and the guide was really great. Definitely recommend this for anyone who likes cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BashirG
50,Husband was in Car Heaven!,We spent 6 hours in this museum! Don’t leave with out doing the Vault tour of the card in the basement. It’s extra but so worth it. The employees are so knowledgeable. We took a break for lunch and ate on site at the full service restaurant. Complete with a full bar. (Did I mention I was there for 6 hours?!?!),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kebass
30,Mullen Museum or Petersen Museum,When the Petersen Automotive Museum originally opened up it was really all about the California car culture. Lot's of hot rods and auto nostalgia. After Bob Petersen died there was a change in direction and Peter Mullen changed the format to emphasize more classic Art Deco and French cars such as he has in his own museum. The Petersen has now had a virtual makeover and in my opinion not for the better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Excursion31574696711
50,Porsche Effect,"Great exhibit, well thought out and well organized. we also did the basement tour which was a great experience. guide was very knowledgeable and answered lots of questions, even listened to our comments about cars which we knew about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacation18573781348
50,Well-rounded auto museum,"Not just collector cars, but kids area, interview videos on car design/manufacture/marketing/etc., hands-on activities, and more. It's the variety that makes it special. Enjoyed the ""Vault"" tour, too. That makes up for the fewer auto displays than the old museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/walterGiraffe
50,amazing,Beautiful building and right across the street from the tar pits. The exhibits were all awesome and good ones for kids. The vaunt tour is a must for any movie or music history buff. Amazing place don’t miss it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coastal22609875793

50,Very Impressed,"This place is great! Unfortunately we ran out of time and did not visit The Vault. Will definitely return. Very clean,,,even the restrooms were very clean. Enjoyed the displays. Staff very friendly and helpful. Don’t miss the opportunity to eat at the authentic Italian restaurant. Food excellent. Will definitely return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brlturner3
50,Don’t miss the Vault,"The museum is pretty impressive on its own but what’s really brilliant is the stuff downstairs in The Vault, such as what’s probably the most valuable car in the world (the second Ferrari ever made), Clark Gables car, Elvis’s car, etc etc.It’s not cheap but it’s worth every penny. Expensive to park too ($20) but discounts for eating in the excellent restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imonierw

40,Turn on the engines and go,"A museum that expresses the desire to show the world what car means that has made the history of cinema or a race or something. The cars of Batman and Cars show the accuracy of the place in every detail.I would like to congratulate the managers of the museum who have made the idea very clear and can be proposed not only to lovers of historic cars, but also to curious onlookers.I had this experience in August 2017",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielAdamiofficial
50,"Top Museum, amazing collection","Top Gear certainly nailed it when they called this ‘the best car museum in the world’.The 90-minute vault tour is a must - the collection of cars not on display in the museum is mind blowing - you can’t take photos in the vault which is a shame, but there are some beautiful, classic vehicles and cars with interesting ownership.Well worth a visit - the exterior of the building is also a sight to behold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thorneta
50,The Petersen Is a Must for Car Lovers!,"The renovation done at the Petersen made a good place even better. There are wonderful permanent displays, and always something new for car lovers, too.

40,3 generations of men went in and had a great time :),"I visited the museum with my father-in-law and my son and we had a great time together. My FIL is huge auto-enthusiast so he loved every aspect of the place. I enjoyed especially the movie and racing sections of the museum.I recommend parking your car somewhere else and then walking to the venue, as the parking itself is little rip-off (16 $).Overall, good fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_ReVilo
50,Saw the Buggati Exhibit,"I went there sometime back and they had the buggati exhibition at that time. Some of those cars make your jaw drop, design and ultimate beauty. 3 floors and beautiful cars. Excellent place for car buffs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Umayrmasud
50,Wonderful Museum,"I'm an 85 year old female who accompanied my car loving son. I thought I would sit on a bench and read a book, but the museum was very interesting. The current exhibit is cars from movies, so that was fun. The museum is spotless, the cars amazing, and the presentation well done. A 90 minute tour takes you to the lower level where there are most of the cars. We didn't have time for that but I think if you are a car buff, you would probably want to see everything. On a Wednesday afternoon it wasn't crowded. We ate at the upscale very nice restaurant in the museum. There is a large garage connected to the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancyeA710MS
50,Really good visit,"Well worth a visit, lots of car parking spacesWell organised and laid outWe did the vault tour and found the lady taking it very informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jssc21
40,In an RV,"There is no RV parking here. The parking garage is covered. The LAMEC parking lot (which the staff told us to use when I called) has a sign saying “no trucks/RVs”. We ended up parking on a side street a couple blocks away. There were two other class A’s, 25-30’, parked along Orange and one street over. This was 9 am on a Saturday morning when the roads were relatively empty. I would not want to take a big rig here during traffic times.We spent 2 hours here, no vault or extra tours. It’s interesting but if you don’t stop and read the placards and learn a bit about the cars you’ll breeze through and be done in an hour. There aren’t a huge number of cars here but the ones they have are special. Some are flashy but there were not a large number of super cars here (no Lamborghini, bright red Ferrari, etc). I’m glad I went but I was a little disappointed that they didn’t have more.No large backpacks allowed but nobody checked my medium sized purse.Don’t miss the moon rover and Jurassic Park car in the parking garage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yessyhara
20,Not as many cars as expected,"This was our first trip out, as a ""car guy"" and engineer this museum was a must see. But disappointed. Besides, they sold us tickets and asked us to start on the top floor and work our way down to the first floor, seemed like a good idea. But we found out why, the whole first floor, the main floor, was ""closed for maintenance"". So they ask for full price admission and only give you 1/2 of the displays. Thats just bad business practice, even for LA! Can not recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/izzysanchez
20,Not a Place to See Cars,"What you get for the admission price is OK though the above-ground collection is small compared to a number of car museums I have visited in the Midwest and East. But it is The Vault where you pay too much for too little, and the museum should be ashamed of the tricks they pull to get your money. Only after you have paid and are standing at The Vault door do they tell you no photography is allowed. After that large disappointment, the door opens and you are looking at what could be any level of a large parking garage with vehicles backed into tight spaces. Then they give you more bad news. You cannot go around the cars or look at them from the side. A few cars are parked in the aisles so you can see all four sides. The young woman who was our docent was knowledgeable and pleasant, but the place doesn't live up to its hype.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710douglask
50,"have been wanting to go for years , wife took me for my birthday","if your a car person this is a must see venue , but even my wife who isnt into cars enjoyed the trip , give yourself plenty of time as there is a lot to see ,pay the extra for the vault tour so worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glenndebarge

20,Disappointment,"The initial price to see the cars should include the vault as well. The top portion could have had more cars, was only half full. You have to pay an additional $30 per person to see the cars in the vault. Was not a good value, over priced!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyTravelTime21

50,Very impressive,"We were very impressed with the museum and all that it had on offer!Unfortunately we missed the Porsche Effect special by a week and were too early for the Hollywood Dream machines, but we did get to see a few cars from both that were still on display/just brought in.We did the two hour vault tour, and our guide Andy was knowledge and friendly. We were, of course, sad that you couldn't take photos on this tour (mostly to help with the memory for later lol), but knew this beforehand from other reviews.The cars in the vault, and those on display, were presented immaculately, and are minds were left blown by what we saw. My partner's a real petrol head, so he was soooo in his element.We shopped at the merchandise store and were given a validated parking ticket for spending so much ... bonus 👌 Parking is normally $16 USD.We also ate at the restaurant onsite. The food was nice, but the waiter service was poor - our only real disappointment for the whole visit.If you are a car enthusiast, this should be a must-do on your list!.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathymL9202IC

40,Superb museum but parking a rip off,As a last minute add on to our LA trip this was recommended to us. We were very happy when we found the museum as it looked amazing but the parking is a rip off and to see a lot of the cars you have to upgrade your tickets for access to the vault which was a shame as there are set tiles for access there.I accept that sometimes limited access is required but at least make it free when customers are already paying for tickets and parking.There were a number of cars I wanted to see and didn’t get too due to this which is a real shame.The shop staff however were really good and friendly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10carlh

50,Went for the Limited Exhbit: THE PORSCHE EFFECT!!!,"This is a great car museum on its own, but the Porsche Effect exhibit made it much more special for us. We were lucky enough the exhibit had been extended, and we got there a week before it ended. It did not disappoint. We are members of the Porsche Club of America, so it was a ""must see"" for us. We spent a couple of hours touring the 3 levels and really enjoyed it. The vehicles were fabulous and they have a good little gift shop to pick up a memento of your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snoopy647
50,A must if you like cars,"I don't think I can add to the high praises of this museum. It is truly exceptional. I would need a couple of days to review it properly. There is so much history behind every car and the story about the story etc. If you are a car nut, you know what I mean.At the time of our visit, there was a Porsche special. I have two 911s and it was a fantastic opportunity to see so many historic Porsches in front of me. The most legendary P-cars were there: the 906, the 917, the 962, the 919. (The 935 was in a different location.) More importantly, perhaps, a 901, a 911R from 1967, a few 930s...Then, you will get the opportunity to view some of Meyer's cars. OMG. All my favorite cars are there: a couple of Ferraris and a Bizzarini (I kick myself for not buying one when they were ""reasonable"".)Finally, we also visited the Vault. Only ""problem"": the Vault tour should last at least 3 hours or have 2 different tours, please. Also, talk less about the celebrities and more about the cars.Good restaurant, beautiful facilities, easy parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiosp515
30,Good for a quick visit,"This was a fun but kind of short stop. If you have the time and really want to see something rare make the trip to the Nethercutt museum,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Merci000
50,Extensive,A great museum for car enthusiasts but pay extra and get a two hour tour of the vault. It is suggested that you plan a trip on an odd day. On popular days parking will be a problem and the museum can get jammed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeyBoy12804
50,Beautiful automobiles,A nice place to spend the afternoon looking at beautiful cars. Easy walking and not too crowded. Took about 2 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karen1012
50,Worth visiting,"Car lovers will enjoy the hudge collections of cars, from old style to F1, the corvette etc.If you don't visit tgst museum, honestly you will regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomtT5252TP
40,Worth a visit,"We went specifically to see the Porsche exhibit which ends this week. It was excellent, as is the rest of their displayed cars. There was a little of everything. Automotive history, movie cars, race cars, motorcycles, etc. Pay the extra money and take the very informative 90 minute guided Vault tour. We spent an enjoyable three hours at this museum. It is kind of expensive, but totally worth it if you love cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbielab
40,AMAZING IF YOU LOVE CARS! (kinda sucks if you don't),"Yes, I give the place 5 stars...but I really like looking at old, priceless, and famous automobiles. That's what you'll be doing in this place for a couple of hours. So if you like that idea definitely GO check it out. But if not, STAY AWAY. (oh, and if you REALLY love old cars, why not make a trip up to see the Nethercutt Collection up near Sylmar. It's a bit of a drive North of Hollywood, but it's FREE. And the car collection there is even more impressive than the Petersen. Oh and the have a TRAIN to. Like a really, antique, full size train.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnpH381RS
50,Take Time for the Vault!,"I had been looking forward to this visit for a long, long time and it did not disappoint! I bought the extra ticket for the vault tour as well and I am glad that I did. The museum itself is very nice and well organized. I was especially impressed with the movie cars and after going on the vault tour I am surprised that there are not more of these on display - there could easily be an entire floor dedicated to those and celebrity vehicles. Museum great for any time - the vault tour was nothing short of exceptional and nirvana for an auto buff! The automotive history down there is amazing!!! Worth every cent to an auto buff like me and I will remember this for years to come!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/271robertp
50,First Ever Electric Motorcycle Exhibit MIND BLOWING,"Full video review at Cineclast dot comI checked out a little sneak peek of the killer new exhibit at the Petersen Auto Museum in LA featuring the most advanced, cutting edge, wild and beautiful electric powered two wheeled beasts being crafted right now.The VIP Press preview happened last Thursday and the exhibit goes live this weekend. Gotta say that these bikes will make you think differently about the potential of electric power. The exhibit, called ""Electric Revolution"" is the world's first to elctro-bike exhibit and will feature over 20 new and historic electric two wheeled bikes that will simply blow your mind.Off-road e-bike from Swedish hotstuff Cake, Neil Connolly's Storm 36, and the twin-motor Zeus from Curtiss Motorcycle Company are all there to be gawked at.. Alta Motors, France's Shiny Hammer, Blatant Moto, and artist/fabricator Joey Ruiter are among other hot shots to grace the Petersen's halls.This is a unique event not to be missed, and yes, of course they have more sexy and historic automobiles then a rich kid's Matchbox collection. Race over, don't walk, it's wild.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/therealserrini
40,A BEAUTIFUL AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM,"The Pererson Automotive Museum is right up there with the greats, beautiful cars, huge building, lots of room so you can get up and close even on busy days. This trip was our first and we saw three of the five floors of vehicles in a little over three hours. We had a great time.At first I thught the information on each vehicle could have covered more news but as the day went on I feel it is very good and precise, if you really need more information you can ask someone.The exibits are constantly changing so you will never see it all even if you visit many times.We have visited many auto museums and this is one of the best. We will be back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/707clayg
50,Gear Heads Ahoy,"The Ultimate gear head experience, From Hollywood time machines to the rarest of street machines they are all here, too may to list, a wonderful few hours spent. Hollywood royalty always traveled in motorized style and the results are this museum filled with iconic cars of every era. Another big plus, if you are traveling with a friend or spouse, who has no interest just down the street is the MOCA. A match made in heaven.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/217brucer
50,Must visit for car enthusiasts,My partner is a massive car enthusiast so he was really excited to visit here.I really enjoyed it too as someone who doesn't know a huge amount about cars.There were some cars from the movies which peaked my interest and just generally seeing my fiance's reaction to seeing some of the cars on show made it worthwhile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maisy20
50,Car Lovers Paradise,What a wonderful museum. Floor afterFloor of absolute priceless cars.Be sure to leave 3/4 hours minimum to make the most of this incredible museum.The vaults tour is a must as well and the tour staff are very knowledgeable and the cars and their history is obviously their passion.I’ll Be sure to visit here every time in LA as the collections on show change frequently.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sportstherapyscot
40,Beautiful Museum,This is by far the nicest car museum we've ever visited. They were setting up for an event and parking was difficult but the museum was still open. Perhaps they should manage that a bit better next time.That said the had great cars and great explanations as to what the significance of the car was. Exhibits were themed well and even non-car people could find it interesting. There's an exhibit for kids that explains how cars worked which was super informative for all the non-technical adults in our group too :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbyw2014
30,Had higher thoughts,I was surprised that there wasn't more cars to enjoy. Iv'e read about the Petersen Collections but all that space and so few cars actually made me disappointed. Among the ones i was most passionate about 3 out of 4 was parked in the garage used as driving specimen.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unicornone

50,Auto Enthusiasts Dream,I've been to the Petersen Automotive Museum many times and each time they have hosted a different theme of cars. It's always exciting to see what they showcase,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhotographerJames
30,"Interesting cars, dull displays","There Petersen used to have lots of interesting displays. Now it has cars and that's it. No context, nothing around them. They are amazing cars, but it's not the museum of LA car history it used to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3718TTbarryw
40,The Vault is The Best But The Location Sucks,"Great museum. The highlight is the Vault Tour that has great guides. The Vault has a ton of historic and classic cars. And we only got to see a small part of them.However, the effort and traffic to get there is abysmal. We travelled on a Saturday. We were routed through the streets to get there. A trip that should take 2 hours from suburban San Diego was 3 hours. Coming back it was four hours. This is on a Saturday. We cannot imagine a situation where would endure that again to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronfO6150FU
40,A terrific car museum,Visited Petersen Automotive Museum and was impressed with the range of cars on display. Entry price is reasonable and you can pay more for an exclusive ‘garage tour’ of additional vehicles not on display. A good Porsche section as well as a gift shop and restaurant complete the picture. Recommended for automotive enthusiasts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/-Guzzis-are-ace-
50,Definitely a place to visit,My wife and I were very impressed by the selection and quality of the cars on display. They covered many eras and manufacturers. I would recommend the extended tour as it covers many more cars and is led by a guide who is very knowledgeable about the cars. It was a big highlight of our trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ebojoe
40,Very nice assortment of vehicle genres,"When we were there the main exhibitions were Porsche and vintage Japanese and custom Japanese vehicles . The variety of Porsche stock production and all out race cars was very impressive . We didn't go on the vault tour as pictures are not allowed . This is due to many of the vehicles in the Vault do not belong to the museum . Understandable, but disappointing. We will visit again the next time we are in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A8486XQmichaels
50,A must do!,"If you are a petrol head, then visit this place. The outer skin of the building is amazing and if you can see it lit up a night, wow!!!Great selection of cars and a few bikes. Some cars have been in movies and some are concept. The rest bring back memories or you have them in your fantasy garage :)!!!You can if you wish pay extra and visit the rare ones in the vault, due to time restrictions we didn't get to :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ian1811
40,Cars,"I love old cars. They have a Tucker in the vault, my favorite car. The vault tour is a bit boring and need to know a lot about cars to enjoy it. The tour is about an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferjS3881WJ
50,Great Collection of Cars,"This is well worth the trip for anyone remotely into cars. Their collection is incredible regardless of if you're into foreign, domestic, or exotic. They had an amazing Porsche collection when I was there.It is usually not too busy during the week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taiowaw
50,Great,"I'm not really into cars, but my husband is, so I went along for the 'ride'. Well, I think I got more interested in it than he did. Amazing history and we enjoyed the videos of the 'tv/film' cars. We also visited the 'vault' which was worth it. Maybe a little long for small children, but very interesting for adults. Would recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/954suzanneg
50,A Must Visit For the Auto Enthusiast!,"This was my third visit to the museum, but the first time that I took a tour of the ""Vault Collection"" Although this extra tour makes for a pricey visit ($39), I would highly recommend it (75 minute tour is sufficient) as there are cars you would never otherwise see such as a one of a kind Rolls Royce, celebrity cars, and the first Ferrari! The onsite restaurant has good food and adds to the overall experience. The featured collections change on a regular basis providing a reason to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I332SYjb
50,What a GAS!,"Took my teenaged son here, didn't expect it would be so great. Fantastic exhibitions, from the traveling (Ferrari) to permanent (Bugatti). How cars work, how they are made, from Maserati to LA low riders, even a little simulator-racing area. Just beautiful, several unforgettable hours. Oh, and spend a bit extra for the basement-warehouse tour, it will blow your mind what they have down there--from gangster getaway cars and dictator's limousines to tons of hollywood film-and-TV classics. Wow!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SvalbardGuy
40,DETAILED review,"If there's anything you need to know to prepare for a trip to the Petersen museum, I hope to cover it here. I searched and planned for hours before our visit, but still didn't know enough. Here goes.There's parking in a garage that is attached to (part of) the museum. It was easy to find. Yes, it costs, but it was extremely convenient.If you take a vault tour, you CAN bring a bottled water with you. I had read reviews which stated no eating or drinking. However, they explained to us that a plain bottled water was acceptable. Unfortunately, I didn't know this in time and had left my waters in the car.If you take a vault tour, I had read that you could not go to the bathroom. However, they explained if you have a medical condition and need to go to the bathroom, the guard will escort you. Unfortunately, I didn't know this in advance, so I skipped one of my medications that morning (to avoid needing to go to the bathroom within a 2 hour timeframe).If you go on a vault tour, you will NOT be able to take pictures or have your cell phone out. Yes, you can carry your camera, but the lens cap must stay on. Your cell phone must stay in its case or in your pocket or purse.If you go on the vault tour, you will be in a confined area (yes, it's underground) with cars parked door to door. This is also a ""working"" garage so the air quality isn't fresh. If you're a car lover like me, it won't bother you. But if you're bringing someone with sensitive lungs or allergies, keep in mind that they might be smelling exhaust fumes, gas, oil, etc.If you go on the vault tour, you WILL NOT have an opportunity to sit down. Ever. You must stand and/or walk the entire time. So if there is a handicap concern or you have knee or back trouble, consider this as you decide which length of tour to take.If you go on the vault tour, there is a flight of steps getting down there and coming back up. Our guide said there was an elevator for anyone who needed to avoid steps, but then he started walking down the steps before I could ask where the elevator was.If you go on the vault tour, I had read that it's cold down there and to dress appropriately. Well, I was HOT in the vault...it was stuffy....maybe it was the lack of air flow. So I'd suggest you wear layers so you can take one off if you need to.If you have KIDS and want to do a vault tour, there is an age limit for kids to be in the vault. I am not 100% sure what the age rule is because I can verify that there were 2 kids in our vault tour. Although I never found out their exact ages, I can attest to the fact that they were often more behaved than some of the adults in our group. They definitely had an appreciation for cars and were eager to learn.On the subject of KIDS.....if you are planning a trip to the Petersen (any part of the museum), please make sure your kids actually care about vehicles and appreciate them! This is not a place to bring your kids and let them run wild for a few hours. Go to a children's museum for that please. Your kids will be happier and the rest of us will be too. I literally had to leave one floor and go to another because I was so stressed by the kids RUNNING around the cars, climbing on the cars, swinging on the ropes, etc. If they don't respect the value of a vehicle, they don't belong here. End rant.One very cool feature about this museum is that they have placed charging stations in multiple spots throughout the museum. So if you have a phone that dies easily when you're taking pics, you can bring your own charger to plug in or you can use one of their chargers that fits your phone. Awesome feature!Speaking of pictures, as long as you are not in the vault, you are permitted to take pics on all of the other floors. The lighting in the museum is a little bit dim, so this might be a challenge for some cameras. There is ONE opportunity to sit in a car for a photo.On the 1st floor of the museum, they alternate a ""featured"" type of car. When we were there, it was Porsche. Not my favorite, but a Porsche lover would really appreciate it.On the 2nd floor, they had local legends cars, race cars, motorcycles, and even 2 cars from the Disney Cars movie (when we were there, it was Lightning McQueen and Jackson Storm).On the 3rd floor, they had cars from movies, famous cars, and historical items. This is also where you can sit in a car for a photo op (you'll either have to take turns or hope you find a nice stranger to take your pic together, like we did).To get between the 3 floors, you can take an elevator or climb stairs if you prefer. The bathrooms inside the museum were very clean and well taken care of.While you are on the regular 3 floors of the museum, there are opportunities to sit if necessary. There are padded benches scattered around. There are also a couple of films you can sit and watch if you need to rest for a bit.There was an area for ""kids"" to play near the Disney Cars display. We walked in and were very impressed with all of the interactive games and ways for kids to learn about vehicles. In fact, hubby sat down at one of the tables where you can learn to draw various cars from the Disney movie. After watching him for a while, I joined him and we ended up drawing some cool souvenirs!If you're concerned about spending the entire day here and getting hungry, there's an Italian restaurant inside the museum (see my separate review for that). It wasn't necessarily cheap, but it was very convenient. TIP: if you eat at the restaurant, give them your parking ticket and they will give you a discount on parking! I believe it was a $4 discount.Okay, now let me discuss the vault tour. We purchased the longest one available. Do I believe it was worth the extra charge? I honestly believe it depends on who your tour guide is AND how large your tour group is. Unfortunately, we were on a tour with a large ""birthday party"" group and in fact, one of the ladies in the ""party"" was also an employee at the museum (we saw her later setting up for another party in an open section of the museum). There were over 20 of us and it was TOO many. It was impossible for all of us to stand where we could see the car the tour guide (Jeff) was discussing. This was irritating. It also caused people to walk around to try to get a glance from another angle BUT that made our group ""wander"" off. So our guard (can't remember his name) was always trying to herd us all back together like a group of animals. It was also hard to hear the tour guide unless we were very near him. There were also many side conversations taking place amongst the birthday group. Again, the group was too large! I feel this was just our bad luck as we reserved our time online the previous night so we had NO idea how many people would be in the group.We had read that taking a vault tour would come with a souvenir and a discount in the museum gift shop. BUT our tour guide (Jeff) never mentioned either of these things. After the tour ended, we asked the lady in the gift shop and she said we were supposed to be given a ""secret code"" while in the vault. Ummm, NOPE.We had read that people were disappointed in the shorter vault tours because they didn't get to see everything. Well, let me tell you, even on the longest vault tour, you won't see everything. There were a LOT of vehicles that our tour guide totally skipped over and entire sections that we never even walked near. We could only see from a distance. I wanted to ask questions about some of them, but we didn't have time.The guard who accompanied our group in the vault did not do a very good job. He allowed several guys to walk around corners before the rest of us and in between cars (definitely a no-no) and even some back-tracked. I caught one guy with his cell phone. The guard should have caught that! AGAIN....I cannot stress enough....the vault group was TOO BIG.In total, we spent 2 hours in the vault, an hour for lunch, and 2 hours in the rest of the 3 floors of the museum. So yes, you can spend an entire day here. Do I recommend it? Yes. Do I recommend the vault tour? I still believe it depends on your guide and the size of the group....but there's no way to know in advance (that I'm aware of).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
40,"Great collection of cars, even more so if you are a car buff","I came here with my family because my son HAD to see the Delorean from Back to the Future for real - and he was not let down! This museum has a great collection of classic cars, motorcycles, and related automotives. We have a 6 year old so we could not do the Vault tour which I regret. But overall the sheer amount of vehicles, their history, and some of the cool movie cars made it well worth the visit. Also a gem if you are into Porsche - they had a whole section just for them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddone1
50,What an incredible history of the Porsche!!!,After spending hours in the museum I came out with a true appreciation for the Porsche and its history! Now I want one! It’s probably the best car design by far for a sports car! I was fascinated by the German history of this classic automobile!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelaM7103IC
40,spectacular collection of cars of all types.,"It doesn't really matter what type of cars you like. If you like cars you will find something to your liking. Moviecars, antique cars, classic cars, muscle cars and more. there is something for everyone. If you are going it is worth adding the cost of the vault tour, although the tour feels pretty rushed. 250 cars in one hour so you really only get a glance at everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rob-CS

30,Bait and switch at its best - vault tour to see the cars,Decent collection of about 80 cars which you can see for $16.00“But” to see the actual collection of over 200 cars you need to pay an additional $23.00 per personThere are some nice cars and some rare cars but the way they grab your extra cash is just wrong!I can see more cars at my local car shows for free,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldtiredandretired

50,Yessssssssss!,"As a car enthusiast I was excited to finally check this place out. There were several cars on display as soon as you walk in (including a Honda S600!) so you know you’re in for more great machines.I especially enjoyed seeing the cars that have been in movies and tv shows, including the original Batman and Robin. The “Cars” (as in the movie) Mechanical Institute looks like it would be a great learning experience for kids.When we started on the 3rd floor, security told us the 2nd floor was closed but it turned out to only be a portion and I don’t feel as though I missed out on anything.Although parking in the garage is $16, it’s free if you spend $75 in the gift shop.I would love to return when they’ve switched up some of the cars and spend the extra dough to check out the Vault.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnAnotherJourney
50,Awesome,"A nice, nice, nice collection of cars and motorcycles.

50,Bucket list tour of museum and the vault,"Took my auto oriented family for a general tour of the museum. tmyself and the kids who wanted to see the vault had reserved our spaces ahead of time for that portion. We were very lucky in that the total public on this tour was five people in the crowd-the tour before us was about 45 people! So we were close to the tour guide which made it easy to hear, and got us Close to the cars for descriptions as well as we didn’t have to wait longer for the whole herd to get settled in each time before the tour guide could start speaking. The tour guide says that people take the vault tour multiple times because the vault inventory changes whenever the rotation of cars within the museum display changes. Note: I think the buyers better get moving on acquiring Japanese cars because that is what my 19 and 25-year-olds wanted to see. The gift shop prices were fair and the style of display of the motorcycles in the public portion of the museum was very innovative. There is something at the Peterson for every taste of car lovers. I will go next time I’m in LA to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawnm68
40,WORTH A LOOK,"Visited the Petersen Automotive Museum to have a look at a huge collection of cars. We took the vault tour which for us is where to see a much bigger and better range of vehicles than what are displayed in the general entry sections. The tour guide was very knowledgeable, passionate and really took you on a journey of the motor vehicle over the years. Some really interesting cars and well worth a look, cheers. :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hgrundell

Seeing those cars, plus so many others made me feel like a kid again! This was my alone time, where I could take as many pictures as I wanted, and take my time doing it!

50,Must See the Vault,"The 75-min. Vault Tour costs an extra $23, but you don't want to miss it. For one thing, a knowledgeable guide takes you through automotive history, starting with horseless carriages, and much of the Petersen's vast trove of classic, innovative, memorable and often one-of-a-kind vehicles. Sure, the regular self-guided galleries are worth seeing, especially for aficionados of racing, design and engineering; the Porsche exhibit is interesting. But for me, general admission is just a down payment on getting access to the Vault, where they keep the Tuckers and the Shelbys; Fred Astaire's 1920s Rolls-Royce; limos fit for rulers, from maharajahs and commissars to Juan and Evita Peron; cars driven by actor Steve McQueen; a Pope-mobile; and a whole lot more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briochem2000

50,"If your a petrolhead, this is for you","The Petersen Museum covers a wide variety of various makes, models and types of cars and bikes that are not only rare but also have amazing provenance. I noticed a bus stop out the front , but if like me you're doing a day trip in LA - Uber etc is about 45 minutes in heavy traffic from LAX. It suits all ages and I highly recommend the Vault tour, just make sure you book a day in advance. There is flat entry and a lift if your in a wheelchair, but I can't remember if thats the case with the Vault tour so maybe contact the museum in advance. I really enjoyed this tour and will happily go again when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Compass17497896411

40,"Museum was great, ticket staff difficult","I am a member of the Petersen and love the museum; always something new to see (we visited The Vault this visit) and do. On this visit I had my family with me visiting from overseas. We had two young children in the group (and 3 adults), but purchased 5 adult tickets initially not realizing that there was a children ticket and discount. We had yet to even pay for the tickets but the staff refused to change our tickets to two children tickets. Kind of frustrating as 1) we would expect the ticket staff to say that they had children tickets and 2) surely you can change an order before something is even paid for? As a member this was even more disappointing as I had been saying what a great museum the Petersen was to the family and this initial interaction was not great.Note that on the ticket board there is a warning (in very small font) that they will not change orders. This I assumed was at least after paying for the tickets but apparently not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielhG2674OI
50,Fun for car enthusiasts of all ages,"We visited both the museum and the Vault, which I highly recommend. There are 250 cars in the basement and each one has a fascinating story. The Vault tour did not cover them all, so I hope to see more of them in the future. We were spent about 3 hours total for both the museum and Vault. They have a few video games for older kids and a play area for small children as well. You have to be interested in cars to fully enjoy this place, but the history as told through cars makes the museum at least somewhat interesting for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinaj808

50,Best Car Museum,"I am a long-time visitor of the Petersen, making frequent visits since I moved here in 2004. After the remodel it has been especially fantastic. My favorite parts are that every few months they make a few minor changes pulling cars in and out of the main exhibit to get a little surprise, and the the second floor special exhibit gallery. This is smaller than the main changing gallery on the ground floor, but always has really fun shows, like one with all cool Japanese cars from the 50s and earlier; or one with all huge silver cars. The place is kid friendly and always fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magoldman

40,My Experience at the Peterson Museum and Gift Shop,"The following was a letter written on October 23, 2018. A reply was written on November 3, 2018 with apology and gift articles [Peterson Museum Hat, Tote and Pen].To whom it may concern,Not sure what department or who I should address this communication, I trust it will however be directed to the appropriate individual within the Peterson Museum staff. Last weekend I visited the museum. Being a member of the Porsche Club of America [PCA] I was drawn to the museum to view the “The Porsche Effect” exhibit. I also attended the 120 minute Vault Tour at 11:00 am. I was quite impressed with the array of cars displayed and discussed during the tour. The museum was beautifully appointed from the outside to the inside. It was spacious and well laid out to display the array of automobiles and memorabilia. The reception and tour staff were very courteous and informative. At approximately 3:00 pm I visited the Gift Shop before my planned departure from the facility. I encountered a disturbing dialogue with the counter sales person at the cash register. I had intended to purchase a Porsche Emblem Cap that I had picked up at the counter. After I had determined that it fit I approached the cash register the sales lady was carrying on a conversation with another employee ignoring my approach. I waited patiently for their conversation to end as she ignored my presence.She began to ring up my purchase and stated the final purchase price. I proceeded to engage my credit card. As she was about to place the pad in front of me to sign she retrieved it and abruptly instructed her counter partner to pull all the remaining Porsche Emblem Caps from the display. She quickly pulled the pad back. Apparently her counter partner did not act fast enough as she raced to the caps on display and removed them herself. She mumbled something and reconfigured the purchase price stating that the item had been priced incorrectly. She then offered me the pad for signature which I refused to sign. In short the sales person was offensive, lacked greatly in communication skills and generally reflected negatively on my total experience at the museum.Before I left the facility I stopped by the front desk to ask for a supervisor. He listened to my concerns and quietly suggested that the person should have accepted the mispriced item as it was so marked, I certainly agree. He then suggested that I take my complaint to the Gift Shop supervisor. Frustrated as I was at that point I wanted no further dialogue with the staff.Sadly what was initially a very positive experience visiting your facility my Gift Shop encounter has left a bitter taste with my personal experience at the Peterson Automobile Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoPlaces61646787660
50,If you are in to cars. This is the place,Great 3 hours spent looking at all kinds and types of cars. The Porsche exhibit was the reason I came. The Vault was unbelievable a secret trove of almost any care you can think of....had a blast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S8101XGmichaelb

50,Best car museum ever,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this museum. If you're a REAL car buff and fanboy like I am spend a little more money and time and do the EXTENDED Vault tour. The regular vault tour is a must but I could have spent 12 hours more if I had a choice. One of the highlights of my year was this museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dylanmV5027YS

50,Exceeded expectations,"I was dreading being dragged along to a car museum! But when I got there it was sleek, expansive and quite informative. There’s activities for kids, cars from movies and a few different interesting ways of displaying the vehicles. For only $16 it was 1.5 hours well spent. It’s a 15/20 minute walk from the Farmer’s Market so another good activity in the West Hollywood area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahcS4456RY
50,One of the better attraction in LA. An enormous collection of historic automobiles!,"If you can afford it, do not miss a tour of The Vault where there are a few hundred amazing cars each with a story. Two tours of different lengths are available at additional charge to the main museum.The Petersen is one of those incredible museums that really could only exist in LA. Remarkable venue and an unbelievable collection of vehicles spanning the entire history of automobiles and motorcycles.Pretty pricey but worth it IMHO. You get a small break flashing you AAA card.Do not miss this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Waterloonie
40,Well curated collection of contemporary cars,"We went to the Petersen for a few hours on Christmas Eve with my father and son. Their online ticket purchase system worked smoothly and it was easy to check in once we got out of the parking structure. Ample parking for both wheelchair access and EV charging.The collection spans three floors with a modest amount of explanation of each car, motorcycle or movie prop. This collection had a section devoted to cars from movies and a section devoted to Porsche. There was also a large collection of motorcycles which I found the most interesting since it a category that is often not stressed at other museums. I have seen much larger collections at the Nethercutt in Sylmar.For what we saw it was a bit pricey, considering there was a $20.00 tack on for parking. Still, if you are in the area and are a car enthusiast its worth a look. Very accessible for people in wheelchairs and for younger children with appropriate supervision.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Resorteye
50,The full tour,Did the full tour. Was happy to pay the going price given the amazing vehicles that this place has. Lots of movie cars as well.

50,Fantastic Museum,"For our last day in LA before heading home for Australia we headed for the Peterson Automotive Museum. The museum has a remarkable collection of hundreds of motor vehicles, many of which are in original, pristine collection. General admission prices are very good value but we went for the additional 75 minute vault tour which was amazing. A guide takes you into the climate controlled basement where there are hundreds of vehicles and provides a very informative many of the key vehicles kept there. One in particular, an original Ferrari, one of the very first built by Enzo Ferrari to race is estimated to be worth 35 million USD. Photography however, within the vault, is not permitted as many of the vehicles are on loan or kept there by private owners for appreciation/security purposes. The museum its self is set over three floors, well spaced out and the museum staff very engaging and knowledgeable. We had lunch at the museum restaurant which was most certainly well above standard museum fare and licensed. If you’re a car enthusiast, appreciate fine automobiles, or looking to entertain teenagers with an interest in cars, make plans to visit the Peterson Automotive Museum, highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunnyCoastDiner
40,"VERY good, but could be better","First, if you're not going to pay for the FULL tour, don't bother; the exhibits (other than the tour) are not very exciting, unless you're truly a die hard motorhead. If you DO spring for the tour, you'll be disappointed if you don't take the Upcharge to the longer tour because you'll not only miss out, but you'll SEE from a distance what you're missing out ON, and you'll be disappointed. I personally think the tours are overpriced, but, again, if you're a motorhead, you'll love this place. Plan on doing something AFTER because this is NOT a full day affair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffB45
50,A must if you’re a gear head!,"Being car crazy this was on my to do list whilst in LA.. I knew the Petersen was top notch as far as car museums but it exceeded my expectations! The building is three levels of exhibits plus a vault of the rest of their collection.. The exhibits are revolving and entertain every genre of car enthusiast.. On my visit the third floor was movie cars, second floor was a very comprehensive exhibit on the process of creating a vehicle from design, to production, to finished product featuring a Mazarati SUV. Additionally vehicles that had landmark innovations for their era where there too. On the same floor was a history of Japanese cars plus some custom motorcycles.. The first floor was a Porsche exhibit and a few historic Japanese cars hinting at the exhibit above.. My favorite was the Juxtapoz showcasing “low brow” hot rod art. Ed Roth and Von Dutch are my car art heros and I was thrilled to see the Orbitron and the Kenford plus a handful of their 2D works! Although classic American cars and hot rods are my thing I found the other exhibits showcasing the Japanese and European vehicles to be very interesting and informative! Unfortunately due to time constraints I could not visit the vault but will surely be visiting the Petersen again when in LA to check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shedrivesahotrod

I would have thought that the Petersen (publisher of the hot rodding world) would have a permanent hot rods through the decades exhibit. Very few rare American cars or regular cars on display. I was expecting so much more. The vault is very impressive. Historically significant cars are/have to be hidden away so as to not get damaged. They need to make a book showing the cars in the collection, since there is to much info for me to retain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kingofrot95

As my wife claimed on traveling to the museum, “we are going to see pretty, pretty cars.’ You know what? Was she ever right.Specifically, we were going to see the Porsche Experience display...and it did not disappoint. The museum has plenty to see and spends good time and space presenting the vehicles and has appropriate descriptions/information available if you want to take the time.While the Porsche display was terrific, the vault was even better. Honestly, the experience would not have been nearly as good had we not taken the tour of the vault. It costs a bit more, but is TOTALLY worth it. We took the first tour of the morning, and there were only 4 of us...so it was akin to a private tour of some amazing vehicles.Cannot recommend this place highly enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joelk598
40,The Porsche Effect - A must see for the Porsche fan,I visited the museum primarily to see the current special exhibit the Porsche Effect. It presented an amazing collection of rare cars from early 356s to a variety of race cars. The rest of the museum presents a collection other cars from the movies to American race cars to Tuners. All in all an interesting way to spend an afternoon. For an extra charge you can tour the Vault which is full of additional rare cars in the collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/299jonc

50,Heaven for car lovers!,"First of all, you may need to drive around the building/alley to find the entrance to the parking lot. Parking was $16, but we got a $4 discount with validation from the inside Italian restaurant.Vault tour has 2 kinds: regular and extended. Extended is 2 hours long. You must buy general admission ticket before you can buy vault tour ticket. Find pricing and times online.Vault tour is underground. Well lit and ventilated. But for some people who have issue with recycled air or extreme asthma and allergy, exert caution.There’s no restroom, toilet, or seating area, so you are standing and walking the whole time. Don’t go if you have issues standing and walking for extended period of time.When seeing cars, start with 3rd floor and work your way down. 3rd floor has lots of movie cars. Fun to see bat mobil, back to future car, etc.Japanese cars are on 2nd floor. There’s also free simulation race on 2nd floor. Due to the seating style and proximity of the screen, I became nausea while on simulator. Beware!2nd floor also has a children’s “ build” area. Fun for kids to use their hands to build or draw some things. This is also where McQueen (in cartoon Cars) is.Then back to ground floor with all the Porsche display. This might be a temporary display so if you are a Porsche fan, don’t miss the opportunity.Gift shop is a lot of fun.

40,Must see automotive museum for classic car collectors and fans,"Three floors of displays in the museum, plus The Vault as a guided tour at additional cost. The Vault is worth the additional ticket and includes many rare and famous vehicles. Your Vault guide will advise not to take photographs, explore on your own or touch any vehicles, although on our tour he frequently touched and tapped on fenders and even set his coffee cup on one vehicle (gasp!) as he talked. Clearly, do as they say and not as they do. The museum as a whole is impressive, and I would rate 5 stars if more cars were on display in the museum proper. Most vehicles are allowed very generous floor space. I could also pass on motorcycles in what is billed as an automotive museum. Be sure to allow plenty of time to get there. My 20 mile ride took two hours, which made me late for my appointed vault tour. Staff was understanding and allowed me to take next tour since space was available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WayneFromNY
50,A wonderful collection of things automotive,"Hadn't been back to the Petersen since they had opened their new museum, and I was wonderfully pleased to see what they had done. The museum itself is oriented around the history of automobile development, both nationally and internationally, and is a wonderful lesson in technological development of our world. For us real car buffs, they offer a Vault Tour, which encompasses a massive number of autos that are stored at the Museum, with a very animated and comprehensive description of the many cars that make up the collection. Very worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaldYokum
50,Another Great car museum,"Visited here during our recent vacation on the West Coast. This was our third car museum, first Sacramento, Academy of Art University Museum in San Francisco and now the Peterson. I missed the vault tour due to time constraints. If the ticket lady had mentioned it I could have paid the extra and taken the vault tour.Anyway the museum is fantastic and well worth a visit if your in LA.My favourite Museum in the LA area is Peter Mullen Automotive Museum but the Petersen is a close second.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/motorcar1
50,Great muesum for car lovers,Great muesum for any car lover.What a collection.Bikes and cars.$16 entry for 3 floors.There is a vault section that is an addtional $23 for an extra 75min tour.Worth a look and staff are friendly and toilets and wheelchair access which is good.A must do for a car lover.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deesimone
50,Fascinating and fabulous displays,"Although neither of us are car buffs, we found the Petersen to be an amazing collection of cars, motorbikes, and associated stuff. All the displays are very well designed and presented, with excellent signage.Car parking is very convenient and reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikebarie
40,Amazing cars and a lot of history ...,"Even is you're not a car buff, this museum has something for everybody. Antique automobiles use in classic movies and race cars off of the track from years gone by. And be sure to see the authentic low-riders in all of their gaudy beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerrygoff78735
50,Late in day vault tour was like a private VIP tour,"Loved this place ... came to see Porsche exhibit, but spent most of my time on a 2 hour Vault tour. Micala (sp?) led my vault tour with just one other fellow car enthusiast, about my vintage. Our guide, was informative, helpful, and happily indulged our many questions. We covered a ton of ground, as it was only 2 of us ... and saw pretty much everything.I toured little of the museum, as I didn’t have time. But, I was 100% satisfied just with the Porrsche exhibit, the vault ... and the parking lot. Yes, many great cars ar driven to the museum, including cars being shipped in and out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weidspeed
50,An excellent experience even if you are not a car buff.,"Very impressive. I have been to several car museum but none like this. The museum covers three floors plus the vault tours in the basement. The cars are spaciously placed for easy viewing, and most have an interesting history. In addition to the regular museum, they have separate vault tours - one 90 minutes and the other 120 minutes. The vault tours are well done with an experienced guide, but there is no place to sit down and no rest room. So if you can't handle being on your feet for that long, skip the vault tours or at least minimize to the 90 minute version.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmbakulich
50,A day free in LA so had to visit,"I was touring Route 66 and national parks and had a day free before this started. And wanted to get to this museum. And so glad I did, the Vault tour even the 75 mins is a must do. Well worth the extra and I must say it’s one of the best car and bike exhibits I’ve ever seen and I have been to many over the past 25 years. If you love cars and bikes, iconic ones from celeb owned to one offs, or ultra rare exotics then you need to visit this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/remal963
30,Interesting place,"This place has a pretty good display of cars that can entertain everyone for about 45 minutes. What they didn't tell us when we were getting our tickets was that you can pay extra to have access to another level. On the three levels that we did get to see, there was a nice variety of cars on display, including cars from movies, cartoons, and a room with engineers designing the cars of the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magfamily2016
50,Awesome Japanese cars!,"Great car museum with cars for everyone to enjoy. Parking garage is $15. Admission to the museum is $16/adult, less for seniors and children. A special vault tour underground with rare cars etc, is an additional price. There are 3 floors of beautifully displayed cars. We really enjoyed the Japanese car exhibit and Porsche exhibit. The motorbikes and movie cars were interesting as well. There is a restaurant and plenty of restrooms. We spent 2hrs here and loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pasherry

40,Treasure Trove of Cars,"Two types of admission available.General will give access to the 3 floors of vehicles on display. Noted separate sections devoted to Porsche (nice time line of cars); post WWII development of Japanese brands; evolution of electric and hybrid vehicles; a children’s booth; plus a select group of motorcycles. Photos allowed.For an additional fee, a Vault tour provides a look at a fleet of vehicles in various states of restoration waiting for their eventual display on the upper floors. Well work the extra few bucks. Sorry, no photos allowed in vault.There is a parking garage ($15). Also a restaurant.NOTE: The La Brea Tar Pits and LA County Museum of Art are just two blocks away from the Peterson Museum. Therefore, just leave your car in the Peterson garage when visiting these other attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6_Speed_Automatic
50,What a wonderful experience.,"My cousin’s family who are automobile aficionados, with teenagers in tow, invited me to visit the new remodeled Petersen Museum. On first approach the new building is of a beautiful design as are the vehicles it houses. The exhibits are wonderfully arranged with historical details displayed about each vehicle. The teenagers were besides themselves about the vehicles they saw that were created before their time. They commented the exhibits were artistic in their nature. I told them that was the whole point. As wonderful as the exhibits were, the highlight of our visit was a tour of “The Vault”. There are several tours to take, depending on your cost and time. Informative tour guides lead you on a tour to vehicles currently not on display. We all agreed the stories given by the guides enlightened us to a culture and history of each vehicle. There are not lavatory facilities available in the vault. It may not be suitable for the youngest of your family.Visiting the Petersen Museum is a wonderful experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dee4137

50,An excellent place to visit.,"We had been told of Peterson's by our son, who recommended we visit. In our opinion we made a small error when booking, we should have booked the longer visit to the vault. That said, the shorter tour was excellent, our guide was outstanding, being extremely knowledgeable about the cars on display and their history, answering all questions clearly and concisely. We will visit again for the longer tour when we are next in LA. Many thanks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puddykat

40,70th Porsche exhibit,"Somewhat disappointing after all the hype per the display. Some cars had been removed and a couple of displays shut down due to taking cars to Monterrey. Overall it was not even as large as the Japanese display on the next floor, very surprising for sure given the 70th year.Valut was good, much variety, excellent docent. Great lunch, but we came from Florida for the Porsche exhibit. What was there was great, after Rennsport, we saw much more at the Monterrey event, albiet not in the same type of environment or your world class museum. We have attended before but this trip was less than anticipated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/356bird
40,Excellent Car Collection,"If you love cars- this is the place to be! They have an amazing collection. It isn't exactly how it used to be (I think they rotate the collection now) but they still do a great job of displaying the cars. Back in the day they had more 40's cars out to view. They have exhibitions and rotations now, but the redesign of the museum is pretty superb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850dd

50,"Petersen Automotive Museum -- Truly, a Must-See!","A few weeks ago, I accompanied guests from out of town to the Petersen Automotive Museum -- my fifth visit, their first. I'd booked the Vault Tour as part of the visit. After my guests and had spent an hour-plus viewing the three floors of the General Exhibit, I was concerned that they'd be ""out of steam"" by the time the Vault Tour started.Not at all! The docent-guided Vault Tour was, as it always is, an incredibly fascinating and stimulating, in-depth immersion into automobile technology, aesthetics and history, from the first ""horseless carriages,"" through the iconic marques of the 20th century (foreign and domestic) and into where personal transportation is now and may be heading.Did I mention that the Petersen is a must-see? Yes, ABSOLUTELY a must-see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonPoontatahMiller
50,Never Gets Old,"Petersen Museum has some really nice cars! I know it sounds stupid but, it's true I have been there many times and have seen several different exhibits. Recently I took their vault tour and it was well worth the money. I plan to take the longer vault tour next time. American has such a history with cars and you can really appreciate it by visiting this museum. One of my favorite pastimes is watching auto racing and they have just enough of those type of cars to satisfy many if not most auto racing fans' appetite. I high recommend you visit this museum. It is one of the best in Los Angeles. Good variety of cars, some famous, some not so well known but have interesting stories. I think this might be one of the most underestimated museums around. This is place is well designed and layed out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoyceK27
50,Car Heaven!,"This was one of the major highlights of my recent trip to Southern California. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting LA. I was practically drooling with envy looking at their amazing collection of cars. There are three floors where the cars are displayed. There is also the ""Vault"" in the massive basement area of the museum where many of the other museum cars are stored. There is an extra charge for the Vault Tour, but it is well worth the money. There is also a very nice restaurant on the first floor of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobca1947

50,Porsche Experience,Fantastic! The Vault is well worth a visit. As a longtime Porsche owner I was drawn to the museum for the Porsche exhibit but was equally impressed with the quality and quantity of the entire exhibit. The restaurant was a nice break between the Vault and the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Art911

40,Wear Comfortable Shoes,"This museum is very well organized with plenty of parking. Off the main streets of Downtown Los Angeles, it looked more stunning inside than it does outside. And it looks pretty impressive on the outside. Walking into the lobby, the cars on display spark interest in everyone. There is a gift shop, restrooms, and a cafe that is quite healthy though expensive. There is the main desk where tickets can be bought or guests can check in at. And then, I started from the top.Like a delicious car-cake, each layer offered something different that excited and delighted the visual senses! Even the basement tour, though a little extra, was delightful and wonderful. It was hot down there but there were so many cars that excited me, I felt that it was well worth the wait. And then, returning to the visible layers of this car-cake building was at my ease and my own pace. No tour guide is needed because every car has a sign that goes with it, if not their own video reel. Although touching isn not allowed, it is also not needed. The sight of the cars, for an enthusiast of various arts and designs is enough to satisfy and blow minds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tchai85
50,"For car lovers, history buffs & movie fans","Petersen’s tour was amazing! Our tour guide was a wealth of information. I still can’t believe the amount of details he knew about every car there.

Been here at least 3 times and there’s always something new. Presently, there is an exhibition called the Auto Didactic/Juxtapoz which covers the art of Robert Williams and Von Dutch and many others. Touring the Vault is also a really good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trippic

50,Great Venue,"We were given tickets as a gift and what a treat. We got there early Saturday morning and had no trouble finding a place to park. We had reservations for a Vault Tour, which we highly recommend. There are a TON of cars in the basement that are worth seeing! We had time to view most of the museum prior to our Vault Tour. We had lunch at the restaurant on site which was VERY good. We then took our time to see the rest of the museum. It was a great day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coastal666114

50,If you are into cars...,It’s a must. They have a great variety of models and you learn a lot about the history of cars. If you are a fan of back to the future they have the DeLorean time machine! For the kids there’s a Lighting McQueen they can touch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cinaalb
30,The Vault,"The museum itself is great, the exhibition is done well, very organized and educating. This collection of cars is incredibly eclectic, highly recommend it. Just a word of warning if you decide to visit the Vault: They recently added the vault. This is a collection of over 250 vehicles from around the world. Some used to be owned by celebrities and dignifies. The only way to get there is through an organized tour, ours took about 75 minutes. The tour quality is totally dependent on the tour guide, we simply had a bad luck with a very unpleasant guide that was rude and was focused more on rules rather than quality. He apparently tried to follow some rules in a very unreasonable manner.i.e. They do not want you to squeeze by a car and rightly so, this is a very expensive collection but some cars have more than 5 feet gap so going by them and peeking through should be more than reasonable. They didn’t allow it and yet the guide had the group follow him through at time narrow paths between two cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ItaiV_12
50,A Walk Back in Time,"We came to California for a wedding and stayed on to see many of the museums in Los Angeles, including the Petersen Auto Museum. There was an initial admission and then a special VAULT tour which was extra. We paid for the extra 90 minute tour and it was well worth it. Even my wife liked the visit.We saw cars owned by famous movie stars, cars that carried the President and other world leaders.For me, seeing the old cars in pristine condition was a step back in time. I've always enjoyed looking at the old cars in local shows or when an antique passes me on the street.You should plan on about half a day for the visit; you park in the very distinctive looking building.len243.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Len243
50,Cars Galore & Great Italian Food,"I made a special trip to see The Porsche Effect limited time exhibit and also purchased a Vault Tour ticket. The Porsche exhibit was just what I wanted to see and the main gallery display was excellent. The layout walked through Porsche's entire history and racing pedigree. The 90-minute Vault Tour was amazing and had cars covering the entire history of the automobile from their inception to the present day. Be sure to plan enough time for this in your visit. The docent/guide really knew the details and stories behind the cars, many of which are in original and pristine condition. There's even some fun sports, racing and movie cars to see. Be prepared to walk and stand a lot which is what led me to take a break in Drago, the on-site Italian restaurant. The Caesar Salad was among the best I've ever had and the Salmon entree was excellent. All in all, a great location from every perspective!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickB_SJC

50,Awesome experience,"This was my husband and my third visit to the Peterson (once was before the remodel). We took our son and his wife this time and did the vault tour. We had enjoyed our previous visits immensely and have highly recommend the museum to friends and visitors for years. However, everyone needs to do the vault tour at least once in their life. I think the vault was more enjoyable on a return visit, as our first visit to the remolded museum took most of the day. As an educator, I’m impressed with the way the history and specifications of the cars and items is presented. Don’t miss the “kid” space that has fabulous interactive models of how a cars components work! The simulator is cool also!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22scadoo

50,They know it all!,The docent who led the Vault Tour was extremely knowledgeable and very passionate about the vehicles there. He answered questions and made sure we could hear him well. The man polishing the Porsches that morning when we arrived knew the history of them and was super friendly and willing to answer my son’s questions. The newly refreshed building is the perfect showplace for all of these automotive pieces of vehicular history. The employees made this visit extra special.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cccladybug

50,Must see for car enthusiast!,This museum was educational and informative by giving the story behind each of the vehicles on display. The quality and rarity of the vehicles was impressive.

Such a wide range and covering so many important phases of our history with cars. Before you come make reservations in advance to visit the vault, an even more stunning selection of milestone cars awaits you there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/748travelc
50,You JUST gotta see this place,"Visiting this museum has become one of the highlights of my trips to LA, especially taking the Vault tours!The “Vault” is the basement where the museum stores both written automotive material (after all, Petersen was a publisher!) but to me the real draw is to get to see all the rare cars the museum either owns or stores that aren’t currently on display. For security reasons no pictures are allowed, but the experience is so memorable I can bring to memory such things as the Pagani Huayra that Pagani donated to the museum or the Funny Car dragster nearby.There are two Vault tours offered, 75 or 120 minutes. My advice is to take the longest duration tour you can. Even the longest tour can’t cover all that’s on view.Tour size is limited, but several per day are scheduled. This tour has a separate charge in addition to the general admission ticket.I’ve done the Vault tour twice, and each docent leading the tour was engaging and knowledgeable. My wife really appreciated the female docent- how often do you get to meet a lady drag racer!The museum itself has 3 floors of display space with some seemingly permanent displays and lots of rotating displays or themes. And as you tour you can get supplemental information about what’s displayed from the Smartphone App or any of the several guides that roam the floor and will gladly strike up a conversation with you.There’s even a spot where you can play video games (Forza , a car racing game, naturally).There is (paid) parking available and limited on street parking nearby. Even a sit down restaurant is on site!You really owe it to yourself to pay a visit if you love cars or take someone who dies!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shyster951

50,Love cars? You'll love the Petersen,"Been to the Petersen a few times over the last few years. Have taken out of town guests as well as car enthusiasts friends that have never been. The current floor displays change on occasion and my last visit featured Porsche as the main event; classic, rare historical Porsche's in race trim as well as streetable examples. Check the website for what's being shown. Also, I like to go early, when they first open. You beat the crowd that way. I also recommend taking the Vault tour. Comes in two lengths (75mins vs 120mins?) where you'll see one of the most valuable collections in the world. Great morning of very cool stuff for car lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbarden2018

50,Fabulous automotive experience,A must see even if you are not a gear head. The vault tour is a must do as there are cars in there that you will never see anywhere else.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/417guy
30,Broadly Interesting Car Museum,"This collection of cars is incredibly eclectic. The top floor was a mishmash of movie cars, a couple hotrods, and a few coachbuilt bodied cars. Second floor, some Maseratis (sponsored?), old Japanese cars, questionably modified Japanese cars, two Ford GT's(old GT40 customer/road car and new styling buck), and some electric car area. First floor was Porsche - again nothing truly spectacular. Just some interesting stuff, and a lot of boring stuff.I was very excited for the vault tour, and I was disappointed. The docent was extremely nice and put on a good show, but he did not seem genuinely knowledgeable on the cars. One of the guests asked how big the engine was on an old Rolls Royce. The docent responded ""6 cylinders!"" So the guest reworded his question to ask for displacement, and again, the docent responded ""Only 6 cylinders!"" There were some genuinely interesting cars that the docent had no idea about. 959 rally car? Walked right past it. 599GTO? ""It's a Ferrari!"" Bugatti EB110 next to an Alpine A110... Not even a mention. Plenty of time to talk about every quirky car name or celebrity donor, but almost no in depth knowledge on mechanics or engineering. This seems like a great place to go if you have a broad appreciation for cars, and you want to see a lot of different styles and vintages. If you are looking for an amazing experience with a certain marque or era, this is probably not for you. There are some truly incredible cars, but there are also a lot of cars that I wouldn't look at twice in a parking lot, let alone spend time looking at in a museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterhQ1130DF
50,Not the Museum I remembered from ten years ago (that's a good thing!),"I visited the museum regularly from '95 until I moved away in '08. In those thirteen years or so, nothing seems like it changed. Stuffy street scenes, same old same old, and perhaps a small area dedicated to a temporary exhibit. Not so no mo'. This museum is all about the cars now. Nearly an entire floor was dedicated to the Porsche exhibit. The cars on ""permanent"" display were peppered with ""wow"" cars. Don't miss the GT40/GT interactive display. Vault Tour worth every penny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guykingo

50,Took a tour of the Vault - a great experience,Have seen this museum for a long time - we took the Vault tour and they also had special exhibits for Porsche and Low Rider cars. It was great and enjoyable. Had a good time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacksbat3
40,Time Machine,I went here for the sole reason to see the restored Back to the Future DeLorean Time Machine. I found myself enjoying other cars on display too. It's 3 floors. Start at the top and work your way down. I was there just over an hour. It's a shame parking costs as much as admission./,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RyanAndTiffany
50,For car lovers,"If you're a car lover, as I am, this place is for you. It has a huge collection of terrific cars, all in top-notch condition, and all very creatively displayed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
50,A hidden gem!,"There may be controversy in the city about the outside architecture of the building, but in my opinion I thought it was fantastic! Great photo ops before you even walk inside. The museum itself will evoke all sorts of memories (Herbie the Lovebug is there!). I saw the unimaginable -- was surprised and delighted at every turn. Love the way they incorporated the artist studios. It was a bit ""Porsche heavy"", but I liked that. :)The museum is the perfect size for a 2-3 hour visit. The gift shop is great! Have a fun time - I know you will!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/489fredr
40,Impressive but ...,"The collection of historic and unique automobiles is impressive but the way they’re displayed (and NOT displayed) is a bit disappointing.For example, the heavily publicized Lowrider exhibit had only 4 cars and dedicated a significant display area to a life-size piñata. Lame.The “Porsche Experience” exhibit should really have been named “The 411 on the 911” because the hall was dominated by the 911. Other, newer models would have provided more context to today’s “Porsche Experience.”And finally, the top two floors were fine. But nearly every automobile in the Vault is more interesting or historically significant than those on display in the top 2 public floors.Speaking of the Vault, we did the 75-minute vault tour. Worth the extra money easily! In fact, kinda regret we didn’t purchase the 2-hour Vault tour. It was definitely the highlight of our day there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EditorCJP
50,Amazing collection of high value vehicles,"We visited based on a recommendation. It was well worth it. A word to the wise though... the value of this museum is in visiting the vault. Without this element the visit would have remained worthwhile but not nearly as good. To give perspective, there are probably 50 cars on display in the main museum compared to 230 in the vault.The only shame is that you can’t take photographs in the vault which is a shame as there are so many amazing cars down there worth literally hundreds of millions of dollars. It would be good to have a memory of at least some of them.Well worth the extra for the vault. There is also free on street parking a couple of streets away for two hours which is better than paying the parking fee for the museums own lot. 2 hours is enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lhhamilton71
50,"Gorgeous, Thoughtful, and Fun. If only...","The Petersen, now, is what the Petersen from a decade ago should've been. It's full of eye candy, all glimmer and sparkle, or deep, dark and menacing. It leans toward the design side, cultural imagery and objects d' art versus the engineering, but still manages to feel like it covers all the bases. That's the thing: it now covers so much more than before. History? check. Movies & Show Business? check. Video Games? check--- (Forza stations fully decked out!) Design Process? check (Art Center has a studio in the museum). Motorcycles? check. Toys? check (Lego!)Everything is beautifully displayed and well lit. The circulation is comfortable and sufficient, even when a bit crowded. Staff is a bit indifferent, but not a distraction. Parking is easy, though at $15 certainly not a bargain.The only frustration is that feeling of wanting more, an emptiness stemming from not being able to touch anything, to sit in any cars, to hear any engines. The Petersen provides a visual feast, but still, it's like visiting a candy museum and not ever tasting the sweetness. Car guys/gals, and even non-car folks, understand this. The many (many!) signs repeat this, in a hit-you-over-the-head way. Don't touch.If the appreciation of car culture is sensory, the Petersen is a visual overload that is otherwise hollow. No touch. Few sounds or smells. (As for taste, the Drago restaurant is pretty good.)Yes, the challenges can't be understated. The crowds, especially the kids, would undoubtedly ruin every single car interior and exterior finish. But still. Maybe 3d printed replicas? Duplicates that are less valuable? I dunno, that's for the museum designers of the future to figure out. All I do know is that we were all longing to sit inside the Ford GT just to see the view, or feel the steering wheel. We wanted to straddle the cycle from Dark Knight Rises just to see if we could. We wanted to feel the crushed velvet interiors of the low riders on special display.The Petersen is still a five-star experience, in my opinion. If only...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelDrone
30,Movies cars,You see a car in a movie and you like ....what do you do ...you go see it in this museum and take a picture of it and show it to your family and friends and touch it also,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rashedlahha
50,Sunday Funday!,This Labor Day weekend we chose to have a staycation. Although we did not go out of town that doesn't mean we can't explore our own backyard. We finally made it to the Petersen Museum and it did not disappoint!The Petersen Museum is excellent all around. It is kid friendly(5 and up) and enjoyable for those who are not car fanatics like myself. Make sure to check out the interactive room for kids on the 2nd floor. They have carpads which help keep the kids busy on the 2nd floor while you explore.The price for a family of 6 to get in cost $74. I felt the pricing was reasonable for the amount of time you spend in the museum. There is a classy Italian restaurant located in the Petersen Museum so if you are wanting food that is your only choice. Parking is $15.I sure we will be back because my husband and oldest son want to return to check out the vault that houses 250 cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rwheeler1977

If you come enter through the garage as the have a few cars to look at there.Lots of exhibits and really enjoyed learning about the history of models like Porsche. Also great to see some cars from various movies.Lighning McQueen is there and my 2 year old got a kick out of it. There is also a discovery center where they let you draw cars, build cars out of Lego and race them, as well as learning about engines.Great place. Really enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamuelFHuang
50,Cars Lover,If you love cars you will love this place. It was amazing. The best is they have a place for your toddlers to learn about cars. To learn how brakes work & everything.

Truly a place you have to check out...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natural1sumr

30,Nothing special,"Petersen Car Museum is too pricey, it takes at most half an hour to go through .I can do something better in LA , don’t lost your time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adyescu
50,Go! Car Enthusiast or Not,"Beyond the care and glint of vintage automobiles, beyond the toy store (don't leave without a cool model car!), there is the building. It feels roomy because it is roomy. What a fun museum! There are no framed, dead Europeans on the wall lilting and swooning with secret meanings and symbols. No! This place is dedicated to engineering sleekness, speed, luxury, color, chrome, and American muscle (even though Bugatti, Maserati and Porsche will kick your eyeball out of their sockets! For once in the museum experience, reading the about the subjects is as fun as it gets. You get yo see the cars you saw in some of your favorite movies and television shows. You'll get to imagine yourself in a finely crafted sports number. You can even sit in the cabin of a Maserati! Even with all that, the place is just cool. I walked to the place and entered through the garage, where sat several elegant vintage luxury cars including a burgundy Mercedes limo! The lighting is fantastic, so if you're a photographer your pictures will be sublime (and even if you're not). The docents are lovely, knowledgeable folks who don't mind engaging your queries in interesting ways. The entry fee seemed steep at first but as I took in the exhibits, the idea of this wonderful American thing took hold and conveyed just how emense the horseless carriage is. When you go, allow at least three hours and don't forget your camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492nathanieln
40,Beautiful collection,Went recently to see the Porsche exhibit and was not disappointed. What a wide range of gorgeous cars and motorcycles...will def go again and take the Vault tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaB916

Cars for children amazing exhibition!It’s very spatial place to feel and see cars.But, unfortunately vault, which I heard contains much more than that, not easy to be in.Very recommended place.BTW, there is caffe, shop and EXCELLENT Corvette",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/593yurys
50,Unreal Collection of cars,"If you like your cars and car history than this is a must visit, 3 floors of beautiful exhibitions on the history of automative works and how they came about and how they have influenced todays work. There Porsche exhibit was amazing, as well as the Ferrari exhibit. Too put the icing on the cake there was also Ferraris 2006 F1 car as well as the Mclaren P1 and Porsche 918 Spyder which was an unreal to see such cars in person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rohankapila
40,Hoping to see more cars,The exhibits are nice but the Vault tour is where they keep the bulk of the cars. Definitely worth adding this to your ticket but even then you only get to see a fraction of the Vault. Would have liked more time there and more access to the breadth of cars versus hearing long stories about just a few of them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KRBBoston

30,To little for too much!,"As a frequent business traveler and car fan I try to visit the petersen every time I am in town... it certainly is a good place to visit if you are into cars! Especially you should do the extra vault tour once, which they offer to guide you around their storage.But here begins my point of critique: This time I visited the Petersen with my family and became aware of the crazy pricing they do have: USD 20,- per person + another USD 20,- for the vault tour + parking... as a family of 4 you have USD 175,- on your clock for a museum, which is nice, but not worth 175 bucks for a visit of possibly 2 hours.Guys you should have a family pass or something and come down to earth!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pkabel

40,cool cars,This place could take you 3 or more hours if you're a car junky and includes some exhibits on motorcycles as well. The Porsche exhibit was my favorite part but all the cars were unique and cool in their own ways. There is also a small kids section that I recommend for ages 4-9 ish.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seancU8639CF
50,"Cool museum, both inside and out",What a great surprise when we came across the Petersen Museum. We were in LA for a film festival and decided to take in the LaBrea Tar Pits. We missed our turn and decided to park and walk around instead. I had never heard of this museum but was drawn to the amazingly cool four story building with a maze-like superstructure on it. My 23 yo nephew and I (both engineers) were in nerd heaven with all the different cars and related memorabilia that was totally unlike any of the other car museums I’ve been in before. I would definitely return again next time I’m in town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O4346FSdianes

The next floor takes you through technology and innovation including a working design lab. Finally race cars and a large collection of Porches. There is another floor below with more than 250 cars but this was an additional $20 to tour and we didn't have the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoyMcN

50,Beautiful museum,"The exhibits are very well done. There are activities for kids. We paid extra for the 70 minute vault tour. The guide was extremely well informed. You would not have to go on the vault tour to see plenty of cars, but if you’re really a car buff you will want to go to the vault tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/498AnnaC
50,Excellent Museum,A must see when in Hollywood. Easy to get there and many things to see. The children really enjoyed themselves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingE-Tx
50,The Museum is enjoyable — the Vault Tour is outstanding!,"There are two very different experiences here — upstairs and downstairs. “Upstairs” is the regular, three-floor museum. It’s enjoyable, albeit a little underwhelming. The space is modern, nicely designed and open, and the exhibits are varied and well arranged. It doesn’t take very long to see everything on the three floors — and, once you’ve seen it, you may not feel inclined to return until the exhibits are significantly rotated. You might be inclined to mumble, “Is that all there is?” It could hold more, to be sure.There is more. A lot more. “Downstairs” — in The Vault.We took the 75-minute guided tour (there is a longer version). You descend a few flights of stairs into what is more or less an underground garage. There are 250 cars lined up down there, fairly tightly packed. It’s a bit warm — warm enough for them to provide bottled water to those on the tour. There’s no sense of design to the space and only the slightest sense of moving from exhibit to exhibit. Very different from the upstairs. But, it’s very enjoyable!It’s a fairly linear, but very impressive, history lesson — first of US automobiles and then of European automobiles, followed by famous Hollywood cars (there are some of those upstairs, too), and cars that belonged to former heads of state, from the US and around the world. The variety is amazing. It’s a great collection.Our tour guide, however, was even more amazing — truly outstanding — articulate and with a great, dry sense of humor. She appeared to be in her mid-20s but had the knowledge of someone three times her age. Thank you, Micaela — you made the experience!There is an added charge for the Vault Tour and tickets are limited so it’s best to buy them in advance. Pictures are not allowed in the Vault. Upstairs includes a large gift shop and a very nice place to eat.I am likely to return — to The Vault.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonr105
50,Awesome car museum close to my home.,So I live no more than 15 miles from this great museum and I've been fortunate to of been to it before its 90 Mill$ renovation. Since its renovation I have become a member and been able to enjoy all of their exhibits and have been invited to all of their member only exhibits. Even with out membership this museum is definitely worth checking out. It is located in the museum row so allocate at least an hour and half to check it out. Also if the vault tour is available its worth checking out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miguelrQ4389PO
50,Amazing cars and history,"An amazing collection of cars from around the world. A must see is the Vault for a guided tour. Also the one off exhibits are great. The Porsche display was well worth it. Try the restaurant but stick to the simple burgers, pizzas and sandwiches. Anything else is “hit or miss”. You can spend 3 hours here with the family. Also good kids sections with interactive activities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/875peterb

Lots of one-of-a-kind vehicles, all with fascinating stories.

50,"Must see museum for petrol heads, allow lots of time.","Five hours to get around the museum including the full vault tour. That's mandatory. If you don't do this tour then you should be arrested for lunacy, because its great. The museum is clearly oriented to the local car culture, American cars, movie cars and hot rods but there are enough classics to keep the rest of us interested.Unfortunately the vault tour is closely shepherded so I wasn't able to look closely the cars that interested me (a grosser merc, or maclaren can am beast) but wow, it's amazing.The displays are immaculate and I enjoyed the Japanese car theme in one of the halls, and some of the development motifs elsewhere.Basically, if are a petrol head, this is for you.Oh, and the restaurant has the best pizza I've had in the USA.Just excellent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldredjag

50,The Petersen is worth a visit,"Truly one of the most amazing car museums I have ever been in (to quote my husband). The vault tour is an absolute must. My husband recommends allowing twice the amount of time you think will be necessary for this place.This is truly one of the top 10 car museums in the world. You can see everything from a motorbike to a one-off round-doored bodied Rolls Royce. The range is mind-boggling and the staff are really knowledgeable. I let my husband visit this unsupervised and he spent the whole day there, which makes the entry fee well worth it. He did comment that the food options are limited - you have silver service or nothing - but he came back with a big smile on his face and raving about the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonimcallen

We also did the (shorter) vault tour, which was well worth it, quite informative and I definitely recommend it. If possible, I suggest you get there early enough that you can fall through the door as soon as they open, which we did and thankful for it. It gets really pretty crowed. Also worth noting is the fact they have a nice restaurant inside, with very good food. This was definitely a worthwhile experience.There are also very nice museums in the immediate area so you can make a day of it if you chose to do so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R8737BPjimb

50,Why didn't I go sooner?!,"I have grown up in LA and I have not gone to the Petersen Museum until this year and now I am a member! I had a friend visiting from out of town and we were actually going to LACMA, but the museum was closed so we walked across the stream to the swirly red and silver building that attracted our eyes and realized it is an automotive museum.The service was excellent and they suggested starting from the top floor (3rd) to the bottom) and we spent a good 2 hours there. The top floor gives you the history of how the automobile today came starting with buggies with engine. Also, it has a whole cars used in movies section with DeLorean and the Batmobile. When you get to the second floor, it has a whole section on boxcar racing (children), motorcycles, Lego McLarens, and a new exhibits about Japanese cars in the 1930s-1950s (Monozukuri exhibit only opened to members at the time). On the first floor, there is the evolution of Porche and an arts section explaining the Lowrider culture, which made for an interesting dichotomatic affect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenkX1486HU

50,Wonderland for Automotive Enthusiasts,"While I was in LA last year December, I wanted to kill some time before heading to Universal Studios to take my kid some place interesting so I stumbled upon Petersen Automotive Museum via recommendation received on TripAdvisor.The place we were staying was closeby to this museum so we did not have any trouble locating it and you would notice the quirky silver - red building design of the museum that evidently stands out as an art gallery when seen from the road. As you enter towards the reception desk to collect your tickets the entrance area itself has some interesting vintage cars and low riders on display which should be enough to get you excited for rest of the tour.We began from the ground level which has one section dedicated to art and cars which is an interesting take on how these machines were not just wheels and engines but an important part of our culture, how they evolved with changing times and trends and some of these cars have been symbolic to society in many ways, cars have been extensively used to express artistic side of human nature.The other half of ground level has all cars from the house Bugatti which look exuberant and give you an insight into their family history and I simply could not stop admiring some of these beauties I would have probably seen just in movies. We then moved to the third floor which has extensive collection of everything related to automotive starting from a bicycle, old gen two wheelers, early car engines and lot more.My favorite section had some famous cars on display like 'The Love Bug' Beetle Herbie, Delorean DMC-12 ""Time Machine"" from 'Back to the Future' movie, The Batmobile and Bat-Bike. There is a section for kids on level 2 which is informative and engaging for them to be kept occupied with some activity based learning. I was running out of time and felt an extra hour or so was necessary to soak in the information and history of motoring at leisure.There is a car collectible shop on ground level and a café as well if you want to grab something on the goEven if you are not a car or motoring enthusiast this place deserves a good 2-3 hours of your attention and the cars on display are stunning and would take you on an exhilarating journey into the world of motoring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KreativeGeek

Petersen was a car guy, and the foundation funded by his publishing empire seeks, and succeeds at celebrating and memorializing all things automotive. It's not just about horsepower, speed, handling or fat tires. The Petersen has a broad and eclectic collection of automotive history of its own, and regularly brings in world-class collections. This is simply a remarkable, continuous festival of the car - technology, quest for perfection, successes, failures and how the car has affected modern society.From pre-Model T to the latest McLaren.

50,Vault updated - worth every penny.,"The museum is great, especially right now if you’re a Porsche lover!!!Imo- if you don’t do the vault, you’re not making use of your time here. The vault is literally an underground parking garage with cars I never dreamed of seeing (definitely don’t see this caliber of automobiles in one place in the Mid West where I’m from...more specifically KY 😂😂)Brand new ford Gt, Pagani’s, McLearen P1, tons of old stuff and muscle cars if that is your thing. But literally everything from crank cars, to $2M super cars... spend the money and do it. I did the short one, didn’t see the need for a longer tour, but I’m not one to ask the guide 20 questions either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyK751

Several cars are from private collections. A nice place to visit then go across the street to LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coachee1313
30,Too expensive. Too brief tour of The Vault.,"My whole trip through California, Arizona and Nevada was based on classic cars theme. All kind of cars. I’ve seen many. Also quite rare ones. That’s why I decided on visiting Petersen World’s Premiere Automotive Museum. For the price of the ticket I was expecting to see a lot. Especially the “famous” Vault. Well, Porsche’s open exhibition was nice. Some nice cars in the first floor. But really nothing that I wouldn’t already see or read about. I was expecting something more, something special. All in all it’s Peterson so I did expect more than just a few cars which I already seen in numerous miseum in Europe. The Plymouth prototype was very nice to see. And honestly I was expecting similar type of cars. One of a kind, prototypes, ... So I thought The Vault would be it. Once we entered the vault we were told that they are renovating or reorganizing the vault. And they don’t have all the cars in there. They are moving them here or there or they are on different location. At the counter nobody from personel mentioned this! We saw roughly 100 cars. You cannot walk alone - it is guided - you cannot take pictures. There is a security officer hovering behind you at all times. And explanation on the cars was brief to a point it was only described what car and what model. Which most of is already knew. Most of the time if you can see the brand badge and find the name of the model you don’t need a guide. I know it’s difficult to explain everything about every car since it’s many cars but we got way better history tour FOR FREE in Shelby factory in Las Vegas. In The Vault were few cars that got my interrest running, for example Dodge Charger Daytona, which was only briefly mentioned and explained the front was added to a Charger for Racing purposes. I mean those things are all Wikipedia stuff. I am sure these guides have A LOT more of information at theor disposal. They are half if not full-on car historians.The other part of the vault - maintanance hall/garahe - was quite more interresting. Because of this I didn’t give a score of only 2. We saw Jag XKSS and we were told more about the history of the Jag and other cars. Actually an incognito gentleman with a hat and walking stick knew every detail of every car there was. Together with interresting history facts.To wrap it up - I was expecting to see more cars of my interrest. And I know every interrest is different bit mine expectations - set upon ticket price of almost 36 USD plus parking - were not fulfilled. Also because half of the cars i would have liked to see were sitting outside in the rain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Odpadnik
50,An amazing journey into history of cars,The museum is not large and has a good presentation of special vehicles.I had the opportunity to visit “THE VAULT”- a special exhibition in the lower floor of the museum with 250 special cars. This was amazing and worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrVisittheworld

40,"Great building, great motor vehicle collection","The museum is very near the Le Brea Tar Pits and the LACMA (Los Angles County Museum of Art). The building itself is a work of art and picture-worthy. It was certainly the most distinctive building that we saw while in LA. When we bought our tickets (senior and student discounts available), it was suggested that we take the elevator and start on the third floor. It was interesting how the design of the first automobiles went from strictly an engineering challenge to a search for the perfect blend of engineering, functionality, speed, comfort, style and most recently efficiency. The placards describing each vehicle were very well done. It even kept my wife’s attention and she normally gets bored at car shows.The third floor holds the museum introduction, concept cars, Model T, very early electric and hybrid cars, as well as cars used in movies and TV shows. The kids will love seeing the real Bat Mobile and Bat Cycle. There is also an antique car that people can sit in and pose for pictures.The second floor is has a kid zone, videos narrated by car enthusiast Jay Leno, custom cars, motorcycles, performance road cars, manufacturing, and a design studio.The first floor is mostly about the artistic influence on automobile design.We didn’t get there till 2:30 and it closed at 5:00. We felt a little rushed and should have made efforts to get there earlier in the day. I would plan at least three hours to fully explore and enjoy the terrific vehicles in their collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road_Warrior32034
50,One of America's Best Car Museums,"As a longtime member, yesterday's visit resulted from an offer to see the cars and motorcycles in its basement collection called 'The Vault.' These are cars not currently on display or recent donations. Among them are dozens of spectacular examples of Bugattis, Delahayes, Rolls/Bentleys, Porsches, Cadillacs, presidential limos, unusual makes, a smattering of woodies and interesting motorcycles from the beginning on.On the main floors were a collection of movie cars, low riders and a Porsche historical exhibit which are changed out with regularity. There are special sections on Art and Design and exhibits for kids.Unlike the original Harrah Collection in Sparks of the 60's or a Barrett-Jackson auction, you won't be walking by rows of old cars. It rather seeks to do in-depth profiles of specific automotive categories featuring a raft of examples.This can be a family adventure with something even for the non-addict. On-site restaurant offers a wide-ranging menu at reasonable prices. For $15 you can park in the monitored indoor adjacent parking area, and members are issued parking vouchers. The museum offers a well-stocked 'gift shop' and I've assumed that their vast library of automotive journals and periodicals can be accessed by special arrangement.Include the Petersen in you plans to visit the area, You won't be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraveLee073
50,Get in here!,The first floor had a Porsche exhibit that was fabulous. The 2nd and 3rd floors had more permanent exhibits that were terrific!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glenw2013
50,This was the most entertaining museum I’ve visited in Los Angeles.,"If you like cars AT ALL you will love the Petersen Auto Museum. They have many movie vehicles, custom motorcycles, an entire section dedicated to Porsche history, and that’s not to mention the rotating exhibits I’ll definitely be coming back for. It was awesome to see the design studio, where students dream the future of super cars. It cost me $13 as a student, and adult tickets are $20. I can not recommend this museum enough, and I can’t wait to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cod615
50,A Car Guy's Dream,"I'm a guy that enjoys Top Gear and The Grand Tour. This museum was next to my hotel, and together 2+2=4.

50,A must for petrol heads,"This place is amazing. From the crazy architecture to the incredible car collection. You’ll see cars here that you’ll never see anywhere else.. some of them are one of a kind. The collection of Porsche’s is particularly interesting and shows the development through the years and how the DNA has been maintained. That’s far from all though. There are cars from films (as you’d expect in LA), as well as some amazing supercars and a great collection of vintage Motorcycles and children’s cars. There’s definitely something for everybody here - even people that are dragged along by their petrol head partners and kids!I’d definitely recommend this to anybody with any interest in cars or bikes- or even in movies...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidhQ5357MV
40,Great museum.,"Myself and partner visited last month. Did the vault tour. An extra $20 for a 1.5 hour tour. That was awesome, but we were quite unimpressed when we were told we weren’t able to take photos and then towards the end a private tour came in and were allowed to take photos in front of us. The staff in the gift shop probably should find new jobs. Too busy talking between themselves to actually provide any level of service. Standing in line to be served I found out the young guy got a warning the week before for something. The lady that served us couldn’t even talk to us.We ate lunch onsite at Drago. Ordered Carbonara and Salmon. Both were wonderful. Reasonable prices and Service at restaurant was very good.The actual museum displays were great. The vehicles were wonderful to look at and the collection was awesome. We would visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissSkoda

50,CAR LOVERS GALORE,"Petersen is one of the most impressive automotive museums I have been too. They have a great variety of new and old vehicles. Some cars are so rare, they are valued well over $10M (They have a $75M Bugatti...).The facility itself is state of the art. Very high end and has beautiful architecture. Petersen allows you to book corporate events and even weddings at the Museum (I need to find the right girl so we can get married here ;)).The vault was closed for renovations when I went, which was a bummer, but I absolutely plan on visiting again when I am back in the LA area.Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/911corey
50,A World Class Automotive Museum!,"4 stories (if you count the ""Vault"" in the basement) of very cool cars and motorcycles in a new and art deco building on the corner of Wilshire and Fairfax. Start on the top floor and work your way down to the Vault (buy tickets for the Vault in advance). Special exhibits when I visited were the Porsche, Ferrari's, and ""low riders"". The Vault is worth the time and money and I had a blast. I got there when it opened and stayed until around 3pm (5 hours). The crowds were light and I could spend a little extra time in the race simulator. Ford won't be asking me to race the GT at Rio, but I did OK in the Cobra at Laguna Seca ! I would go back soon for a Corvette exhibit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asitis63
50,Kids and Dads will LOVE this place!,"I recently took my uncle, niece and 21 yr old daughter to Peterson Auto Museum in Hollywood as part of a day exploring L.A. and it was a hit - even with the girls! It is spotless, well organized, and with interesting pieces for everyone. The movie cars were fun, but the classic cars like the Dusenberg and the Bugatti's were amazing. They even have a special ""vault"" for the extra fervent car enthusiasts in your party. The onsite restaurant is upscale with white tablecloths and a delicious menu. You can go in for as little as $12 or go for the vault and a meal and make a more elite day of it. Definitely not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjjSD
40,Perfect for Porsche and Ferrari Lovers,"The two automobile makers with the most cars on display are Porsche on the first floor and Ferrari on the second. You will also find an electric car and a hybrid one more than 100 years old, some hot rods and other interesting models not so old. There is a collection of little cars for little drivers. Motorcycles are on display, along with samples of low rider custom cars. I thought there would be more production models from the 30s to the 80s on display, but that was not the case.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/THFinPR
20,A decent way to kill an hour or two,"It's an interesting car collection but not nearly as diverse and expansive as I had assumed before visiting. The museum recently had a facelift and features a cool facade and clean, modernist interiors. But overall, feels like you are visiting a personal car collection and not a historically rich museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ImRebeccaA

They have such of a variety of automobiles and motorcycles ranging from some of the old original cars to special exhibits like 70 years of Ferraris. There are exhibits on popular cars likePorches and cars that never sold because they were so unusual. They also have famous movie vehicles from the Batmobile, the Back to the Future Car, and others from the movie Cars, There are knowledgable docents to give you history and answer questionsFor an added cost, you can visit The Vault, which is touted as 100 years of automotive history. The Vault houses special cars many of which are never on display to the public.You can spend many enjoyable hours touring the museum. I recommend it for any age because everyone can get something out of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyincali2016
50,Weekend visit,"We went to La to visit the Petersen Museum for my Husbands birthday present. The museum is newly renovated and gorgeous. It has plenty of information folks to assist you. We used the free parcel storage in the security office so we didn't lug around shopping bags.We looked over the porche exhibit and the low rider exhibit. ( really cool with artistic paint jobs)Then took the vault tour. The ""vault "" is the basement storage area and hold special cars not not exhibit. My husband loved seeing all the race cars and the different models and annual changes. There is a chic restaurant on the main level with a bar named Drago. Italian contemporary food and surroundings. No meatballs or spaghetti.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickipadula
50,Massive exhibits,"A huge must if you’re a car person. Currently the museum has the Porsche Effect exhibit which if you are like me, a Porsche fanatic, it’s a got to go see. Porsche spanning the decades. A 64, 356, of course many 911’s, 935, 919 etc. They show a brilliant multi media spectacle of Porsche racing through the ages.Another must is the Vault Tour. Best to book in advance. It’s a 90 min guided tour of some great and fascinating cars.While Porsche was my main attraction, the other exhibits were outstanding; Ferrari, custom bikes, cars from movies & tv, classics and the curious. There is also a kids play area.The gift show is excellent. Stuff for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/218adrianb

I got a couple friends and we made a trip from Seattle to LA, just to visit this place.Would definitely do it again.We arrived a bit late in the day, at 3:30ish, so we only got through a floor and a half before the last vault tour of the day.Speaking of DO THE VAULT tour, the $20 extra you will pay is worth it. Not only are there the coolest and rarest cars in the world down there, but our guide Jeff made it so fun!Just to clarify on how much we enjoyed this, we came back 2 days later to finish the rest of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SergeGTS

50,World renouned,"Full disclosure -- I don't love cars. My husband loves cars and I love him, so there we were at the Petersen. Highly recommend for family unity and later credits for indulging me with Blade Runner tourist nonsense at the Bradbury. But the Petersen is within walking distance of museum square (LACMA, Folk Art Museum, La Brea Tar Pits, etc.) and the building itself is unbelievable so it's worth a visit. The design of the place itself is fascinating, and I really did love the Art Cars section. There are some movie and TV classic cars, including several Batmobile type vehicles. A whole room full of Ferrari -- I swear he squeezed out a tear seeing Schumacher's F1 something-or-other that he saw win in person, god love him. There's a separate vault tour. The cafe looked lovely. The kid's section was amazing -- hands on, creative. No condescension whatever, just really well done. Go! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljaack
50,A fun excursion for the whole family!,"My family of 5 spent a week in LA to visit colleges. It can be hard to find an activity to satisfy three kids - ages 13, 14 and 17. While my husband wanted to go to the Getty museum, we thought our kids would like the Peterson better. It did not disappoint. You start on the 3rd floor where autos from various movies are housed. The other two floors had some amazing cars and they did a great job of supplying enough information/history to go along with the cars. Would definitely recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michele9271
50,THe Art of Individual Transportation,"Creative and iconic cars and motorcycles that are borderline works of art are found here. We just loved our Peterson experience! ...even my wife who has minimum interest in cars(but loves art). Kids will enjoy the beautiful crafted kid's cars as well as the hands-on center. I just loved the old Porches, the 50's vintage Ferraris, and the amazingly painted and designed low-riders. Leave 2- 2 1/2 hours for this museum, more if you are a true devotee. Bring camera! Parking is extra $15 but we found a spot right on the block.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valtraveler10
50,More than just cars!,"We went to the museum because we had a couple car lovers in our group. We quickly found out there's a lot more to the Petersen Automotive Museum than just cars. The building itself is a magnificent design, and the layout of the museum makes it such a pleasant place to stroll through. The cars are grouped together in a very logical way, with plenty of space and easy navigation. There are cars from Hollywood for the film lovers. Cars of the future for the tech lovers. Historic cars for the nostalgia lovers. Miniature cars and an interactive space for the kids. We spent a couple hours and would definitely recommend this as a hidden gem just a few blocks from other well-known Hollywood attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barb536
50,Enjoyable,"Being dragged around a car museum is my idea of hell but I have to say it was enjoyable.

50,Amazing museum if you are at all into cars,Went here with my brother and his sons when they were in town. His sons are into cars and we had spent a morning driving some of the canyons around LA. WOW what a way to end the day! What an amazing collection of cars. This place was filled with one of a kind unicorns and rarities. If you are into cars at all you must go here to see amazing one of a kind dream cars. I won't go into the long list of amazing cars here but you won't be disappointed no matter how into cars you are. What is additionally amazing here is that the cars here are not some replica or fake displays but these cars are the actual original cars. I can't believe I had not been here before but I know I will definitely go back. Now I need to figure out how often the displays are changed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaQi
50,Automobile Presented as Art,"Just returned to the Petersen to see the Porsche Effect exhibit. As always, the exhibits show off the vehicles as art, well lit and each with a story, avoiding the pitfall of clutter and too much visual noise. The fascinating collection was well created. Also some great low riders on display. A must see for anyone with an appreciation of cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danjiro
40,Nice afternoon,Six adults and two children went to the museum and the Ferrari exhibit in early March. It was a nice way to spend the afternoon. A lot of interesting cars that you can easily walk through at your own pace. There were also some different activities for the young boys to do. Lots of restrooms that were very clean. Some good fun history lessons along with some cars from old movies. Something for everyone and we all really enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schmooglet
30,A little over-rated and left underwhelmed by the experience.,"After 3 unsuccessful trips to the US to see this museum I was left a little flat b the experience. Sure there are some lovely vehicles but the 'theme' didn't make a lot of sense. I think it should be called the Porsche museum as the mark features prominently.Sadly the manufacturer widely regards as the inventor of the motor vehicle, Daimler Benz, doesn't get a look in. In fact, there may have actually been none on display at all.I think my expectations were so high that it just left me a little flat and frustrated given the quality of so many other car museums on the West Coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAK2123
50,An unexpected highlight of LA,"We hadn't planned to go here but it was recommended to my car-loving son, and of course once we saw the outside of the building we just HAD to go in. We had a wonderful time here, particularly seeing famous cars from movies (seeing the DeLorean from Back to the Future!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJM784
50,Wonderful collection of vintage automobiles.,My daughter and I walked through the regular collection and those in the “vault “ and even she was impressed. The only issue was the length of the vault visit which was a little long and involved a lot of standing and listening. A little more freedom to explore for ourselves would have been nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juniord2006
50,"Eclectic Collection With Plenty of ""WOW"" Factor","Went here to see a temporary Ferrari display but there certainly was a lot more to it than that.The first WOW moment came even before I bought our tickets. Hard to walk past an M8 McLaren Can Am car without being seriously impressed. Sitting at the entrance resplendent in its ""McLaren Orange'; one of the most beautiful cars that ever raced in my opinion.Inside there is everything from old motor bikes to current model 'Hypercars'. Plenty of Bugatti's, a Duesenberg, a few 'Yank Custom Cars', way too much to mention here. There is an awe-inspiring tribute to Dan Gurney too. If you don't find his cars beautiful, go home, do some knitting.The museum is a good size. Plenty to marvel at without becoming too much of a good thing. Staff friendly.The Ferrari celebration was spot on. Not loads of cars (and the 250GTO was missing), but certainly some of the most beautiful Ferrari's of all time. Beautifully and simply displayed too. The lighting made them look works of art, which of course they truly are.All up, well worth going (even without the Ferrari display) for anyone who enjoys cars, or indeed just things of beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kgnof1977
50,CAR LOVE,If you love cars and mechanics this is second to none as far as a space to see some of the worlds best cars. What an amazing collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnFallonstudio
50,Fantastic museum even if you are not really into cars,"Excellent museum, leave yourself time to look around, we broke our tour up by doing the Vault tour (highly recommend) then had lunch in the museum cafe and then explored the rest of the museum after - well set out, very informative and the Vault tour was very interesting with a great guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyHotels
40,They have a great collection of cars.,If you like cars you will have a good time. There are many cars from different eras and movies. It takes 1-2 hours to casually check out all of the cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PirateCatLA
50,Car lovers dream,My friend and I wanted to go to Petersen's after hearing about it. We are both car lovers & weren't disappointed with the cars on display. There are three different levels & each has a different display of cars & motorcycles. The top floor is numerous cars from films over the years. I really enjoyed reading the history of the vehicles as well & the family behind a lot of them. You pay for parking in the parking garage. Then there are a few different tours you can choose from. They even have a tour that includes cars not on display. Nice little gift shop. We didn't eat here. Lots of photo ops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reneetravels2
40,Good For Race Car Enthusiasts,"Arrived on a Saturday after 1pm. Waited in a long line with only one person selling tickets to walk-ins. It was raining, so maybe this caused an uptick in museum goers. Lobby has cars on display, so we can look at something while waiting in line. Parking is a little pricey, but on a rainy day, it was worth it.Virtually all the cars on display are of American or European lineage. Second floor was most interesting for my 6 year old son. They gave out interactive computer tablets that you take around to different stations, so you learn how to build a virtual race car. Tablet uses characters from the animated Cars film.Best part of the museum for us was seeing the movie cars: DeLorean from Back to the Future; Batmobile; and Lightning McQueen model based on Cars.I also liked an exhibit on the history of cars and freeways in Los Angeles.Worth a one-time visit for me. Too bad I didn't have much knowledge or interest in the Porcsche, which was a major exhibit on the 1st floor. Hope their collection expands to Japanese cars, and that they can rotate it in to their exhibition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
50,Amazing! Highly recommend the Vault tour,"I’m not that into cars, but it was fascinating to learn about the history of the auto industry—electric and hybrid cars were invented much earlier than I thought—-and to see some of the most valuable cars in the world—historical/revolutionary cars, famous cars from movies, cars that well-known actors, politicians and religious leaders rode in and owned. We went on Free Museum day so general admission was free, we just had to pay $20 for “The Vault” tour. It was definitely worth the extra cost! Our docent Jeff was excellent—great voice, old school, funny and knowledgeable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimbersK

40,Going back in time at the Vault !!,"This is a very worthwhile museum to visit especially if you have an interest in cars. During my visit, there was a special feature on Porsche (The Porsche Effect) cars. It was great to see all the various brands/types of cars on display and the highlight was the guided tour of the Vault. You are not allowed to take any photographs in the Vault but it was a fantastic automotive journey through time! Again, this is a worthwhile stop while in Los Angeles. There is ample parking on site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BT993TT

Perfect for a rainy day visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dljclarke
50,Worthwhile for the Car enthusiast!,We visited this museum primarily for myself and my 6 year car mad son. We enjoyed the experience and viewing some of the cool authentic cars they have. My son and daughter loved the activity centre on the middle floor and of course getting to see Lightning McQueen and Miss Sally from Disney Cars. Absolutely worth the visit although for $46-$48 for 4 people it seems a bit expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/An0nymou5
50,A Must See Wonderful Car Museum,"The Petersen is an absolute must for car lovers. Not only are the rotating manufacturers/theme car events worth the ticket, but the regular museum is a wonder of adventure from the first automobiles, to Indy race cars. Certainly any car enthusiast won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1fastcat
40,A pleasant surprise!,"Actually thought this was LACMA when we entered (it's across the street) but stayed due to the awesome cars in the lobby. The building's exterior beckons. Inside the exhibit is well organized and curated. Fun for an hour for sure, then head over to LACMA as planned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blevans

30,"Best for car-freaks, not laypeople",We used to like this museum more - but they've remodeled it and taken away the fun parts if you ask me. Now it's really just about cars and variations between fancy cars. Their 'kid part' is a few x-boxes and a bizarre ipad adventure thing. They used to have hotwheel mania which was much better and installation rooms with historic settings that I found charming. I miss them. My car-loving relatives LOVE this place and are thankful it's just about cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arielmc

I have been to many auto museums around the world and this is one of the best. Allow at least 4 hours or more to really see and enjoy it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeadfootCJ7

40,"Ok with more current cars, too. Closer to downtown LA, but not the extent of the Nethercutt collection!",A bit crowded but stay focused on each auto and mentally screen out the other folk. I liked the trip out of town to the Nethercutt much better; more of an adventure to get there but so worth it. Fewer people know about the Nethercutt so fewer people in attendance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nandee
50,Fun and educational,A definite must see for all car enthusiasts. Try and go on free days. Just make sure you RSVP to be able to get in. Later in the afternoon is less busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/687satoshin
50,Porsche Exhibition,Fantastic looking building that houses some off the best cars that I have ever seen had to go back to see the new exhibit the Porsche Effect as last March they had the Bugatti exhibition. One highlight was the Ford GT40 holographic display went for around 4 minutes very good integration of technology used with a real display. Highly recommend to any car enthusiast.

50,Excellent Vault Tour & Collection,"My husband and I have loved cars for a long time but we'd never been to the Petersen Automotive Museum. The building which houses the collection is a architectural masterpiece! Once inside, start on the third floor where the history of the automobile is well curated. Lots of gorgeous cars or all types and ages. We opted to take the Vault tour which is where Mr. Petersen's personal collection is housed. Our guide, Andy, did an excellent job of relating the provenance of most of the cards. So many interesting stories behind these beautifully restored cars. A real plus was the nice restaurant, Dra Go. We stayed for lunch and the food was very good and the prices reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dorothee
50,Amazing Car Collection. Worth the Price for the Car Lover.,"I have been here a few times and have seen a few changing exhibits.

I am a car guy, and a museum buff and this is my heaven.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leiasnerfherder
50,Great Museum,"A very comprehensive museum of cars. History, development, technology and design. Very enjoyable to kill a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkRAus
40,"Vault tour is a must, otherwise lots of Porsches","I spent a very happy morning at the Peterson. The vault tour is a good idea as you see many cars stored there. the guide gave a very full history including how Lincoln and Cadillac got there names. There are vintage and classic cars, and some race cars. We saw presidents cars and movie cars from green hornet and fast and furious. Bugatti and Rolls Royce were valued in millions, and some owners garage there cars at the Peterson due to insurance. I liked the 1972 Renault Alpine rally car, the 1987 F1 McLaren of Alain Prost. But my favourite was the Toyota 2000 GT (James Bond you only live twice). It was a real shame no photos were allowed on the vault tour.the rest of the museum is interesting. they have the Batman car from the Michael Keaton films, and the Bale Bat bike. A lots of Porsches road and race. Some nice Ferraris and some classic bikes (Harley and Indian) some cars decorated for art (not my thing). a gift shop and restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonjpayne2017
40,Cool Cars,"Part of the show being in California is seeing all the nice cars on the roads. Yet, I heard about the Porsche exhibit, and decided to make a visit. I spoke with a security guard and started at the top and worked my way down. You get a sense of car history and finer appreciation of automobiles. I was even wowed by the ""Batmobile."" The sheer beauty of the sports cars, including early year models was amazing. They also have a great collection of motorcycles. And the design studio was interesting. I wished they had included Lamborgini. Fine collection nevertheless. Some type of interactive display would have been nice. It's possible there was something in the family section, which I didn't visit. My only downside was being shadowed by a security guard. I never had this experience at the British Museum, Met, Louvre, et al. I did see a fellow African-American, an employee--cleaning the cars....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cjejr2
40,"Great museum, but lacks a sense of place","Filled with beautiful cars and some interesting exhibits, the Petersen left me disappointed in its lack of emphasis on the Southern California car culture that sparked America's love of custom and hot rod autos. There was a superb display of Bugattis that seemed out of place here.On the plus side, various exhibits that trace the history of automotive history and development were interesting and informative.A small exhibit of low riders seemed like an afterthought, and showed only famous and highly detailed cars; I'd like to have seen some more representative of what's on the street.Given the location, and Hot Rod magazine heritage of Petersen, I think there should be a permanent exhibit on the SoCal car culture and the cars and companies that created American auto customization and racing development.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bartr
50,Vault tour amazing.,"We opted to see the vault tour, which lasted well over 90 minutes. It was worth the money to see the cars acquired. Some are worth millions. There was an official car that came fron Jordan, another couple from Russia, some past presidents' cars, cars that had been made and used on Hollywood sets. Some porches, cadillacs, an amazing Rolls Royce with circular doors and windows. A Honda, the original that sold well in USA in the 60's for an economical family car.The tour guide was really knowledgeable and towards the end of the tour he had to hurry to finish. We were lucky that our group was split in two, so there were only 12 so we could see and hear fine. Perhaps seeing less vehicles might give more time for questions etc.There is a shop and restaurant inside and the staff are helpful. If I hadn't done the vault tour I would have thought it average.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieQ937

40,Nice museum,"I've wanted to visit this museum for a long time. We we're visiting in the area, and with the current Porsche exhibit, I couldn't resist. The vault tour was interesting, if maybe a little overpriced. The regular collection was nice and worth the price of admission. The Porsche Effect exhibit was terrific. Porsche fans should not miss it. Drago restaurant on site is very nice, but consider making a reservation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jolsongoude
50,Great car museum,"Our family of three (two adults and one 13 year old boy) visited the Petersen Automotive Museum on Sunday, 2/4/18. While we like cars, we are in no way car enthusiasts but there was enough variety that all of us thoroughly enjoyed the museum. We went at opening and were able to find free parking on the street one block from the museum. We did not get tickets for the Vault but found there was enough to enjoy with the standard ticket.Highlights: Porsche and Ferrari exhibits, art cars, Lightening McQueen, Back to the Future Delorean, Ford Model T, McLaren P1, concept cars and race simulation.

Altho, I did see some of the Petersen Collection when they had them on exhibit at the Reagan Library during renovation.Love to see the variety of autos and motorcycles from Hollywood exhibit to all the red Ferrari vehicles and modern technology of Tesla brand.

But a small rebate of $6 if dining at the onsite restaurant but you do need to ask for the eligible card. Car parking is free for purchases >$75 at the gift shop.Museum is interesting with over 100 cars on display.

50,Outstanding Auto Museum,"The Petersen is one of the world's outstanding auto museums and a definite must see for any auto enthusiasts when in Los Angeles. They have special and standing exhibits and an excellent ""Hidden Garage"" that you can visit for a fee and appointment. That is hosted by a guide under the museum with many restored and unrestored autos, most with interesting histories. During our visit, the underground museum had just acquired the original ""Back to the Future"" Delorean that was used in the movie. Several one of a kind Ferrari's and exotic cares were also there. The restored 1930's exhibit was beautiful. Be sure to bring your cameras and allow several hours with comfortable walking shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/439kents
50,For the car lover,"What is unique about the Petersen Museum is the "" Hollywood"" influence, i.e, Batmobile, cars used in movies, the ""southern California ""influence i.e. hot rods, the "" Latino"" influence, along with several presentations of historical autos.Although this museum has its share of expensive, impeccable foreign cars, this , in my opinion, is not the primary theme.Because this museum is downtown, ( I think) the grounds are not spacious. One will need to know in advance where the museum is located; the likelihood of finding it fortuitously seems somewhat unlikely to me.If you are any type of car (and motorcycle ) buff, you would clearly enjoy this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justme54481

Also really enjoyed the Indian/Harley display and couldn’t believe the details in the Chicano art showcased in the High Art of Riding Low gallery. Outstanding!Did the extra tour option the the vault which was super interesting. Since many items in the vault are on loan to the museum, you never know what be there.

40,"Beautiful musuem, children's section too small/limited","The Petersen Automotive Museum is conveniently located in the Miracle Mile district in the heart of Los Angeles, the building itself, from the outside, is a work of art. I visited the museum with my husband and our 3 year old daughter, we are not car enthusiasts however we found the museum to be quiet entertaining and aesthetically pleasing, the cars were gorgeous and the layout was very well done. The highlight for me was the bat-mobile. Having a 3 year old daughter, I thought the section dedicated to children was very small, and heavy screen based, I think there were missed opportunities for tinkering projects/activities, as for the rest of the museum it's pretty much no touch which is challenging with kids under 5.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/souseyeh
50,"The ""Car Culture"" is alive and well....AND ""on display"" at the Petersen Automotive Museum!","As a car enthusiast I have visited the Petersen Automotive Museum many times over the years, but my most recent experience last weekend reminded me of what a gem this is in my own corner of the world. The Petersen often has ""Cruise-Ins"" to honor various automotive legends, and/or certain car makes, These are held on the rooftop parking structure and are free to the public.Last Saturday my car club, the Los Angeles Shelby American Automobile Club was involved in a Tribute to Carroll Shelby and there was a very large turnout of the cars he was involved in building. It was a wonderful exhibition! Inside the museum, at this time, there is a display featuring ""Lowrider cars"" with bright metalflake paint and lots of chrome everywhere. I also discovered a new restaurant has been added since my last visit and what a wonderful surprise that was. Drago Ristorante features very tasty Italian food at reasonable prices and my Mufalette sandwich was very fantastic. It came with a cup of cold diced potatoes that had been sprinkled with olive oil and a hint of garlic....oh my, I will be returning just for those. A great place to view the history of the automobile and have some good food at the same time. I recommend it highly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikew938

Many of them are historical such as the Model T, some are from the movies such as Herbie and the Batmobile, but my favorite section was the 'Lowrider' gallery. Here the cars are lovingly decorated and painted but there is also a lot about the importance of these cars to the group people who had them.We were disappointed with the museum since in the end it seemed that it was just a bunch of cars rather than any explanation of why this was important. The goal of the museum was to 'present the history of the automobile and its impact on American life and culture.' We found lots of cars but not much impact.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyF406

No pictures are allowed during the vault tour but I can vividly remember many of the rare cars we saw, one of kind automobiles. You are in a group and move around in a group so if you do not like to stay in a group you may not like this. My husband is not big on group tours but he enjoyed the vault tour very much.

The ""Art of Bugatti"", apparently on tour, was a fascinating look at the car building family and their art--not just automobiles. The ""low riders"" was not particularly appealing to me but in LA I can see how it would be an attraction. The ""regular"" part of the museum could use some serious signage as there were cars displayed and described but nowhere--at least that I saw--was any reason that a manufacturer of heavy machinery and farm equipment would make a personal pick-up truck (they could take some lessons fr/ the Studebaker Museum in South Bend there).Cars fr/ the movies and television shows were fun to see and brought back memories but none were particular ""stand outs"".Perhaps touring ""the Vault"" first jaded things for the rest of the museum but that being said......""The Vault"" tour was fascinating BUT it seemed as if there was a 90 minute time period and woe be unto a docent who exceeded that limit as we were rushed through a mass of cars (I heard a boy tell his dad, ""I think I am about 'carred' out"" as they were leaving) w/ little time to actually examine what we were seeing.There were way too many people on the tour so it was hard to either see or hear (at one point I went down another aisle in order to better see what the docent was describing and to better hear her and was approached by a security person asking me to ""stay w/ my tour"". I told him I had paid for the tour and could not see nor hear if I was w/in the group. He relented but watched me like a hawk the rest of the time).Our docent had favorites and it was apparent as those were described and others given something of a short shrift but she admitted that her favorites were ""hot rods"" and that was the focus of her tour.Tours are supposedly scheduled a couple of hours apart but we arrived in the basement as another tour was going on and yet another tour started while we were in the midst of ours so the echoes of each of those tours made it even more difficult to hear/focus on our tour.No pictures are allowed and the explanation given was it had nothing to do w/ the cars on display but for insurance purposes as they were afraid thieves might discover a way to steal the automobiles on display (huh?).And as w/ the signage upstairs not enough explanation was given as to why a particular car or innovation was important---w/ the exception of, in our case, the muscle cars/ hot rods.Cars were bunched together in such a way that it was difficult to see inside and get the interesting aspects of how passenger areas changed--especially when it was mentioned as part of the tour.All-in-all I felt as if we were rushed through w/ little time to actually appreciate the automobiles on display--especially after paying $30 for the tour ON TOP OF the regular fee to tour the museum.Do not get me wrong as the cars are fascinating there was just little time to appeciate them and I am not certain it was worth the price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tencatdaddy
50,Very Elite! Wonderful for car enthusiasts!!,Very elite collection of cars! A must see museum for car enthusiasts!! Be sure to do the Vault tour. It is well worth the $! Our tour guide Pete was very knowledgeable & kept the tour interesting. The upper levels of the museum are laid out very well & easy to get through. The store had some great deals on souvenirs so don't overlook the store! Museum is easy to find & parking is easy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TammiC318
50,Just amazing,"Such well presented exhibits, great balance of history and more recent together with famous movie cars. One of the best car museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M5107RNmichaelc
50,An impressive exhibition of the history of automobiles,"The museum occupies three floors. The museum has automobiles that where first invented, high performance road cars and also Formula One racing cars and motorcycles. The museum has a new exhibit every month or so. When we visited the museum the exhibit was 'The art of Bugatti' which focused on the Bugatti family, their cars and a family of artists.The museum has parking on site (free for 30 minutes and $13 for the day). Admission is $16 for adults, $13 for seniors 62 +, and children (3 to 12) $8.All the galleries are wheelchair accessible. Complimentary wheelchairs are available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoderickL855
50,Great for the car nut,Really enjoyed my trip here. Well laid out and very informative. Spent a lot of time in the Bugatti Section. i would suggest getting there early as the parking lot was full when I got there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christianlR7702XC
50,A car lovers paradise,"For old and young alike, this four floor collection of motor vehicles from 1886 to the present, includes exquisite examples of antique, exotics, classics, muscle cars, race cars, motor cycles and children's cars. Presently an exhibit of low rider cars is featured.Additionally there are examples of the the Art Center design process and a childrerns room. It is an all day feast for car lovers",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesv8
50,Great for car enthusiasts of all ages,"If you love cars, you have to visit one of the largest automobile collections there is. Learn about the history of cars, with some rare examples of early vehicles. Rotating exhibits fills the other floors of the building. When we were there, they were about Ferrari, Bugatti, famous movie vehicles, hot rods and the art of the low rider, with stunning examples of each. In the kids' room, they can see how critical components of the car work, do art, and play with toy cars and track. Look for extended opening hours during peak weeks to avoid the crowds. Parking is in a dedicated parking garage that can fill up at busy times, but other parking is available in the area. Expect to spend an morning or afternoon here and, if you live in the area, get a membership and come back throughout the year for new exhibitions. If you have the time, you can buy the 'vault' tour, where the museum stores vehicles not currently on display. Worth it if you want to get the most out of your time there. Admission is a bit pricey, so only plan to go if you have the time to spend absorbing all the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814ianb
40,For car lovers and then some.,"A wide variety of beautiful old vintage cars and some motorcycles.Also some specialty cars. They sure don't make them like they used to. Anyone, even if you aren't ""into"" cars can appreciate the exquisite design.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/airbrush1212

50,Awesome way to spend an afternoon,A friend took me to the Peterson Museum while on a business trip because he knows I'm a car guy. The place was absolutely awesome. they have a great collection of very cool cars ranging from extremely old to the most modern. There are plenty of exhibits for people of all ages to enjoy this place. Highly recommend it if you love cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trippinbillies40
40,Great car collection,"I highly recommend a visit to this museum. Not being a petrol-head, I was unsure if a visit would be worth it, but walking into the foyer the cars on display had me hooked. The thematic layout of the museum floors is insightful. My son, who normally doesn't like museums, was enthusiastic. I highly recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PBM2010
50,Fabulous car musem,"Kids out of school and decided to venture into LA and take in the Petersen Automotive Museum. They have rotating exhibits and the last time we visited many years ago they had the Mattel Hot Wheels. This time around they had the low riders, Disney Cars, Ferrari and Bugatti exhibits. I like how they breakdown the floors with the history and design of automobiles. There are may touch and feel areas for little kids also. There is also a display of cars from the movies like Batman, Thelma & Louse, Back to the Future, and Herbie the Love Bug. This is a great place to visit if you enjoy cars. They even have a restaurant on the lower level next to the gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twinmom8
50,Must see for car enthusiasts,"A large collection housed in a beautiful building. There are three floors with a wide range of cars, ranging from yellow 1929 Duesenberg from The Great Gatsby to futuristic cars that were never manufactured.We reserved the 90 min vault tour and it was very informative and should not be missed. The guide was well-informed and full of facts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melindag386
50,"Two years on, the reborn Petersen Automotive Museum is coming into its own.","Two years ago, the board of directors of the Petersen museum decided to take a risk: to change the comfy, familiar, and much beloved diorama based exhibits, and move the museum into the forefront of worldwide automotive museums. The bet paid off, big time.There's an impressive permanent collection, but the curators have stepped up the game with an amazing round of shows assembled from all over the world. Bugatis? check. Ferrari's? Check. How about motorcycles -- check...an impressive collection there too.The museum looks at the automobile, now, in sever different contexts: as an object of engineering advancement , as art, and from a social context - what represented freedom for the common man in the 20th century more than the private automobile?One thing about this museum that always strikes me is that everyone seems to be smiling as they explore the museum's collections. It's just a fun, interesting and educational place, and the positive energy really rubs off.The other plus, is that it's a relatively inexpensive place to take the whole family. There's an area on the 2nd floor that is specially designed for younger kids, but they'll enjoy the exhibits as much as the grownups. And don't miss the Forza motorsport simulator on the second floor, either. It's worth the wait.One caution: there's a very good fine dining restaurant on the ground floor with an Italian menu. But, if you're on a budget, you'll want to either pack a lunch or visit one of the other less pricey options in the area. Don't get me wrong, the food's great, but if you've got the whole family on an ""economical"" outing, this might not fit the bill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougr846
50,"Excellent automotive display, don't miss the Vault tour","This is a very good automotive collection, and worth goign through. If you do go, do not miss the vault tour. That is the best part of the museum, and you will only get a 1/4 experience without it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matt_Bella
30,You should have an option to rate good not great,"This museum tries hard and look at the website before you go as they have rotating specialty exhibits which are very good. I like the Nethercutt collection more as it's just more varied. In this museum you will see some great cars but you'll still leave with a kind of meh feeling and your kids who really don't get to do anything will be glad to be back in fresh air again. It could be so much more with interactive exhibits, a tie in with lego for kids to build cars, scalectrix to race cars, audio tours etc. It doesn't generate excitement with the most exciting part being how they dress the outside of the building for different themes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB
50,Don't miss this museum,"Spent 5 hours here and loved it. Do not miss the ""vault"", pay the fee. That is where the exceptional value is with low production vehicles, one of a kind and movie star cars. The tour is $33 per person including the vault. Parking can be a little difficult in their structure die to space, as others have indicated. Do not miss this attraction!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2fromWi
50,A MUST SEE,"If you like cars, or if you like art, go before January 18, 2018 to see the ""Art of Bugatti"" exhibit. You learn that the Bugatti family was very artistic, which explains why their vehicles are so gorgeous. Just seeing the new facade is worth the trip. We did not do the Vault, and we heard that it was not worth the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freda70
50,"Bugattis, Ferraris - Free Parking in garage with Restaurant purchase",Great automotive museum for the auto enthusiast. Definitely recommend the Vault tour - it is a guided 90 minute tour with stories on the cars. The cafe has great food too and they will validate your parking ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusieSuggs
50,Interesting even if you aren't into cars,"This is a can't miss if you love cars! But even if you don't, the automobiles from history and entertainment make it a worthwhile visit none the less.During our visit we were surprised how big it was and how crowded. Possibly we picked a busy time of day.One last thing, if you haven't seen the outside of the building, it is super cool - Especially at night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/in0r
50,A fun place to visit,This was my first time visiting the Petersen since its remodel and I brought my friends visiting my family from Australia with me. The remodel is great and the cars and motorcycles incredible. It's an easy layout to follow and very interesting. I'm also not car guy but really loved the visit. I must point out that entering the museum from their parking lot is pretty weird. You'll know what I mean when you visit!!! Or not. All in all a great visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StudioCityMark
50,A must see for gear heads,Hey this is the place to see and learn about cars. The selection is awesome and the joint is all spiffed up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattithedivaP
50,A dream for the pasionate,"An amazing place with so many unique cars . First you have THE CLASSICS ( Europe GTO Ferraris etc , old mustangs ) . Then the Hollywod ( Batman's car , back to future , etc ) , then the motorcycles : every Harley and Indian that was produced ( until about 1990 ) side by side . Then its the Bugatti expo . And only sometimes - The special Exhibition- The Vault",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tudorc923
50,Not just a bunch of old cars,I have wanted to visit this museum for a long time. Since we were visiting Southern California for Thanksgiving this year I made sure a trip to the Petersen Automotive Museum was our first stop.The girls in our family went to the Grove Shopping center near by.The cost to enter the museum isn't horrible but it's not cheap. If you choose to add a visit to the Vault like my son and I did it can get a bit expensive.The vault has some really cool cars and our tour guide was very knowledgeable.We grabbed lunch at DRAGO between our tour to the Vault and the rest of the museum. The food and service were both good.The room full of Bugatti's was amazing. The display showing competitive models from Indian and Harley Davidson was super cool. The room full of Ferrari's felt like it could be valued at $100 million plus.This is not a display of old cars. This is a museum with cars as the art.Glad I went!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianF37
50,"100,000 sq feet for Car ENTHUSIASTS to explore","A Museum of CARS and their impact on American culture and life. This attraction is open daily from 10am-6pm, excluding Thanksgiving & Christmas. Parking available on site. Aside from the entry level (which is fee-free), there are an additional 3 floors plus the Basement VAULT. Admission to 3 levels is $15 per adult with discounts for students, seniors and youth; 3yo & under are Free Entry. For an additional $20, visitors aged 10+ can take a Vault Tour.1st Floor = Artistry of the Automobile2nd Floor = Automotive Design - its diversity & technology3rd Floor = History & NostalgiaVAULT Floor = Representations of over 100 years of auto historyMy boys thoroughly enjoyed this attraction and were only annoyed with one thing ... not ENOUGH time, both walked out saying, ""we could have spent at least a half day in here"" !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristinaMCGM
50,A Must See While in LA,"Even if you are not an automobile enthusiast as myself, you will really enjoy your visit to the Petersen. The facility is large, organized, immaculately clean, well staffed and secured. The cost is $ 16 per adult plus and extra $20 per person for the vault tour (discussed below). Parking is $ 13. The displays are well presented. Each display presents a discussion of its history and fun facts. Overall, a unique collection of historical, contemporary, and futuristic machines. We spent about 90 to 120 mins to visit all three floors. Our disappointment was the Vault Tour. The Vault Tour is a presentation of about 180 cars located in the basement of the museum and not on display on the museum floor. The 90 minute tour lasted two hours and could actually be presented in one hour tops. The docent was informative and eager to share his knowledge, however, it was much too drawn out and dragged on. We were actually relieved once the Vault tour was complete. So, enjoy the Museum and the regular tour. We highly recommend the visit. But unless you are interested in automotive history, pass on the Vault Tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DDM137
40,Great place for car lovers,This is a very modern nice place to go and look at some great cars. Classic and modern cars are beautifully displayed over 3 floors. The building itself is very nice and modern. The outside looks very sharp as well as the inside. It’s located in the Miracle Mile surrounded by other museums. It’s also about 10 blocks from The Grove and the original Farmers Market.The museum has a section where you can play Xbox One Forza which is very cool.The vault tour is ok. Some interesting cars but you cannot take pictures in the Vault. The guided tour felt rushed but was understandably as the guide has to work his way over 100 cars in only 90 minutes. We got bored before the end and elected to leave but I guess people really into cars would enjoy the tour.The gift shop has plenty of collectibles to buy. Didn’t see anything spectacular or that you can’t buy somewhere else.The restaurant inside the museum was good. Great food at reasonable prices.A great way to spend a couple of hours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FabianVidela
50,Sophisticated car displays,"Yes, it is expensive to visit when you factor in the $13 parking fee but it is a car museum not to be missed by gear heads. Every thing from a collection of Bugatti's (which for me was educational but the least interesting display) to a number of custom lo-riders with the most awesome paint jobs I have ever seen on any vehicle. In between are cars with a movie history, extremely rare cars and some high quality hot rods. Also some special displays like the all American racer Dan Gurney. I spent 5 hours here.There is a cloth napkin Italian restaurant on the first floorThe exterior sucks in my opinion. This is about cars not psychedelic mushrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/702billh
50,Fabulous Collection!,"I think we spent nearly four hours in the Petersen wandering round admiring the collection of gorgeous cars and bikes, and enjoying a surprisingly tasty lunch!Absolutely loved it especially the collection of Bugattis. The attention to design on them is divine especially compared with the boring cars we are surrounded by on the roads today. It is well laid out and the staff are friendly and informative and are happy to share their passion for pistons with you! If you are in the area give it a try I'm sure you will not be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skinsid
50,Well Worth the Visit! Go for the Vault too!,"The parking might be expensive ($15+) and the admission prices reasonable, but the exhibits and the optional admission to the Vault make it all worth it! They have some of the rarest and most recognizable cars on display that keeps you walking to every level they have just to see them all! If you can pre-arrange a time/date to visit the Vault, it is worth the extra ($20+) fee just to see more cars that are not on the floor yet for the public to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristopherF2352
50,Great collection in an iconic building,"This museum amazes and delights with various collections on three levels for the basic admission and a fourth, underground, for those willing to spend extra for ""The Vault"". (Recommended.)The three public floor collections currently on display have cars famous from movies and TV including the Batmobile, the De Lorean from Back to the Future, Herbie from the Disney movies, and even the yellow VW bus from Little Miss Sunshine. They also have many cars owned by actors like Steve McQueen and cars designed by the kings of high-end L.A. mods like Chet Foose and Boyd Coddington.The collection also includes a lot of one-offs or almost one-offs from the earlier parts of this century that never made it into big production, a Ferrari collection, a couple Bugatti's, and some rare motorcycles. I loved that they expanded the definition of 'classic car' to include low riders (especially Gypsy Rose, the intricately painted '64 Impala)--a uniquely Los Angeleno experience.The Vault tour, for an additional $20 each, gets you a two hour guided tour underground where the collection's garage and overflow storage includes historically significant cars, like the limousine owned by Saddam Hussein and a Mercedes that belonged to Imelda Marcos--they say the trunk is full of shoes. There's even an old Rolls Royce that you expect to be told belonged to Alfred Hitchcock, but no--it belonged to the Kennedy family friend and Malibu producer who drove Bobby Kennedy in it to the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles--where Bobby was assassinated.Don't miss this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UnrepentantFoodie
50,A fascinating tour of the vault and a good Museum,"The vault tour was fascinating and well worth the money. We were down there for about 1 and a half hours. Part of the charm was not being able to take photographs; sometimes you want the element of surprise and this was full of that. It serves as a place also where people garage their cars for insurance purposes. It is a wide and excellent colllection through the ages aincluding some really famous cars including many wonderful exaples of Rolls Royces, Sports Cars, cars connected to famous actors, actresses, politicians and others. Even if cars are not really your ""thing"", this was a very good tour. The guide made it so interesting and his knowledge was fantastic.The rest of the Museum had some amazing cars, motorbikes and other vehicles. I really recommend this place. Go see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CassandraHolly

50,Time well spent,"Had an extra hour or so to kill before a flight so I decided that it’d be awesome to go for this vault tour that everyone was talking about.Incidentally you can’t take any pictures in the vault, but it was definitely worth it. The guide was very knowledgeable and fun walking through a chronological timeline of the creation of the automobile and its subsequent refinement.Next time I’ll check out the rest of the museum for sure lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabork597
50,Amazing Automotive History,"I recently visited the Petersen Automotive Museum with a group of automotive enthusiast. We took a tour bus from San Diego up to the location on Wilshire Blvd. in Los Angeles. We had heard about the museum, but no one in our group had ever seen it in person. I must tell you, our ""socks were blown off""!The exterior is like a multistory jewel box. You can hardly wait to walk through the front doors. Once inside you are like a kid in the most spectacular toy store in the world. Your visual stimulation goes into overdrive.Just of few of the outstanding exhibits are:1. The Art of Bugatti. In today's world conformity it hard to believe that suchexceptional creativity once existed in the world of automotive design.2. 70 Years of Ferrari. At one time Ferrari owned the world of professional auto racing.3. The Corvette-An American Supercar. Proud of our American made car that put suchan exceptional car into the hards of everyday Americans; even to today.4. The High Art of the American Low Riders. Great tribute to such creativity put intothese cars, mostly by the very owner of the car.5. Harley Davidson vs The Indian. Another great tribute to a race for dominance in theworld of motorcycles and to conquering the race track plus the American road.6. The Vault. The ultimate place to visit while at the Petersen Museum. Rare behindthe scenes tour of some of the most unique cars in the world-100 years ofAutomotive History. None seen in other parts of the museum.While touring the museum be sure to make time for a visit to their Drago Ristorante. Great food at reasonable prices.Wear good walking shoes and allow plenty of time to ""oh and ah"".The Petersen Automotive Museum was named Museum of the Year by the International Historic Motoring Awards.You will not be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/236jimp

50,An unexpected highlight of our trip!!!,"The museum had been pointed out to us whilst on our Bikes & Hikes LA tour earlier in the week so we decided to take a look. We were impressed!!! we stayed all afternoon, about 4 hours with our 7&10 sons. The vehicles in the museum were amazing. The kids activity room was very engaging and educational. The staff shared their knowledge about the vehicles and also engaged with our boys. A hidden gem in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claudiaw838
50,I Needed More Time,This was my third attempt to see the museum and my first success! The LA traffic changed my earlier plans. I had three hours to look at the amazing exhibits. I knew there was no way to see the vault but I could have used more time on the three floors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davekcpa1
50,One More Off Bucketlist!,"The museum presentation works for car lovers, autohistorians,and those with a creative & artistic interest. It is not just a big building filled with cars. There is also a section geared toward children. You will pay to park and if you do not fit the description of one of my earlier mentioned people you will probably find the entrance fee pricey. The “Vault Tour” is an additional cost to see 100 cars in the basement. If you are not car crazy save your money. The main museum will suffice. They have a convenient restaurant if you are looking for a meal and the gift shop has plenty to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NOBIGTOE

50,A museum that all of the family can enjoy,"We travel through LAX almost every year and have never before spared the time to go to the Petersen. It is a truly magnificent establishment with something to appeal to all. My wife is not a car buff but she had a really enjoyable day, and the in-house Italian restaurant and bar is of a high standard. True enthusiasts should also take-in the Vault tour which brings into play another 300-odd cars, all of which are of interest. This is a special place housed in an architecturally stunning building, and as the exhibits are changed regularly one could return and see many new things. Really excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertC117
50,Excellent...One of a kind.....Trend setting,"I've been to The Petersen four times, and each time EVERY car in it has been different. That alone makes it different. I have read some ""criticisms"" of this place which say they should more-or-less crowd more cars in. Please don't. This is one of the few auto museums that actually give the cars on display ""breathing room"", and I like it like that as opposed to the sardine-can school where you really can't observe a car from almost every angle, as you can here. The Indianapolis Museum is a good comparison; great collection but the cars are crowded too closely together, and they have a fantastic collection...including a few of the cars that I saw at The Petersen this time. If you're in LA, go here. Even if you aren't ""car people"" this is a real museum and there will be things of interest here. The present display on Bugatti is a good example. Not just Bugatti cars, but artworks from the Bugatti family including sculpture, paintings, sketches, furniture (yes) and much more. As I said, go here. best dollar-to-experience you'll get at a museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiritof67
50,Great place for both car enthusiasts and those that arent,"This is a great museum if you love cars and even if you don't. It's also affordable at $16pp ($36 for the vault tour). It is a well displayed museum with easy to read and informative facts about the cars/motorcycles. If you're wondering whether to pay extra for the vault, it's a definite 'yes' if you love cars but I'm not an enthusiast and I enjoyed it too. There are over 100 vehicles not displayed on the main 3 levels and the guide is very informative and well spoken. We spent just over 3hrs here and then strolled down to the farmers market for lunch and a little shopping - best of both worlds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimo1987
50,Fantastic Museum and great restaurant!,We had such a fun day at the Petersen Museum! Our visit coincided with the Bugatti and Ferrari exhibits. We did the vault tour which was fantastic!! I took my 10 and 12 year old. The tour was a little long for my kids but they made it! The regular exhibits are wonderful as well. We had lunch in the restaurant and it was just lovely. We're not really car people and we still managed to thoroughly enjoy a 4-hour visit to the Peterson.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Infomiss_trips

50,Boys Day Out,"The wedding was to be on Saturday but Friday was a pretty free day so my husband, his brother and my husbands oldest friend, all in CA for our daughters wedding on Sat decided to do a boys day out and the destination without hesitation was the Petersen. We have been there many times before and as members of the National Corvette Museum, get in for free. The vault tour was $20 and it was the vault that my husband was most anxious to see.The guys were all impressed with the displays and the way they were arranged. Some were the same as they had been on previous visits since the remodel and others were different but all were enjoyed.They ate at the 'fru-fru' Italian restaurant which was a bit pricey. The old Johnny Rockets was more in keeping with this museum. The guys were not impressed but you are a bit of a captive as there is no longer in and out privileged for parking and handicap spaces are at a premium.Great day was had by all and it is recommended by two guys from GA and one from OH",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/02corvette

The design studio was interesting, talking to young designers who are the future of the automotive industry.Enjoyed this very much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barongruda
30,Ok place to spend an hour,A bit pricey at $16. The whole museum can be gone through in a half hour if you’re in a hurry. A decent collection of cars and motorcycles but I was disappointed. Not that many cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/56003Richard
50,"Add my name to the impressed, very impressed!","I like cars and have been in many automobile and motorcycle museums and have enjoyed them all but Petersen - well this is a must visit! What a collection of exceptionally displayed and well lighted vehicles - it is just incredible! Do yourself a favor and take the tour of the vault, we had Jeff as our guide and he should be listed as a national treasure. His knowledge and easy-going style made the 90 minute tour fly by. I can't say this enough if you like cars, motorcycles or exceptional museums, find the corner of Fairfax and Wilshire, pull into their lot and plan to be there for several hours of shear enjoyment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/550CraigM
50,Truly Amazing,"Cars today are becoming a bit boring as just utilities, so I appreciate the old models with some design flair. I am also not a museum lover, but Petersons Automotive just displays what it has in quiet and pleasant surroundings and allows you respectfully to get really close. They have a fantastic selection set out over three floors in groups including Ferrari, Jaguar, McLaren, Bugatti, Ford, movie cars and much more. There is a nice shop, a restaurant and also parking on site which is a boon because the parking nazis in the street are red hot. We went round without hurrying in about an hour. Recommend it strongly",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRNSydney_Australia
50,Amazing,We toured the auto museum and did the vault tour it was amazing. We really enjoyed seeing all the really rare cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Apert
50,Fun even for a non-car person,"I have no interest in cars, but I very much enjoyed this museum. You can learn about the history of cars and appreciate the beauty of some of them even if you care less about what's under the hood. We highly recommend paying the extra for the vault tour, Our guide was Jason, the Director of Education, who missed his calling; he should have been on the screen! For an hour and a half, he provided non-stop, entertaining, informative, commentary while showing us some amazing cars. The only downside of this place is the restaurant. If you want trendy, expensive Italian food, it's fine, but if you just want a quick lunch, or a snack to fortify yourself, forget it; it's not there. The restaurant seemed an odd choice for a museum like this that probably attracts a lot of families. Otherwise, though, we loved the museum and would go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LEB123
50,Unbelievable collection of automobiles,"We booked a tour that included a visit to The Vault where hundred of vehicles are stored when not on public display. The tour guide explained the history of each, adding in little bits of fascinating trivia that added colour to the commentary. There are too many items to name but it is an awesome collection.We then climbed to the top floor and slowly worked our down through the public galleries to the ground floor. Some displays are semi-permanent, other galleries change regularly. If you like 'big boys toys' then the Peterson Museum is a must on a visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D6144QZstevem
50,So glad I came!,"They have Automotive history, design, race cars, motorcycles, low-riders -- an eclectic mishmash of displays that were 100% perfect and fascinating. We had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W7905RGpetera
50,Fantastic museum even if you are not a car aficionado.,I have been here a few times with my now teenage son. It is very well curated and fun. There is an interactive room for younger kids. The building itself is very cool architecturally.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFoolForTravel
50,"A must for intense and casual car lovers, alike","Nothing less than a complete history of the automobile in a single building, the Petersen should get more acclaim than it does. Beginning on the top floor, then working your way down, a visit includes the invention of the motorcar to the present, special section of movie/tv vehicles, as well as many special rotating exhibits.Top-notch museum store is a must for car lovers, as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/886chrisn
50,Terrific!!,"I love this place. The displays were awesome. The staff were super friendly and helpful, particularly the young lady with the bob who helped us with the virtual demo. She was a delight! There were so many beautiful and amazingly odd pieces on each floor, and I found the Bugatti and Lowrider areas near the entrance especially intriguing. The prices weren't outrageous, and I even got a terrific poster in the gift shop. I didn't have the chance to eat at their restaurant, but I will definitely be giving it a try on my next visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alejandras904
30,"Some good, some not so good","I don't get it.The chairman of the board of governors is Peter Mullin, who has the Mullin Automotive Museum in Oxnard, Ca. This typically opens only two days a month.Petersen was full of cars from the Mullin collection, at the expense of cars owned by Petersen.So Mullin had a good showing, Petersen not.Some of it was good, very good. Possibly too much space and not enough cars in it. The visit was certainly not as good as previous visits ( before the refurb )The girl in charge of the race simulators on I think the first floor has a lot to learn about people skills. She certainly needs some training, and a little common politeness and courtesy would go a long way. Maybe the Petersen is not for her.The Ferrari exhibit was very good but with the space available more cars could have been included.It felt a bit too 'arty' and not enough cars. I know Petersen, in common with other museums, share their cars all around the world. But a bigger focus here would make visits more enjoyable for people who have come to visit the Petersen !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/v8mth
50,Great collection of specialty cars!,"My father was visiting from out of town so we wanted to go to a museum on a Monday and realized that many are closed on Mondays. After a little research, we decided on the Petersen automotive museum in Los Angeles. We were able to buy out tickets online and the cost for the three of us was $49. There is a student and senior discount so that helped a little with the cost. Parking is onsite at $12 a car. The museum was not crowded on a Monday and so we were able to see everything fairly easily. We spent about 2 hours there and liked the diverse collection of cars on three different levels. Our favorite room was probably the Ferrari room as it was filled with beautiful Ferraris from past to present. We also were able to race in a simulated racing game which was fun. Overall, we enjoyed our time here. A tip for discounted entry cost would be to see if Groupon has a special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,Petersen Automotive Museum,If you enjoy seeing great cars this is a great place. One of the great car museums in the country. This is a history lesson of cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wa6flr
40,Wow this place is amazing,"Not being a car enthusiast I wasn't sure about a visit, but WOW the cars are incredible and the displays of cars and bikes worth seeing. It isn't just about cars there are wonderful history and stories to be read as well as training for future designers.The Petersen family are to be congratulated on this venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gl0rians
50,"Awesome, the least known but best of L.A.'s museums?","The cars are always changing, the displays impeccable and if you have time I strongly recommend the tour of the Vault. A superb experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevebA1816ID
50,Well worth seeing,Did a tour of the Petersen and a tour of the Vault. The Rolls in the Vault was fabulous. Loved the building a Maserati exposition.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159BrianB
50,Awesome cars,"We had a team building event at the Petersen Automotive Museum. It was raining hard the day we went. Once we got inside the museum, the rain did not border us. We went to the Vault to see their exclusive collection. It was really meant for the car enthusiasts. For me, the cars on first to third floors are good enough. They have really awesome cars there, many of them were used in movies. The life size McQueen was awesome!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claudialY2852RZ
50,A dozen or so things to see for free...,"If you've got limited time (like maybe after viewing the couple of free things to see across the street at the LA County's Museum of Art, you can walk into the ground floor of the Peterson (the outside is very cool by the way) and see at least 10 to 12 wow-looking cars. We didn't have time for the $12 tour so we just checked it out and it's worth the look. Maybe we'll come back and drop the dime, but you should check it out for free - it's worth it if you don't have to worry about parking. We didn't, as we've bee taking advantage of the Metrolink's Weekend Day Pass - 10 bucks for each day on Saturday or Sunday and we can ride anywhere on the system - from Riverside to Oceanside, to Ventura. Then you can use the same pass for MetroRail which is the two subway lines in LA and the lightrail system that goes out to Santa Monica, up past Pasadena, or down toward Long Beach. Anyway, the Petersen is cool even if you just visit the ground floor, use their clean restrooms, and maybe buy a pizza or something at the restaurant on the ground floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11PaulB
50,"Excellent Museum of ""Special"" Cars","This museum, which seems fairly new, appears to focus on ""special"" or rare cars. You won't find any run-of-the-mill Ford Mustangs or VW Beetles here. Instead, you'll see a Batmobile, the actual Ferrari 308 from the Magnum TV series, a Tesla, Porsche racecar, Maserati, the modified Delorean from the ""Back to the Future"" movies, etc. There's also an excellent exhibition of vintage Ferraris.Everything is well laid-out and displayed. I was able to find on-street parking on a side street a couple of minutes from the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyb993
50,Must see for car enthusiasts,"We have wanted to visit the Petersen for years, but never seemed to find the time. We were not disappointed! The Ferrari exhibit was exceptional and what collection would be complete without a few special low riders? The school lab was also fascinating--be sure to see their Segway-like people mover that folds up the size of a small briefcase. If we had time, I would have loved to take the Vault Tour of their collection of vehicles not on display. Next time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mah_Murrini
30,Hoped for more movie cars,"We got here on a quiet Monday morning and were glad of the crowd-less environment!There are a couple of options there, you can get the regular museum admission or add on the 90 minute ""Vault"" option which includes a guided tour and 100 more vehicles, i would have taken this but the group that was with were not as much of a petrol head as i.The regular museum is on 4 floors, i was little disappointed in the cars of TV and movie section as there were only a few cars, maybe 8 or so and some photo's, i would have thought an auto museum in Los Angeles/Hollywood would be able to appropriate at least a whole floor to the industry that put it on the map.That being said perhaps there were more cars of TV and movie in the vault but shame its not included in the main museum if there are.As for the rest of the museum it was very well laid out and informative, highlights for me were the Bugatti section and the Chicano cars, amazing paintwork and attention to detail.The place is spotlessly clean and not a finger print to be seen on any car!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bellasarius
40,Deserves its title as America's best automobile museum,"The building houses some of the rarest cars in the world and a few Hollywood vehicles such as the 1989 Batmobile and The Governator's motorcycle from Terminator 2. I am knocking off a point because of The Vault tour. Lots of awesome vehicles lay in the museum's basement but in order to see them you cannot take pictures or tell anyone online what they are.I understand the reason is so they don't get robbed as thieves could break in and steal the vehicles below if they found out, but it feels like a cheat when you shill $140 for three people and can't provide evidence to friends and family that you saw the Vault vehicles other than your own memory. Aside from that, I'm sure any auto enthusiast would love to see what the Peterson has to offer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8078NCkevins
40,Great Place to Go for Car Lovers,"Great place to see cars with history. It contains some of the rarest cars you may not have even known existed for the novice car lover. It's clean and the people who work there are polite gentlemen who exemplify the experience. The only drawback was the wait times for the guided tours for the vault. It would have been nice to go right in even for a self-guided tour. Alas, it was still a nice site to stop in while here in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5658JZmichellel
50,If you like Bugattis....,"I've been to auto museums around the world, but had never made it to Petersen's museum. It's very well done, with the cars well lit and spread far enough apart to be able to walk around them and take a good look. In the interest of time and budget, I only went to the main part of the museum, and missed the Vault, which would have added $20 to the admission price.The museum has numerous vehicles that were used in well-known movies, including a Batmobile and a 1981 DeLorean used in Back to the Future. For me, the high point is the collection of Bugattis, which were easily worth the price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluevoter
50,Car lovers must see,Recomended to this museum by a car freind so glad he told me about this was amazing would love to return some day as it was so good,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1729EOchrisc
50,Bucketlist Check. I am a kid again.,"I didn't know what to expect as I only had a say to kill in transit. I am a car enthusiast.Man was I impressed. 3 levels of cars sorted by car maker, innovation etc... I even got a Batmobile and deLorean from Back to the future thrown in.Attached some pics. Nothing more needs to be said here.So had lunch at the restaurant there. Italian fare.The diid was delightful with the mussels and vongole (cozze e vongole) devine. AMatriciana pasta was al dente. I would have likes a little mire sauce.A little pricey for US but this is LA and the service was very good.$15 entry and $12 parking is a goid day out!You can also see the ""vault"" for $35, this is a guided tour for 90 mins with over 100 cars in the basement not on display!Enjoy and live your inner childhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesKyriakou

50,"Fun for all, even if you only like cars a little.",Definitely worth a visit. Never disappointing.The displays change frequently.Cool stuff always.Kids section is also fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tallminded
40,Behind the doors and under the hood,"The striking exterior of this museum gives little hint as to what is inside. It's like a beautiful car: looks good on the outside, but how does it perform? What's under the hood? Or, in this case, what's behind the doors?It does the things a museum should do, and does it pretty: engages the visitor by its use of space and thoughtful displays of its permanent and special exhibits. Visitors get to ogle the outsides of automobiles as well as the inside. The choice to feature a section on the design of automobiles (and a chance to watch actual designers in action), as well as taking an in depth look at development of a car, is a nice touch. The exhibit for the movie Cars is fun, and possibly the most kid-friendly section of the museum. I do wish the museum took greater efforts to explain some of their interactive exhibits so you could decide if it was something worth waiting in line for. When I went, there was a section that seemed like a video game and people sitting to wait their turn to be escorted into the back video game section. I can't say for sure if this was the case because there was very little signage or information about it in the museum map. Museum personnel were busy with other visitors. I have no idea if I missed out on something fun.The museum does a nice job of providing phone charging cords at many outlets. Look for a bench to sit on and it probably has a phone charger nearby. The size of the museum was easily manageable; bathrooms and drinking fountains were easy to find and get to without having to snake through a warren of galleries. I wish I had a purchased my ticket online so as to avoid the line to the ticket counter. I was able to get to the museum easily via public transit but there is a parking lot available.I appreciated the exhibit on lowrider art that was a featured during my visit. Automobiles are feats of design and engineering, but they also play a cultural role and shape the way we live. I appreciated that the museum had an exhibit that embraced and displayed how a car engages with our lives and imagination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lngwlksnbdwthr
50,I love cool cars!,"If you like cars, this is the place to go. The museum is reasonably priced, but if you want to go to the ""vault"" on a guided tour it is extra. You don't have to pay extra to see great vehicles. Old Fords and some of the first motorcycles are on display. It was interesting to see vehicles used on tv shows too. I would definitely recommend a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ROMENTraveler2014
50,Parallel Journey of Los Angeles and the Automobile,"Uniquely designed as a evolving story of the growth of Los Angeles with the parallel growth of the car culture, this amazingly beautiful car museum will not disappoint you. The inventory alone is enough to keep you engaged for a few hours. Additionally, the location and new facade will impress you, as well! Put this auto museum on your bucket list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelegray01
40,A cool afternoon of loking at great cars,We and some friends went ot the museum and paid extra for the private tour. The tour showed incredible vehicles and the guide was extremely knowledgeable. Sometimes he got a little teechie on us but it was fun even for the ladies who were not necessarily car buffs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180carlj
40,Went with my son in law for a boys day out,The exhibit was great and laid out well. We reconized a number of the special editions from shows or know to havew been owned by celebritires. Very enlightening day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Morfynn

40,"Great car museum, exotics and unusual cars","We've been to many car museums across the country and this was the first one that featured more exotic, one of a kind cars.

50,Best Automotive Museum Ever,"Visited 8-25-17. I was very amazed at the outside of the building. VERY PRETTY. I saw the outside and had to make my way inside. I said something amazing has to be inside there and it was. Lots of older model cars, motorcycles, bicycles, boats, and photos, bugatti cars and precious furniture pieces and more. Paint jobs on some if these autos were beautiful. I have never seen anything like whats in that museum before. Definitely recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waynettam
50,Enjoyed every moment,"My husband is a car guy and he is the one wanted to go there. He bought the tickets on line with his iPhone. After purchased the tickets he read that he would need to print the tickets. He called the museum and found out that he would not need to print them as long as he could show them on the phone. When he called it was Round 7 pm, I said to him that there would be no body answer the phone. But there was some one responded and being very helpful. I usually don't care about car shows or museums but this one I enjoyed very much. It wasn't just about cars but about history of the designers and or builders. Overall it was well presented and the exhibit was informative. We parked our car on the street across from the museum we didn't pay a dime for parking just a little walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carole-688
50,RPMs on Wilshire!,"The visitor experience begins before you even enter the museum: the massive building is encased in bright red undulating steel ribbons that convey a sense of speed and grace from blocks away. The extensive collection (only a portion of which is on display at any given time) features everything from the Batmobile to a deconstructed Maserati to a life-sized pink low-rider pinata suspended from the ceiling. Very well-curated exhibits include the history (and future) of the car engine, the Bugatti family story, and the evolution of ""car culture"" in the US. There is something here for everyone - whether you appreciate the beauty and art of car bodies or of the engineering within them. Guided tours of the vault (to see more of the collection) are available; enthusiasts of all ages (but not heights) can play Xbox's Forza; the requisite gift shop & a good Italian restaurant may be accessed without buying tickets (you can also peek at several exhibits from the lobby). The Petersen is only a few blocks from the La Brea Tar Pits and LACMA, so there's really no excuse to miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jgrellamom

50,Different,"This is NOT your typical automotive museum. Similar museums are pretty much just warehouses or large garages filled with cars of all types, depending on the collectors' whims and tastes. This one is very contemporary, open, airy, relaxing and California-centric. It does have a section on the history of the automobile, but with a focus on southern California. It's exceptionally well-organized around different themes, such as: cars from movies, evolution of cars from gasoline to electric, the car culture of southern California (including racing), etc. For an extra fee, you can take a guided tour of their ""Vault,"" which is a separate collection of some exceptional cars located in the basement. This part is ""similar"" to what you'd see in some other automotive museums. But the rest, is very unique, and well worth visiting; especially so when there are ""special"" exhibits. When we were there, they had special exhibits on the LA low-rider car culture and the Bugatti brand and history --- both excellent! Reasonably-priced parking is adjacent to the museum, which makes it very convenient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheBrasilian
50,AWESOME!,"Fantastic collection of ""one off"" cars, Bugatti's and Ferrari. A number of movie cars are also on display Great parking, knowledgeable docents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twaone

50,This is the apex of general automotive museums. You MUST visit if you care about cars.,The depth and breadth of the collection puts Jay Leno's collection to shame. Carrol Shelby's original concept car using a cheve engine is here. The official cars of most of the world's dictators and bad president's are here. The cars that created the signature cars in the movie CARS are here. One offs. Customs. Low riders. Concepts. There is more than you can really comprehend in one visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuyA473
50,Amazing museum,"Superb collection of cars. Old, very old, sport cars, racing cars they have it all. I loved the Harley-Davidson vs Indian exhibition. My favorite was Ferrari exhibition. There is also a design center, where you can see how cars are designed. I loved the section with cars from movies and series. There was no line at the entrance, but they will make you leave your bag – you can’t take it inside. You can take photos, just no flash photography. There is a coffee shop, a restaurant and a gift shop available at the premises. The restaurant was too expensive for us. The gift shop was nothing special. They also offer tours of the vault, where they keep the most valuable things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abeillesgee
40,If you like cars then go,"I was attracted to this initially by the architecture of the building. It is a fun place to view a lot of eye candy cars and learn tech data about the automobile. Lots of beautiful old cars, hands on for the kids (both little and big), and design information (clay models). I wish I had enough time for the vault tour. Call them because the online reservation system was not working before.It also the restaurant in side has a great menu but I didn't have a chance to try it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EOarizona

There are cars in this museum that you will not see anywhere else in the world!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seg33
50,Should be high on your family list,"Our family tries to stop at different kinds of attractions on vacation. If yours does then this is a good choice.. If your family loves cars its an obvious choice. But also if they like movies. There are cars that played large roles in different kinds of movies ... ""Batman"", ""Back to the Future"", comedies like the Herbie movies, the animated movie ""Cars,"" etc and TV series like ""Magnum PI."" Interested in history then there are cars to see. Want to know about engineering there is something for you.

I was not excited to go, but I ended up really enjoying looking at all the movie cars and I especially enjoyed the Vault tour. The tour guide had tons of interesting information about each car. He tried to focus on what the group was interested in. I did get a little tired during the vault tour since we were standing for about 90 minutes listening to the stories of the cars.

We pretty much ended up staying for hours. I went with 2 thirteen year olds. We had a fantastic time. So interesting. Awe inspiring. (A 52 million dollar Ferrari, still can't wrap my head around that) So impressed with the low rider paint jobs. Truly works of art. So much to do and see. Per an employee the change the exhibits up every 6months or so to make it interesting. The kids loved it. We did take the private vault tour. The only negative to it was it was a bit to long (1.5hours) and the kids were fidgeting towards the end. Will definitely visit the next time we travel to LA:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scm77
50,You don't have to love cars to love Petersen Museum,"This place is just gorgeously laid out. If you are into: cars (obvs), design, history, pop culture, tech, racing, or are just a generally curious person, go. Spouse loves cars, I don't, but we both thoroughly enjoyed Petersen Automotive Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MidoriKi
40,Get the private tour,Our son is a big car nut but was disappointed in the upstairs (main) showroom and the exhibits there. However we did do the private tour of the basement cars. With a tour guide and around 20 other folks had a cool experience downstairs. The cars and the stories that went along with the cars was much better and much more interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrenw903
40,Cars - Motorcycles and. . .more cars!,"My 13 year Nephew was in heaven. I gather there are cars there that are ""awesome"". I found Steve McQueen's D type Jag and old Indian motorcycle so I was happy.The 1.5 hour Vault Tour is a little intense if you are not a true enthusiast but the restaurant made up for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Driftboat
50,Best Auto museum in California,"Great place. Easy to find, though their parking garage does fill-up (like everything else in Cali, parking is an adventure). Beautifully done, nice collection and variation. You won't find many muscle or sports cars; a handful of ferrari's were in a certain area, but otherwise they are lacking any Corvettes or other domestic favorites. Some old roadsters and some newer cars, lot of unique ones. There are a few Movie-type cars like the delorean from back to the future and magnum pi's ferrari and herbie. Great Bugatti collection, only wish they had one of the newer models from the last 15 years, they were all old school. Couple of race cars, and an homage to Maserati. Great staff, very clean place. Overall this car enthusiast give it a big THUMBS UP. Best car museum in all of Cali without a doubt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brucep460
40,Not just for car people,We headed to LA early before a evening concert. The kids chose the Petersen Museum and a good choice it was. The museum is reasonably priced and has something for everyone. The Bugatti and Ferrari exhibit that they have right now is worth the trip alone. You can see the entire museum in a couple hours or take your time and spend five. I really want to go back and just look at the cars because the first time we went I spent more time reading.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevingN7214FF

50,Must see in LA,"The Petersen Auto Museum was a highlight of our visit to Los Angeles. The display of Bugatti cars and art pieces was unbelievable. The display of all the Dan Gurney racing cars showing the evolution of each car was fantastic. A visit to the Vault had us head swivelling in all directions. With the display of motor cycles to enhance the inventory, it was one of the best Museums we have been to yet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/139trevorh

40,Lots of cars,"This was the first place we stopped as we had time to kill before we could check in. Great place, interesting. My son, 13, thought there would be more newer sports car types - there weren't. Fun to see some movie cars, also a good display of Harley and Indian motorcycles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krisfromMN
50,Great Museum to Visit - Great History Lesson in Cars,"Loved this museum. The workers who checked us in were very nice. The museum was beautiful, just as the cars were. I am not a car buff, but I really enjoyed learning about how the automobile evolved and seeing that evolution in person. We did the vault tour which was great. Our tour person was very knowledgeable. She actually worked for Mr. Peterson and had so much knowledge about each of the vehicles we saw. You should definitely do the tour. We also drove the video game cars in the family area. You should do that also. The driving is so real and different that what you would drive in an arcade. It was fun. Overall- great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MillerGloria

50,Low Rider Exhibit,"Although I would have liked to see more low-riders, the cars that were displayed were outstanding examples of that genre. The rest of the car collection was spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M7507BQjohnb
50,Superb Auto Museum,"We took our adult children and upper teenage grandchildren to the Peterson Museum's Vault Tour, as well as the general admission tour.

50,Car utopia,"I had a fantastic time at the museum with my friend and her six-year-old son. I haven't been there since you've read done and you see him, and it was amazing! Can't think of a better place in Los Angeles or anywhere, to view cars like that . The price to get in was fine, the only thing is the parking is too pricey to add another $12 on top of what you pay to get in !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lormom9

20,Underwhelmed,"When I bought the tickets (2) via email, I understood the tickets covered the main museum along with the vault. My vault tour was at 7:00 pm so I got there early enough to see it all. I was told my tickets were only good for the vault tour. So I got to sit in the lobby for a long time. My wife was unable to attend with me due to illness. So What? Too bad for me. We finally went to the penthouse where the DJ was blasting the neighborhood with sound. It did not seem to me that people were enjoying the music. We then went in two groups to the vault. The guide knew a little about the cars. The people that could not hear her grouped in the back and I helped them with questions. If I were doing this trip over, I would go the Parks museum at Pomona. Much more relevant to me. To pay the prices and then be shown to a parking garage and herded by security, I was underwhelmed. This was a bucket list trip. Loved LA. Ate a lot of good food. Saw the Peterson.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foxwagon
50,Great Cars,"Although they didn't have a Japanese Vehicle collection on show that day, it was still a very cultivating experience. The Vault is a must-see, I cant say much because you have to see for yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spruce400BPT
50,"Great Place to See, Even if You're Not a Car Person!","Go for the ""Vault"" tour. The docent we had, Peter, was amazing. He made the 1.5 hour tour very interesting. It wasn't all about a car's internal dimensions and specs, the tour was about the history of the cars, how they were designed, their owner's, etc, etc. Many of the cars were in motion pictures! The docent tour is like your own private tour. We took the 10:30 am Vault tour then had an amazing lunch at Drago on the ground floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/541robertam
50,Fantastic afternoon out,"Having always had an interest in cars, I wanted to check out this museum, when I said to people that I was going on holiday to Los Angeles and said I was going to a museum they looked at me funnily. Well I had the last laugh. Excellent vault tour with various interesting collectors cars from the round door rolls royce to the history of the porche 911 or (901), and movie cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/997ScottB997
50,Vault is a must see.,"This was my first visit to the Petersen after their dramatic remodel. On Monday AM museum was not crowded. Easy to park and tour through exhibits. Cars were well displayed with interesting written info. I did miss the diorama displays from the original museum. However, the new vault tour more than made up for that.loss. Peter is an amazing tour guide with many interesting background stories about the cars. Drago is a great on-site Italian restaurant. Well worth a lunch stop,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emily4518
50,Fun to visit and friendly staff!,The main museum did not take as long as we had thought it might to see everything and that was without really rushing. The vault tour is well worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnacA7755MH
40,Vault Tour,"I was very impressed by the vault tour and the Docent was very excellent.Her knowledge of the cars on display and automotive history was impressive.A couple of ""fine tuning"" suggestions;Start the lecture only when all participants are present.Have a discussion of the rules before the tour.... the tour was interrupted many times due to people walking between cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanmckee2000
30,First visit,"Exhibits were excellent....particularly Ferrari and Bugatti. Vault tour was good, not a particularly good value for the money however.Only detraction of a wonderful visit was a surly Petersen security guard at the front door before the museum opened. He could not care less or be bothered with questions about the museum. The last thing you want is a bad first impression before your customers even walk in the door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertmeredith99
30,Hypocrit,"Took the vault tour which was not worth the money and was asked by security to not use my phone. I was not talking, making noise, or taking pics. The guard then used his phone off and on for the rest of the tour. There aren't any indications of this policy, only the no photography rule which I believe is silly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonlQ9740QP
50,Definitely worth it!,"For every car freak a must, but also for everyone else worth visiting. Fantastic and interesting exhibitions throughout the museum. The building itself is an architectural highlight, the museum's shop is huge and the restaurant serves good Italian dishes.Staff is very friendly, premises clean and nicely cooled - so this museum should be on the must-see-list of every L.A. traveller.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanessaB608
50,Spectacular Automotive Museum,I couldn't have picked a better car and motorcycle museum to go see. The cars were breath taking and the history behind each car just amazing! I could have spent one more day there. I highly recommend going to the Vault also. The story behind each car told by the tour guide was impressive. I would recommend this museum to any one who is passionate about the automobile history!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tifinid

50,For The Love of Cars,"My family visited Petersen on a Friday evening Vault tour. The building is really nice, the roof deck was entertaining the cars were amazing. We have a few suggestions- make the groups of tours smaller and hand out headsets or amplify the tour guide. Unless you pushed to the front, you missed out on the special histories behind the vehicles- and hearing the stories behind the unique vehicles is the point of the Vault night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/587kelleyl

10,Horrible tour,"We were told there was a Chiron in the vault so we got the vault tour. Not only was there no Chiron, but the thing lasted an hour and a half. An hour and a half of a sassy, cowboy tour guide trying to be funny and passive aggressively reprimanding you for either falling slightly behind, getting slightly ahead, or just standing an inch too close to the cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/v-poghosyan
50,Autoventure!,Beautifully laid out museum that allows you to actually get up close to the exhibits (don't touch) with very knowledgeable docents. I cannot wait to return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chuckput
50,Wow! Definitely worth a visit if you care at all about cars,"The Petersen was a late add to our Los Angeles itinerary -- we decided to visit on a whim on the last day of our long weekend trip. All I can say is, wow!My first key piece of advice: do the vault tour. It is an extra add-on to the ticket, but that's where many of the goodies are -- an odd combination of unique custom cars, cars relevant to automotive history (think Tucker, DeLorean, Tesla, Model T), and cars relevant to world history (limos of FDR, Saddam Hussein, Marcos, etc.) In the vault tour, you walk through an unadorned basement garage with one interesting vehicle after another. It is surprisingly long at 90+ minutes, so eat some food and use the bathroom in advance. The docent who led the tour was outstanding.The rest of the museum is very interesting as well, but the vault was the capstone, I wasn't sure what was permanent display and what was special exhibition, but we saw an exhibit of Ferraris, an exhibit of cars from movies and TV (e.g, Magnum PI's Ferrari, the DeLorean from Back to the Future, the T-Bird from Thelma and Louise, etc.), and a Bugatti exhibit, among others.I suppose some love of automobiles is important to having a good experience, but if you care at all about cars, this is a must-see destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalmone07
50,If you love cars this is a cant miss experience.,"The Petersen Automotive Museum is an amazing place. You can see cars of all kinds here. From cars that had a staring role in movies to cars that helped inspire the cars we have today. They have a kids area that is more hands on but I loved that area too as an adult.We passed on the restaurant. It didn't have a lot of space and seemed pricey. I have no clue if the food was any good though.Tip: Don't bring a backpack. They won't let you bring it in. Instead they will have you check it in at the desk, but really it would be easier if you left it at home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/routetoa
50,Has everything with a motor,"A car buff will really enjoy this museum. Old, new different - you name it and it is here. It is fun to see even if you are not a car person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dean01
40,Fun afgernoon,"If you love cars this is the place for you in Los Angeles. Three floors of cars but it's not overwhelming. Very easy to make your way through. Not too big or small. We also did the vault tour which was very informative and fun but women , be sure to wear flat shoes. It's 90 minutes and you are standing the whole time. It's fun though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATravelingSloth
50,Highlight of our stay in LA,"This is a car lovers paradise. From Hollywood prop cars to high end luxury vehicles, it is all on display. The collection is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/murielcu
50,Great Car Museum,"This is a must-see for fans of all things automotive. We found the quality of the exhibits to be variable. The Bugatti and Ferrari portions were outstanding, while some of the stuff of the top floor was pretty meh. Parking is super convenient (but not free) and all of the facilities are top notch. Food at Drago in the lobby is not your typical museum fare -- really good!Those who are turned off by ""Car Museum Snobdom"" should stop reading here.... This is far from the best automotive museum on the planet. The Mercedes, Porsche and Audi museums in Germany exhibit in a completely different league. For some, this may not even be the best car museum in LA, as there is a very impressive, free collection not too far away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertR402
50,So clean and modern.,"I was very surprised with my visit to the Petersen, I am not a car fanatic but found it very interesting. The top floor had cars from the movies, I loved the Gatsby car. The Ferrari exhibit was obviously impressive though I preferred the Bugattis.There was more than just cars - motobikes, a small art gallery, a technical centre to view, a learning/play area for children, a restaurant and excellent wash rooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueKeo
50,A must or must not ....( you must love cars!!!!),"If you are ANY kind of a ' car-nut ', ...DON'T miss this place. It is awesome, and worth your time and money. You will not see a car collection of any kind, anywhere else,..like this..unless you go to Barrett- Jackson.If you don't like cars, and just think its 4 wheels and a mode of transportation,..then do not go .Our elder son, not interested at all,left him at the hotel....while the younger brother has not stopped talking about it, weeks later.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdrianSly
50,"If you love cars, this should be on your bucket list!","We attended the 2nd Museum After Hours, Vault Tours and Penthouse Party.....the first wa ~10 years ago according to some people we met that went to that one too. It was a little pricey but for the rare occasion that it is offered, I am quite happy that it happened when we were here. Clearly stated what was included, we also bought general museum tickets and did the self guided tour earlier in the afternoon. My wife and I both found it very informative and interesting but then back for the after hours agenda, the vault tour was AWESOME- many rare cars and the tour guide was AWESOME as well, she started working for Mr. Petersen when she was in her late teens/early twenties and knew all of the background stories and was able to answer all of the questions. The Penthouse event allowed guests to see the architecture of the building and surrounding area form a unique perspective, they did run out of some of the margarita ingredients but had plenty of Peroni on hand.....a little less than what I expected for snacks given the price but oh well, that's LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillsWebSpace
30,Penthouse Vault tour not worth the expense,"I purchased the rarely offered Penthouse party and Auto Vault tour at the Petersen Museum. After inquiring about the extent of the tour, I was under the impression you could see the entire museum collection on this special event night. I was wrong. You get a 55 minute tour of the vault - interesting but rushed (and way too many people). The Penthouse ""party"" was not champagne but rather snacks bought from Smart and Final (I recognize the brand on the chips bag) and drinks that were soda, low end margarita (they ran out) and water. Definitely not worth the price of admission, which was considerably more than their regular ticket price. The only real highlight - other than seeing some rare vehicles - is the view and the building itself. Architecture that is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouiseASL
50,COOL!! Very nice auto collection,"My daughter wanted to see the cars, and she was thrilled. Such a great variety of autos, from movie cars, to race cars. Something for everyone. Easy to walk around and see everything. Also have a video driving game (she won her race by the way). Was not too crowded while we were there so we raced twice. A great variety of displays and lots of history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_TAO-0o0-
50,Beautiful edifice to display cars,"A most rewarding venue for the car buff. The building itself is beautiful, a gem. It is five floors for well laid out easy to navigate display of cars and motorcycles. Fully enjoyed the experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arnolds637
50,Uniquely LA attraction,"Here in LA, we do so love our cars. This is a fun museum for families - especially kids who love cars. The autos range from novelty cars (and ones from movies and TV) to priceless models. My kids love to come back every few months to see what's new. And the fact that it's across the street from the tar pits and LACMA mean you can hit all three in a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellegO441YP
30,I was a bit disappointed,"Beautiful building, eye catching. You park in the covered parking area. You get 30 minutes free. Then you pay a $12.0 flat fee to park.It is truly a place to see, but it was just ok. Beautiful cars, when we were there, most areas we herd about were off limits to the public.You could see those area, but you would gave to pay more to see them.We will not return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492russellt
50,Must See for Car Enthusiast,"Definitely a must-see for the car enthusiast. This museum is impressive, thoroughly modern with an extensive collection of rare, exotic, iconic cars. Highlights included the special Ferrari exhibit, Bugatti exhibit and the cars from movies. I recommend the 90-minute vault tour for an additional fee. The vault tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and it was great to see learn about the cars/motorcycles that were there. Our vault tour was very crowded though. There is a nice restaurant and a limited offering gift shop. Although I wasn’t the car enthusiast I really enjoyed this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancySeaside
50,Fun place to spend a few hours!,"I had a few hours to kill while in LA so I thought it would be fun to visit this museum. I've been various auto museums Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI, and LINQ's auto collection, Smithsonian and always found them fascinating. The Petersen was definitely worth the visit.I only did the general museum tour, not the vault tour as I did not have enough time. I spent about two hours there and visited all three floors. The museum is spacious and at that time (Wednesday around noon), not overly crowded. Being fond of movies, I particularly enjoyed their autos from different movies and TV (Herbie: Fully Loaded, Back to the Future, Batman, Magnum PI, The Great Gatsby). There is a nice focus on design of automobiles, culminating with an exhibit on the artistic Bugatti family.Other exhibits include motorcycles (Harley-Davidson and Indian mainly), race cars (including a special Ferrari gallery), and electric vehicles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/12DeanB
40,Definitely Recommend This Museum Although Vault Tour Was Too Crowded,"I am by no means a car enthusiast but I found this museum highly engaging with a great collection of automobiles, motorcycles, etc. and a very nice, spacious layout. The movie cars collection was especially fun. We took the 90-minute vault tour - a little pricey, but worth it. The guide was extremely knowledgeable; I am sure he could have talked an hour about each vehicle! However there is apparently no limit on the number of people admitted to each tour, and there were too many of us to be able to see each car properly as he spoke about them. Also, 90 minutes is a long time to be standing and just shuffling from car to car; it would have been nice to have one area midway perhaps with some benches where we could have sat a few minutes while the guide talked to us. Otherwise, though, I do recommend this museum, even if like me you never heard of a Bugatti automobile before!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColRud
50,Don't miss it.,"What a great value! Located near other attractions this is well worth your time. Even if you're not a car person the selection of cars to admire is worth the trip. They have the first electric car made, you'll be surprised when you see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soonernscout
40,Great for car lovers - vault tour,"Visited to kill time waiting for an international flight.Worth the drive but ensure you go before noon. There is a 90 min vault tour of cars in storage or transiting. Price included normal museum access.Do the vault tour only if you are really into cars. Saw some extremely limited 1 of 3 editions, Presidential cars, etc... No pictures allowed in vault.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrenc339
50,"WOW WOW WOW! One of, if not the best car museum in the world!","The Petersen Automotive Museum should be on every car enthusiast's bucket list! One could easily spend a day walking around the three, large floors that contain the museum's humungous collection. The number of cars here is astounding. They have everything from Michael Schumacher's 2006 F1 Ferrari, to Lightning Mcqueen, to crazy hot rods. If you like cars, you must spend a day at this museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kadenwisniowski
50,"Wow! If you love cars, start here.","This is one of the top car museums in the country. If you're anywhere near LA, and like cars, make the trip. You will not be disappointed. There's no 'lunch-bag -letdown' with the Peterson.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imorr55
50,Gorgeous Collection,For a car enthusiast its a must go visit. For Friends or Families is aentertainment at its best. The building is quite impressive as well. I would recommend to add the Vault visit where they have dozens of cars that are not displayed in the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juangB7031VS
30,Should have been 5 stars,"Love the collection at this place, beautiful cars and excellent collection. I would have give it a 5 stars base on the ""products"". However the overall experience wasn't as pleasant. These are what I learned when we visited the museum:1: Always close the door as soon as you enter the building or the security will yell at you from the door while you already half way down the ticket booth. ""SIR!! You forgot to close the door! It was stuck and YOU let the air out!"" Humiliating? Not really, he wasn't yelling at me, just feeling unfair for my hubby (he was carrying the backpack. Wait, you'll see why I mention backpack soon).OMG! SO sorry to interrupt you socializing and God forbid you have to stop talking to your friend to close the door! So sorry for the inconvenience.2: know the rules! There's NO sign as of what the rules are, if there's any, we sure missed it - the one we found out is no backpack - and that's actually 90 mins into the visit just when we are about to leave! (remember I said backpack earlier?) We started on the 3rd floor spend almost an hour there where we encounter many securities and none of them mentioned anything!!On the 2nd floor after about 30 mins, just when we are about to leave, the lady from the video game center told us there's no backpack allow!! So I guess she call security to ""kindly"" escort us down to make sure we ""check in"" our bag. We were talking about 3 securities waiting!! I do have to say, those 3 were at least polite or maybe slightly embarrassed because they didn't do anything for 90 mins until she said so?3. Do NOT ever make any suggestions! I made a mistake by telling the lady at the video game (car racing) center to put more sign up so its not as confusing, boy, she let me have it! Did I mentioned she's also the one that call security because I told her she need to suggest to her boss to put more sign up? Her reply ""NO! If YOU would have LISTEN to me earlier like I SAID..."" I guess I missed it the first time? Or walk in late, but come on, without sign, it is confusing as of where is the waiting line. What if I'm deaf and can't hear and only read lips? Ok, I'm not. I did interrupt her while she's trying to argue with me but she did laugh it off, I still have chills just hearing her laugh 😳Overall, it's still a good place to visit. The collection of the museum are wonderful!Just make sure the employees are always right! And make NO suggestion and cause NO inconvenience to anyone! Just give them your money and listen to them! 👍🏻Have a GREAT visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonetF4058QY
50,Petersen automotive musejm,"GREAT place to tour even if you aren't a ""car person""! We did the extra 90"" tour of the Vault which has 140 additional beautiful cars with amazing history shared by a really knowledgeable guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marthaa940
50,A must see for car enthusiast,"This is a wonderful museum. Plan to spend several hours viewing 3 floors of beautiful automobiles. An absolute must is to take the Vault tour. Worth the extra ticket! Stop for lunch in the onsite restaurant. However, the souvenir shop is a disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GretaGarboFranklyn
50,Great even if you are not a car nut,"An amazing collection of rare and very beautiful cars, the Bugatti's are just gorgeous, lots to see and nicely done. We didn't do the vault tour but thought it was good value even without this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottb869
40,5 stars without the vault tickets,"It was nice to see the beautiful Bugatti on the first floor, and the rest of the museum on general admission. However, I did not recommend to purchase the vault ticket, unless you're a super serious automotive buff. It was not comfortable to enter the guided tour on the basement, it felt a bit too long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badwolflibrarian
50,First class automotive museum,The museum houses a variety of vehicles for all to enjoy. The faciltiy is very well layed out and very well funded. The location is also close to other attractions in the Los Angeles area. The display vehicles cover a wide range of interests from customs and hot rods to historic show cars and classics.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmangapora
50,Wow Wow Wow,"If you are into cars, this place is a dream!!!Not only the cars are to die for (vintage Ferraris and Bugattis among many others) but the museum is stunning with a phenomenal modern style. The restaurant is also very good; well priced and with excellent Italian menu. Service was very good too.Our kid was really excited to see Lightning McQueen, but unfortunately, he was taken away for the weekend 😞. He wasn't too happy about that, but Doc Hudson helped a little. We will be back to see the Vault, which is a enclosed are with the most interesting cars, and apparently is not part of the regular entrance fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrSotomayor
50,Huge selection of cars on display,The admission cost was family friendly which we appreciate soooo much. There was a wide variety of cars from the movies to personal private collections. Our kids really enjoyed the forza motorsports experience and the Bugatti floor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tborntreger
50,Amazing collection of cars,"Now this is a place that holds every mans dream car no matter what that car is . 3 floors of cars including a Ferrari collection that dates back to the 60s , original movie cars and racing cars as well as a great collection of motorcycles . Just an all around great place to visit and reasonably priced . A must for any car lover but also just a great palace to take kids and adults alike .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V6152ZVdanp
40,Fun place to visit...,Had a good time looking at this beautiful car collection though somewhat disappointed by the lack of Hollywood cars. Parking fee was nearly as much as the price of admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelfV267DB
50,If you love cars this is the place to visit,Peterson Automotive Museum is a must for the car lover. I have been there recently and I can tell you its a must see. Well worth the admission and a wonderful place for a family outing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/165Oldtimer
50,"great collection, go on the vault tour","Lots of great cars, there was a special exhibit of Bugattis while we were here. We went on the vault tour, where you get to see lots of great cars that aren't on display. The docents were great and had lots of interesting stories about the cars. One of the Bugattis we saw was owned by the former Shah of Iran, and we also saw this same car at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. That's the caliber of vehicles there. Beautiful outside of the building too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarzan2613
20,"Expensive, rude and unhelpful staff","As a dyed in the wool car enthusiast this had been a trip of a lifetime (from the UK). However after a long and tiring journey we were greeted by quite the snootiest and rudest lady encountered so far at the ticket desk who ignored our smiling approach and raised a hand to my face as I politely asked where the vault tour congregated as it started shortly. ""I will get to that in a minute"" she said brusquely. After a curt explanation about how the floors were arranged she ordered us that ""you WILL gather over there in 5 minutes before the vault tour no later"", she then barked ""Wrist"" with no explanation. My wife had to prompt me that it must be a wrist band ID wherupon Miss Snooty produced the inexplicable paper band. She also didnt give us a guide. But I noticed she did to some others who followed us along with smiles, so it must have been us in particular she didn't like for some reason. Quite a staggering attitude for not the hardest job in the world.Anyhow the museum suffers like all modern ""re-imagined"" museums built in the last 20 years of far too few exhibits in too much space, just like the equivalent museums in the Museo Dell Auto in Turin and the Alfa Romeo museum in Arese. No doubt modern museum designers were involved who think cars like works of art need vast spaces around them to be appreciated, when all most car geeks want is volume, as many amazing cars as possible parked side by side, and a little info board next to the front tyre.It was also extremely expensive, with the vault tour (which is essential if you actually want to see a lot of interesting cars) it was over $140 plus $12 parking in the multistorey (which is very easy to miss with little signage).All in all what has been a dream trip turned a bit sour. There were so many unsmiling unfriendly staff who gave most people the impression that you were lucky to be allowed inside, whilst crawling and fawning loudly to the odd few ""special"" (presumably rich) guests who occasionally appeared.Can't recommend it unfortunately without a thorough staff retraining exercise. I'm gutted",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stratoszero
50,Great Auto Collection,"Was awed and rendered envious by the MANY different autos on display here. The grandchildren, ages 10 and 7, even enjoyed the area where you can virtually ""drive"" a car through a LeMans type race. I was thrilled by it myself. The museum is just down the street from the La Brea Tar Pits so you can easily take in both the same day and still have plenty of time left over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussellD359
30,"Nice cars, but snooty staff","The cars are nice, but the staff is snooty. I felt ""looked down on"" by most of them. One of the guards followed me around on one whole floor, no idea why. At the restaurant, I was told that tables are reserved for those who are eating, so I could not sit there to drink a soda while my son visited the vault.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmmarley

50,Amazing night at the Petersen Automotive Museum!!,"I was invited to an event for Loyola Law School at the Petersen Auto Museum. I was glad I attended. The event was catered and servers came with great appetizers and there was also food stations. The cars are amazing, and look like new. I would recommend going if you have any interest in cars. If you're planning an event, consider the Petersen. You can't pick a better venue in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X4148BNrobertr
50,Awesome collection,If you're a fan of automotive history and cars in general you will love it here! I'm getting a membership,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/626cliffw
40,Great museum - lots of really cool cars,"I spent a few hours in the museum one afternoon. The main tour is self-guided and I chose to read about half of what they had written about many of the vehicles. The various wings are laid out really well. When I went, it wasn't really crowded so any pictures I took were easy to line up without anyone in the background.I added on the Vault tour. I was bummed they didn't let you take pictures down there. I think its primarily because some private parties have their vehicles there on loan. Our docent seemed fairly knowledgeable and had a couple of cool stories but didn't seem to budget his time well. We really rushed through the last couple rows of vehicles.Almost all of the vehicles in there are in amazing shape and many are so unique. It's a really interesting way to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taniaw78
50,Stunning cars and building,This was an unexpected treat; the new building is beautiful and the car collections are spectacular; I would highly recommend the vault tour; while it is 90 minutes long it is well worth the time; my 11 year old got a little antsy after 60 minutes but the tour guide was great and kept us all engaged till the very end.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5280Fam
50,"If you like cars, this is a must",Stunning cars from all eras. The Ferrari and Bugatti collections were beautiful. Some fun 'from the movies' cars. I've been to most of the tourist places in this city and this was a very pleasant change of style. Good for air conditioning too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bugs1012
50,A Car Lover's Dream-,"Actually, everyone loves cars, Young and Old, this is a World Class Museum, covers history, current and future trends, and on our roads and raceways today- well worth the time for a 1/2 day walk around and keep in mind they have a New classy Restaurant- worth the short wait to get in- and let's not forget the Kids attractions- they will talk about the visit for months .......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBjeffreyl
50,A pleasant surprise,"My ten year old son is a car nut and really wanted to go to the ""car museum"". We didn't know what to expect, and were very pleasantly surprised to see such a well designed museum with a truly outstanding collection of old and new cars. Other family members who aren't car crazy enjoyed it more than they expected to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellerGuy30
50,What a great museum,"I should preface this review by saying that I am not a car enthusiast. I was very impressed with this museum. The collection was laid out well. The museum did a nice job of balancing a focus on the history of cars, the role of cars in movies (it is LA after all...) and high-performance vehicles. I have never taken so many pictures of cars in my life.One hidden gem. There is a driving simulator in the 'family area.' It is well-worth waiting for a turn to drive a simulated car around a track.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/utpsy

40,For car buffs and afficionados,First time visit. Looks small upon entry but has multiple floors. Start at the top and work your way down. The exhibits change. The kids station was a hit so if you have bored younger kids be sure to take there while so car buffs can take time to wander.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynthiatucker
50,More fun than I thought,"The museum has been recently renovated and has a variety of vintage cars, motorcycles, and concept cars. It is very well organized and comfortably spaced so one can enjoy the vehicles. There is a drago restaurant and of course a museum store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ByronR170
40,A Car Lover's Dream,"I'm not exactly a car fanatic, despite having been born and raised in L.A.--the heartland of car culture-- but since this museum is practically in my backyard I decided to stop by for a look.As advised by the helpful lady at the admissions desk, I started my tour on the 3rd floor which features everything from horseless carriages (aka the original ""cars"") to the Volkswagen Beetle from Disney's ""The Love Bug"" and the (Michael Keaton era) Batmobile. You're not discouraged from taking pictures-even with ""flash"" cameras-so this would be an ideal place to get some interesting selfies alongside some of the most unique and exotic wheels on the planet.Since I do have a soft spot in my heart for vintage cars, I found the Bugatti collection of vehicles from the 20's and 30's to be out-of-this-world beautiful. No wonder they're worth millions! I wouldn't have thought you could use words like ""seductive"" or ""sensual"" to describe the design of a car, but they perfectly apply to the sleek and luxurious Bugatti wheels I saw here.Next time I visit I'll bring my SO since he truly is a car fanatic and the Petersen Automotive Museum will definitely be his speed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492HappyTraveler
50,"Moder, up to date automobile museum","Been several years since my last visit. Started on 3rd floor & walked down; exhibits were outstanding. Largest was the Bugattiexhibit with info on the family & their development of advanced cars, closely mollified by the Ferrari exhibit. The Petersen seems to always be on the cutting edge of automobile collections, with may foreign & domestic makes. Highlight was the Maserati story with great videos showing how cars were built & the extreme quality of the product, including a Quatroporte body being built and the finish automobile at the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enochs

50,Great history of the evolution of cars and the car culture!,We went on a Saturday and got there early. We could get around easily through the museum and saw all of the exhibits. All really well presented. Wished we had more time so we could have also done the Vault tour which takes you through an extra 100 cars which are not on exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M824EAcarols

50,Amazing Place!,Do the full on tour. General Admission to the Museum and a Guided Vault Tour. I would highly recommend taking some time to visit The Petersen Museum!

Guards are used to & understanding of children. Great array of cars - very old and recent. Batmobile is here. Child was very interested in seeing ""running boards"" for 1st time. Able to take pictures of him standing in front of the cars. Probably can't avoid the nice gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phillygirl2017
50,Fun Place!,"If you are a car nut, this is a must. There is something for everyone. Old cars, expensive cars, concept cars.

There was not a question from anyone in our group that stumped him. He had all of the answers and you could tell that he loves his job. The turquoise Ford woody station wagon was my absolute favorite. You can see the most pristine cars and trucks here.

I am 65 years old, so the displays altogether span my lifetime. Cars I thought were pretty cool back in the day still look that way to me now. Same with the other ones, now that I think about it, so it sure is fun to take a trip down memory lane and look at them all over again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/00Bruce00

I was here many years ago and remember a completely different line-up. The fantastic remodel might have something to do with this. We did not pay the extra $20 to see the cars in storage. On our first trip, there were many more cars on display. I recall seeing a lot more American production cars spanning the decades from the 1900's to modern cars. This trip, I saw only a few from the 30's through the 60's. I grew up in the era of very large cars and oh those fins! Having owned two Ford Model A's, I missed seeing one this trip. For these reasons, I almost gave the museum three stars, but I guess they are attempting to appeal to a younger audience, and not an antique car lover like me.

But that is most of the museum and well worth the visit. However... you must buy the extra trip to the Vault. It is what evoked the ""amazing"" in my headline for this review. A real trip down the history of the auto, giving the highlights of the best cars to demonstrate the evolution to today's cars.

We also shelled out for the private collection tour in their basement. It is a 1.5 hour guided tour where you may see some historic vehicles and get a background story. There are also random and rare cars down there which get rotated for display. We saw a Ferrari Sergio which was on loan to the museum; 1 of 6 ever made. I had never even heard of it prior.

50,Amazing tribute to automobiles,"Being a motorhead I couldn't pass up the chance for a visit to this famous museum. We came to Southern California for a quick trip to Santa Monica the pier and the end of Route 66. But being so close I had to stop by this mecca for auto enthusiasts.The outside and inside has just undergone a multi million dollar renovation. Everything inside and out is spectacular.We drove into the parking structure ($12 all day, very reasonable for LA) and walked into the main floor. Just the free cars and motorcycles on display is impressive. We signed up for the Vault tour which took us on a guided tour down into the storage area under the museum. This was a real highlight for me, a small group being told about the cars in storage by a highly qualified tour guide. Ours was Jerry and he provided expert interaction with our group with questions and little known facts about so many of the cars down in storage.After the Vault tour, which took one and a half hours. we started on the third floor and got to see an amazing variety of cars including Hollywood cars, that is cars you've seen in movies. Naturally the batmoble and Back to The Future cars were there. There are in excess of 400 million dollars worth of cars on display. As I said this is car heaven for anyone that appreciates the automobile from it's earliest form to the latest in technological vehicles.If that wasn't enough, the Drago Italian restaurant is in the lobby of the museum and it's excellent also.

The special vehicles in the vault are incredible pieces of history that you will not want to miss. The vault portion is a 90 minute guided tour with a docent that was amazing! His passion for vehicles coupled with his knowledge was impressive. There wasn't a question he could not answer and he kept us engaged the whole time. I would not recommend this portion for smaller children as it is a walking tour through the vault and the vehicles can not be touched. The collection of vehicles in the museum is remarkable. They have everything from cars used in movies to presidential vehicles and everything in between. This was the only tour that my teenager was not bored with after 15 minutes.

My kids made up for it on the upper levels. We could have stayed there all day, thank you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W1476KQstephens
50,What a treat !,"Was headed to Lacma for the day and the parking garage was full ,ended up parking in Peterson Parking and spent the day there. Had a wonderful lunch at their restaurant and enjoyed everything Peterson had to offer. We never made it to Lacma but will try later. Don't miss out on this gem !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriabluffpla2017
50,Cool cars,"Great place for car buffs if any age. Many interesting exhibits and hands-on workshops for kids. Parking pricey, free 30 minutes is not enough, so you pay $12 for all day, though 2 hours probably plenty for museum. Many high-end cars on display, rare and historically significant ones, with nice narrative about cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/njsnarky
50,One of the best Automotive Museum,"First time here, the exterior of the museum was already amazing, inside of super clean and shining, rather than says it's a museum, its more like a gallery. The services was great, people were polite and kind. The cars in there is amazing. One of the must go place when visiting L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yutaih
40,Well worth the visit,The fee for the general museum was fair but I thought that The Vault at an additional $35 was very steep - I wouldn't do it again. There is a good Italian restaurant within the museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaymiller
50,Rare opportunity,"Don't miss this car museum. One of the very best in the country. Both deep and broad, with rare one-of-a-kind cars. Well-curated and seated, it's a memorable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reiserhof
40,great for car enthusiasts,"There's something for everybody here, from classic cars to antiques, to supercars and exotics. There's an entire room dedicated to Bugatti, as well as a great display on the process of car design and engineering. There are 3 floors of displays and it's sized right for about a 1 h,our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwwyjjliu

30,"Pick a car, any car.","I enjoy going to art museums so, I thought I'd give PAM a try. They presented the cars well. The gift shop was neat. The cars were very interesting for about 30 minutes to me, however, my car fanatic friends couldn't stop fawning over them. Overall, if you are a car buff, race on over. If not, don't worry, drop off your car fan and hit LACMA down the street, and then you two can meet in the middle for lunch somewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ntitled1
50,Fantastic exhibits,"The building facades are fantastic the way they sculpt around the building, then inside there is a International mix of cars from Europe and USA. Start from the 3rd floor and work your way through to the ground floor where you see the Bugatti storylines and the finest collection you will come across, the details of design and coach building are stunning and colours are electricA few other gems from McLaren and Ferrari plus an exhibit of Harley Davison and Indian bikesEasy to find and parking on siteA real gem",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/james101bos
50,Incredible car museum!!!,Loved this place. Even if you are not a car enthusiast you will love it. Lots of history and take the 2 hour vault tour. Wow!! Their onsite restaurant drago was also very good. my teen loved the day there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DL9022
50,Harley and Indian Exhibit,"The other reviews are spot on so I won't repeat it, but I really enjoyed the motorcycle exhibit that's on right now. I spent around two hours there which allowed me enough time to see things in enough detail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gypsy_Adventure1
50,Great Visit,"Wow for a petrol head this place is fantastic, the parking is great and the museum if well laid out and huge.The amount of car and quality of them was fantastic, and the vault tour well worth the extra money.I will be back as had great day with son and my relations from LA, staff were excellent as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Derekh1

50,This beats the automotive exhibits at the Henry Ford in Dearborn by a country mile,"When we landed at LAX on Friday, the Petersen Automotive Museum was not on our itinerary. The driver who picked us up at LAX highly recommended it and I'm glad we listened to him. I grew up in Dearborn, Michigan (Ford Motor Company's World HQ) in an automotive family and have been going to the Henry Ford Museum (one of the world's premier automotive museums) there, since I could walk. Was absolutely blown away by the Petersen Automotive Museum and think you will be, too. It beats the Henry Ford Museum by a mile with the breadth and depth of its automotive collection, which you'll see and hear about in detail, if you take ""The Vault"" tour, a 90-min docent-guided tour of the Museum's most significant cars, not on display upstairs. What also set the Petersen apart from the Henry Ford was the exhibit on the second floor detailing how a car is manufactured, sponsored by Masserati. The exhibit is comprised of five sub-exhibits starting with the raw materials used in a car's manufacture, the components of a car, finishing with the actual colors available today for interiors and exteriors. As a proud native Detroiter, was stunned at the displays and their comprehensiveness. Don't miss the Bugatti exhibit on the main floor, as well, detailing that family's extraordinary creative genes. Spent a very happy three hours there and think you'll think it's time well spent, too. Note; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the La Brea Tar Pits Museum are a couple of blocks away, but because of major road and sidewalk construction we found it wasn't feasible to include them on our Petersen tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrishAT2014
50,a great way to spend a few hours,"This museum focuses on automotive collections, with some history, mostly cars and some motorcycles. It's mission is to conserve, not restore, not tell history - and that's clear. The collections are a little random, but all of the artifacts are pretty cool. The cars are all well marked with accompanying signs, photos, and stories (all in English). The exhibits are on three floors. I suggest 30 minutes per floor, on average. Otherwise, it's overwhelming and .. if you do the vault tour .. The vault tour is, indeed, 90 minutes with about 120+ cars. So, do the math, your docent will give you about a 45 second explanation of car after car after car in the line up in their basement. It can be a bit much. But, again, the cars are cool. Don't expect this to be a kids place. Though there are kids exhibits, there are a lot of vehicles in the open and that are Do Not Touch. In terms of the building itself .. the outside is way cooler and I was disappointed some of the red waves weren't carried through. The floor is cement, so wear comfortable shoes. It's new, so I think they still need to think about sound, giving it more ""buzz"". Some area felt dead, since they were visually cold and dark and quiet. The adjoining restaurant, Drago, is GREAT, on par with other Drago restaurants. It is definitely not a typical museum cafe/break stop. It is a restaurant. It may not be great for groups, families, kids. But, it was great for a group of 40-something friends celebrating a birthday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NinaPintaStaMaria
50,"Must See, Even If You Aren't A Car Buff","We visited the Museum on a family vacation. My oldest son loves cars, especially the exotic ones. He was thoroughly impressed as was the rest of the family. We did the additional ""Vault"" tour and saw even more treasures. The Museum is newly renovated and very modern. A lot a famous people have cars stored here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisamE3303MQ
50,Impressive,"Any car enthusiast will enjoy this collection! Beautiful collection of cars from throughout automotive history. They are definitely given the white glove treatment. The display and curation are impeccable. I didn't opt in for the underground vault tour, but will be back for that. My favorite was the 1930s model blue Bugatti, just gorgeous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SilverlakeJake
50,Impressive...Most Impressive!,"My teenage son is big into cars so I took him here while on our trip to LA. I think I came away more impressed than him.From the moment you enter into this very, very unique building (the exterior is an architectural gem), you can sense this is not your typical car museum. Here, the cars are treated as pieces of art, which they rightfully deserve to be called. You can spend hours here just examining the craftsmanship that went into the design of each unique vehicle.The museum does have its fun floor on top where you can see a dozen or so vehicles from Hollywood movies and tv shows. There's the Michael Keaton Batmobile, the 1960's bat motorcycle, Delorean from Back to the Future with the interiors just like from the movie (even the time screen and flux capacitor are lit up) , Herbie the Love Bug and Magnum's Ferrari.But the other two levels have the prototype cars and one of a kind classics. Each one so very unique and pristine in condition. I do remember one purple beauty that was owned by ZZ Top. One floor was filled with Bugatti classics from the 20's - 30's to the present.Overall, even if you're not a lover of cars, I think you'd find something here to be impressed by. The museum has a nice gift shop and restaurant on site. Parking was $12.00 for all day in a covered garage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redmonder
30,Nothing Special,"I’m a car guy who actually wrenches on cars and participates in several car shows during the year. I was expecting to see hundred's of cars on display in a manner that would show how the automobile evolved but was disappointed in the number of items on display. The quality of all the items on display was top notch. The vault tour was interesting, but the tour guide spent to much time on cars like the Nixon presidential car and pope car and didn’t even acknowledge and interesting drag car with what appeared to be a 16 cylinder small block Chevy engine. I’ve seen more cars on display at local outdoor and indoor car shows. Also, don’t take your phone out during the vault tour or you will be accused of taking pictures even if that’s not the case.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B5057CPfreds
50,The Museum for Car Enthusiasts of All Ages,"This is really one of my favorite museums. From the moment you approach the building, you can tell that your in for something uniquiely wonderful for car enthusiasts of all ages. I've gone by myself, I've taken my daughters, and my wife. It was FUN for all of us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summervacationeer
50,One of a kind,This is a multi level Car museum with one of a kind vehicles...Everything was new and the cars were amazing.. They also had an Italian Cafe which serves a good lasagna....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomB1275
50,Cars as art,This is not the typical car museum. Certainly there are cars but the are not so piled up on top of each other that you become overwhelmed. Instead they are displayed as sculptural masterpieces that you can walk around and appreciate in their own right. If you can be sure to take one of the docent lead tours where you will get more in-depth information about individual cars and their owners.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caparadis
50,See the history of the car,"We came here for an after-hours special event and this place had so much to see and so much to walk through. All the most exclusive, eclectic and authentic vehicles in the world. I highly recommend spending an afternoon here and bring the kids too! Parking is easy and underground. They have a new cafe and new souvenirs shop too. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sigirl33
50,Fantastic eclectic collection,"We accidentally found this place while visiting the nearby La Brea Tar Pits. Three floors of classic cars, idea cars, movie cars, cycles, and more. Well worth the time. A little pricey for the amount of time. Construction of a new metro stop at this location makes it temporarily inconvenient to access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul-A-C-62
50,"Um...if you love cars, you'll prob love this","Whether you're 3 or 103 - if you love anything with wheels you're likely to enjoy this place. I only have a sideways interest in cars and I certainly couldn't deny the beauty of some of the vehicles on display, but my 3 year old son thought it was all pretty damn cool, especially Lightning McQueen and the dedicated 'Cars' area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/587hannahk
50,Petersen Automotive Museum,"This museum is well worth a visit. Kids will enjoy it, too. There is a gift shop and the on-site restaurant is quite good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AGtravelers2
40,If you like cars,Lots of history and variety of cars to see fun for a wide array of ages. There was a display of movie cars that was fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mouseangel
50,Great collection,Get early or very late in the day to enjoy an incredible selection of rare cars.Consider the offer to visit the vault for an extra fee to see even more cards,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meherio
50,When Commerce Becomes Art,"The Petersen is a stunning museum, beginning with its grand contemporary architecture and of course driven home with its automotive exhibits. History, commerce, design, art, sports, entertainment and science all come together with a bang here as the world of significant milestones in the development of cars and motorcycles is explored and celebrated. The day before visiting I had been ruminating on how the drive of a particular corporation at a particular time to create a winning product and make millions of dollars can at times result in sublime expressions of pop art. (The Ford Mustang is a perfect example though they're not displaying one at the moment.) The Petersen is a feast for the eyes and the imagination. The store is amazing - I'm glad it wasn't around when I was a kid because I would have lost it not being able to buy one each of all those model cars...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SidneyW50
40,Do Not Stop--Go Straight to the Petersen Museum!,"This review is not for car enthusiasts like my husband and daughter; instead, this is for those of you who may be on the fence about the experience.For years my husband has suggested visiting this museum, but I have always hesitated due to the fear of LA traffic, mind-numbing exhibits, and simply, sheer boredom. Yes, traffic turned out to be as bad as I had imagined, even on a Sunday. But the museum itself was so interesting and entertaining that our three-hour visit flew by. When we were finished, I insisted that we go back up inside to see the exhibit of the decked-out hot rods we had inadvertently missed!What did a non-car-enthusiast like myself enjoy about the Petersen museum?1. The history of the automobile with vintage ""cars""2. Automobiles from different movies= Herbie the Love Bug, the Delorean from ""Back to the Future,"" the Batmobile, etc.3. The process of car production, from prototype to trim choices4. The children's room with interactive computer screens explaining in simple terms how cars operate5. The history of alternative-fuel vehicles6. The history of Bugatti cars7. The gift shop with clothes and miniature cars (I almost bought the ""Breaking Bad"" motorhome for my son).8. The cool exterior of the museumWould I go again? Absolutely. I might even agree to go on the Vault tour--a private, docent-led tour of automobiles not on public display. Just remember, this tour costs extra, requires reservations, and does not allow children.The only problem with the Petersen Museum is that, unlike the Getty Center, there are no free charging stations for hybrid cars like mine. Oh, and for some reason we found the parking pay stations a little confusing, but there is always an attendant around to clear things up.If you have the chance, I definitely recommend that you check out the Petersen Automotive Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TulipL0ver
50,Stunning building exterior with fabulous exhibits,"Wonderful museum with all kinds of cars and motorcycles. Loved the special Bugatti exhibition. Especially love all the interactive parts of this museum - hands=on activities for kids and adults, race car simulation, etc And there are movie scene projections on the walls all around the movie car exhibit hall. My husband chose this activity but I loved it too. Parking in the adjacent garage is good for all day, so you can park here for one price and then walk around the corner to other museums on the Miracle Mile. Make a day of it. thank you LA for putting so many so close together: LACMA, La Brea Tar Pits, and maybe more within walking distance of the Petersen Automotive Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClassicTheatre
40,Sunday in Los Angeles,"I visited the Petersen many years ago, before the remodel. The new iteration has far fewer cars on display, but the exhibits are themed and quite interesting. I was mostly there for the Dan Gurney exhibit, as he has long been my favorite driver.It seems that visiting ""the Vault"" would be the way to see much more of the collection, but it more than doubles your ticket price. My general admission ticket was $15; visiting the vault would have taken it to $35...possibly the most expensive car museum admission price in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/horizonbound
50,Three levels of automotive marvel...,"My gosh to sum it up: nostalgia, & diversity in design technology! Some may enjoy seeing the cars of film and television while others may relish the art and industry, or simply classic sports cars! There's something to be admired for everyone. It's easy to spend 1-2 hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Faryz1
50,"WOW! Cars, cars, cars, and motorcycles","Brand spanking new and shiny. The exterior architecture is amazing. The displays are wonderful from movie cars, to classics, to race cars, to motorcycles. The display is put within a cultural context which is makes it much more interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BinkySez
50,Largest Privately Owned Auto Collection,Take the Vault tour. That is where all the really cool stuff is. Plus it is a guided tour with lots of info on eack specialty car. The top 3 floors have a wide variety of different autos from early to movie cars to Indian vs Harley Davidson display. This is worth an afternoon when in Beverly Hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/288kentc
40,Car enthusiast husband :),Of course during our spring break vacation we have to do something my husband likes. So he chose to come here. They offered free military admission so that was awesome. I loved the Art of Bugatti on the first floor. But who doesn't love some Jean Bugatti cars :)He wanted to do the vault tour but no children under 10 yrs old. Maybe next time. They do have a Cars experience on the second floor designed for kids. That was pretty cool. I learned a few things in there haha.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelleyj812
40,Unexpected but cool!,This museum just happened to be walking distance from our hotel. I'm so glad we stopped in. I'm totally not a car person. But this place had some great Americana and really made us stop and think about the importance of innovation in our lives.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlisonGF
50,Automobiles as Art,"The new Peterson museum's facade is fantastic and the vehicles on exhibit are great. Many eras and types of cars (race cars, hot rods, famous movie vehicles, gorgeous specimens from the 20s and 30s, contemporary marvels) as well as motorcycles are on display. It's also possible to view the cars that are in the vaults for an additional charge. We spent a couple of very enjoyable hours visiting just the vehicles on exhibit. You can also ""drive"" various routes, watch movies, learn about engineering...definitely worth the price of admission!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonannie22
50,Testosterone inducing,Great day out for the family but especially car heads. Enjoyed most every inch of the place including the gift shop. Parking was easy and we walked down the street to the food trucks for lunch. May even return with 'vault reservations' one day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/742melindac
40,Good value visit with interesting exhibits,The museum or exhibition is to high standards and sections include some exceptional vehicles. There is a section dealing with explanations on how the parts of the cars work from engines to suspension and gears. This is very educational and well worth spending time for those that do not have mechanical knowledge. The vault tour is interesting but it is disappointing that such great vehicles are hidden away and photographs are not allowed. This section is a museum on its own without the top floor exhibits. Overall a great place to visit for those with a slight petrol mix in their blood!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pavakeal
40,Some exceptional specimens,"This museum was on my list for quite some time and had the opportunity to visit it last week. It worth buying the vault tour to discover some great specimens. Spread on 3 floors, the museum offers different sections, including motorcycles, race cars, movies cars, ... my favorite is the precious metal section with fantastic cars such as the 1954 Mercedes W196 . The Bugatti exhibition also worth the visit with the display of the extraordinary 1939 Bugatti chassis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedSkirrel
40,Visit The Vault,"My first visit. The top floor has the 'history' section with cars from various movies. We saw 'Christine', the Batmobile, the Delorean time machine, and more. The Vault tour lasts 90 minutes, and it isn't enough time to go through all the stories about all the cars in the 'garage'. It is an incredible collection. We spent so much time here, we have to go back to see all the other museums in the area (LCMA and La Brea Tar Pits). We did get to Pinky's for dinner. I was surprised that it is so close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jean_on_a_beach
50,"A gem! Must visit, don't skip this one.","This was my second visit to the Petersen Museum (previous visit was in 2013, just before they closed for renovation apparently). I had really enjoyed the previous visit, but this time was even better.This place is impressive. It has a huge collection of cars, and this alone is worthwhile to see, from the 19th century to modern times and future ideas. But it is a real museum, it has the vision of a curator who understands how automobiles reflect our culture and our society, our dreams and aspirations, well beyond the mere need of transportation. The display shows how cars evolved to meet goals for style, utility, innovation, freedom, destination. Or how the highway system evolved. They also have an impressive exhibit of the Bugatti family's creations, including cars, but also sculptures and some furniture.I will become a member of this museum and I cannot wait to visit again when I am back in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_Daphne1734
40,MIA American Muscle Cars,"Some great cars but definitely doesn't focus on American cars. If you're into muscle cars, this is not the place for you. Displays on cars in the movies/tv, European cars (lots of bugattis), hot rods, race cars, and motorcycles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M9290RYjennifers

50,A must see for car enthusiasts,"The Petersen Museum is a fantastic place to explore the history and development of the automobile & motorcycle over the years. There is also quite a few famous ""Hollywood"" cars like the Delorean from ""Back to the Future"" and Stephen King's ""Christine"" It's well laid out, has it's own off street parking and cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bigpetesol
50,Terrific Museum,"If you're a classic car fan, this museum should not be missed! Beautifully designed, the exhibits are easy to see and there's plenty of room to move around each vehicle. When we were there, an entire showroom was dedicated to the Bugatti---this was spectacular! The adjacent museum restaurant is also good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Britishcats
40,A must do for the car nut in L.A.,"Bugatti, Ferrari, movie cars, racing cars and hot rods number among the many displays on offer. The displays are beautifully thought out and the cars are all immaculately restored and displayed.We did the vault tour and once you pay for this and the admission it didn't feel like value for money.The Peterson is located quite centrally in L.A. making it easy to get to. Parking is on-site and reasonably priced for L.A.I wouldn't bother with the vault, however for the car aficionado the Petersen is a must see when in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VHD001
50,Great time - not just for car lovers,"This place is amazing. You don't have to be a car fan to enjoy this museum, but if you are this is a must visit.

50,Family spring road teio,"Amazing collection of motor vehicles from different eras. Included were some movie cars and vehicles along with several rooms of race cars. Older model luxury cars were also showcased in their own 'gallery'. The Bugatti Family had their own room with many beautiful cars, sculptures, and artwork. Admission fee is not bad and parking is on site for a fixed rate of $12 for the day. Leave your car there and walk up Wilshire Blvd to other museums and food trucks. A great Saturday outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saleafpeepers

50,A MUST for Automotive Fans!!!,"We didn't plan on spending 6 hours at there and that still wasn't enough time!Pay the extra fee to do the Vault Tour. It's so worth it!!! I really don't know where to start but you MUST see this place that has so much car history and what we can look forward to in the car industry future. It really is an ALL day place to visit for automotive lovers.Stop by the gift shop on your way out. So many fun things to purchase. If you spend a certain amount (forget how much) the gift shop will validate for your parking for free.Also, you'll have to check in and leave any back packs at security while in the museum.Also, you're not allowed to take any pictures on the Vault Tour, but you can go back to security to get your camera for the rest of the museum.The Vault Tour had so many cool cars! Our tour guide (sorry, can't remember his name) had so much knowledge of the history and facts of all the cars. You could tell he really loves his job.Check out the floor that has the car driving games. So much FUN! I must had stayed there for 30-minutes. They let you play & play if there isn't a line. We went on a Friday and it wasn't a crowded day. My husband had to drag me out of that section.There also a Great interactive kids section. That has so much fun things to do while they learn about cars.There is also a section that shows about the school for car designers from the beginning to the end a car gets created.A section with cars from movies.Lastly, you'll have to eat at the restaurant (Drago Ristorante) in the museum. Who would ever think that a automotive museum would serve such Delicious food. See my review of the Drago Ristorante.Just a few pictures of all the Amazing cars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808Madeline
50,Fantastic Remodel!,"We went to the Peterson Automotive Museum on a Sunday afternoon. It was a fantastic day! The facility is so sleek and inviting. The parking was a piece of cake, considering you are in L.A. The collection is great and you can pay a little extra and tour The Vault! There are so many amazing vehicles, race cars and motorcycles to view, not to mention the interactive stations that give you so much additional information. The Bugatti collection is beyond beautiful. The history of the art and the cars is truly fascinating. The collection of movie cars is also a treat. However, seeing the ""Christine"" movie car freaked me out... it is haunting. The Back to the Future DeLorean is there and the Flux Capacitor is ""Fluxing""! This is definitely worth a trip. It is also great to drive down Museum row and visit the other museums which are within walking distance. This place is a must see if you are at all interested in cars, Racing and motorcycles the like!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AGMoto
50,Suprisingly interesting even to a non-car fan!,"I came here specifically to see the DeLorean from Back to the Future which is now housed on their top floor with other famous cars such as Magnum's car, the Batmobile and Herbie!I'm no car fan, I just wanted to see the DeLorean but was pleasantly surprised to find myself fascinated by the place. There's a lot of interesting stuff to read and I found it excellent value for money.... and yes, seeing the DeLorean for real was brilliant!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LonePineKath
50,So Fun!,"Surprised my new husband with tickets and the basement tour for Christmas. He's a car buff. But surprisingly, he didn't seem as thrilled about the gift as I thought he would've. That said, after a day at the museum, he was blown away! He loved it! The Basement/ Vault (can't remember the name exactly) Tour is well worth the money. Wear tennis shoes as you're on concrete the entire day. The museum is really cool even for people who aren't into cars. We will be going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimtravelnut
50,Newly Remodeled and Expanded,"If you're a gear head, this is one of the best experiences in Los Angeles. Greatly expanded in the last year or so, the displays are varied and interesting. Don't miss the ""silver"" room devoted to silver cars including a priceless Ferrari 275GTS/4 NART convertible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesM298
50,Amazing Collection of Rare and One of a Kind automobiles,"Ended up here because of the bad weather, and it was a wonderful accident. I love cars, so I was in heaven. There are so many one-of-a-kind cars here! They have a little history with them and purchase cost, which was really cool to think about. It is 3 levels broken up into ""themes"" - there are even some movie original cars here - like Christine and the actual Back to the Future Delorean. You will spend about 1 to 1 1/2 hours here if you read everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelintexas79
50,Brilliant,This museum is worth a visit. The cars and bikes on display are amazing. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. If you are able do the vault tour. Peter our tour guide was fabulous and his knowledge alone amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J2321AUheatherw
40,Wonderful collection,"The place is still amazing, but unfortunately its less-so since the remodel. And it's expensive. It's $15 to get in and parking is $12. Once your inside they talk to you about joining the museum It's $85 a year and they tell you about all the events they have, but they don't mention that nearly every event costs extra to attend. I joined last year. I won't be doing it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banerman
50,Great way to spend the day,"I am a car guy, so this place has always been on my list. It exceeded my expectations, and the place is just so cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hotelmagellaninn
50,Fascinating,"Even though we did not do the Vault Tour, we had a great time. I especially enjoyed the automotive history of SoCal on the third floor. We certainly plan on going back to do the vault tour. The only negative thing is the traffic confusion from road work on Wilshire. Definitely use Fairfax to going to and from the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deb7091954
40,As TopGear magazine says- In the 50 things to do if your a Petrolhead,"June 2016 a lovely hot day and my wife and I pull up to what has to be the most amazing car park ever!!!!! All arty and just stunning. Once in this has to be seen. I have visited many motor museums over the years but this is one of the best. The building and displays caters for all (I would have given 5 on the rating had it not been for the redevelopment of the catering facilities but did not spoil my visit)The cars are fantastic and my wife loved the film and TV section as well as the hands on displays. The staff also are very informative and above all APPROACHABLE (Take note UK) Value for money was fantastic and yes I recommend you visit the basement, it costs a few dollars more but to see all that machinery is just jaw dropping.This place is not a stuffy preservation of the past museum, it has a great feel and welcomes you in as someone special. Keep it up Petersen and hey maybe I will be back soon to see what delights you have",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G1993BIrichardc
50,Amazing collection,"Gorgeous new building and a fabulous collection of the most unusual and gorgeous vehicles. Try to see ""the vault"" collection which has incredible cars and requires a private tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MesBeauxVoyages
50,Wow automobiles!,I am far from a car enthusiast but I really enjoyed seeing restored old cars and motorcycles (not so much racing cars). Got a kick out of seeing Steve McQueen's sports car and the Batmobile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/613elaynes
40,Definitely worth the visit if you like cars!!,"This place is pretty amazing! Car buffs heaven! Dedicated parking that is free for first 30 minutes or if you make a $75 purchase in gift shop. (not hard to do!) Gift shop is impressive, with many one-of-a kind items, just wish they had more size Large, in their apparel choices, always out of size Large! For a reasonable fee, can visit 3 floors of auto history and beautiful one-only cars or special models, some never-seen-before! Can take pictures and a couple of interactive things to do.......Not so great, they are VERY serious about NOT touching anything and I mean ANYTHING! You will be descended upon by the ""security nazis"" who will threaten you with expulsion if you touch that again!! They charge a large extra price to see the ""Performance Car"" or ""Celebrity Car"" collection, that can only be seen by guided tour every 2 hours......we did not do these yours.......gift shop is pretty pricey but hey, what do you expect?I would still recommend this for anyone who is a gearhead or lives with one, including children, it is a one-of-a-kind place to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HGF001
50,A must see for all automobile aficionados,"Recently renovated, this museum has an amazing range of refurbished automobiles. The Vault is worth the extra money for the guided tour. The restaurant Drago was a delicious and welcome rest stop for lunch between the main area and the Vault.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerAZ863
40,Interesting Exhibits,The Museum has all kinds of cars you can think of.Info is shared in detail. A great place for car enthusiasts.The basement has some of the best cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aadeshagarwal75
50,Walking Down Memory Lane!,"Had a lot of fun on January 14th attending a very relaxing and fun afternoon looking at all these amazing works of art called ""automobiles"" at the Petersen Automotive Museum. This is the 1st time I've been to the Petersen since it re-opened after renovations way back on December, 2015. I had visited the Petersen Museum a number of times over the years, the last time was probably around 2008, quite some time ago.The building itself is exceptional! It was made clear to us that the cars on display on the ground floor are always changing, and new exhibits are on offer. The Petersen consists of 3 floors, and it is recommended you start at the 3rd floor and work your way down.The 3rd floor, the ""History"" floor, is divided into eight sections, and a wonderful variety of vehicles are on display! The 2nd floor, the ""Industry"" floor, is divided into eleven sections, including a collection of motorcycles going back 100+ years! The 1st floor, or ground floor, is called the ""Artistry"" floor. It consists of the Lobby, theree sections of Art and the Automobile, and a restaurant called ""the Drago"", where I actually had coffee upon arrival. Then afterwards, had a nice lunch.I highly recommend spending the extra $20 dollars and get tix for ""The Vault"" tour. It's a special tour that lasts approx 1 and 1/2 hours, were you will see over 100+ additional cars that are not on display. In conclusion, the Petersen is safe, clean fun for the whole family! You don't have to be an automotive ""oficionado"" to appreciate the vehicles on display!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRONOSJR
50,Heaven for a car nut,"If you like cars, whether race cars, classics, early automobiles just out of the horse-and-buggy era or celebrity and historical cars, then Peterson Automotive Museum is a must-see. Exhibits rotate so check their website to see what's new. And do yourself a favor and pay a bit extra for the basement tour where dozens of historical cars from all eras are stored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwfilice
50,Eye catching exterior with some great cars inside,We took the Vault Tour. It is an hour and a half long. Our guide was very informative and had a great sense ofhumor.Saw some great cars and 'horseless carriages' Movie cars and some with an interesting history. The cars are well displayed and absolutely gorgeous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aileenTorontoCanada
50,"Cars Afficionado""s Heaven",Great place to take anyone who love cars! Their collection is amazing and unique. They even have a room for the kids!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyrnaGarcia
50,Beautiful museum dedicated to the car buffs!!,"The museum is artfully put together and easy to navigate. Each car has information plaques telling about the history and cost of the car. I particularly enjoyed the section of cars from famous movies and the Bugatti section. If you get the chance, this museum is a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christianbQ4038DQ
50,Great place to see cars,Great place to visit with adults and families. We really enjoyed our trip. Many cars to see. We will definitely go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimiValley_CAMomof3
50,Great Automotive museum with a Vault Tour!,"This has been reviewed so much that there's not much to add other than what we did.We went on a very non-busy Sunday morning and had tickets to the Vault (with only 10 guests which apparently is about half the norm). We were very glad we chose to do the vault tour as it really adds to the overall museum experience. We arrived shortly before it was scheduled and are glad we did it first as the stories help establish the overall museum experience and history quite effectively.We spent a few more hours in the museum.If you really don't like cars, don't bother. But, if you sort of do..., you'll probably enjoy it. You'll see cars that you'll never see anywhere else in person (as they have a lot of 1 of 1 cars on display).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AaronsTravels
50,Automobiles on display!!,Visited the Petersen on a rainy LA day and found such interesting automobiles. From the beginning autos to concept and luxury cars there is something for everyone. Several groups of school aged children were touring while we were there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clintonlcarbon
20,Disappointed museum,"I expected more from a man who started both Hot Rod and Motor Week magazines. Over priced and overrated for what there is to offer. Between the $12 admission it will cost you another $12 for parking and if you want to see the secret ""Vault"" collection for an hour that will cost you another $12. I've been through most auto museums in the US and Germany. This is a third rate representation of autos and motorcycles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nikki4765
50,See the Art of Bugatti before it's gone!,"I love auto museums and was looking forward to this one when we visited in late December. We allowed 4 hours to see the museum and yet it was not enough. We ended up coming back the next day for 2 more hours. We did take a vault tour and it was longer than stated, but well worth it. Though this was wonderful, it's part of the reason we ran out of time. So many cars that the docent couldn't even describe one quarter of them. And check out the exterior of this building after the 2015 remodel - beyond description! One of the best elements of our visit was the special exhibition on the Art of Bugatti. It's about the glorious Bugatti cars, but also about the art created by Bugatti family members. Fascinating. Be sure to go there before this exhibit ends (at the end of 2017?). Footnote: we had lunch in the recently opened Italian restaurant (Drago) and enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/napavalleydiner
50,Paradise for car lovers,"Always great exhibits of beautiful and interesting cars, motorcycles, etc.Worth going back every few months as things are always changing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinsond362
50,What an amazing museum!,"My husband and I are car nuts and we had an opportunity to visit the Petersen in late January. It's an amazing place--if you love rare and historic cars you'll be in heaven! The museum recently reopened following a $90 million renovation and the vehicles on display are beautifully lighted and staged. We enjoyed roaming around the three floors taking in all the eye candy. We also purchased a Vault tour, which takes you to the basement ""vault"" where many other rare and valuable vehicles are stored. Our tour guide, Jeff, made the vehicles' stories come alive and it was well worth the extra cost. We enjoyed a delicious lunch in the museum's Italian restaurant, Drago, and the food and service were excellent. All in all, a fabulous way to spend a day in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryAliceH_12
50,Love Cars? This is THE Place!,"Since my last visit several years ago the Petersen Automotive Museum undergone a major make-over. The outside is, well, interesting, but the inside is excellent. There are three floors with exhibits that cover both the technological aspects of cars, but the history, too. Expect to see examples of classic cars of both European and American origin, an AMBR (America's Most Beautiful Roadster) winners, and even motorcycles.The famous Cadzilla and the Hirohata Mercury are on display side by side. WOW!During my visit the was an excellent collection of Bugatti's on the first floor. Art, beauty, and $$$$$ all in one spot.A new Italian restaurant is situated off the lobby, and it is a good choice for lunch.A ""new"" feature is The Vault, a group of cars that not on the main display floors. Tours are available for an extra charge. I did not take that tour.The Petersen is a great place for the car nut, no matter if you are interested in the technical bits or the artistic aspect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerl53
40,The Vault was a little disappointing,"The main museum was good, spread across several floors each with a slightly different theme. Plenty of space so you could get a good look at the cars and just the right amount of reading material. The Vault was slightly disappointing for two reasons. Firstly I think we were expecting some future looking space filled with expensive supercars rather than an underground car park with a real mix. Secondly our tour guide was very focused on the engines and design as opposed to the history of the cars etc. For example, the most interesting car their for my family was Grease Lightning and the tour just walked past it. If you love cars and how they work it would be excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arcticcircle
50,Time well spent,My husband is a 'car guy' and this was a bucket list item for him that I also enjoyed more than I had expected. I would definitely add the 'vault' tour to your visit; the stories in the basement were fascinating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FormerHockeyMom
50,Nostalgia Plus,"Back to the Future, Batmobile, Herbie, Magnum PI, International Harvester Scout, the Great Gatsby and Maserati, 64 Chevy (all chromed) all in one place.Don't forget the Bugattis. I've driven by a few times, not sure why I didn't visit, but clearly a must see museum in Los Angeles. There is the general admission which we visited, and also a separate tour of the vault which I will have to do another time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mntraveler35
50,New house,"We've been here a few times but this was the first time in the revamped building. The nostalgia value of the museum has gone, but in it's place is a wonderful collection of cars from all over the world. The silver room blew me away and was the highlight of the museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/477nickn

40,Interesting tour and great automobile collection but,They simply charge too much. The Nethercutt Collection provides a superior collection and tour at no cost.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theOySters
50,Private Party for our Company.,Museum closed for the night. My Boss & the whole Company had it all for themselves. It's true that Rusnak had 17 dealers back then maybe more today. But this was just for one of them in the one I worked for in my last 31 years of my 41 years with Chrysler. Done in November of ((1997 not 2016)). It was special in seeing the impossible collection of so many different cars from all era's. We were all free to walk around and explore every little corner. But always someone near by to help and answer any of our dumb questions. This was a very formal attire so I had to ware my only tux. Everyone looked so elegant to blend in that same setting as we all arrived waiting for our tummy's to be filled. Rusnak always went first class in all that he did. So the dinner was in his same style. It must have been a beautiful catered affair I don't think they had a kitchen like that. We all enjoyed the dinner and when done were free to make another stroll before departing for home. You may not get a dinner like this of even a free pass to enter but this is really a must see at any price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaduckcoin

40,Very enjoyable,"I'm not a car enthusiast per se but I do love beautiful design so I decided to join the boss on a visit to the Petersen. We bought the Vault Tour as well as the regular ticket. So glad we did. We had a fabulous, knowledgeable and passionate tour guide, which made the Vault Tour really memorable. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ESB-UK
40,"Work of art, beautiful cars","The museum is a work of art, both inside and out. The outside of the museum is very distinctive so you know you've arrived without any question. The inside display of cars, videos, and exhibits are very tastefully done and definitely leaves you wanting more.I am not the car enthusiast that my husband is, and I have been to more car shows that I personally care for. That said, I would highly recommend visiting the museum. The cars that are displayed are works of art, and the memorability vehicles bring back great childhood memories.There is also a portion called The Vault you can visit downstairs that is escorted with a very knowledgable guide. If you want to go into The Vault, it is an extra charge and you need to make reservations. I would also recommend you BRING A JACKET if you take this tour. It is cold! The cars that are down there are very rare and can be one of a kind in some cases.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunlady56
50,Nicely done!,"This is the third car museum I've visited and nicely designed. Easy to get through without losing interest, very well edited. Highly recommend doing the additional Vault tour which takes you through storage in the basement. Impressive collection of Bugatti cars! Get there early for a tour as you'll want to allow an additional 2 or so hours to do the rest of the museum. Note you can get lunch there as well. Parking is easy and an additional $12. Great gift store too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzyl275
50,Cool museum,"It rained very heavily our first day in Los Angeles, and when I googled rainy-day activities, this was one of the first museums that came up. My car-loving husband loved it and probably took a hundred pictures. I don't care about cars, but I wasn't completely bored, and it was cool to see Herbie and the Delorean, so it deserves five stars. Plus we were able to stay in the same parking to go to another museum since there's several close by, so that's handy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/44sabrinac
50,Cars? Yea...Cars!!,"even if you are not a car buff, this is a great museum to check out. it is amazing. the collection is overwhelming but so cool. for car guys and girls, its a huge slice of heaven. stuff you def can not see anywhere else. its a must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gma0917
50,Los Angeles' Premiere Auto Museum,"The focus of this museum is ""the car."" There is the French Auto Room, there's the racing car room, there's the high-end silver car room, there seems to be a room for every thing. Which left me wandering a bit. I did LOVE what I saw but categorizing what I saw is a challenge.The admission for seniors as $12, very reasonable but I also took the Special Tour. The Special Tour takes you to the basement store room, the cars there are just magnificent. I didn't enjoy the guide commentary, I'm not into which celebrity owned which car or what movie this car was in... but that's just me. Everyone else seemed entertained.What can I say, it is a ""must see"" museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wind-In-His-Hair
50,What a Great Collection,I have always wanted to visit the Peterson Automotive Museum and I recently had my chance. This is a great collection of cars through the ages with many prototypes and originals. There is a play area for small children and several rooms where information on the collections can be obtained. If you are a car enthusiast this is the place for you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CurtK815

50,Great museum,"The Peterson car museum is a great day out for any car enthusiast. The kids loved looking at all the cars on display. The interactive displays were not only educational they were fun and really entertained the kids and started them thinking about some basic mechanics principles.There are a huge variety of cars on display, we only did the basic tour which was amazing, for an additional fee there is another area you can visit with additional rare cars - not sure what was on display here but the basic tour was more than adequate for us and good value for money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoubleExpresso
50,Awesome classic cars,"I didn't care much about cars, but a friend told me to visit anyway. I did and came away with a wonderful experience. The beauty, the chrome, the classic dashboards and steering wheels, just to name a few were great to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larryk491
50,Amazing Place!,"My wife and I were looking for something indoors to do while visiting LA on a rare rainy day. We have done all of the usual museums before and were looking for something different, so settled on the Petersen Auto Museum. It was impressive. The building itself is very cool, having just undergone a renovation and the contents were very cool too. I really liked the different motifs in each room - Hollywood cars, motorcycles, race cars, and vintage cars. We didn't have the chance to go to the Drago Ristorante onsite, but the menu looked very good. Also, it is very close to other museums - LACMA and La Brea Tar Pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P3699BNfrankm
50,Stunning Museum!,"I'm a car lover, but you certainly don't need to be to enjoy this amazing museum. After a complete renovation, this place is ABSOLUTELY STUNNING! The collection is stellar and the space itself is gorgeous. Be sure to get a Vault ticket for a guided tour of the overflow collection in the basement. It's made up of cars that have been rotated off the floor, privately owned vehicles and ones that are on loan but aren't on the floor. (You cannot take ANY pictures in the basement, but can take plenty in the museum.) It's probably best to buy a ticket in advance online, but if you show up at 10AM when it opens, you can easily get into the 10:30 tour. The docents do an amazing job of explaining all of the stories behind most of the cars and are very entertaining.While I was there, the featured marque was Bugatti and it was AMAZING!The exterior of the museum is equally stunning, so be sure to cross the street and take in the view..especially at sunset, when the stainless steel absorbs and reflects the setting sun colors.Do NOT miss this museum while in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HockeyChef
50,Art on Wheels,"This is a must for any car lover. Located in downtown LA is one amazing auto museums anywhere. You can view everything the first practical car, celebrity rides, cars from cinema, electric and fuel efficient, classic racers, some gorgeous 50s and 60s sculpted beauties and a impressive Bugatti set up. I personally really fell in love with the Precious Metals display. A room full of all silver stunners from a Porsche 356 to a Ferrari 250 SWB. The Bugatti collection was also full of information and some spectacular automobiles. A real bargain at $15 pp for the standard tour extra for the vault tour. We only had about 4 hours so we had to pass on the vault. I will definitely do it next time. I think there will be a next time because my wife really enjoyed it too. There is also a fee to park. The first 30 minutes are free after that it's $12. Still a good bargain for a great museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1mohman
50,Incredible homage to the automobile,"Even for a non car enthusiast, this is a must see while in L.A.The sheer volume and diversity of cars is incredible. They have an entire floor dedicated to Bugatti!The collection of cars from famous movies such as Back to the Future and the Batman movies is spectacular.Even, something as mundane as the physical building itself is a work of art.While I did not eat at the restaurant, the menu was very appealing and the food looked really good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/786linusv

This is a great place to spend an afternoon and take in the history of the automobile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PilotMichael
40,Solid Auto Museum,"Being a fan of Jay Leno I had to come here after seeing it feature on his videos. I found it a very interesting museum but if like me you have been to a few then it won't blow you away. The permanent exhibition is good with some great cars and interesting information but if your looking for a place to drool over some of the finest cars ever then this isn't the place. Yes there are some stunning, rare cars but there are finer collections. What was great was that they have shown the automobiles involvement in things from cinema to war and all things in between.The additional value Tour is worth the money. The cars down there are great and the tour guide was top quality. For me it's the best thing about a visit to the Petersen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LifeAsABackpacker

50,The Petersen is Amazing,"This was our first visit, certainly won't be our last. What an amazing place, haven of automotive wonders of beautiful and creative designs, fantastic visions, colors, contours and amazing back stories. Bugatti's rock, horseless carriages fly and all is a symphony of ingenuity. Inspiring and beautiful. The Petersen is more artistic than most art museums, truly a collection of rolling sculpture. Cars and their history for the ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aresverde

50,Amazing and historic,The Petersen Auto Museum was quite interesting. We took the vault tour and then spent another hour or so walking around the rest of the museum. My 3 teenage kids really enjoyed it from the awesome sports cars to the older historic cars. Enjoyable afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/323kristenh
40,Cars as art,"This museum is extremely expensive. Not only does it cost a lot for admission, but we were forced to pay $12 for parking for only a few hours. You have to do the optional garage door because most of the great cars are in the basement. I can't believe they have one of the surviving Tuckers in the basement and not on display in the main museum.Yes there are some great cars in the main museum. These are phenomenal works of art. The cars are displayed as works of art as opposed to lined up next to each other as a normal car museums. The museum is very airy and exhibits are far apart. They do have super cars and some motorcycles.As a car nut I would've liked to see more cars and more information on each car. The most popular area is the movie cars. I found the Nethercut collection to be 10 times more enjoyable- and it is free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outdoorpartner

50,Great museum for car enthusiasts,"My uncle booked a half day at Petersen Museum during the launching of the new Lamborghini Centenario. My fiance' loves cars and I guess this visit was the highlight of our entire trip. There were a lot of really nice cars, some were vintage, some were even donated by certain high-society families. You might want to catch their version of Cars and Coffee where car enthusiasts showcase their luxury/supercars at the rooftop of the parking building. Although we're not sure if schedule is fixed and how often do they have it but it's best to call the museum or get info online. Nonetheless, this is a must-see for car lovers, historians, families, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cv0612

The Bugatti exhibit was great too, not just cars but also some beautiful furniture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GUYT992
50,Well worth the detour,"Husband is a car enthusiast so this was an obligatory stop in LA. Well worth the time, the Bugatti exhibit is fantastic and so is the room of silver cars. The 90 min vault tour is well worth the extra money as it has some amazing unique cars that are part of history - some presidential cars, an unused Popemobile and lots of ancient cars. The new building is also beautiful. Definitely a must-see for car enthusiasts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaiAnhL
50,CAR DUDES MUST VISIT!,"I have not seen a better collection and exhibit of Automotive History & Technology. The Peterson has curated a fantastic variety of the Automobile from early examples to the latest technology. Pay for the premier package which let's you go in the basement to see more and exotic cars. The only thing I would hope for is for informed and gregarious attendants offer insight and informative banter on the various displays. Maybe a little more hands on/experiential would be good. The Forza attraction was cool. The Gift Shop was cool, but the t-shirts were way too expen$ive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisH527

50,BUGGATI BONANZA,"I am by no means an authority on the Bugatti, but after seeing this show I intend to become one. It's a trip into the past with an historical look at the Bugatti family who created these exceptional vehicles and also a wide variety of paintings and sculptures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/penelopem593
50,Great car museum!,Loved it. Great collection of cars. Well worth a visit. The building is amazing too. Great cars. Cars. Cars. Cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbatlanta
30,First Time for my 8 Year old,"Very nice exhibits/location, not a lot to see for the price. The staff was friendly and helpful but overall could expand or come down on admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarettad
50,Amazing visit to Petersen!,"This is a must see in Los Angeles! My husband and son are the auto enthusiasts, but my daughter and I loved this museum also. It is great for everyone. The history is outstanding - and the autos are the best in the world. We did the Vault tour and that is well worth the extra $$. Just be prepared to stand on your feet (on hard cement floors) for 90 minutes - and bring a jacket because it is cool in the basement vault. We LOVED it! Great tour guide and covered so much. We spent hours at this museum - you won't want to miss any of it. You can also walk to the Tar Pits from here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethK1704
30,Not really worth the money,"My son and I were in LA for the weekend and looking for some new things to do. We came across Peterson's and it looked really promising. It started out great when we were on the third floor with a great little collection of cars. But the other two floors were a bit of a disappointment. I expected more cars, a more divers collection, etc. My son also mentioned that he saw no muscle cars. I'm sure there may have been a more diverse collection in the basement, but based on what we saw and paid for, I wasn't going to give another $20. to find out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drsjones
40,Great car find,This is a great newly renovated museum and it was amazing. It was a nice find to see all the cars that are the masterpiece of art. It was much better than what I was expecting!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelMc1
50,Much better than I expected,"This newly renovated museum is terrific. It has a simple theme of tracing the history of the automobile (and related vehicles such as motorcycles). The displays are ""roomy"" and modern. The collection is impressive. The building is easy to navigate -- you are directed to the top floor and work your way down to the main floor. The location is right in the heart of the museum district. Unlike many museums, this one does not have a cafe, but there are excellent food trucks located nearby one Wilshere Blvd. along the parking lot area of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorne29
10,Inept Staff and Poor Customer Service Reps and Problem Solvers,"I tried to buy two adult tickets, two tickets for my teenage niece and nephew and for my mother on line. It would not accept the Triple A discount on line. I personally went to the Petersen on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving to buy five tickets for Black Friday.Instead the inept customer service rep sold us tickets for Wednesday only. When we got there, they would not honour the tickets that I purchased for my family. We HAD to buy tickets for the second time. The people that answer the phones have no phone etiquette and transfer to the wrong person. I will NOT leave a phone message due to Petersen's checkered history of returning phone calls.Kurtis Anderson has a severe deficiency in returning phone calls and solving problems in a timely manner. Kurtis is the manager. It took two weeks and about 30+ phone calls before my mother was reimbursed. Kurtis then writes a cold robotic apology, gives me two free tickets and two booklets that arrived creased due to his ineptness to use a padded envelope.The whole staff needs a complete customer service classroom lecture by me on phone etiquette, being professional, transferring phone calls and wording things correctly.The cars were wonderful and unique and one of a kind. I enjoyed the cars at the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baseballcardassassin
50,Awsome,"If your heart beats only one more for the beauty as usual,this is your place!

50,Incredible experience for the car nut or novice.,"Beautifully laid out facility. If you want to do the vault tour, allow a minimum of three hours to see everything.

Our family of four loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hava2612

50,The Finest Automobile Museum in the World,"They keep repeating at every opportunity that they're the best car museum in the world. Well, quite simply, they are. The building was completely renovated in 2015 into a modern museum space that would be the envy of any modern art museum. The collection is breathtaking and you own it to yourself to take the Vault tour I'd you have any interest in cars at all. This isn't just the best car museum. It's one of the best museums of any subject anywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reubenclamzo
50,Wow!,"Amazing collection of cars! There's something for everyone there. Motorcycles, movie cars, hybrids, super cars, hot rods... amazing collection! We did the valut tour. Extra money but totally worth it. So many gems in this collection!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/styxfanerin

40,A Petrolhead's Delight,"A huge variety of different cars from different eras. Some original Vintage Cars, some look-alikes (Used in Movies) and some newer ones too. Too bad I did not get chance to take a Tour of the Vault. One floor almost all dedicated to Bugatti with Bugatti Veyron and Chiron both kept on display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tejasghongadi
40,good,"Located on Wilshire Boulevard along Museum Row, and being one of the world's largest automotive museums, it has a huge collection of historical events of automotive. The Petersen Automotive Museum is a syndicate popular for its educational programs and automobiles. The museum is new-fangled with rich exhibits of all kinds of autos, motorcycles, race cars and movie cars.

50,Lovely remodel!,"First time back since the remodel. Wow... the museum really looks nice. This is one of the most spectacular auto museums in the world. Inside you will find a very interesting array of cars from all genres. Plan on spending three (+) hours to do it correctly. Hint: DO spend the extra and get the ""Vault Tour"". They take you to the basement to see many vehicles that are not on public display. My favorite was Steve McQueen's Jaguar XKSS. Another hint: the gift shop is dangerous to the health of your wallet!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheGfos
50,Amazing,"I'm not really a fan of cars, but I found this museum amazing ! So much dedication to set this all up, you can feel it in every spot !The staff is very polite and courteous.Admission is only 15$ per adult and totally worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taniamanco

50,for Car Nuts,"A wonderful place to take the children and grandkids. Here you can learn much about our love of cars, and see many of the iconic models. Its also very close to the LA Art Museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leidenaar
50,Amazing amazing museum!,"As a car lover I absolutely loved this museum! I was told that they have a circulation between Bugatti, Ferrari, Aston Martins etc on the first floor display and when I got there it was the Bugatti s on display. Their collection is simply fantastic! There is no section that is boring and it is a great place to spend 2-3 hours in. I especially loved seeing the Batmobile and other cars used in movies and tv shows such as James Bond, Entourage and breaking bad. Absolutely a must visit for car lovers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dream597106
50,Not to be missed,Even if you're not a car person you would appreciate the beauty of the presentation of these classic and historic automobiles. The Bugatt exhibit is wonderful. A restaurant will open soon. Take a try at the simulated auto racing which is free. Except I got carsick driving it and had to stop. Entry fee for what you get is reasonable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brukar
50,Very enjoyable visit.,"Excellent museum with huge variety of cars. I visited with my daughter and even she enjoyed it.Spectacular building. Enjoyed the XBOX racing.Received a discount for being a RAA (South Australia) member.Parking was a little steep at first 1/2 free, then $12 after that.Highly recommended attraction in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Terry00seven
50,Stunning car collection,If you love cars this is the place to visit. The cars are simply displayed but lit to show their natural beauty. The vault tour is well worth it and the Bugatti exhibition is stunning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mark67debra
50,Spectacular museum!,A great way to learn about the car industry. Need at least two hours to absorb the information and view the cars on display. My favorite part was the Bugatti collection on the ground floor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/820lenkam
50,Wonderful museum.,"This is really a great museum of cars going back to the earliest models, and including some of the rarest vehicles of all time. Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q3963NXerikr
40,"Spectacular venue, incredible collection! Needs more iconic cars on display.","Simply put, a Petrolhead's dream come true!The museum has one of the finest collections of cars, from including a brilliant display of Bugattis while I was visiting. The venue itself is a work of art. Stunning building with exceptional lighting compliments the masterpieces.And then there is 'The Vault'! Housed in the basement of the building are an impressive collection of cars with their own contributions to history. From Elvis Presley's Detomaso Pantera to Saddam's Mercedes limo, it's definitely worth the 20 extra dollars for a 90 minute tour.What I found disappointing though was the lack of some of the world's more common, yet game-changing vehicles. Now, I understand that some of those vehicles are still roaming around on the streets, but to ignore a VW Bug's place in automotive history, a Willy's Jeep, American muscle cars, a Citroen 2CV etc. in a place like this is truly disappointing. You simply cannot have a museum and not display such icons of automotive design.Having said that, I wouldn't miss the opportunity to visit the place if you are a car lover. Truly pleasant experience. A must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frad2013
50,Museum supreme,"This is one of the museums you must visit before you die. The variety of cars on display is astounding, and they have a good handful of the classic Hollywood cars as well. All they need now are the Mad Max vehicles, and they'll be complete.This building is very well maintained, and very fun to be in even if you're not all that interested in cars. They also have a Disney/Pixar's Cars thing on the second floor, which is fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameygamer
50,A very entertaining collection - celebrating the beauty of cars,"Except for the insane park situation due to subway construction in the area, this museum is well worth a visit if you are into muscle or at least specialty cars. The collection clearly has no intend of ""completeness"" of any kind - just of displaying beauty and fun.I had a good afternoon there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ullrich0815
40,Good place to visit.,The cars were all in excellent condition. Would like to have seen more American makes. Very clean facility. Gift shop on the expensive side. They did advertise parking is available. We were there for about 2 hours. Did not pay the extra for the vault.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindav388
50,Vroom your way here!,You do not have to be a car nut to enjoy this automotive museum. If the building does not grab you the cars inside will. A facility like this does not come cheap or around very often so if you are in the area you owe it to yourself at the very least to walk around the building. The exhibits are well lighted and the information is very readable. Kudos to the design team for providing a different way on presenting vehicles. It's not free but it is worth the price of admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loesshawk2015
50,First Visit,"A friend recommended the Petersen Automotive Museum, so we had to go & see for ourselves. What a place, the cars & bikes are well presented & displayed with plenty of room to move around, the Bugatti's on the ground floor are fantastic I have never seen so many beautiful cars. Highly Recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinkwebb
50,"Stunning, beautiful, rare","This is a first class museum~ so beautifully presented and laid out. The exterior of the building is what I imagine ""aerodynamic"" looks like! The exhibits are well spaced and documented, the cars are so well cared for and the museum flows well. We saw the Bugatti exhibit~ and WOW~ this exhibit is more than just the cars! It documents the family's history, untimely passing of 2 brilliant family members, and the immense creativity beyond cars. We splurged and took the vault tour~ JUST DO IT! Jeff was our docent in the vault, and his depth of knowledge, engaging manner and sense of humor made the tour that much more enjoyable. Wear comfortable shoes as all floors are concrete. In my opinion, this is good for children aged 12+.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BodhisattvaHand
40,excellent,"very good, lots to see and would visit again found all the exibits very good and very interesting, three floors of ecellence",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/856shaneo
40,A great upgrade!,I went to the upgraded Petersen and it was SO much better. A great selection of cars to look at and it is very clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiges88
50,Back to the Future A Car!!,Petersen was such a fun time. My fiance had looked up the museum and knew this was something that I would highly enjoy. She wasn't wrong. The cars are just beautiful. The top floor is dedicated to cars in tv shows and movies. Very cool!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaw237
50,Fun for the Whole Family,"Had a family outing here and everyone had a great time! Whether you are a car enthusiast or a novice, you will enjoy yourself! They had a great collection of vintage & modern cars. The most fun section is probably the one with the cars that were featured in movies/shows (Batman, Little Miss Sunshine, Entourage).Even though this place has VERY expensive cars and for the most part is a no-touch zone, they have a GREAT interactive area for kids. There is a life size Lightning McQueen and a room with books, arts & crafts, and hands on demo stations that teach kids how cars work. Nice gift shop. Garage parking. Bag check for large bags.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaD888
50,Hot wheels,"This is just a fun place for an car enthusiast. The first floor is for artsy car stuff. The second floor is for the car engineering. But I loved the motorcycles. The third floor is my favorite,which is about car history in Southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiritwheels
20,Disappointed with the new museum,"I guess I am no longer the type of person that Peterson is looking to cater to. I have been to the old Peterson many times and loved it. (I especially liked the recreated L.A. street scenes, Bulldog café in particular) I recently took my daughter there and the place has become an art museum that happens to feature cars. While I love cars, this place portrays them in a bland, antiseptic way and not the approachable way that Peterson used to. Lots of empty space, all done in a silver and gray backdrop with an obvious nod to corporate sponsors. (I am looking at you Disney and their Cars exhibit and Maserati with their crazy long and overly detailed discussion of the Quatroporte.) I was really looking forward to this museum re-opening and had made a point in going back to it whenever I was in town but I will not be returning. For me, Peterson's will only exist as a memory. Good luck with the new format but I hope that more people start to boycott this place, prompting a quick re-design.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cww207
50,Not just for car nuts,"A visit to Petersen's with my 14-year-old grandson -- a serious car nut, while I can't change a tire -- turned out to be an amazing experience for both of us. We toured the facility, and also went on the vault tour, which I highly recommend. (The kid went totally crazy over the ""Back to the Future"" DeLorean.) But for me, I had never really been in touch with what singular works of art the great cars of the 1920s - 1940s were, and found that one could process the Petersen's experience aesthetically and historically (Duesenberg, Stutz et. al. -- wow). I was really glad we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darthwill
30,Beautiful cars,"We had been there several years ago and loved it. Now it's like any other museum. It used to be a pathway that you walked along and time and cars progressed. Oh well, still worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janiceburch
40,"Great cars, expensive parking","I really liked this museum being a car guy. What struck me was the cost of admission being $15 which is very reasonable, but then charging $12 for parking (after the first 30 minutes). As if someone is going to stay for less than 30 minutes. I had done the research and knew going in that the total cost was going to be $27, but feel for the person that arrives thinking that the cost of the experience is only $15. I didn't see much if any on street parking. One positive about the parking. I was traveling on a motorcycle, new to Los Angeles and had all my gear on the bike. I had parked and was securing a few locks to the bike and was approached by a very nice person that I am assuming is a volunteer security person. He suggested that I park in another area more visible to the cameras and assured me that he would watch over my bike on his appointed rounds. I was impressed. I was in the museum for over 2 hours and had no issues with my motorcycle. Security was more than willing to hold my armored jacket,riding pants and back pack while I was in the museum. Overall a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottR71
50,Stunning collection of vehicles,"Absolutely gorgeous cars on display at the Petersen. The most beautiful being the Pontiac Aztek in olive green. I suspect that this vehicle may have encountered a respray or two in its life, and it just adds to it's sumptuousness. The car's design has been described as ""aggressive for the sake of being aggressive"" and ""atrocious proportions wrapped in plastic body cladding,"" and ""looked like a station wagon stretched out by a car bomb."" But I think that's cruel. It's a wonderful example of modern vehicular design and should be applauded.The Bugattis are nice too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherry_black83
50,Everything in Perfect condition,"Recently remodeled, the Petersen museum is well thought out, interesting, well maintained, and a great example of what a car museum would want to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdBannister
50,boy trip,"Came down to LA with the family and decided to split a girl's day and boy's day, me and my son had a blast! So many cool cars! My son was so impressed with all the cool cars her saw, I was cool dad of the year!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TThornton80
50,Nice cars,"We booked online general admission as well as a tour of the vault. As the displays change regularly, there are always new items. The vault tour was the best part although we were caught in a fire emergency (false alarm). Not confident either the docent or the security guard would have been much help if the situation was really critical. Too bad the Bugatti exhibit wasn't ready as those cars were definitely the primo show pieces. Parking is a typical LA ripoff - the first 30 minutes are ""free"" but it's $12 for an additional 5 minutes or 5 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCS_TX
50,Petersen's Been Completely Renovated,"The Petersen is the premier auto museum in LA. It was closed for a long time while it reinvented itself with a complete makeover. There is a entrance fee for viewing the museum ($15 I believe), and it costs $35 to take in the 1 1/2 hour tour of their basement garage full of not-on-display vehicles. We just viewed the lobby area, where there are actually a number of interesting cars on display (for free).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebelVirginia
50,Wowzers!,"This place was amazing! I went with a true car aficionado, and I think his tongue was dragging the entire visit! Even the way the displays are arranged and constantly rotating is a work of art. My favorite was the silver room, which I understand will be transformed into a red room in the future. I also liked the Hollywood Movie cars - from Back to the Future to Thelma and Louise. We also did the vault tour – and just a word of warning, it is looong. There is no sitting during this time, and the concrete floors get hard, so wear real comfortable shoes. Prior to the vault tour, we had about 45 minutes and breezed through the upper levels. The guides are walking encyclopedias of detailed car information – how they store so much minutia is beyond me. Admission is $15 and the vault tour is an extra $20. You sure get your money’s worth!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuePete
50,car culture city,"i nov the Peterson and have been going for over 10 years. LA is a car culture kind of town. You are what you drive. This museum has amazing cars from films and TV shows, in addition to amazing low riders and sports cars. Sexy and fun, but also something the kids can enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/834reggiec
50,Amazing collection,"The Bugatti collection is simply amazing. The various collections on the second and third floors were also splendid. If you have time then do the ""Vault"" tour to see the cars that cannot fit upstairs and some likely to never appear upstairs (like some of the nastiest world's dictators cars)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ADKtraveller
50,Allow yourself plenty of time!,A museum of the highest standard. I thought my wife and I will would spend a couple of hours there. We ended up spending four hours there. The volunteers are helpfull and friendly. The standard of displays is excellent and varied. Next time I intend to take the Vault Tour. Such an intersting place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woodworkerMelbourne

50,Works of art,My friend is a car buff. Wanted to do something cool for him and choose the Petersen Museum. While I am not a car dude I was taken away by these cars. Literally works of art. After visiting this museum I morn the passing of some incredible car companies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/579JohnG579
50,Automotive Porn!!,If you love all things automotive then this is heaven! This has the most impressive collection of cars I've ever seen. It's laid out like an art exhibition and shows off the vehicles as such. We loved it!If you have young kids with you there are interactive displays and workshops for them to take part in. I thoroughly recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markybritt
50,If You Love Cars -- Place to Go,Had a company social there and there are many types and classes of cars and motorcycles to see -- three stories of automobiles from the old to those used in movies. Cool place to go if you love cars and easy to get around. Place will take approx. 2-hours to see everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FoxTravelers
50,Excellence in auto presentation.,My first visit since the remodelling and expected to be underwhelmed but happy to say the refurbishment was money well spent.Many integrative media displays on 3 display floors. Many USB and inductive pads for charging cell phones. A new section has been added highlighting alternative fuels and the history.There is a large supervised kids section. Take the vault tour for an informative docent to take you through the unseen collection.The store was disappointing but doesn't detract from an excellent auto museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuckyPhil21C

Not only can you look at the cars but go into a room you can video race cars and another room of how to design cars. There are three floors that are full of wonders!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yolidog
50,Very cool car museum,"Went here with a friend. We are both car enthusiast, but not grease monkeys. Spent a few hours going through the place. They have a general admission price or for a little more money you get the vault tour. It took about 90 minutes. They bring a small group to their basement area where you can view a selection of cars that are not on display upstairs. It was worth it. I only wish the museum was bigger so they could display all the vehicles they have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonP550
50,Something for Everyone,"My husband is a car nut but the kids run out of attention span very quickly. Petersen Museum has revamped their kids play space, staffed it with friendly, engaging staff and created an exceptional place to visit. The cars are endlessly amazing - even the Batmobile and Batbike were there - satisfying car buffs and the remodeled space in stunning.A great choice for all",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/396amandah
50,Brilliant,"Loved it. Equal to any other car collection in the World. Just saw the standard museum ticket offering but there is enough to keep you dazzled for 1-3 hours, depending how long you gaze longingly at exhibits. Car enthusiasts will love it. Bikers get a small display of 10mins viewing. But plenty of interest for non car nuts too.Shop is worth seeing (free before entry)Also free exhibits to view in foyer.Cameras welcome.We parked nearby as free (on Sat)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Desmovalve
30,"Wonderful cars, but sterile and no vibrancy such exciting subjects","Some beautiful cars, the like of which will never be seen again, such as the achingly extravagant Delhayes, An interesting museum, though thin on atmosphere. It needed some sort of vibrancy. In a few years we will all be driving electric cars, and generations will have forgotten the sound of the internl combustion engine in all its glory. Yet this museum has miised that essential aspect. Disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/683simonf
50,A must see.,"My husband is a car fanatic and LOVED this place but I think anyone can appreciate the beauty and pricelessness of this car collection. The new museum is immaculate and well staffed. We were at the old one years ago and it was also very nice so clearly there was an incentive to spend more $! There could be more of certain types of cars and less of others, but it really depends on what is made available by the donors and everything there was so darn well maintained. We didn't have time for the vault tour, but a must next time in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MandDplus2

50,Wow,"I'm not a car fan at all, yet I found this museum very interesting! The architecture on the outside of the building and the ambiance of the exhibit was gorgeous. I could have just looked at the outside all day. (Certainly was gorgeous enough to buy a postcard for the fridge.) There was enough in there for a non-car-lover to keep me occupied.

40,Recommend the guided tour as well,"A beautiful building housing beautiful and very expensive cars. From the horse drawn buggy to the Bat Mobile it's all there. My wife who isn't a car lover still enjoyed our visit. The museum's strengths are it's collection of stunning art deco cars. It's weakness would be a severe lack of muscle cars and Japanese import cars. Nonetheless it was a wonderful experience. The guided tour of the ""Vault"" has some unique one of a kind pieces including the vehicle Bobby Kennedy sat in just before he was assassinated as well as a Pope mobile. The tour does a wonderful job of connecting larger historical events to it's automobile collection. Overall tickets are a bit on the pricey side as well, but if you're a gearhead it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933kennyl
50,Great Exhibit!,Took a group of high school kids for a project. We were sponsored by the Rotary Club. One of the Rotarians knew the owner and so we were treated to a special tour. The kids loved it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PLO528
50,If you're into cars this is a must,"Classics from long ago, customs from then to now, beautiful French masterpieces and radical hot rods...they're all here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cliffe665
50,Simply awesome and not just for car lovers!,"This Museum is simply awesome! I loved everything about it, particularly seeing those cars used in movies. Unfortunately the restaurant wasn't yet finished but I am sure that it will equal the quality and style of the Museum. Well done guys!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJG27
50,Collection Worth Seeing,The museum was great and had automotive and motorcycles of all varieties to see. It was a great collection you cant find anywhere else at one time. The vault is an experience in itself for the vehicles they have to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BH1000RR
50,A must for all automobile lovers,"The museum is very easy to reach and the cars there... The cars...Highly recommended for every one, also with children",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adibrand
40,"Great Classic Cars, but very few hot rods","As a life-long hot rodder and reader of Hot Rod magazine, I was very excited to travel from Colorado to LA to visit the Peterson Automotive Museum in September. I didn't realize that as part of their recent remodel, they changed the focus from historical hot rods to expensive and rare classic cars from around the world. I was really disappointed that most of the historical hot rods were no longer there, although it was great to see the Hirohata Merc and Doane Spencer's deuce, plus a few other famous hot rods. We also took the ""Vault"" tour; what we didn't realize until we'd paid that additional fee and the tour had begun was that you cannot take photos in the vault, for some reason. Overall, the museum is well worth seeing, there's just not a focus on hot rodding like I expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DenverFlash34
40,"Fantastic, interactive museum - but quite greedy too ;)","Amazing building snowcasing some of the worlds most wonderful treasures if you are a car-lover. We had a chance to watch an interesting introductory film (history of cars) on the top floor, but were interrupted by a guard saying we need to leave as the museum closes 6pm. Should have checked the opening times before paying 15$ per head for entrance! Museum shop downstairs stayed open for a good hour after the museum closed :DI would recommend to either remind late arriving visitors about the opening times, reduce the entrance price for the last two hours or extend the late visitor ticket to a re-visit for the following day.It would be easy to spend a day in this fantastic place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minikai

40,Museum and Vault Tour,"Husband and I did the museum and the vault tour. For 2 it cost about $70. We saw batman car, magnum pi's car, delorian from back to the future, and other cool cars. I would say you need 1-2 hours for museum and then the vault tour is about 90 min-2 hours. They take you down the basement and go car by car and tell you about them. Husband liked it. I thought just so so. There is no where sit and 90 minutes or more of standing on concrete in sandles makes the feet kinda hurt. All said and done... saw some interesting cars and husband was happy. The following day we checked out the other Car Museum in LA outskirts and hubby liked it better... first of all it was free and secondly was just bit more exciting to visit. Overall though... some cars are at one and not the other.... so it just depends on what car you want to see...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kariensean
50,Classic Autos LA,"Awesome. Old classic cars from Back to the future, Batman car and cycle. Steve McQEEN motorcycle. A must see for classic car enthusiasts. 3 or 4 floors of cars and technology. Review website. Military present ID card for reduced price. Probably spend a couple of hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrentF337
40,Wonderful collection - a few lessons learned for next visit,"This was my first visit to Petersen. I've read about it being a great collection, and wasn't disappointed. You have a variety of small collections of different types in a very interesting portfolio: beautiful cars as art, hot rods, racing cars, hollywood cars, history of EV. All presented in a very high end modern museum style. My lessons learned: (1) plan time for and pay-up for the vault guided tour - sorry I missed that (2) great stuff for kids - the room that shows how engines and such work, the piece by piece build of a maserati (3) I'd plan 3-4 hour including the vault tour.Only reason not 5 stars: no audio or guided tour of main floors, or materials with details on the cars to learn. Cafe wasn't open - which I'd check before devoting 4 hours to the place.Overall fun if you love a wide variety of automobiles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCHKCA
50,The ultimate car lovers tabernacle.,"While I loved the Bugatti's and the multi million dollar cars in the upper floors, the real stuff is in the basement tour. Make sure you get the upgrade and enjoy the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinwK8892NE
50,fanastic museum with a diverse collection,"My son loves cars, so we made a trip to this museum. I've been to other auto museums, but none like this. It's collection is world class, and unlike other world class auto museums, it's collection spans many different areas types of cars and also many different manufactures.I highly recommend the ""Vault"" tour. It's extra, but well worth it! Cars not on display upstairs and interesting guided tour with history and facts. I really enjoyed it.We came early on a day they had their ""Breakfast Club"" drive-in, where people bring their personal cars to display. We had a free breakfast and enjoyed seeing everything from old Jags to Ferraris.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KochelSee
50,Brilliant!!,By far the best car museum we have visited!! The cars on show were fantastic and the lighting was great for photography. A must for car enthusiasts travelling to the USA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterbEdgewater
50,SPECTACULAR COLLECTION OF ROLLING PIECES OF ART,What a great place to spend a few hours looking at some of the most beautiful and facinating cars every produced. Their collection offers different ranges of cars from the the more modern to the first ever made. A great place for the entire family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckyus1949
50,More sports cars than most auto museums,This collection has more sports cars and concept cars than museums like the Nethercutt. One interesting car is one of Steve McQueens favorite Jauguar racing cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rwhames
30,There are not enough cars in display!,"The building is an embarrassment after the second attempt from the Petersen Organisation to sign up for its 90 Million redo. What you get for that is a red painted metal cladding not that well applied, that doesn't even turn around the building, overlaid by giant Stainless curbed that are expressing going too fast resulting in a building crash. The interiors are uninspiring plain- Jane white drywall with the same metal cladding but in grey, under blueish artificial lighting. Nothing to dream about but the last gallery on the first floor, that display the best in between the war cars. The Delahayes, the Delages, the Bugattis and Hispano Suizas are magnificent examples of the finest in automative design. The second floor has a gallery where all the car presented are painted Metallic Silver it is a strong and welcome effect under the blue casting recessed lights. I particularly like to see Art Center College of Design represented and interacting with the visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VBCJJ
50,A must for any car enthusiast!,"Fantastic selection of classic and sportscars in great surroundings! We went on a Friday and practically had the place to ourselves.

50,For the love of cars!,"You are bound to start with a Wow! The majestic Rolls Royce at the entrance. And seeming counterpointed McLaren F1. Watch your face in the mirror.

50,Impressive!,"Well worth the visit for auto and non-auto enthusiasts. Great collection of vehicles and motorcycles. Well-displayed exhibit, areas comfortable to walk and view exhibits.

50,Even if you're not into cars it's a great place to visit (vault tour is a MUST),Got dragged here by my other half who loves cars & as someone who's not that interested it was a great way to spend a few hours whilst visiting LA. The vault tour is an absolute MUST do! They have so many interesting cars both beautiful but also of great historical interest. Don't miss. BTW the parking is a little pricey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janet2801
40,Sparkling collection,Surely the cleanest car museum ever! Fantastic collection of cars and a chance to driver a Maserati. Some great cars from the movies too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaB2714
50,A car enthusiast's heaven...,I had gone to the Petersen years ago and wanted to see what's changed since their recent makeover. I was not disappointed! I did make the mistake of going in reverse...they encourage you to begin your tour on the third floor. I started on the first. I also highly recommend taking The Vault tour. It's worth the extra amount. Be sure to give yourself at least 2 hours (plus another 90 minutes for The Vault) in order to appreciate everything that's there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/469MarkN
40,"Great, but you must do the Vault Tour!","I enjoy auto museums and I'd never been to this one. I was on vacation and went specifically to see the 3 BMW Art Cars they have on display. But I also decided to do the Vault Tour for an additional fee. I'm glad I did - for me at least the most interesting cars were in the Vault (really it's just the bssement). They are not put out in displays, they are basically just parked/stored, but the knowledge and associated stories of the guide (you must be accompanied and there's no photos) make the whole 1.5 hours fly by. Theach rest of the museum is well done, but the Vault Tour is thoroughly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keitho353
20,Dissapointed!,Visited a few years ago and sw many old cars. They were gone at this visit; only custom cars on display.. Parking was overpriced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosieb482015

50,Fantastic Car Display,"From parking my car in the car park, till leaving the museum, the experience was nothing short of awesome. The layout of the three levels of the exhibition flowed smoothly from the earliest of cars to concept ideas of the future. Even the interactive area for kids was well laid out and informative. The staff were great.I would strongly recommend visiting Petersen's if you're a car enthusiast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/normane362
40,Nice Automobiles,We saw so many classic cars. We were members for many years. They change he selection of cars. Always fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annecantravel
50,Amazing. Great tour.,The Petersen is actually much more educational than I thought it would be. Expected just to look at cars but not the case. Each floor explains just about anything you need to know about the history of autos. One floor shows cars used in movies. My favorite floor was actually the first with all the old beautiful vintage autos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flhappy
40,Surprisingly Fun Afternoon.,"My husband and I trade off choosing venues, and our rule is""No matter the choice, the other person is to go no questions asked"". His recent ""choice"" was the Petersen, so I tagged along. He went all the way- Vault and all, while I opted for the general admission floors only. He was ecstatic over the Vault tour- raved about it for days! And I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the general exhibits. Many of the cars were stunning, and reading their histories was fascinating. The Museum's recent remodel is very well done- a pleasant way to spend the afternoon, even if you're not a car nut (it was also a fun people watching place too).The gift shop is quite nice- we actually started our holiday shopping early as we found several unique items there. The one complaint I had was it would have been nice to have a decent place to grab lunch/snack. There is a ""penthouse"" floor where there are minimal vending machine-type items, and when the food trucks are outside (which they were not the Wednesday we were there as the LACMA across the street was closed) that could have been an option, but the place deserves something nicer for those spending the well deserved several hours there.Definitely recommend tho and plan to return- even just to shop in the gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/576maryanns
50,Vault Tour - Best Part of the Visit,"Fun car museum. You don't have to be a gearhead or grease monkey to enjoy this museum. More of a history and cars museum than a pure car museum.i was expecting lots of Corvettes, T-Birds, Camaros, Mustangs, and concept cars, but that is not what I found. The museum is organized into exhibits - one exhibit featured Delahayes, Delages, and other elegant cars of that ERA. Another featured silver cars; and another exhibit about evolving automotive technology featuring several iterations of a Tesla S - drivetrain & chassis, interior, fully built car; another exhibit featured racing Porsches.But hands down, the best part of the visit was the Vault Guided Tour. Yes, it costs a further $20, but it was well worth the price. Great, great guide (thank you Jeff). He had so much historical knowledge - of the early automotive industry, explaining, head-of-state cars (from several countries, including Russia). My 29-yo son and I were kept captivated.One suggestion: wear comfortable shoes. The floors are polished concrete. After a 4-hour visit, my feet were killing me.Prices - $15 for basic museum admission; additional $20 for vault tour; $12 for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/texas_forrest
40,The 'NEW' Peterson................,"Even though I live 3000 miles away I visit about once a year on my annual So Cal visits. This was my first visit to Peterson since the major remodel the museum performed. I loved the old Peterson. I had some friends cars featured there even.The 'new' Peterson is impressive to say the least. It is like a very high end fine art display you would find in any major city.The downside is the Peterson has lost all the charm of the old place. The old diorama displays were among my favorites and they are all gone. The best of the new was 'A Day at the races' display.The Peterson is new, very nice and different than the old.......but not better IMHO only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveVWV
50,Great every time!,"I have never been, but my husband and 2 sons go regularly and rave about it every time. They never get tired of it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Noneeg
50,Magnificent car collection,Went with wife and 8-year old grandson. The exhibit included the most beautiful cars ever made. How come 50-year old cars are nicer than the ones on the road today? Grandson's favorite was the Batmobile. And they had other cars that were featured on television shows and the movies (like the Delaurean from Back to the Future). For an extra $30 you can visit their storage area containing over 100 additional classical cars from yesterday--maybe I will go next time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelWacks
50,Beauty of the Beasts,"Wow...I purchased two tickets to treat my husband for a (Australian) Fathers Day surprise but the surprise was shared by me! What an amazing array of automobiles, from early 20th Century to modern day, and encompassing many famous vehicles from well-known movies.Allow at least 2 hours to roam around 3 levels at leisure, longer if you are a serious car fan.There are restrooms available but no cafeteria. However, a short walk up Wilshire as you turn right at the exit, you can enjoy a great lunch at LACMA, Los Angeles County Museum of Art.BEWARE - do not book through Trip Advisor! I paid $20 each for a 'skip the line' but even on a Monday Labor Day holiday, there was no line, and the reception staff were not even aware of it. Tickets at the desk are $15 each.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mercedes341
50,You'll Enjoy even if you're not A Car nut!,"Love the building. Love the exhibition space. I'm not a car nut by any stretch of the imagination...and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing all the cats and learning car history. The exhibit is on three floors and so many of the vehicles on display are ""art"". Have questions, ask the security guards. They should be the docents because they are so knowledgeable. Everyone is so friendly and willing to share info on history, value, quirks of the various vehicles on display. General admission is $15 for an adult. But you AAA card will get you a $2 discount. I recommend at least two hours to roam the galleries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
50,Great Museum,My husband and I are car people - we are drawn to this museum.... they have soooooo much to see - we loved it!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpR4816AS
50,Car Guy Heaven,With some thought you can see how each generation of cars lends itself to the next. Innovation abounds in this place as the contributions of Gearheads/Geniuses/Artists are depicted by this amazing collection of cars that mark history. Design takes precedence over what is under the hood at this place. The stories of the Vault cars are not to be missed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BroncoFan12
30,Worth seeing (once),"Lots of cars spread out over three differently themes floors provides a good way to spend an hour. Reasonable entry fee and good location support a trip there. Only negative is the rude and unfriendly ""security"" guards. Their attitudes are better suited for a state prison.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjd721
50,I Had the Opportunity to meet Chip Foose here and it was amazing...,"Okay so if you are an oil head, if you are a car guy and if you love great Automotive design then this is the place for you. I have got to tell you that when my girlfriend and myself came to this beautiful location last month to listen to and also meet the Great Chip Foose I was blown away by everything that I experienced that day. To meet the Master Mr. Foose was something so special for me and I am a huge fan of this mans work and of course of OVERHAULING. The talk that he gave was so inspiring and after listening to him and being able to walk the Museum floor and see the amazing vehicles and bikes... On thing that is for sure is that you will not be dissappointed in your visit to the amazing and BEAUTIFUL PETERSON AUTOMOTIVE MUSEUM....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/787kevinp
50,Amazing afternoon at the museum,"Ok so you'll tell me it's a car museum, and I'll say, YES, and it's awesome. Of course the collection is amazing, but the history pat is just as good. Some fantastic automobile you'll only see there, a beautiful building, and a great afternoon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phdedieu
50,"Superb museum, incredible building.","The Peterson was one of the highlights of our recent trip to Los Angeles. It is housed in an absolutely stunning building designed by xxx in the Miracle Mile museum district of Wilshire Boulevard. In a city full of absolutely packed attractions with endless lines we found it to be beautifully airy and relatively quiet at 10am on a Sunday morning in August. The museum is superbly laid out on three floors starting with the history of the automobile on floor 3. The cars sparkle in perfect condition and are well presented. There are classic one off editions from all the famous car manufacturers. The entrance fee is far more reasonable than any other attraction we visited in LA at $15 Adult, $10 Child. One more tip, we found by accident, parking is free on Sundays on the street immediately behind the museum which will save you $12 parking fee.There is an interactive area on floor 2 where we had an extremely knowledgable and informative explanation of how a car actually works from engine to gears to axles to wheels by Adam. There is also a Lightning McQueen replica and art table where younger kids can trace the Pixar star.On the same floor you can play Forza, unfortunately we found this to be staffed by the opposite kind of people to the excellent staff at the interactive zone. The young ladies in attendance that day were over officious, pushy and far too 'jobs-worth'. They managed to upset my middle son by refusing him a play, being 4ft 8.5” when the height restriction was 4ft 9”. We clearly showed them he could reach the pedals and there was no health and safety issue but they weren’t having it. They also abruptly pulled off our older son in the middle of his game due to time constraints when it was a quiet Sunday with only a handful of people waiting in line. A bit of a shame but we didn’t let it spoil our day.All in all massively recommend this gem of a museum. A must for car enthusiasts and great fun for kids and parents alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lawson2020
50,If your a car lover this is the place to go.,"Very enjoyable, if your a car buff or just like looking this is worth the trip. You can walk around by yourselves or take a 90 minute guided tour. We just walked around. This is something even your children would enjoy. Not very expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968elleng
50,"A hidden Gem in the city of Los Angeles, must visit for Car Buffs","What an amazing find this was in the busy and bustling city of Los Angeles. Petersen Automotive Museum was demolished in 2014 and the completely redesigned Petersen Automotive Museum was officially opened back again in 2015. The admission to this museum is just $20and you can visit the Vault at an additional fee of $20. But you are not allowed to carry camera and no photography is allowed during the Vault tour.Generally you start from the bottom level going upstairs, but here all 1st floor doors are locked from the outside because you are supposed to take elevators directly to the 3rd floor and move your way down to the 2nd & 1st floors.

50,Better than ever!!,"We had not been to the Petersen since its last re-do. My husband and I are both car buffs and I also have an interest in art - the two interests intersect beautifully at the Petersen. The exhibits are well ""curated"". Most car museums are more general line-ups of various cars with no theme or logic, but the Petersen presents the cars as part of thematic exhibits. The Mullin Gallery is automotive design as ""sculpture"" and is nearly as nice as seeing the Mullin Museum itself (in Oxnard). The BMW artist's cars in the next gallery are fascinating examples of what major artists (incl Warhol and Hockney) have done when using autos as part of their media. Even the movie car exhibit is a lot of fun - take a few minutes to watch the background video on the wall - nicely done. There is something here for everyone who has ever admired a car! (Also, the LACMA is just down the street one block if you want to do 2 museums in a day).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betterontheroad

50,Amazing museum but Vault tour the best,"Recommended by a local friend so went at 10:15 on a Wednesday morning. Was room on the 10:30 tour so we got our wristbands, looks around a bit and then headed downstairs with Andy out tour guide.90 minutes of amazing cars and stories down in the vault - was definitely the best part of our time there. After the tour we headed to floor 3 of the museum and worked out way down.Great display of cars and we loved the second floor showing the development of cars. Saw a couple of little girls with iPad type devices following along building cars. Seemed to have a couple of dedicated areas and interactive programs for younger kids.Gift shop had nice selection and 12 year old even wanted a shirt to remember his trip.Definitely worth a few hours - not sure what the museum looked like pre renovation but it is a beautiful space with the art of automobiles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tber
40,Great it you like cars,"Newly remodeled museum offers a sleek presentation of all sorts of cars, from early models of the 1910s to 2016 models from the US and around the world. Some motorcycles as well as some cars from TV and movies. It is $15 to enter the museum for adults; AAA members get a discount if you ask for it. There is a 90 minute guided tour of ""the vault"" with is $20 additional. We didn't check out the vault. I am not a car person but loved this museum before its remodel. Now it's fewer cars with less of a story to get hooked into. I think it's more for car lovers now. Perhaps the vault holds the best of it now. Take advantage of the $12 all day parking and go across the street to see the art and tar pits in the park for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socali123

50,Works of art!,"Let me say that I am not a car lover. To me the are just a means to an end, but I truly enjoyed my trip to this museum. It gave me a greater appreciation of the automobile not only as a type of transportation but as an art form. It was also a trip down memory lane viewing our childhood road trips. My family spanning three generations had a great time as well. I would recommend more cars that the tykes can sit in. It is hard to explain to a small child, look but don't touch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terryk2013
10,Bring a ladder!,"Completely underwhelmed. I visited this museum before its renovation and thought it was much better. It's especially terrible if you're short. Many of the cars are displayed on pedestals, which makes it very difficult to see the interiors of the cars if you're not tall. I'm 6 foot two so it was OK, but not ideal. My 22 yr old daughter who accompanied me is five foot two. She couldn't see the interiors of many of the cars, especially on the first floor, which was really disappointing. This museum seems to lack the coherence of storytelling that it had before the renovation. Many cool cars, but there are several free auto museums in LA like the Nethercutt that are better if you just want to see cars. Also, lots of relatively modern cars on display. Jeez, it's LA, I don't need to pay to go to a museum to see a modern Ferrari or McLaren. Then there is the display of cars with silly paint jobs. I mean, if it was historic car, like Janis Joplin's Porsche, then I could see it. But a new BMW that looks like a Middle School art project? Just not a fan, especially given the limited size of this museum. Saw the whole thing in 90 minutes. Best part was probably the race car simulation, which is just a glorified version of an XBox game. I didn't pay the extra $20 to see the vault, but then I've seen and driven lots of classic cars in my time. I'd go to the Nethercutt first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525BillS
50,Awesome!!!,"This place was truly awesome came here for the boys but i enjoyed it the most. There are absolutely beautiful cars from different eras. They have cars from different movies like little miss sunshine, batman, furious 7, entourage, etc.... Truly enjoyable to just look at the pieces. I would recommend it, it wouldn't take over an hour. Passed by after LACMA, it was the cherry on top!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fozb703
50,My kids loved this place!,"I can not say enough good stuff about this place. We were looking for a place to kill time while waiting for house to be ready for checkin, and found this place. Boy are we glad we did. My kids had so much fun here. Bat mobile, herbie, lightning mcQueen, etc etc. And lost of other cool, awesome stuff to look at. Oh, and air conditioned!! We are not really car people, but definitely a unique place to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PDXfam6
50,Amazing art,"This place is the home to so many pieces of automotive art, a certain must for any fans of cars, doing the guided tour od the vault is certainly a MUST",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yabbie67
50,something different,car lover or not...just interesting. lots of race. old. new. various models. the strange. the historical ...all in a modern bldg.def worth seeing just something a lil diff and odd. and for many the old cars from all decades will bring some type of memories. of a first car or grandma's car etc.great place where businesses have parties too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyW234
30,afternoon with Lightning McQueen,"I took my kid to the museum thinking they would enjoy seeing all the cars and the a new experience.. While it was a cool museum, filled with lots of old and unique cars, I found it a bit stressful to tour the museum with a very curious and handsy three-year-old. We ended up spending most the time in the kids room where they have a lightning McQueen exhibit. He really enjoyed that it was actually a lot of fun.He was able to get in for free on a school special but I had to pay admission. I found that the cost of admission was a bit high for the experience that we got.Would we go back? Maybe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAZADOR-CA
50,A Must see for any car lover.,"This is a must do, renovated museum is stunning. The Vault tour is well worth the extra cost. Shame you can't take photos there though. The excuse of "" security issues"" is not plausible. As I look back through my photos it would be good to have the vault memories too. This was the only down side though. The whole experience was superb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whare2016
50,A car guy's dream,I have been here twice for short visits in between other activities. It is a great place to drop into when you have a chance. Some of the displays are refreshed and I keep finding something I missed whenever I make another round through the exhibits. Don't miss a chance to wander through the Design Studio.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruceK488

50,Best Automotive Museum In California,"The Peterson Automotive Museum is a world class, top shelf, oh my gosh museum. The building is a work of art from the outside and the displays are works of art on the inside. There are incredible Concourse Quality Cars for the Connoisseur and scooter displays for other budgets. There is a children's area that will engage the little ones. There are TV show cars to stir up memories of sitcoms and movies. The video of the progress of other fueled cars during the last century was so comprehensive. The unique cars that are under this roof are amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleySays

50,Great museum in LA,"I went here as a joke, and was delighted with how fun it was. It really is one of the more interesting and fun museum experiences I've had in a long time. Even if you don't much care about cars this will be a fun way to spend a few hours. Lots of cool auto related stuff that I'd never really seen or thought about. Good for kids too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAOXON

40,Great collection of cars displayed in an impressive facility,Really fun and architecturally impressive car museum. They even have a racing simulator! Fun for an afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/argosyinc
50,Trip for our son,"My son is a 13 year old car fanatic and this was top of his list for must see in LA. It did not disappoint as it had loads of the detail and specs to keep him happy, but the cars were beautiful so Mum was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the visit too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/306mirandam
50,Absolute must do in Los Angeles,"Certainly a must do for any car lover, but anyone will enjoy this museum. It is an amazing collection of cars and they are spectacular. Cool, new fast cars, as well as remarkable old cars. Don't pass this up. You can spend 1 hour or 3; worth every minute.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbjlouky
50,Unbelievable place,"All four of us went and I wax worried the girls would be bored but think they had more fun than Dan and myself. This new building is incredible, three stories tall filled with cars that few humans will ever see, if you go to LA it's a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P4481LArobertf
50,Very Interesting,if you are really into cars and history this is the place to go too we had a great time at seeing all the cars!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I8972GGmelissam
50,Super COOL,My family visited this museum and it was one of the best car museum's we have ever been too! The kids went crazy over the cars from famous movies. We even got to do a simulated race together! Super cool place to visit and very clean. I noticed they had activities for the younger kids too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenangrignon
50,Must do for car fanatics!,"Centrally located and well appointed museum for car fans. Three full floors well curated with amazing displays. It takes about an hour or two to walk through the exhibits, so this museum can be combined with other area museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anitere
30,Dissapointed,"I read the reviews, and expected way more. We took the regular, and vault tours. Our guide was soft spoken and we couldnt hear what he was saying. Our group asked several questions and he could not answer. The cars in the vault/basement parking garage are parked next to each other very tight. You cannot walk between them, or around them. They have no information on them. You are relying on what the guide tells you. We went to see the Tucker Torpedo. Its valued at over 6 million. To our dissapointment it was just parked next to other cars. No information, nothing. If you didnt know the history, it just looks like another 40's cars. What a shame. They should at least have a information plaque on every car. $15 Admission and another $20 for the vault plus $12 to park. Here is a hint feed the parking meter on the sidewalk. Cost $1 per hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347ScottW
50,Awesome for car lovers!,"This museum was really neat. Loved all the old rolls Royce and classic cars in this museum. Also loved all the cars used in films, those were really cool to see in person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tkeenan1
50,A must visit with kids,"This brand new museum is a great adfition to the LA museum scene. Easy parking and access, this museum not only has an outstanding display of cars from all ages, but also extra area on the second level to introduce kids to the different functions of a car. Great exhibit to explain the concept of an engine, how brakes work etc. For older kids and adults the race simulation is a must! Will come again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dirk747
50,Not to be missed !,"We visited two weeks ago and i believe its only just reopened after a major reconstruction.The building is very modern and spacious and is quite unmissable from the street.When you enter you have the choice of visiting the main displays or you can pay a little more and also tour the Basement, the basement is a must as there are hundreds of vehicles stored in there that are either currently in storage or having maintenance or simply stored while they rotate the vehicles on display.Basement tours are limited so i would suggest getting there early so your not dissapointed.The basement was my main reason for visiting, you cannot take photos in the basement, but you are allowed to take photos in the main displays section.The cars are in pristine condition in a spotless building, it was simply excellent in every way.If your a car fanatic you will not be disappointed.There is something for all tastes in here, be it Movie cars, Famous cars Racing Cars, Historical vehicles, Hot Rods, Motor Cycles etc its just awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tony20002
30,If the interior is half as good as the exterior it should be great,"I did not get to visit this museum interior. However, I did want to drive by to see the exterior as it was listed as one of the top 10 architectural designs in LA. I will say the exterior which is across from the LACMA does get your attention. Again, if it is half as good on the inside as the outside, it should be a great visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
50,"If you drive a car, don't miss it!","I am not aware of any other place where one can see the number of rare and unique automobiles as you do at the Petersen. The building itself is awesome and the cars are not to be believed. A family will spend an hour or so there. If you go with just ""car people"" you may spend the entire day. Great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F4691RBgregc
40,Wow. Just Wow,"I love this place! I am a car enthusiast and this was heaven. I especially enjoyed the racing sims and the Back to The Future Car and the Bat-Mobile. Since the renovation everything has changed and it's amazing. Come here solo, with friends, partners, or family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/619isaach
50,I never visited the old one but this one is awesome,"A museum full of vehicles with historical significance? Count me in!!! I never visited the old museum before the remodel. I still think this place looks very modern. They have various cars from racing, luxury, concept. They also have motorcycles (Indians and Harleys).I know we cant do this but I wish I can sit in each car cause it looks so awesome to ride in one. Great picture opportunities with all the cars. Its a must for any car enthusiast",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chainsawmadman
50,Awesome!,"Was at the old Peterson museum several years ago and was simply awe struck by the new museum. If you are a car buff it's simply a must see. The exhibits and collections are breathtaking. We also did the vault tour, which was a lot of fun but a bit long and could have been shortened up. Much fun nevertheless. Can't wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nwwriter
50,"Very, very nice selection of cars.","This was one of the nicest display of cars I have seen in a automobile museum. We were a little disappointed that we missed the tour by an hour that would have provided us with additional interesting cars in their lower leve area. They also have a good selection of motorcycles was a nice surprise. There were many Bugattis, Duesenbergs, Mercedes, concept cars, cars from a variety of movies on and on. My only qualm I had was my daughter, who is an adult, was slightly leaning toward a car trying to look into the interior and a security person said ""We don't like you leaning towards the cars!"" Well, the cars sit on a platform that stands approximately 2 feet of the floor and has a sign that shows ""Do not touch the cars or the platforms."" That is certainly understandable we are well aware the cost of this exclusive collection. Perhaps they need to add ""do not lean toward the car"" to their sign and make the platforms a little lower so people can actually see the beautifully designed car interiors. I would be more concerned that someone with a camera leaning over would accidentally drop the camera/phone onto a car. I witnessed this around the corner from where we were a man doing this very act. It was making me nervous just watching him hold his camera over the car!!You will not be disappointed with a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathed2015
50,A great family outing that's not just for gearheads,"Sure, car enthusiasts love this place, but since the big remodeling project inside and out, the museum connects more with automobile's place in pop culture. It's less a precious garage and more an interactive place where you learn about car history, see student car designers at work and drive a virtual reality race car. Visiting lets you think about all the ways we've traveled by automobile, which becomes a kind of time-traveling trip of its own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeryValli
50,All genres of cars from all eras!!!,"If you're a car enthusiast, this is an automotive heaven! 3 floors, all genres of cars, all eras, cars from movies, motorcycles, AC inside, and a very cool building. Parking is attached - 1st 30 mins is free, $12 flat rate after. We spent 3 hours here. You could knock it out in 2 hours. Or really experience the details in 4-5 hours. There's a free racing game to enjoy (for all ages) on 2nd floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattbI2280HR

50,"Exceptional, a must see.","As a car lover I knew I would enjoy this, but even my other half proclaimed it as ""brilliant"", Im still reeling .........Absolutely superb selection of cars including a number of Delahayes and Bugattis including a type 57SC, the original BMW Art Car, cars from movies including the DeLorean from Back to the Future and Magnums' Ferrari 308 and some great custom cars too.Everything was beautifully detailed, lit and displayed and if you have the time for a little more money they offer a guided tour of the vault with some truly unique vehicles, well worth it in my opinion.If youre not into cars this is a must see, if you are then this is approaching Mecca status, up there with the Schlumpf museum in Mulhouse. Id go back tomorrow!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/531thepimp531
50,One of the top automotive collections & exhibitions in the USA,"This was my first visit to the Petersen since their extensive remodeling. The collection is second-to-none and the exhibits and their layout are extraordinary. A must-see museum If you like cars. Also has terrific exhibits and hands-on activities for younger kids. Make sure you sign-up (and pay for) the Vault Tour - we had a great and knowledgeable docent.

Modern design of this facility stand up in the area right away. After paying the admission, we started from 3rd floor, history floor. My son was so excited to see his favorites, Delorean and Batmobile, he even brought his same model toy car with him. A mind blowing experience, every classic vehicle had been restored to brand new car condition. Wow is the only thought after we left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cchangle

Great exhibits and yo really don't need to be a car enthusiast but it helps!ONLY complaint is that I wish this museum were more interactive (!), like: I wish there had been a section of vintage car advertisements and magazines-these visuals are amazing & what a great accent! Also wish there had been buttons where you could press to hear differnet horns and engines-great for kids! (like the Harley Davidson Museum), how about a bar car or a drive in w/rollerskating servers?Anyway, they did a GREAT job here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acla1026

50,Fabulous Museum to Visit,"Recently renovated, we were looking forward to our return trip - and were not disappointed. Great for all ages, the museum has even added an interactive tablet experience for children. The cars on exhibit were wonderful - and the displays were very well done. We added a tour of the Vault where automobiles are stored when not on display. Our guide for the tour, a volunteer, was excellent! So many of the cars have a story - and our guide was well-versed in their history. Love this museum!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cleomissy
50,Unforgettable,"For those who are fascinated for automobiles and its technology, do not spend less than 3 hours in this fantastic place.

40,EXCELLENT VINTAGE MOTOR VEHICLE MUSEUM,"For all who think the past (1930-1960`s) were great times for cars for their style and construction, then this is a place not to be misses. Hundreds of beautifully maintained cars utes, motor bikes all under one roof on 3 levels. For historic car buffs a must if in L.A. The have a cafe for lunch/milk shake/coffee done out in the 1950`s style complete with red stools.

It is very large, has a huge variety of cars, from the first cars in history, to the most famous ones that belonged to celebrities, to the ones used in movies, like the Bat mobile, to race cars, you name it. Very well displayed, beautiful venue. Worth going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheilafajl
50,World-class Automotive Museum,"The Petersen Automotive Museum is a world class museum of cars. I've been to a few car museums, including the Nethercutt collection in Sylmar (which is a lovely collection of cars in a warehouse style room) and the American on Wheels Museum in Allentown, Pennsylvania (which is more museum like in it's exhibits) but walking through the three floors of the Petersen, you really get the sense you're in a museum, where art and automotive mix (and the cars are the art.) There are plenty of interactive exhibits, touch screen stations throughout, an interactive activities room for kids, and an iPad tour kids can go on with ""Carpads"" that they check out.You get strong sense of the history of cars from their very beginnings, through the most modern examples.There's also a section with a dozen or so cars famous from film and TV (The Delorean from Back to the Future, Michael Keaton's Batmobile...heck how about Adam West's Bat Cycle.)Everything is well spaced out, videos complement exhibits and give the place a true museum feel. You're not here just looking at a bunch of cars in a room...you're immersed in a world of cars, with top notch displays.Well done Petersen!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickpoet
50,Not Just for Car Freaks,"It is difficult to verbalize the magnitude of the Peterson.It is without doubt the best auto museum we have ever seen. We had visited the first incarnation about ten years ago. For a time, we were members. But as we have discovered you cannot belong to everything and we have opted to belong to venues closer to home. If we could afford the membership fees we would still be members. But alas we must pick and choose these days.The redo is pretty upscale and separated into segments. You start at the top and work your way down. It is easy and most informative.I could talk about the cars all day long. But they change them often enough to make that pointless. The cars on display are restored and many are priceless. To say the least.As some have noted it is a bit pricey. However, it is well worth the money. We opted for the “Vault Tour” at an additional cost. It is a deal. The info you get and the cars you see put the whole deal over the top.Parking is in the rear of the museum. I think it was $12 to park. It certainly made it easy and enjoyable.We do not get to Los Angeles very often but we’ll return to the Peterson when we do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelertoo2

50,Get ready to gawk and salivate!,My son and I went for a much-needed connection time to the Petersen. We were there for about five hours and didn't even see everything in detail! Amazing car collection that will make your mouth water! You must do the Vault tour! It is very well worth the extra cost and time!!! Oh how I wish I had kept my classic! They have everything from hot rods to classics to luxury to very rare cars! My son especially enjoyed the car design section.There is a discount for AAA card holders! Also parking is extra unless you find parking on the street!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelaM7103IC

30,Overpriced,"We went here on the 5th of July. The building itself is really cool. They do have some great cars here including the Batmobile and the Back to the Future cars, but overall we found it disappointing. If there is an automotive museum in a city we visit, we go. This one didn't live up to our expectations, especially for the price. We didn't see anything here that we couldn't see at any other automotive museum. One of the staff members also singled out my daughter, telling her she couldn't take her backpack purse into the exhibit, saying she either had to take it back to the car or leave it at security (what was she going to do, stuff a car in her purse?). She took her purse back to the car. When we were leaving, we saw no fewer than 6 people with large backpacks going into the exhibits. My suggestion is skip the Petersen and go to the Nethercutt instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/561laurim
40,Next time: take the valut tour!,"Some great cars here and tons of interesting stuff to learn... could spend hours if you're a car buff... but we passed on the 90min ""vault tour,"" BIG MISTAKE. They rotate cars in and out of the vault and so we missed out on some favorites (The original Green Hornet's car for one). But great place to spend an afternoon, esp if its too hot/stormy out for other activities. And must for car enthusiasts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AgC2012
50,Beautiful Cars!,"This was our third trip to the Petersen, and it was the first since they remodeled. I actually liked the old museum exhibits better, but it's still a terrific car museum. I get it that they were trying to add more interactive features and add things that appealed to families and younger museum goers with the remodel. The collection is great and the design exhibit on the first floor has so many beautiful examples that it's hard to know what to look at next. The vehicles from movies were fun to see and also to read the descriptions of. I've been to a couple of other U.S. car museums, and the Petersen remains my favorite so far. I expect I'll be back there on my next visit to LA, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/66jts

50,Cars! Cars! Awesome Cars!,A must for car enthusiasts.....a terrific collection. A small coffee shop has great burgers and fries. It's a little pricey...and you have to pay more to see the Vault....where even more cars are hidden awayl. They don't have enough space for it all. But it's worth the price at least once. The cars are beautiful.....from vintage to exotic. Go early...it gets crowded in the afternoon. Give yourself three or four hours.....unless you are such a car freak you want to spend the whole day there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BCMCLover

40,Worth a visit if you're an enthusiast,"So the place is not overwhelmingly big compared to other automotive museums. I can recommend the vault tour as you get to learn a lot about the cars in storage. The museum itself has a few ""sponsored areas"" so especially given the expensive ticket prices, that's a bit odd to me.Strong focus on American cars and cars connected to the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Felix8000
50,Most beautiful cars ever designed,"The Petersen Auto Museum has been on my bucket list even before the renovation. When we visited the area (to buy a car, what else?), I HAD to go. Lucky for me, my husband drove us there and not only paid for our admission, but was fortunate to get tickets to ""the Vault.""We started at floor 3, as advised. Talk about history of the auto--this is required to get an appreciation of this industry. The exhibits are in superb shape and the explanations for each are succinct, really giving a great perspective of how the auto developed. Spent about an hour on this floorThen to the 2nd floor, which deals with design, innovation, engines, accessories, etc. Even saw some probably college-aged people in what looked like a seminar, learning about how they could contribute to the industry. From speed to alternate fuel sources to our love affair detailed in car shows and concours, it was there. Unfortunately, we had to leave to make our vault tour.The vault: not necessarily top of the line cars but a potpourri of autos through the ages. Some are show cars; some are celebrity cars, many reflect Petersen's love of hot rods and speed, some are just silly; some from movies. These are not all spit and polish like the ones in the main museum. They are here awaiting their moment or just hanging out till they go to a show, get repaired or gussied up, or reconnect with whoever may have loaned them. But it is well worth seeing. Our guide, Richard, obviously is a total car nut and knew every vehicle. This is a 90 minute tour, lots of space so be prepared to walk a lot--no seating area, no bathroom area.By the time we were ready to resume the main museum, we were tired. I simply could not finish the 2nd floor because I knew the 1st floor was very special to me. So to the 1st floor which took over 1 hour.The MOST beautiful cars every created...and the majority from the 30s--talbot lago, bugatti, voisin--each one seemed more spectacular than the one preceding it. All were beautifully displayed and it was a gigantic privilege just to see them! I've attended AACA shows and concours (unfortunately not Pebble Beach), and I've never seen such an amazing group of truly unique vehicles.HAD to go to the gift shop, of course. Again, so much to see related to automotive history. If I'd bought all I wanted, I'd have to hire a van to get it home.If you're nonplussed about automotive history and design, don't go. You'll never appreciate the effort and never want to spend the time. But if you're a car buff, put it on your bucket list and GO! You'll be in Auto Heaven.NOTE: hard to say how long to visit--depends on your love of cars. My roughly 4 hours was not enough; I tired out. But for those who aren't car nuts, 2 hours might do it (but it deserves so much more!) I'll likely not get back to LA, but this exhibit will be in my mind and heart for always. THANKS PETERSEN!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnW449
50,Perfect place for Gear Heads,"If your'e at all interested in cars this museum is a must see.If your'e familiar with the history of Petersen Publishing (Hot Rod) the vehicles in here can be a bit of a surprise, but a good one.Its a definite don't miss if your'e in Los Angles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sd444
50,If you love cars don't miss this,"You can't miss this beautiful stainless steel & red building on Wiltshire. Inside are so many one-of-a kind vehicles & concept cars that you won't find elsewhere. They even had Walter White's Aztek from Breaking Bad on display! The Rolling Sculpture exhibit was amazing, such beautiful vehicles. I went to this museum because my husband wanted to, but am so glad I did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/687lizabethf
40,Art gallery for boys...,"Some truly stunning cars and hot rods, we did the vault tour which was also really interesting although slightly harder to follow as lots of American car history. Beautifully laid out, never felt packed, decent price & racing simulator made for a nice break after looking & not touching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/753leeb
50,"I am biased, as I volunteer here!","If you like cars, this is one of the top museums in the world, and it is now architecturally significant, so that my draw you in.There is probably a billion dollars worth of cars in this building, and one that is said to be worth $40 million My personal favorites are the 2017 Ford GT and the 1955 Ferrari Testarossa, but there are so many beautiful vehicles. If you like cars, you should check this place out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/734mikem
50,Truly Outstanding,"Fairly expensive, but one of the best collections I've ever seen. A lot of exotic one-of-a-kind cars, and all exhibits perfectly presented. Most of the cars and motorcycles are beautifully restored, but some were preserved in their original condition.Be sure to take the optional 'vault' tour. My guide was Bill, who gave an excellent talk as we walked around the area.My one gripe is that there were several groups of small children running around the place. Why? They couldn't have been getting much out of this museum, and would probably have been much happier playing on slides, swings, and jungle gyms in a park somewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rancher280
50,Ultimate destination for car and hotwheels lover!,very large and interesting collection of cars. lots of famous cars from movies. my personal favorite is the jaguar xkr used for the james bond movie. theres a hotwheels museum here too which is very nostalgic for me since i used to play with them when i was a kid.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlennSutrisno
50,Simply the best Auto Museum you will ever experience.,"Never in my life have I seen more concept cars, more pre-production models, more unique and beautiful cars than at the Petersen Automotive Museum. Located off Wilshire Blvd, just across from the La Brea Tar Pits. Parking is available in the museum parking garage. The museum has 3 floors filled with the most beautiful and historic cars you will ever see. Plus, the separate basement level Vault tour provides a look at an additional 190 cars not on display in the regular museum. here, a tour guide points out the significance of many of the most iconic vehicles in the museum collection. The original Black beauty from The Green Hornet, Sadam Hussein's Staff car, Parade vehicles from our past presidents including Nixon, Johnson, Eisenhower and more. Preston Tucker's personal Tucker! Just to name a few. The upper levels contain the most beautiful examples of exotic and historic automobiles in existence. Delahaye, Bugatti, Fiskar, Deusenberg, Aluma, Nash, Hudson, Mercer, Muntz and so many others are displayed for your enjoyment. Plenty of Hollywood cars too. From the celebrities personal autos, to the cars we love from our favorite movies and TV shows, all are here. Tom Selleck's Ferrari from Magnum P.I., The Back to the Future Delorean ""Hero"" car, the Pontiak Aztec driven by Walter in Breaking Bad are on display as well. Too many to count. The museum is located in the Museum Mile of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davec110
50,Great Museum for Teens,I took group of high school students to several museums in May. The Petersen was definitely their favorite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pcat4
50,Superb car museum,"I visited Petersen in 2005 and it was a good museum then but now it´s superb. Very interesting museum and fantastic mix of cars. With some muscle cars it would be even better. Anyway, i really recommend a visit and you need 2 hours in the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nikon
50,Heaven for Car Buffs,"We visited the museum and were blown away by the beautiful automobiles on display. One collection contained custom cars of the 1930s, there was an extensive motorcycle collection, an historical collection of very early cars (1800's) through modern concept cars and another collection of racing cars. Parking is $12 but we always go early on Sunday when parking on the street is free. Next door to this museum (walking distance) is the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and a mile or so North on Fairfax ave is the Los Angeles Farmers Market and The Grove shopping center. Both worthwhile attractions to visit while you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_Retirees
40,Hollywood Cars,"At first glance, there's an abundance of celebrity/Hollywood vehicles on display. Steve McQueen's Jaguar and the Back to Future DeLorean are both on display.The museum presents an interesting mix of historic vehicles and those of a more recent vintage, including an Aztek!Take lots of time to wander around and ogle the masterpieces in this collection, then on your travels, seek out some other auto museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GWMtravels
10,Worst renovation!!!!,"We Loved the old museum!! We visited June 26 2016 and LA was in a humid heat wave. The air conditioning system was dreadful at the Petersen. We Started on the 3rd floor and descended and the heat grew more intense. We had 4 tickets for the vault but two of us were so overheated we passed on the vault while our husbands went down. It is a 90 minute tour and both men said they were miserable in the heat and there were NO places to sit. They agreed that the tour was too long and too much information. The cars are wonderful of course. The modern art car facade was disliked by all of us. We asked to get water and the gift store employee had to call to find some. The cafe across Wilshire set up a tiny snack station on the fourth floor of the Petersen and No signs to let patrons know. We missed the old service station recreation etc and found their replacement videos not as present and exciting. We heard they are making an expensive restaurant in the building. People visit for a few hours and would appreciate a casual place to sit, visit, eat, and rest for a short period. Who planned this nightmare?Best seen in a cold spell but unsure what they have going in their indoor heating department.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inezs838
50,Excellent timeline of the evolution of automotive and motorcycle history,"Unfortunately I only had 2 hours to rush through, but at least I got to see and photograph everything before they closed. Before arriving I called and asked how much time is needed and they suggested allowing at least 3 hours to allow for more time to read about each vehicle, but a minimum of 1.5 hours to rush through. If I had more time I would have stayed approximately 4 hours. After seeing what was just a general timeline of the evolution of the automobile in the main galleries, it left me wishing I had the time to see the ""Vault"" downstairs to see more specific notable vehicles from around the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SWDadvisor
50,Fantastic,"Please don't miss this one out, it's a magical place to visit. We have been to a lot of car museums and I must say this is one of the best.

50,"Even if you're not much into cars, see this place!","The Petersen is a huge, fascinating trove, from the history of the automobile to astonishing expressions of it as an art form in the 1920s and 1930s. We went to see the artistry, and learned much more (who knew that electric cars were as popular as gas-powered ones in the early decades of the 20th century?) The museum is well organized and curated (Start at the 3rd floor and work your way down; the 2nd floor is devoted mainly to current design and engineering. There is something for everyone!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethht2016

There was James Bond jaguar, the batmobile and toy Story.There was also the $1.3 million Maclaren F1 which was very cool.Parking was $12 in a covered garage but parking was available on the street with either 1 hour and 2 hour limits.I'm glad I went and will come back again to the the ""vault' which it 100 more cars not on display!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandcmk
40,Top quality exhibition,"This is a privately run venture that should not be taken as a comprehensive history of the motor vehicle. The emphasis is on performance cars, speed, style, fashion, and their general iconic importance in American culture, particularly that of California. There some bikes and some old biker and car movie posters, but it is the performance cars that are centre stage. Beginning with Mr Benz’s first success in 1880 we travel through the 1950s and 1960s to the 2016 Maserati Quattro Porte SQ4 V6 which combines sports performance with sedan comfort. There’s the massively popular 1956 Chevrolet convertible, and the 1961 Honda 50, so very popular and, like the Vespa so liberating, for the young generation. Racing cars get attention too, with BMW in particular featured. Positively the best car museum I have seen, and very interesting even for a non petrol head.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnSB3

40,Really interesting cars,"From old classics to art projects to movie cars to one-of-a-kind autos, this is quite a celebration of automobiles. While other members of our family visited the adjacent tar pits and art museum, my 16-year-old son enjoyed this museum and before we knew it, more than 90 minutes had passed. Was definitely a fun visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paul-delaware
50,Car Lovers Mecca!,"My husband and 13 year old son LOVED this museum in Beverly Hills. The 2nd floor has a CARS movie themed interactive game on iPads that can be checked out to entertain younger kids while the car-obsessed Dads browse. There is also a teenager/young adult xbox game room where teens can try their hand for a few minutes at the latest Forza game in a driving seat contraption with other racers. The museum store will validate the parking with a $75 purchase. Overall, a fun visit for any car enthusiast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fepeaux

This is a place you shouldn't miss it will blow your mind.I live in Asia where we don't have access to such beautiful cars unless you are a corrupt politician or someone who recently won the lottery. But this does not mean that we don't share the same passion as other car aficionados.Visiting Petersen was a dream come true...from the moment you enter the museum you are greeted with incredible displays right at the lobby!The museum has three upper floors with fantastic exhibits but its the basement that is the most interesting because this is where they keep their special cars in ""The Vault"" which you can access if you join their 2 hr tour. They even have mechanics working on the restoration of cars. The only setback is you cant take photos,you are escorted by security guards and you have to stand all the time.You can get lost in this place for hours and its best to visit on a weekday so there are no crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabrielA191

50,Congratulations to the Petersen,"Last time I visited I was disappointed but now after the renovation work it is excellent! The cars are presented impeccably but more than that, they have some really unique cars there. The best sections are the Peter Mullin exhibit of Art Deco cars (I hope it stays there) and the Precious Metal with really precious cars. I also visited the vault (the garage with over 100 cars not on display) and don't understand why some of those cars are not on display, specially because there is space available on the 3rd floor. Congratulations to everyone at the Petersen!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/antonioVBoas
40,Worth visiting,"An interesting collection, very well displayed. Although the Vault Tour is expensive it is worth doing to see the cars that are hidden there.The staff are friendly and helpful, the availability of on-site parking a great benefit.There is plenty of space to walk round the exhibits and the lighting is good for my inexpensive camera (with the exception of the Vault where no photography is allowed sadly). I would like to have seen more variety on the ground floor, although the cars featured were beautiful - maybe they should bring up some of the fascinating cars from below to swap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/docsov

50,Great for car enthusiast and their families,"This was our first visit since the museum was remodeled last year. They are still working on some of the areas (the main restaurant is not open yet). We enjoyed the main museum. Some great old cars. No guide, just walk around and read the plaques in front of the cars. This was the first time we visited ""the Vault"". This is where they store cars not on display. It is basically the basement parking lot. A guide walks you are round and tells you about the cars that are stored. Guide was a little too detailed for my taste. It was a 90+ minute tour. Something new since our last visit, pay for parking ($12). You can get it validated if you spend $35 in the gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MVCA0Traveler

10,Horrible!,This was absolutely horrible. We had called to see about the racing experience and was told we could go as often as we wanted as long as we got in line. We got there early to avoid the lines and after four rides were told to go into the museum and not back into the riding experience. We were upset but did not want to agrue. We called once we got home and were told at first that this was indeed wrong and we should have been allowed to do the ride experience as we wanted. However a day later the director of admissions called and told us indeed there is a policy that states after 20 minutes you will be directed to go elsewhere in the museum. This is not posted at the museum or the website. We have enver been in a museum that dictated how we should spend our time. Horrible!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krg999
40,Wow! Cars and vehicles of all kinds,"I'm not a car aficionado, but my husband is. I still enjoyed walking through and reading about the history of the cars.

He and I moved slowly among the beautiful and storied cars and as we encountered each, one-by-one, we made a comment and then more and then more....until we were talking freely about our shared experience over the past 60+ years.The museum atmosphere and cars especially made it easy to share memories safely and get reacquainted.Yes- this museum is about cars. No doubt. However the history of cars is about moving people to places they could not go easily before. and it was interesting to learn they can also move people while stationary.Nice visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PapalBull

30,"Great if you love cars, otherwise... okay, but not worth going out of your way for","Reading all of the other reviews, I got the impression that even folks who weren't crazy about cars would love this place. As someone who enjoys having a car and driving around the country in it, but who is not a car aficionado, I thought the museum was moderately interesting, but not one that I would say is a ""must see"" for folks like myself. I thought there would be a lot of information re the history of automobiles and about the history of highway development in the LA area, but other than one small exhibit on the latter, there wasn't much else on historical matters related to cars (other than the vehicles themselves). In summary, if you love cars, this place is a ""must see"". otherwise I would say it is okay, but not worth going out of your way for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllanReis
50,"You'll say ""Wow"" every time you turn a corner!","I am a fan of autos from the Streamline and Art Deco periods. They are very hard to find because of their multi million dollar valuations. Sadly, when you do find them many of them are poorly preserved/restored. Not so at the Petersen! These mechanical jewels are presented at a level that would make the original craftsmen proud. They are beautifully illuminated and ""posed"".In addition to the ""Classics"" they showcase California lifestyle cars like Woodies, VW Vans, Dune Buggies and Hot Rods. Being close to Hollywood many movie star cars are there. My biggest surprise was to see a real Mach 5 from the Speed Racer Series!If you have the time and they are giving tours of ""The Vault"" you should see it. Any handful of the cars that aren't on display at the Petersen would be ""anchor displays"" at a smaller collection. The only disappointment is there are no photos allowed in The Vault.They have a parking garage. Plan to spend at least 3-4 hours and eat before or after you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChetF684

50,Awesome collection of motoring history in Beverly Hills,"Who would know that behind the modern architectural facade of the building was a Multi million collection of historical, designer, motorsport, and movie star vehicles.With no hint on what's inside until you begin to see some outstanding examples of vehicles and motor bikes as you wander into the depths of the building..you then find the reception you pay very reasonable entrance fee for three floors of the most immaculate vehicles that I have ever seen..Photography is allowed on these three floors and are there some fine vehicles to shoot.Whoa...I can't forget to mention what you see at the start...one of the most fantastic cars that I have ever seen. A round door Rolls Royce..with a history that is just astounding.There is a second tier of pricing ..this is to access ""The Vault"".The vault is a collection of cars in the basemen area..no photography allowed and you see a collection of historic diplomatic vehicles..USSR's Breshnev's limo, President Carters bullet proof limo..just some of them..

The price is reasonable and you can just imagine cruising down LA freeways in the car of your life. How fun would that be? The fantasy starts at this unique museum. I would not miss it on a visit to LA. Combine it with a visit to the LACMA and the La Brea Tar pits and you will be set for an entire day. LA here you come!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaViajera007
50,Do the Vault Tour,We heard the museum had a $90 million renovation. I went with a couple of my friends and we paid the extra fee for a vault tour. The guide was excellent. We saw cars that we had never seen before anywhere. The entire museum is modern and pristine. The vault tour was 90 minutes. We spent almost 3-1/2 hours on our visit. Well worth the time and the fee. Parking is adjacent to the museum. The entire building is a work of art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DenPearl510
50,Cars Treasure Cave,"Real Treasures for real car fans! Right in the middle of LA you'll find it.Two floors are free. Underground, The Vault excursion is a little pricy but it worth it. Only in The Vault you'll find absolutely uniq cars, such as golden DeLorian, or The Round Door Rolls – 1925 Rolls-Royce Phantom I Jonckheere Coupe, and more than one hundred other masterpieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skytruck
50,Must See,This is a museum with the best collection of automobiles. Very clean and well laid out! Plenty of room to wander thru the floors and exhibits! I was afraid that I would be bored but I enjoyed it just as much as my husband!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/367LindaS
40,Loved this place and I'm not even into cars!,"I'm more of a motorbike type of guy, but when i was visiting the tar Pits I was told by another tourist of the Petersen Automotive Museum just across the road, so I thought why not.On first entering the museum I was instantly 'WOW' and totally captivated. I'll be honest and say i only stayed in the free section and could only see the pay section through glass windows but from what i did see i would highly recommend to anyone with an interest in cars (and bikes too) to check this place out. you can view the lobby vehicles free and if they grab you then go for the paid section. The only reason i didnt do the whole place was due to time. I think when i come back next year i'll put a few hours aside to get the full monty of vehicles.there's also a few bikes for those of us who love 2 wheels over 4 :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MuscleDog
50,Amazing cars!,"I really went because my husband loves cars! I had a great time, these cars are works of art!Something for everyone, three floors of great cars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherylr385
40,Works of Art on Wheels,"If you obsess over cars like I do, then the Petersen Museum is a must-see for you. I had visited the museum at least 6 times in the recent past but I needed to see what was different after their huge remodel. The dioramas of old time car dealer show rooms and gas stations are gone (a bit sad), and have been replaced by stellar car displays. On my recent visit (May 2016) I went solo and paid to visit the guided tour of the vault where they keep hundreds of cars waiting to be displayed and cars owned by rich car enthusiasts who pay to have Petersen keep their cars safe. What a jaw dropping tour. If you enjoy cars, put Petersen Museum on your list. Sadly the 50's Johnny Rockets diner is gone, but a new high-end restaurant is soon to open downstairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwfilice
50,Impressing Him at Peterson Automotive Museum!,"The Peterson Automotive Museum is a great date destination. I surprised my Boyfriend for Valentines Day this year and let's just say he was SUPER excited and fell even more in love with me! Being a car enthusiast he smiled and became excited as we made our way into the different rooms and displays. I went ahead and bought the Vault Tickets and well worth the extra purchase. Getting to see actual cars that are a part of American History for the good and the bad, from Presidential cars to bullet holes. Our guide was very educated and enthusiastic, (can't remember his hair but it was on the strawberry blonde side with glasses). The only thing I would change is to install an ACTUAL cafe or food spot, not what currently only supplies hot dogs and pre packaged gas station like food selection. The selection of cars are constantly changing and it has always been a great place to see such beautifully crafted automobiles. Highly Recommed for dates!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/courtrose930
50,Excellent museum,"A must see if you are into cars...the museum remodel is gorgeous and contemporary. The cars are beyond amazing. The ""vault"" tour is spectacular. Great history and very knowledgeable tour guides. Easily can spend half a day there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffM844

50,The best in the world,"We have been to lots of car museums in Australasia but this eclipses them all. Each car was so beautifully presented.The extra displays and footage adding to the total experience.The vault tour was well worth the money.All cars so interesting with a history of their own.My husband enjoyed the 'car details"" whereas I enjoyed the form and beauty of these great machines.I will go again when next in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glambertanna
50,Awesome place for lovers of cars,"Amazing new museum that has a great mix of old and new, innovative and movies, street and race cars and bikes. Things for both young and old. Beautiful collection of Bugattis, Delages and Delahayes along with sports cars and motorbikes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198cyndir
50,Great for any Car enthusiast.,I've read about the museum for several years. I was lucky enough to be in the area and decided to stop in. It's a beautiful building with a wonderful collection of cars and motorcycles. My only regret is not having the time to do the Vault tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juice_22
50,A Must Stop for Car Lovers!,"This was our second time to the Petersen Automotive Museum. The museum was completely revamped. They have three floors with their own theme. They added a Forza racing room and a tech/design area so you get an idea of what's involved when designing a new vehicle. The vault tour was pretty cool and definitely worth the extra money. I really enjoyed seeing the garage where the mechanics actually work on the vehicles. The day we were there they had a Tucker in the vault. The only downside is that a bunch of the vehicles that used to be on the display before they revamped the museum are now in the vault. Last time we were there the Mach 5 from Speed Racer was on public display, this time around it was down in the vault. So a lot less vehicles on display, but the revamped was well worth it. If you've never been and you're a car lover, it's definitely worth going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinorahv112
50,The museum is incredible after the renovation!,"We visited many years ago and just had to return to see the renovated museum. Absolutely phenomenal! A definite must see if you are in the Hollywood area. The cars are magnificent and the way they are displayed is fantastic. Cannot say enough about how much fun this new museum is. I will definitely be returning, since the displays change every 2 weeks per the staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jolacabana
30,Renovated recently,"The new renovation is very nice. A big improvement over the old museum. Vault tours weren't available when we went, but we've done it before and it's highly recommended. They rotate the attractions periodically so check the website to see what's on display prior to your visit. On a down note: While all the old French cars are beautiful examples of cars as art I don't think they're in the spirit of what the museum was originally supposed to represent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3718XOchrisb
50,The extra vault was worth it,The experience at the Peterson was great it was mine and my families second time the first since the remodel place is very nice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jason_7710
50,Must See!,"If you are a car nut or just appreciate a great education, the Petersen Automotive Museum is a must see! Worth every minute. And go on the Vault tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardmR7832BX
50,More than expected!,"We had heard about this museum on a car show we watched and looked forward to our trip to the west coast to finally see this place. We visit car museums all over the US. But by far we can say that this was the best car museum we have been to. You must must must spend the extra bucks for the vault tour. It was worth every penny. The cars throughout areIn top condition and thrilling to see. The set up of the museum is nice with lots of room to move and not feel pressed by the crowd. They have security everywhere to protect the cars. But it still freaked us out to see parents who don't control their children allow them to touch prices vehicles. If you take your kids, do not let them touch except in the few places where they can! It is rude and disrespectful. They do have a lunch room with limited snacks and drinks, because you will want to stay longer than you can go without food! Nice gift shop. Knowledgable staff. Beautiful layout. Beautiful cars. Best car museum ever!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bbstevenson
50,Car Mania !,Fantastic new museum ! The outside design stinks ! I'm sure some people will love it though. Silly about not letting peole take pictures in the vault. You can see them online. You should expand to include the vault cars in the main museum. Overall Great ! We will go many times in the future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/836larryk
50,So cool!,Took my husband for his birthday. Highly recommend the vault tour! This place is amazing and has something for everyone. If you've ever admired a car or motorcycle you will love it. Pay attention to pay for parking before you exit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pavese1
50,Really Top Notch,"This was my first time back since the remodeling and I was really impressed. I particularly liked the ""Precious Metal"" exhibit, but all of them were impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paul_galanti
50,this is 100% worth the money and a good way to kill time affordably!,Lot of fun vehicles and history to see! I am not a huge car guy and I was extremely interested!! Make sure you check their schedule to be sure they are open. They have a lot of private events here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GOCONSOLE
40,Petersen Automotive Museum,"The Petersen Museum was very well laid out and not cluttered. The collection of cars displayed on each of the floors were grouped very well with a lot of foresight. The plaques and descriptions were very helpful well displayed. The 'Vault' tour was, however, the best as show cased quite a few cars that were down in the bowels of the museum. The docent was extremely knowledgeable as described each of the hundred or so cars and gave background histories on many of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibbied
50,Excellent,So many different varieties of automobiles from historic vehicles to modern ones. Great experience!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U9691WZangelaa
30,It was okay,"I purchased 2 tickets for the vault tour and there was at least 30 other people on the tour with us. Movement in the tour was cramped and hard to listen to the speaker, and we didnt get to see any of the cars until he was done speaking about them so by the time the croud passed so we could have a look at the car, the speaker had moved onto the next car. It would be alot better if the tour was more personal and had less people. Other than that, its a cool place to go to, very entertaining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nramire94
50,Family treat at Petersons,"My sister and her husband were visiting from Detroit Michigan. They are avid car enthusiasts. We enjoyed a full day at the Peterson Museum starting with the Vault, a must see place with many gems from the auto years of old. Lunch on the roof top was okay, but will be better once restaurant is open. The main floors have beautiful cars. My favourite is the E-type Jaguar owned by Steve McQueen. Thoroughly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richarddV6446FA
50,Worth the Traffic,"If you are an automotive enthusiast and haven't been to the Petersen, it's definitely worth the headache that DTLA traffic can induce. It's a great museum with iconic cars and loads of information. The vault tour is a must. They also offer military and student discounts. Be sure to go with two or three hours of free time as there is a lot to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blairekw
50,Ford Club Trip,"We enjoyed every aspect of the experience from the new exterior of the building to the lavish suites that have been established to exhibit memorabilia and automobiles including race cars, work of art classics, prototypes and an array of very familiar cars for the general public.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/828BobB828

50,Must see for car nuts,"If you are into cars, do the ""vault-tour"" to get a behind the scenes look. Cars on display are awesome. But the vault tickets online upfront and calculate $10 for parking at the Petersen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenswilde
50,Really cool musuem even if you're not into cars,"My husband and I recently toured the Petersen for the first time. We had been waiting for it to re-open, so I can't comment on what it was like before. It's definitely beautiful now! We paid for the extra tour that takes you downstairs (bring a coat...it's freezing!) and that was the best part. I'm not a car enthusiast but I do enjoy history so it was neat to see how the car has progressed. Plus they just have some really different stuff on that tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jperoni
30,It was almost closed :(,"I went with so much enthusiast... But icouldn get in, only ate the lobby, try to get early, i thought being a museum it could close later nite.. But they close at 5:30 or something like it... I really wanted to get im",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/motorsapien
50,A car lovers MUST SEE,"I wish I could give the Petersen more than 5 stars! Visiting was a ""bucket list"" item for us and it was amazing! Being our first visit I can't compare the newly renovated museum to the previous one but the building both inside and out is as much a work of art as the cars it displays!We were thrilled to be able to get tix to tour the Vault!!!!!!!! I wish I could remember our docents name but he was absolutely awesome! So obvious he loves cars and his job! So knowledgeable and a great speaker! Kept us entertained and informed the entire tour. Was so cool to view this collection.If we didn't live halfway across the country I am sure we'd be here often! Sounds like they do some really cool events here.Congrats to the Petersen on your ""new"" museum and being named the Worlds Best Automotive Museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShiningStar0921
50,amazing collection and building,I highly recommend the vault tour. What an amazing collection and a beautiful building. A must see when visiting LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericacV3615NB
40,A beautiful re-do,"My family and I have frequented this museum almost since it opened. While there has been some criticism over the new design, we think it's amazing and beautiful. The cars inside are jaw dropping and the new activities can certainly fill an afternoon with small kids or teens who are into driving or cars. The place is immaculate and the cars are displayed like art. Truly lovely. And with LACMA across the street it's a very nice full day. Did I mention reasonably priced? Cause it is. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyQM
50,Excellent,"Always a great museum but new design inside and out is spectacular. Staff friendly and helpful and the collection is unbeatable. Should be one of the major attractions for tourists and locals. Loved the vault tour too, our second time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidzee

50,Petersen reimagined,"My recent visit to The Petersen was for a very fine celebration of Enzo Ferrari's Birthday. The museum is now a world class automotive museum. Dramatic and artistic displays, well developed automotive themes, and all enclosed in dramatic architecture. I found the staff to be pleasant, helpful and very informative. Any automotive enthusiast that has visited other premier automotive museums will be very impressed in what the Petersen has accomplished.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamaP6670WD
50,Awesome museum,Great museum for car enthusiasts. Do the back door tour which takes you to the basement you could see lots of cars that are not on the main floor that are super cool. Worth the cost. Buy the tickets at least one day in advance to avoid sellouts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tony0819chgo
50,A Day at the Peterson,I went with some friends and our Dads on a Saturday. We had an amazing time and saw extremely rare cars including a Tucker. I would go again and pay the extra to go back into the vault every time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizmQ2283YQ
40,Husband's birthday present - trip to Petersen Automotive Museum,"Very interesting displays and so glad we took the Vault tour. Great number of exhibits to visit before during and after the tour.

Only problem, it was a long day visiting there and we had trouble finding a place to sit down and rest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelbT2538OI
50,Something for everyone!,Our family of four really enjoyed the Petersen - our two boys (ages 7 and 5) were thoroughly entertained by the Cars room on the second floor and my husband LOVED the Vault tour. The cars on display were beautiful and interesting.... definitely will go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlainaV937

50,The Most Impressive Auto Museum Ever,On a recent trip to LA my wife and I extended out trip to allow us to visit the newly remodeled Peterson Museum. I can say that we were both impressed in what was on display. We also extended our tour to include “The Vault” which we would also highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveB5540HW
50,A Must See for Classic Car Fans,"I visited this great museum on a week-day, and even then, it was fairly busy. There are two parts to the museum, the open section where all cars are on display, then the Vault, which is a guided tour. I took the Vault tour, which is a guided tour of vehicles not on display, and it was maxed out with more than 20 participants. There were cars on display that I had never seen and, amazingly, they are all, for the most part, in running condition. It's a great place to learn about some rather obscure, but beautiful, cars. It's not clear where to start, you check in on the first floor. But you should start on the third floor, then work your way down to the first. The Vault is located in the basement and the tour for that is 90 minutes long and is priced separately from the general admission ticket. Cars are apparently routinely rotated between the Vault and the main display floor. Two complaints, the Vault tour is a little pricey ($30) and is not near long enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ohtobeinsandiego
50,Like no Other,A visit to the Petersen Museum is like no other museum I've ever seen. This is an amazing collection of priceless vehicles in concours condition like none other. The recent remake of the museum is outstanding.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlm523
50,Petersen is Great,Give yourself plenty of time...there are so many cars to see. Take the Vault tour. It's worth the extra money. (Also take the last tour of the afternoon...the guides can run long on the tour and not cause a problem. Ours ran about half an hour long.),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donald90242
40,Vacation,"As a blue collar worker I was more, I more interested in the Vault Tour. The costs overall added up quickly, parking (unless you spent a $100 minimum in the gift shop), additional cost for Vault Tour.I elected not to include my family go on the Vault Tour and security did not allow them to wait outside in front of the building. Treating the like vagrants despite them showing there paid wrist bands.For a car guy it was a ""Once in a life time opportunity.Brian PMadison WI.1947 Packard & 1950 Packard(drivers not show cars)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blpranke
50,California trip,Wonderful display and history of automobiles. Loved the vault tour as much as the rest of the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgbosso
50,Love this place,"This is a fantastic auto museum. They have a very wide collection of cars from a range of eras, many cars also from famous movies. You begin the tour of the top floor and make your way down. They are currently offering tours of their underground garage which was worthwhile if you're interested in cars like I am.I'd recommend allowing at least two hours for the museum itself. Being an automobile Museum, they do have a parking garage, but it's also easily accessible by public buses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveOfBoston
40,Beautiful cars!,Loved it! Wish the whole experience was narrated or at least guides around to help answer questions. I had so many questions since the display verbiage was not abundant. Would suggest finding out any guided tours for the whole museum. Enjoyed also the vault selection of cars underneath - was a guided tour. Loved the history and selection. Parking was $12 cash or card.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/541chih
50,Perfect Gift,"I purchased the tickets as a Valentines gift to my Husband. He was so excited to find that he was not only going into the museum but was also able to view the cars in the vault. Being a car enthusiast, he was like a kid in a candy store seeing all he could and taking numerous photos. The staff was very cordial and informative. A great experience overall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicrats
50,Petersen Automotive Museum,The Petersen is great for all ages. It is so well set up that even people who are not car enthusiasts will enjoy it and learn something. Not your typical car museum. The vault is awesome! Worth the extra money for the tour. The kids area where you can design your own car and race against Lightening McQueen was very cool and entertaining even for teenagers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhondaa66

40,Interesting and enjoyable,Better than I expected. Vault tour was more than I needed and I would not spend the extra money again. Sort of like having more ice cream after finishing a bananna split.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/334brentl
50,Car Lover's Paradise,"As a lifelong car fanatic, the Petersen Automotive Museum is about as good as it gets. I was grinning from ear to ear from the moment I walked in until the time I left. Their collection encompasses every facet of automotive interest, from ""ancient"" history to the most cutting-edge tech of today. The Vault tour is highly recommended. I went twice in the span of one month. There's more art at the Petersen than there is at any other museum in Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alex_leanse

As an Art Center Alum I loved that this wonderful LA institution was included and celebrated. I'm looking forward to the years in the future as the displays change and evolve. Also, thank you so much for including the Hirohata Merc in the initial opening event. Bob Hirohata would have been so very proud that his Barris created, Jim McNeil restored, and Junior Conway painted and detailed Kustom has reached the zenith of automotive culture. Keep up the good work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulkY9206RX
50,Amazing experience,"Don't miss out on the Vault tour, great knowledgable staff take you on a 90 minute tour of the vault, many special cars and great stories about them.

50,Very impressive,"The new building is beautiful on the inside, outside not so much, but that's just me. The cars are placed with lots of space around them so it would never seem crowded.

50,gift for the wheel obsessed,"our trip to the petersen automotive museum was a gift to my husband for his birthday, but it became quickly evident that it was a treasured experience for us both. my husband is obsessed with wheels and gears and fast, moving objects. i've merely as much an interest as any loving wife should in her husband's passions. however, before we even entered through the front doors, the elegant detail that defines every square inch of this museum was evident right as we pulled up. i can't tell you the specifics of what my wide eyes beheld once inside but i can tell you that every automotive was a brilliant, living sculpture; each eliciting an emotive reply. the layout of this gemstone of a building was as precision as the engineering within it. and we took the tour. well worth the extra spend. after all, a museum is a place to grow and the oratory of the tour was profuse with historical relevance to any visitor. i recommend this place to anyone living in the 21st century, and i will certainly visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/737jamiem

50,Awesome! Well worth it,Couldn't be better. We will definitely be returning. Make sure to see the vault tour. Wear your walking shoes though. I can't believe that they would let people get so close to the vault cars. I don't even trust my family enough to let them around my Lotus :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenhI2871LR
50,Amazingly Cool!!,"The Peterson Automotive Museum was fantastic.The architecture is stunning and the exhibits are thoughtfully and beautifully prepared.We also bought tickets to the Vault Tour which I highly recommend.It was a 90 minute guided tour through the dual that houses cars that are not on exhibit.The tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable and described the highlights of each car.We saw a Pope Mobile, Presidential Limousines, Evita Peron's car, Magnum P.I.'s Ferrari, the Back to the Future DeLorean, and many, many others. It was well worth the additional price of admission. I throughly enjoyed the entire experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misschrisritchie

50,An incredible place,"Even if you aren't obsessive about cars, this place is wonderful!

10,the petersen is now gone forever,"i had been to the real petersen five times. although i was not a fan of the what the outside was beginning to look like, that is really unimportant,. as this was a museum for CARS.wow. where to start. anything and everything that made the petersen cool is now gone. no more staged sets featuring the cars in interesting light. nope. now it is all just stark too-bright white lights everywhere and pointless white backdrops. boring and ugly.from the looks of it, they had to see cars to pay for the stupid exterior, as some of my favorite cars were no longer around (the amphicar, the turbine, etc).there is no rhyme or reason now for any of the cars. they are just thrown together willy-nilly.the place was mildly infested with hotrods before. whatever. if they want to ruin a good car here or there, fine. but now? these abominations are now FEATURED. truly disgusting. my second billion dollars will go towards buying up these pigs and restoring them back to their original beauty.and - to top it off - we made plans to finally do the vault. wow. what a real travesty. one, some of the cars they used to be upstairs and that were interesting and now down in the vault. why? we used to be able to see them. get rid of a goddam hotrod or two and put something interesting back on the floor. two, the 'tour'? wow, what a mess. folks: SAVE YOUR MONEY. do NOT waste your time and money on the vault. you go up and back about 80 yards twice. that's it. our guide was atrocious. seriously the worst docent i have ever seen in any realm ever. i am not joking here and this is no exaggeration: this clown spent the first five minutes yapping about himself before we started, and then proceeded to drone on and on and on ON THE FIRST CAR (some 1900s something) and tell us a bunch of stuff that anybody could get off the internet IF THEY WERE INTERESTED...for 15 long minutes. seriously. it may have been ever longer. again - this is not an exaggeration. so we moved a total of 0' and saw ONE car for the first 20 minutes. my group was going out of their gourds as we could see some cars yards away but were forced to endure this clown's hot mess of a tour.no, i will not ever be back. i hope the place burns to the ground for what they have done. actually, scratch that. i was a slow death for it. i do not want these jerks getting insurance money. i want them to slowly go broke and experience the downslide painfully every day until they off themselves under the 105 on a cold january morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goaway2016

The cars in the upstairs sections of the museum were absolutely beautiful - works of art and not to be missed, even if you're not a car nut.

Well worth the $15.00 admission and if you really want to treat yourself to something truly special pay the extra $15.00 and visit the vault where many more cars are stored all of which someday will be rotated into the various exhibits.

Alone, as a couple or with a group of friends, it is a nice way to spend a couple hours in the Museum Mile. We went with friends. We bought the general admission. There is something called the vault tour but you are on a schedule and it appears with a fairly large group on the weekends. I might try this next time and on a weekday if it is available.

50,Car Enthusiast,Any car enthusiast will enjoy this museum that includes three floors of beautiful cars and some other exhibits and activities. There are a few famous cars such as Mr. White's car from Breaking Bad and the car from Grease. The Bugattis were my favorite but if you are a car fanatic there are plenty to choose from. We also went on the vault tour. It was very informative although the 90 minutes seemed rather long after touring the main part of the museum. The main downside to being there so long was not having a restaurant onsite but we noticed one under construction. There aren't really many areas to sit down so if you are with someone who has mobility issues this is something to keep in mind.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sbadOcca

Skip the vault tour if you really are interested in cars.The tour groups are far too large. You can't hear all of what is being said and you can't linger and look at the car after the explanation. There were so many on the tour that half the time you couldn't see the car during the explanation and then time to move on. He admonished the group to hurry up because ""there's so much to see"". That is true but you can't enjoy what you're seeing. What a disappointment. Our guide lost track of what he was talking about several times. He seemed distracted.Visit the museum but check to see how large the tour is. If it's large you will waste your money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BudNLily

(Extra charge for the Vault tour) If you go the car museum, the Vault tour is a must. That is where all the great cars are located. Tour guide was excellent, although some people who were at the back probably had difficulty hearing. You will be disappointed if you just go the museum.

50,Highly recommend!,"My husband is a big fan of cars. When we went to this museum, I was ready to be a little bored but a good sport. Wow! I was so impressed. The cars on exhibit were beautiful, the information about them was interesting, even to someone who knows nothing about cars, and the museum is impressively laid out with large exhibition spaces with plenty of space for people to view the cars. We went on the Vault Tour, an additional cost but definitely worth it. It's a 90 minute tour with a docent (our's was knowledgeable, personable and easy to listen to while we learned a lot about the cars and the museum). It's in the basement and includes many of the collection that aren't currently on exhibit. There's a big parking garage attached to the museum. It would be easy to combine a visit to LACMA with the Peterson as they're across the street from each other and leave your car in the garage at either venue. Those are the pluses: a negative is the food service. It's basic at the Peterson with pre-made sandwiches, snacks and drinks. It's located outside on the top floor next to the garage with very little shade and plastic tables and chairs. Probably a good idea to have a back-up plan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolel401

We opted for the Vault Tour, and I am not sure it was value for money. After we got into 'the vault' we found out the cars werent to be photographed, after another poor unfortunate tour party member took a snap shot, and got publicly reprimanded and made to delete it - while we all watched on in embarrassment. (Glad it wasnt me - but could easily have been). Not sure what is so special about the vault cars that means they cant be photographed - apparently they go on display on the main floors, and go to car shows. Consequently I cant really even remember what I saw down there. However, I did overall enjoy the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bertie101_12
50,Do not miss!,"We used to visit the Petersen Automotive Museum and we always loved it. Now, we love it even more! The museum remodel is positively incredible! The building itself is very cool, the design and layout are user -friendly and interesting. The interactive videos, the XBOX Forza game you can play, some of the cars from movies and television, cars as art, we could have spent more hours there than we did. Next time we will sign up for the 75 minute tour to see the cars not on display - we can't wait! Way to go Petersen Automotive Museum, this was a perfect upgrade and what a phenomenal job of curating you have done!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anandamom

20,Surprisingly Disappointing,"On a recent visit to Los Angeles I was looking to get away from my accommodation on Hollywood Blvd and reading. I am a big car nut, from a young age I have been dragged to classic car shows and museums, so when I saw the Peterson Automative Museum here on TripAdvisor I couldn't wait to visit!!Student admission was $12, however I was offered to do the guided tour to see the 'private collection' for an additional $20. This frustrated me a little bit as I felt this was quite a steep hike in price. Nevertheless I chose to pay anyway.For standard admission you are permitted to visit the collection on the 3 floors of the museum. The collections here are intended to display pivotal cars in automotive history with additional mention of the evolution of the 'hot rod' industry in California in addition to movie vehicles. The guided tour down to vaults allows you to see historically significant cars, for example a Pope-Mobile, Saddam Hussein's personal limousine and Greased Lightning from Grease.Overall I thought the museum was poor. For a museum with the floor size of the Peterson, there should be at least double the amount of cars on general display. Instead a choice few cars are readily viewable whilst the cream of the collection is crammed into the vault. I felt ripped off in both areas. One because it felt empty, the other because the cars were too close together. There was precious little information on display to accompany the vehicles. I love reading about the vehicles history and often spend hours in small museums as I enjoy learning about the exhibits. For the most part this sort of information was minimal. I found this quite boring to be honest.The atmosphere was sterile and empty and the cars on display (in both areas) were very heavy biased towards American automobiles. I cannot recall any Japanese vehicles. There were a few British cars (mainly Rolls-Royce's plus a lonely Austin 7), German cars (VW Beetle and an Original Benz motor carriage), Italian (Ferrari and Alfa Romeo) and a French Bugatti. Even the American cars that were present seemed to be biased towards Fords and Hotrods.It is a shame that non-American cars are marginalised, as absolute classics like the Ferrari F40, Nissan Skyline, Subaru Impreza, Austin Mini Cooper, Jaguar E-Type (arguably the greatest car ever made), Messerschmidt KR200 or a Peel P50 were all absent, in my experience these are generally mainstays of motor museums.I would not recommend this museum, it does not live up to its hype and is expensive and overrated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OptomB
40,Beautiful cars thoughtfully presented,"I was expecting a ton of cars in rows. Was surprised by a very focused and elegantly presented tight selection. I get it.

40,Automotive dream come true.,"Not only is the outside of the museum a stunner, it is filled with automotive masterpieces. From the first car to the first hydrogen car, this museum contains many significant automotive milestones. There are famous cars from the world of movies. From Herbie to the latest James Bond Aston Martin. The main collection is housed over 3 levels, with an even greater number of vehicles in the vault.

I loved it. I'm a rev-head at heart and the museum didn't disappoint, with cars logically arranged in different themes and all in immaculate condition and presentation. Entry was great value, it's a shame parking cost as much as entry. I went on a Saturday afternoon and, as with everything in LA, ticket buying was slim with a queue ....in Australia, we seem to be able to take people's money and give tickets much quicker than they do in LA, but I've come to accept that people must love lining up in LA, as once I finally got my ticket and got into the museum, it wasn't crowded at all. The new facade is fantastic and worthy of many photos. I loved the museum and next time, I'll spend more time (and money) and do the extra 75 minute vault tour. I loved it and will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/em_be53

It was only about a 15 minute walk from where we had already parked at the Farmer's Market up there street so we decided to just do that. It was a nice walk in a nice part of Los Angeles. It was $15 dollars to get into the museum which wasn't too bad I suppose, though I think this opinion will vary depending on how much somebody loves cars.

50,Peterson Auto Museum is a Must,"The Peterson Museum is a must if you live in the Los Angeles area or visiting LA. My Grandson and I spent six hours touring the entire museum. An hour and a half was spent on the ""Vault Tour"" in the basement. Well worth the extra cost. The Vault Tour guide we had, Jeff, was excellent. Not only very knowledgeable about the various vehicles but also history of the previous owners. From U.S. Presidents, international political leaders and Hollywood celebrities. If you have knowledge of the automotive world the Vault Tour will add to that knowledge.The exhibits are presented very well through out the museum. There a number of ""one of a kind"" cars and information about well known cars that may surprise you. The relationship with Henry Ford and Cadillac that may also surprise you. There is a design area on the second floor that allows children to design/draw their own cars. Also a display of the inner workings of an engine, how brakes, electrical systems and gears work. So there is something for everyone, from novice to automotive engineer.There is a snack area on the top floor with ready made sandwiches and salads but I was told a cafeteria will open soon. There is a multi-story parking garage with easy access.

The nice thing is that in 2014 they let Jay Leno drive this car for a segment of his show, rather than just leave it stagnating in the museum.

10,Way too Expensive!,"I had a few moments to kill so I thought I would drop into the museum and see some of their great cars. Big mistake. First off, I was on a bicycle and it was really difficult to find the parking they had for bikes. When I finally did, it was one of those wire frames to hold your front wheel. Not very useful because you need something to lock your bike to. This is LA, people! You would think a transportation savvy museum would have a great bike rack, and more than 4 spaces. Then when you're walking to the front door, there's no walkway. This most direct route is right across the driveway in and the driveway out. The Museum should block this route somehow cause I also saw a group of 5 take the same route I did. When I finally got inside, I was shocked to discover the cost was $12 for a 62+ Senior Ticket. That's bad, but regular admission is $15. To my mind, that's way too much. They will however let you wander the first floor for free. Saw an amazing one-off Rolls Royce with round, yes circles, entry doors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/XrayShopper
50,World class Auto museum!,"After the recent renovation, the Petersen is clearly now one of the top auto museums in the world. The gallery with the amazing post war European cars in amazing ""original' colors is sensational. We have seen these types of cars in movies but they are always Black & White. Seeing the bold colors is very cool. My wife isn't a huge car fan and she loved the museum also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blubs99

There are cars here that if they do not blow your mind, you have NO BUSINESS being in a car museum. Besides the Nethwercutt, out of town a few miles, this is THE :PLACE. Concours winners, hot-rods and one off models are everywhere. Walk in and see the Bugati Veyron and it goes on and on from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LarryP858

You'll be encouraged to start on the 3rd floor and work your way down. It took about an hour to browse, and we didn't do the vault, so I could easily see an enthusiast spending half a day inside. By the time we reached the lobby again there was a line from the ticket booth (inside middle) almost to the front door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
50,What a surprise!,I had planned to visit LACMA this past Wednesday only to find it closed. It was suggested that I go across the street to the Peterson Automotive Museum. The museum has recently opened and the exterior is extremely inviting. Not being a car fanatic I was doubtful that I would enjoy what the museum had to offer. Wrong!!!

I visited the Petersen Museum this week while in Los Angeles and I really enjoy great museums. This one is worth the trip just to see. I was skeptical at first, the entry fee $15, but it was worth much more! The multi-floor facility is just packed with many rare cars, most that you will not see anywhere else. Every floor was packed with must see stops. My favorites were the Aston Martin cars from the James Bond movie Spectra. The 1963 Aston Martin DBS as well as the 2016 DBS custom Aston are just fantastic. Don't miss the ""Silver Room"" every car is incredible.

50,Hot Wheels!!!,"I visited the Peterson Automotive Museum in February with my children, and we all had a fantastic time.Not sure the cost for a one day pass. We got a really good deal for a yearly membership with Groupon. Regardless of the price, this place is worth the visit.The museum is 3 stories tall, and each floor is just as good as the others. You start on the top floor and work your way down.The top floor had classic movie and unique cars. The middle floor was dedicated to the different aspect of automotive production, and they also had a children's area on this floor. The children can also check out an IPAD and find 8 different check-in stations on the middle floor. Each station allows them to build a digital race car. The last station allows them to race the car the built. They loved it.The bottom floor had race cars and very beautiful elegant vehicles. Simply a pleasure to look at. They also had an XBOX video racing area, where you got to set in a race car seat and play the Forenza XBOX race game. The kids also loved this area.Throughout the museum they have lots of interactive exhibits and video displays.They also have a very nice gift shop. I did not see a snack bar or restaurant.Can't wait to go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SNAFU23

50,Trip of a Lifetime,"I am a car junkie, no other way to describe it. My partner took me to LA to visit the Petersen and we toured the Vault. My advice: spend the cash and take the Vault tour, you will see cars that are literally part of World history whether it be the personal car of a villanous dictators or the personal car of another ousted dictator's shoe loving wife! It was amazing.As part of the main tour, you'll see rare and exotic exotic vehicle starting with the first car from 1886. There are movie cars, one-off race and production cars, extremely rare and valuable cars including the $40 Million 1936 Bugatti Type 57SC on loan to the museum.We returned on Sunday for a Ferrari Cruise-In held on the third floor of the parking structure. We saw all types of rare and not-so-rare Ferraris (among others) on display.Worth the trip if you're an enthusiast...the tour guide in the Vault, Chris, was a wealth of knowledge and his passion was evident. It was a walking history lesson and an experience that I'll both remember and cherish as a fan of the automobile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tuckc2014
50,Newly renovated and a real jewel!,"I recall they said it was a $70 million renovation. Whatever, it turned out great. And if you read this and check the current exhibits and they still have the Rolling Sculpture exhibit, don't miss it whatever it takes. Wow! This exhibit is the epitome of the automobile as art and while you often see one or two of these Art Deco masterpieces, I've never seen so many in one place at one time. Stunning. We took the vault tour and highly recommend it if you have the time. About 90 minutes, and worth every minute as there are so many fascinating vehicles not on display at any given time. Not to mention everything else. Very kid friendly as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/backpackluxury
50,OPEN - Renovated and WOW WOW WOW. Schedule for 2016,"Get yourself to the Petersen Auto Museum if you have ever looked at a car in your life and enjoyed the visual.

This is recommended not some much for the cars, as for the story behind the cars or the car owners. This is a must stop for an car lover in LA. There is another museum outside LA that has free admission, but I chose this one for the tour, and location, and the space which was afforded to most of the cars. Some many are like ""masterpieces"" with their unique design and quality finish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MurrayM271

50,Wonderful collection presented in a beautiful manner!,"We visited this museum while on a long weekend in LA for a gymnastics competition. We had been once before, but it had been about 10 years. We really enjoyed our visit. One of my favorite things is the way they weaved video into the exhibits. So the area with the race cars had great race video behind it and the cars from TV and movies had video of the shows behind them. Everything is so nicely presented and the collection really is fantastic. The redesign is beautiful and the presentation spaces are great.

Peter Mullin did an outstanding job leading the rebirth of this museum; it's fabulous and absolutely unrecognizable from its previous iteration. Here's why I think it's one of the best in the nation:+They have some very current cars, including the two from the the latest Bond film Spectre, which raced through the streets of Rome: one of the Aston Martins and a prototype Jaguar.+The collection of classic cars is of concours quality. Many are one of a kind.+The exhibits are well thought out and well presented, with a fair amount of multimedia to bring the stories to life. For example, the Bond exhibit mentioned above features film clips of the race and interviews with the director, stunt driver and actors about the cars.+Drago restaurant is slated to open this spring in the museum's lobby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HvLuggageWillTrvl

The parking is $12/day and the entry fee is $15 for adults for the three floors of displays. The ""Vault"" is where cars not on display are stored. They offer a tour at additional cost that we didn't take. There is a small, starkly lit sterile snack area with vending machines and coffee. We enjoyed looking at the beautifully restored, pristine cars. My husband was hoping for more of the muscle cars of the 50s, but maybe they will be displayed at a later time. It's definite worth a visit if you're a car lover.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HalesLife
50,Peterson Museum...better than ever!,"We had visited the Peterson museum about 10 years ago. As car aficionados of sorts, we thoroughly enjoyed our first visit. We had the pleasure of seeing the completely new and renovated Peterson museum a few days ago. Again it was a great experience, and perhaps enhanced by the new presentation and new collections. They have almost every kind of automobile or motorcycle that anyone could ever find interesting from the James Bond cars, beautiful vintage autos including Voisons, DeLahayes and Bugattis, to tricked out hot rods. Plan to stay for a few hours and drink in all 3 floors of fabulous information and exhibits. The Peterson is a must stop for any visitor to the LA area! (Of note, they also offer a 75 minute guided extended tour into a vault area where there are 100 automobiles that are not generally available for viewing to the public. Great fun for those wanting even more)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/llmarson

40,Vastly Improved,"The recently remodeled Petersen Automotive Museum has been re-invented. The old Petersen had grown stagnate and stale with dioramas that had been displayed for years. The museum had began to feel like a tomb. The new version is a great leap forward in architectural design and automotive displays. The Petersen, now under the leadership of Peter Mullin, has been brought back to life. The lighting has been tailored to enhance each exhibit providing addition character and viewing pleasure. The wide variety of vehicles on display has jewels for every taste. Also, take a bit of time to walk around the museum's exterior- it's truly unique.On the down side - The museum now offers a ""vault tour"" for an additional $20. IMHO spend the $ on lunch. On the 90 minute tour we were shown less than half the cars in the basement and the docent, who seemed to demand to be the center of attention, focused on the ""celebrity"" cars. Not very interesting or informative if you are a ""car person"". If this tour were improved I would rate the Petersen as ""excellent"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sterlingroad
50,"New and Updated, and a little different","Completion of the museum restoration lured me to see the museum again. The museum is still 5-star, but it’s a different 5-star. I miss the old first floor with period cars done in themed settings. I loved seeing the collection of woodies. Or the recreation of a dealer showcase. The cars on the first floor are now impressive, breath-taking even, but they are far from the lives of most of us. It used to be a museum of all of us, now it’s celebrities – steel starlets.Overall, still it’s a great car museum with everything ranging from pristine Bugattis to “Cadzilla”.I took the Vault tour and loved it. It’s more than an hour standing in an imperfectly vented basement with someone telling you a lot about a lot of different cars that aren’t on display (and not in showroom condition). Don’t go if you don’t want to stand and listen for an extended period of time with the discussion being all about cars.A tip: also consider going across the street and visiting the LACMA or the tar pits/Page museum. And if you’re only into cars, then you have to venture north to the Nethercutt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tennisbump
40,Nice selection of all types of cars- very engaging,A really fun museum from car buffs to non-car people. Well presented. Well represented.

This was great for taking pictures as you're not waiting for people to get out of your shot, etc...$12.50 to park and $15 admission. For an extra $20 they'll give you an hour+ guided tour of the ""Vault"". There are 3 or 4 of these tours daily/no photography in the vault. I did not take the ""Vault"" tour to see their non publicly displayed cars. This place has three stories, and they recommend you start at the top, and work your way down. Third story spots cars from film & celebrities. Second story has racing simulator, a room containing F-1 & race cars, a design center, and a room for small children. First floor has several pre-WWII cars, and several one-of-a-kind cars, plus a gift shop. A restaurant is also being built on the first floor. I took several pictures, and spent almost three hours there. I could see myself going back here if out of town visitors or friends wanted to see the place. This museum is also very clean & well kept. Staff is courteous as well. Easy to find on Wilshire Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/997joep
50,Take the vault tour,"I was frankly surprised by how much my fiancé and I enjoyed this museum. The recently remodeled and reopened Peterson Automotive Museum is an impressive collection. You'll see cars which are intrinsically beautiful, cars which are historic because their technology, bizarre cars, cars used in movies, cars owned by famous people, and some which fit multiple categories.The car shot by Elvis because it wouldn't start? The Batmobile? Herbie the VW? A room full of 1930s Bugattis? Steve McQueen's Jaguar and motorcycle? Duesenbergs, funny cars, hot rods, and dragsters? Yep, there all there on display.If you've come this far, pay the extra $25 for a private tour of the vault. You'll get a 90 minute guided tour of the lower level of the museum where hundreds of cars are parked nose to tail. Cars owned by Sadam Hussein, cars used by Russian and Chinese prime ministers, Rita Hayworth's stunning ultra-custom Cadillac, Evita's Peron's convertible, a gold plated Delorean, and a Pope Mobile. Your docent will give you more details than you'll ever remember. And another security guard will follow your group to ensure than nobody touches anything.We spent perhaps 3 hours at the Peterson and were never bored or disappointed.You can park YOUR car in the museum parking garage for the day and walk to the nearby LaBrea tar pits or the LA art museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorM

50,Petersen Automotive Museum---Worth Seeing!,"We visited Petersen the end of December 2015---after the remodel. What's so impressive is not just the individual gorgeous cars but how they have been curated into collections! For example, the current ""Precious Metal"" Exhibit is visually stunning!Also for architectural lovers, the new exterior of the building is unique, wonderful and a great landmark.Plenty of parking, Ticket line moved quickly, and not far from the wonderful Canter's Deli for a bite to eat and great people watching!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/767maryh

The old original motorcycles blew my mind. Also they have a bunch of cars that were in movies with the movies projected on the wall. The one that flipped me out was the silver BOND car. The kids loved doing the arcade like driving simulator. There is parking but it is about 12 bucks as I recall. You can get your tickets in advance online if you want. They offer discounts for seniors, students and kids. Kids under 3 are free and there is a cool hands on room that is separate that they are sure to love.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFoolForTravel

50,Petersen Automotive Museum,"I was at the museum back in '04. It was totally renovated a few years ago and they did a great job. The exhibit I wanted to see was a collection of primarily 1930s cars: Delehaye, Voisine, Bugatti, RR, Mercedes. I had already seen some of them at the Mullin Museum up in Oxnard a few years ago but others were present from other collections.There are two additional floors in the museum with various exhibits. One room contained retired race cars from series such as Can-Am, Group C, IMSA and F1. Another exhibit featured very high end types of auto transportation: McLaren, Ford GT (including the 2017 - Wow!!!!), Masserati.Much of the facility utilizes an open floor plan so that most (not all) exhibits are positioned in various areas without obstructions from walls. You can easily move around even when there are a large number of people. If you have health issues and cannot walk, or just too lazy to climb the stairs an elevator is available. There are rest rooms on the first floor and I saw them on the third as well. (I wasn't searching but there is probably one on the second floor too).Parking is $12 at the facility parking lot. I wouldn't waste time searching for something on the street. Even if you found a spot it would be timed and you risk getting a ticket. The residential area is ALL permit parking so you would get ticketed there as well.The fee to get in is $15 - $12 for seniors. Active military is free but you must show current ID. Kids aged three and under are free.I was there on MLK Day and there was a long line to purchase a ticket. You do have an option of buying your ticket on line which is what I would do in the future. If you do that you can avoid the line and go right to the exhibits.If you're into cars, plan on spending about three hours there. Remember, this is a museum that will change exhibits. What I saw today may not be there in a few months.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Checkered_Demon

There are 3 levels and you should start from level 3 which looks into the heritage of motoring and boy do i love the antique cars on display!

A fun few hours, plus the building's parking ($12) is a great deal as the lot stays open until 11pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4783NNtammys
30,New Place Is Sterile And...,"..lacked the amount of exhibits for kids that it used to have. If you are planning on bringing kids here, you will be disappointed. Is completely geared towards car enthusiasts' only. Johnny Rockets? Gone! No eatery there now. I bought a one year family membership and will never come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crupi
50,Impressive,"While this may not be the largest car museum you'll ever visit, each vehicle is immaculately displayed with complete details of its origins and history.Floors are laid out by type and style of car; one of the most interesting areas are those showing the development of electric vehicles dating back over 100 years.For older visitors there are simulators that can be driven, whilst those younger can do the same on an X-box.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johnpsau
40,Appealing to both car lovers and history enthusiasts,"I tagged along with my husband to the museum, not expecting to find much that would appeal to me. I was mistaken-the museum covers a lot of history behind the evolution of the automobile but also the California highway system.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stitchin'goddess
50,Great museum for all ages and sexes !,"We tagged along with friends who insisted on seeing this museum ! What a fantastic experience , both visually and intellectually .The building itself is unusual and a great introduction to what you will find inside .We had 3 generations visiting , from a 3 years old , teens , car buff, and novice to this sort of exhibits ,EVERY person in our group loved it . Everyone wanted to stay longer , everyone learn something not only about the cool cars that are on exhibit but also about the era that those represented .It's a it's see stop of you are in downtown LA . Easy parking , even with the museum being very well attended when we visited , we did not feel crowded .its easy to navigate and well done !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cocobay
40,Just re opened!,"This was closed for remodeling, The outside architecture is very unusual, many people outside snapping pictures!! In side it now has more information for each car, history and if the car was used in a motion picture they show short movie clips of the car in the picture. It has 4 levels, the vault was not open yet, so I am not sure what is in there. But my 23 year old car enthusiast son enjoyed it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorirene5
50,The remodled museum is brilliant!,The museum and the vault just re-opened after a year long closure due to renovation. It was superb before and now it's even better. Be sure to reserve tickets online ahead of time for the Vault Tour ($20) in addition to the general admission cost of $15.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abF2455VD
50,Tour,"I went through a tour of what is called The Vault. For the tour, I had a tour guide named Forrest and he gave one of the best tours that I've been on. It was a very informative and the tour guide was very friendly. Along with The Vault, there are another three floors and a room for children to play in. Overall, it was a great place to go!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connors386
50,Surprising,"Being from the Motor City, I was skeptical about this subject matter and its treatment in the home of Hollywood but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, there are a few cars from the big screen and the small screen but there was nice collection of old classics on the first floor not to mention a Bugatti and a modified Rolls in the lobby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanhN3065NE
50,Amazing display,"If you are a car enthusiast this is a must, not overpriced at $15 each and car park right next to it. There is so many cars on display it took us a good 2 hours to walk around so plan for 2 to 3 hours for a visit. A nice gift shop but very expensive but also as unusual things you might not see anywhere else. Not sure if there is many eating places near by but they have food vans up the road opposite the Lacma museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monkey2009Cheshire
50,My grandsons and I spent an entire day there,"My grandsons [6 and 9] have been eager to see this museum since they heard it has a section devoted to Pixar's Cars, so I volunteered to take them when school was out. I'd heard good things, but this was even better than I expected. The 3-floor collection of cars, many one of a kind and all immaculately preserved, was awesome, and we didn't even go into the Vault. Some were so beautiful I felt like I was at an art museum, especially on the first floor where an entire wall displayed a constantly-moving series of images that matched the ethereal music.We were advised to start at the top 3rd floor and work our way down. Third floor is devoted to history of cars, with lots of old autos and motorcycles. There were several interactive displays the boys could do, but they really enjoyed sitting in one of the old ones for a photo op. The 2nd floor was the one they wouldn't have left except they got hungry for lunch. A large children's room has an array of interactive displays, toy cars to race and play with, and books about cars for all ages. They loved the Car-Pads, iPads for each child to use on a scavenger hunt around the 2nd floor that enabled them to design their own race car. What a fantastic activity for kids. Also there was an area where people could do X-Box type racing games where you sit in the driver's seat just like in a fancy/expensive video arcade. Boy was it difficult to get them out of there.One caveat however. No food is available on the premises, but there is a family area with tables and chairs where we could eat our own lunches. It also had some small cars to play with and books for the kids. So I recommend bringing your own food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/259maggiep
50,Incredible collection of cars and automobile-related items,"My husband is into cars. He has a 1960 Vette and is always eyeing old beauties. I like cars but I'm not quite so enamored with them. You would never know that if you saw me at the Peterson Automotive Museum. It is incredible. The work that went into creating the building and providing all of these cars, motorcycles, and related items is beyond belief. How did they gather together all of this and create this wonderful museum?About the time I thought I had seen my favorite car in the world, I would turn the corner and see something even grander. One of the exhibit rooms has cars that are painted white. Since color is so much of the aesthetic, leveling that playing field allowed the form of the cars and the details really serve as the differential in style. It was, by far, my favorite room in the museum. Don't miss it!! But, the Cars of Film and Television was fun to see and should not be missed either. Don't ignore the display cases. The second floor has many of them, each filled with something special like radios and other memorabilia.Three floors of fun wonderful things to see!!We got there around 1:00 on a Sunday and the place was packed. We waited in a very long line but it took only a few minutes to get to the counter. Adults are $15, Seniors $12, and youth $7. There is parking on site as well as on the street near LACMA (Sunday free street parking). There is no food but a restaurant will open some time this year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fro2
30,For the Car Buff,My husband enjoys this museum and the displays are ever changing. I enjoyed seeing a life sized version of Lighting McQueen and the Precious Metals displays. On my visit there were lot's of very young children that were running around and screaming crying. They were definitely NOT enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawn29t
50,"Petersen Auto Museum is a ""WOW""","We had visited the Petersen Automotive Museum several years ago and thought it was fine. With friends from Chicago in town we decided to put it on the list of places to visit. What a pleasant surprise it was! The recent remodeling is spectacular to see. The cars steal the show! The variety of autos on the 3 levels is incredible. The room that I call the ""silver"" room because the cars are mostly all painted a beautiful silver was breathtaking and some of the autos on exhibit were mind-blowing.One impression that I came away with was the spectacular designs of the cars of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. The sweeping lines, dazzling chrome and futuristic features were so far ahead of their time. Some of the luxury cars made me want to get inside and relax in the fine leather seats while other designs made me think of driving at very high speeds across the deserted highways of yesteryear.The Petersen is a must for a local or if you are looking for LA area treats for out of town visitors I highly recommend spending the 2-3 hours that it requires to take in all of the classics and collectable cars on exhibit there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jerald_Froschauer
50,revamped from the last time we were here,"I MISS MAIN STREET!!! IT WAS NEAT, SHOWED 1900'S TO 1930'S AND IT IS GONE, GONE, GONE.The outside is stunning as is the 3rd floor. There is a lot of information booths to view videos and gain information but the design center on floor 2, left us all pretty cold.The displays leave a lot of room to wander about but I like the scenes area like one they did on the 1920 with cars and clothes being showcased.The store lacks a lot...The shirts are blah...so we did not buy one for the two guys watching our home in ATL. The book selection is lacking also...Lots of wasted displace space in it. All we bought was a magnet.... the least we have ever purchased on our visits here.The new restaurant is not yet open but Johnny Rockets was always packed, fun to be there. Not sure how an Italian restaurant will go over. J.R. fit right in with the cars and an Italian place will not.The over all look is clean and sterile and while we enjoyed being there, it lacks warmth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/02corvette
50,A Must See for Any Car Enthusiast,"Firstly; wow. What an incredible and expansive collection. The display stretches across three incredible levels of variety and quality I didn't even know were possible.The Vault Tour led by Jeff was also amazing, with great information and pace. Well worth the extra money if you are considering it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdwardP46
40,Car museum,"Fantastic collection of very high end European marks. Lower floor had 30 plus Bugatti', Delage', and Delahaye. Second floor had a nice collection of silver 50's and 60's road racers. Plan to spend minimum of 2hrs going through. Line was ridiculous to get a ticket at 10:00. Surely they could fix this. Plan on $12 to park and $15 for unguided admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pyorrhea
50,AMAZING,"The car museum was full of classical cars and on the other hand it had the latest modern race cars. Amazingly, it has some of the rarest cars ever such as: the rolls royce ""round door"" (only one made!), the BUGETTI VERION (fastest car in the world!)and ferraries and even the car from batman! Even the exterior is outstanding!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/629rameshe

50,Wow!,"Wow! Thank you Mr. Petersen for collecting such fabulous cars, building a museum and sharing your fabulous collection with all of us to see. The newly renovated Petersen Museum is a must see. I liked the Petersen before, they really outdid themselves with the renovation. So much to see an do for all ages. Beautiful cars. The entire experience at the Petersen was breathtaking. A must see when in the city of Angeles, experience the care culture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAR411

50,Spectacular Cars and Must See Museum,"This museum has always been a great property to visit. Now with the new remodel, it is even better. I don't know which I love more, Christmas time or this museum. Be sure to add this to your list of must see car museums for the holidays. Dad doesn't need a new tie, he needs to go see these cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/route66motel
30,Beautify building that lacks classic American cars,"Beautiful building that lacks American made cars. If you love European cars this is your gem. Otherwise it might leave you cold. The interactive ""Cars"" movie exhibit is terrific for children and teens will enjoy racing the cars. The motorcycle display lacked Harley's and muscle cars did not make an appearance.Rumor is that the muscle cars were sold to fund the renovation. Herbie the Love Bug was also sold. That is all unfortunate as it should celebrate the California car culture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,Petersen Museum has moved upscale,"The newly redesigned Petersen Museum opened this past week and we were fortunate to be in town to check things out.Having been to the Petersen twice before on my trips to the west coast (we're from NJ) I was interested to see just how the place has changed.Turns out the museum has become less museum and more like an art gallery.....very sparse, very chic, very ""white"". Gone are the previous street and garage dioramas, that gave context to the cars on display and added interest. Now, almost every vehicle sits on a very sterile display platform perhaps 8"" off the ground. Lighting is very good, but if you're under 6' 2"" tall, getting a glimpse of an interior is all but impossible.Guess where I'm going with this is, for me, the Petersen has lost it's ""soul"".....it's connection to it's roots. It's now less about the history of the automobile in America and the Southern California car culture and more about generating oohs and aaaahhhs with the expensive and exotic.For a car guy, or gal, it's still worth the trip and a great value. It just needs a little more ""grease under the fingernails"" texture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/930waltw
40,It something the boys should see.,"This has something for all the family. The boys can walk around and has a great afternoon. The displays are good. They old and new, with some movie cars to make you laugh.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionaf709
40,Some fantastic vehicles on display,"Just reopened this week after an extensive renovation, the Petersen Automotive Museum has some fantastic vehicles on display.In particular I can highly recommend:Art and the automomobile - BMW commissioned artworks on their cars and Artistry of the Automobile - beautiful Art Deco era cars both on the Ist floor.Other highlights are:Hot Rods and Custom vehiclesAlternative Power vehiclesas well as a couple of vehicles from the latest James Bond movie SpectreKids can also have fun designing cars in the Pixar Cars mechanical InstituteWell worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kardy1
50,Beautiful Experience,"The facility by itself is mezmerizing - you can't miss it going down Wilshire. The layout is impressive, and all the exhibits are educational. It wasn't my first car museum, but I came away with new knowledge and appreciation, and having seen cars that you CANNOT see anywhere else. I plan on keeping up with them so that I can be alerted to new exhibits and events!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizdwhiz
40,Way cool place but missing most important piece--SoCal car culture!,I'm not a big car guy. This is my first visit to any auto museum. I'll go to more auto museums!Petersen is way cool but is missing some stuff.I love the concept cars and newer stuff (30-40-50-60's)Art cars--wish I had taken a pictureLoved the go really fast porschesToo many french-euro cars and not enough of where the true car culture and birth of hot rods flourished. This is clearly the result of Mullen ego--and that's a problem for all car enthusiasts.Petersen should have SoCal car culture display.Drops from 5 stars and a must see to that's fairly cool. 4 stars and thats cause the exterior is so neat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle

This was even with a few floors closed due to the due refurbishment. We 100% will be going back when its reopened again. Lots of history, lots of interesting information about Los Angeles, the vault and the tour guide was great, 90 minute tour actually took us 2.5 hours as we were so interested in everything they had to show us. The gift shop was amazing and we spent a fortune in there.

50,Motoring Mecca!,"Located at the corner of Fairfax and Wilshire about 5 minutes west of the LA Brea Tar Pits & Museum, the Petersen is now closed until December 2015, but we visited in February 2014, and were amazed. Not just about the cars either, but about the careful context in which they were displayed. Each is displayed in the environment of its time. Some of these displays, such as the 1950s era garage, are as interesting as the car in them. That one drew me back to my youth and my uncle's garage! The first floor traces the history of the auto and how it affected the culture: drive-in hamburger joints, drive-thru stores and Drive-in movie theatres among other things. The second floor has race cars, classic cars, vintage motorcycles and scooters, concept cars, celebrity and movie cars. On this floor we saw cars from Batman, Bond movies, Green Hornet, and some presidential limousines. The original Herbie VW is here as were cars driven by Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen, Clark Gable, Fred Astaire and others. The third floor has an extensive science centre where the car and its capabilities teach 'children of all ages' the basic principles of physics and chemistry. The fourth floor is a conference centre. But there is a basement too, and in some respects this is the most important feature of the museum outside the first and second floors. The public displays on the first and second floors comprise over 100 vehicles. The basement vault contains more than 200. Special, reserved, docent tours of this vault area are available for an extra fee, and are subject to an age restriction (no one under 12). The extra fee for this bonus one-hour tour is $25, more than the $12 admission to the Museum itself. There is parking under the Petersen for $10. No photography is permitted. There is a Johnny Rockets diner directly accessible from the Museum. The renovation will add much more interactivity, featuring 22 extensive exhibits, more than 135 flat screens, and many LED units, touch screens and projection units. Check the website for details on hours/days of opening, fees and tour details. Enjoy when it reopens in December of 2015!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etweeden
50,"Fantastic Building, A Work of Art on the Outside","The exhibits prior to the renovation were ok, but not mind-blowing. But, the new building IS mind-blowing and it's worth a trip just to look at the outside for free. It is a stunning work of art, IMO. It will be a fantastic addition to the neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mhb1954
50,great place for kids and adults too,"We went there on our last trip to LA and had a blast. We were looking forward for a repeat performance this trip and were disappointed to see that they were under construction.

50,Many visits to the Petersen. I'm almost an Expert!,"We have visited the Petersen many times with family and friends. They have a fascinating historical display of a little village of a bygone era complete with the earliest gas station pumps and vintage ""shops"". There are cars which one would likely never see anywhere else from vintage models to racecars to tv and movie cars including on our visist the Batmobile, Herbie the Love Bug and an Elvis car. There are presidential cars and vintage racers. Any petrol ead/ gear head should put this on the list of ""musts"" to visit when in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCMASONRLLY
50,Great car museum,If you are a car buff or simply enjoy looking at and interested in history of autos this is your place. They have revolving displays during the year so check out current exhibits on line. Was a little bit disappointed in the tour that allows you to go into the basement to see cars they don't have room for upstairs on display. That is an extra charge so be sure you understand what you are paying for. A great way to enjoy time looking back on the styles and history of automobiles. You will enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joee496

At the exit there's also a really nice shoppe for souvenirs and a Johnny Rocket's, which is really exquisite (the Jonny Rocket's has an outside entrance too).

It's a great way to see how transportation and technology have evolved hand in hand. There are also other transportation vehicles and memorabilia displayed.

40,A surprise day for my husband's birthday,"I just love cars and had been meaning to visit the Petersen for years. And wow the day I take him, it wasn't really busy, but they were filming an episode of Chasing Classic Cars there, one of his favorite shows and Wayne walked right by us. We fell in love with the red and green Steve McQueen cars. So many fantastic cars - it's like art and history meet the road. We both loved the displays especially the Packards. Later we learned that these two Steve McQ cars were auctioned off on one of Wayne's shows. We are sad it's closed for a year but can't wait to see the new things when it reopens. I highly recommend this place for car enthusiasts, kids, families - it's just a great place to look though history and start some wonderful and memorable conversations with your children and connect with your own inner car enthusiast even on a day by yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/concettah667

Been there a bunch of times and as a dedicated gear-head and former mechanic, this place rocks. But it doesn't rock when it's not open. We could not believe they couldn't keep one part open during the construction. We were totally disappointed. I'll give it a good review next time I go there but I'm getting on in years and so I don't know if it will happen. Totally bummed because this is the best collection of cars and motorcycles and anything wheeled in the world.

50,A Must See for Auto Buffs,"Firstly I have to admit it's been well over a year since I was here - some business function that I don't recall. I am not a car nut, but I still found the well kept and exhibited cars to be fascinating to study and learn about.I can't say that I would go if I had to pay the $70 entry fee.

40,Attention all Gearheads,"The Petersen has a great collection of cars and other vehicles dating from the earliest days of the automobile to the present. It also has some exhibits relating to the culture of the automobile, which has been a quintessential aspect of the history of Los Angeles. As you would expect in LA, many of the vehicles have connections to showbusiness - Fred Astaire's Rolls Royce, Steve McQueen's Jag and a Batmobile for example. Some are eccentric custom or concept cars. Most are just great cars. The Petersen is across the street from the LA County Museum of Art, and a very short walk from the La Brea tar pits. The three attractions could be combined in a great day out, and there are plenty of restaurants on the doorstep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RNPSHP
40,Great for any car buff,Such a great collection. One of the best recommendations that I got from a friend was to sign up for the newsletter. I did not realize how many great events are held on weekends there at the Museum. Very worthwhile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lagiant

I felt as if I was going through a time machine! So many cars, so many talks with my grandfather, so many movies!They have cars owned by Clark Gable and a motorcycle owned by Steve McQueen! Cars from Batman, Bugsy, and a car once driven by Elvis. If it good enough for the KING it is good enough for me!I had a good time and thought I would not! If you like cars at all you will LOVE this place, the history behind some of these cars is quite shocking! I had no idea! It was fun to find out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollyK263
50,Be sure to take the vault tour!,"We were on the beginning of a California road trip and had been attending the Barrett-Jackson auction in Las Vegas. We drove to LA to specifically visit car museums there. We arrived at the Petersen around Noon. On the way there, I read about the vault tour and called ahead to reserve spots for us. We were so glad we did! The vault was really amazing and as the upstairs museum is more devoted to cars in specific exhibits, we were able to see a larger number of cars. The guide was excellent. He had many stories to tell about the different cars. My husband's advice is that you should be sure to ask questions if he doesn't talk about a specific car you find interesting, because the guide will then tell you so much information. Many cars of the famous there. Upstairs is beautifully laid out. It was different than most car museums we have been to, in that it is more of an upscale museum with specific exhibits that change. As others have mentioned, there is a Johnny Rocket's there and that was really great since we arrived after our drive from Vegas and were hungry after the tour. It was great to be able to have a bite to eat before touring the rest of the museum. And a cute concept to have a diner format in a car museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HGH
50,"One of, if not, The Best Auto Museums","The Peterson goes beyond just having a collection of old cars. They place them on ""movie sets"". Quite unique for auto museums.

40,Car enthusiasts dream - - Vault or Not - VAULT YESSSSSS,"My husband is a car enthusiast, so why not spend a few days in LA on our way to Hawaii (oh yeah, Peterson Automotive Museum).I purchased tickets online before we arrived. I purchased tickets for the museum and for the Vault Tour. The museum was just ""ok"", it was in a little bit of transition when we were there. One of the displays that was advertised had just been taken down (a bit early), so there was a little void in the interior space. All vehicles are worth the look!However, the VAULT TOUR was well worth the visit. The vault had many cool cars to view. The gentlemen who gave the tour was very knowledgeable and interesting to listen to. There is NO Picture Taking in the Vault, so you must remember with your eyes!If you have a respect for the History of the Automobile, you will enjoy your visit. There is a Johnny Rockets attached to the museum where you can get a quick bite to eat to finish up your day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dillon66

50,Cars in their milieu.,"If you like cars (and in LA, who doesn't?), the collection of cars presented here and shown in settings similar to how they would have been seen in their heyday, is excellently crafted and (AFAICT) historically accurate. Good information is available on each car shown, and some background is also available. A good learning experience, even if only to see the cars in person. We had a great time, and learned from the cars and from each other. A definite must-see for any car-guy or -gal. It is conveniently located and has parking on-site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheriff88

50,Car Nut Heaven,"I have seen many great car museums and car shows, this is the best of all. I was fortunate to see the Harrah's collection in its entirety before most of it was sold off. The LeMay collection is impressive too. I have been in several private collections but what sets this one apart from the others is the way the display the cars in natural settings. A 50s station wagon in a 50s San Fernando Valley garage, for example. A separate pickup truck section, a hot wheels collection, motorcycle, even a big display of vintage gas pumps. It's all here. Plan to spend at least an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858chuckh

I'm still giving a high rating because I've heard how wonderful it is...and can only imagine how much better it will be after the renovations.

50,Talk About Cars!!!,"Unbelievable!. First of all the Tour Guide was probably the most informed person on any subject I ever met (been to zillions of places)!. Went into the vault, group of us, UC Berkeley Alumni, andlo and behold, cars beyond cars: original, historic, hot rods, cars from movies, head of state,cars made for women, luxurious cars, racing cars, small cars, 3 wheel cars, in never stopped.The colors, the metals, the grills, the historical development of cars, who owned them. Fascinating. Head of state car from Russia, China, Elton John, Jane Mansfield, Jack Nickelson, etc.Upstairs was a floor of cars with scenery, manequins in different time periods: 1920s, delivery trucks, gasoline stations, pumping of gas, logos, license plates, car companies both American and Foreign. Another floor was exhibits of Mustangs, Corvettes and hot rods and specialy cars with awards. Fantastic!. Had been wanting to go and an alumni coordinated this event.

There are lots of amazing cars to look at and the collection is always changing.The vault tour was very much worth the extra money. It was a 90 minute tour and you got to see the best of the collection. The tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beginningtotravel1
50,Great Experience,"I have both attended the museum, and work for a company that holds events there as well. It's fun for both event attendees as well as museum-goers. The staff at the Petersen is first-rate, and they change out the cars quite often. The displays are fun and describe not only the car, but the history around the car as well. This is a must-see for any car lover, if not the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA_Guy_412
40,"worth seeing, with a caveat","I am a car nut, so I judge a bit harshly (and I took in Nethercutt 2 days after, and this isn't that). Took the vault tour and at $34 combined I think plus parking, so I have some nits to pick. The vault was interesting, but static and the omnipresent security guard was a bit much. No pictures (uh huh). Most everything displayed side by side, so forget about seeing inside the vehicle. Not true of all, and they had a few stunners (round door Rolls, 2 Dusies at least, and there's a Tucker in the main exhibit). The vault guide wasn't much given to questions - no spacing allowed in the speil, though he was open to a bit of conversation at the end. Too much (for me) focus on Tbuckets and Kustoms. Museum itself has a nice slice of life feel to it; a scaled down version of the Henry Ford school of display. It is certainly a good museum, but if you want a great deal of depth - well, that's hard in a group of 25. I'd recommend it, but if time or money are tight, I add the qualifications.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
30,Very biased display,"Paid $ 15 admission each + $10 to park for a nice but very biased display of cars. Ford was almost over represented with a few german and english cars thrown in, mainly historic. Not one GM car on show except the Volt in the electric display and I'm sure they would have used a Ford if there was one that they could have used. Fairly disappointing to be totally honest, hopefully when they reopen, they will cover more makes other than 95% ford",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lync984
40,CAR COLLECTORS DREAM DAY!,"My brother and his wife were here from Arizona and suggested we visit the Petersen Auto Museum, which my husband and I had not heard of even living here in So. Cal. all of our life. Wow, what a great place to spend the afternoon. First off, it was a little bit of a drive from OC to Wilshire Blvd. but when we arrived, we parked in a covered parking structure and virtually walked 1,000 ft to the museum. The museum is set up to take you back in time and walk you through vintage cars all the way to today's cars. We enjoyed lunch at Johnny Rockets located right inside the building. We didn't get to see ""The Vault"" but we are going back when my brother comes to visit again. Thoroughly looking forward to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hisbux21

The museum is currently undergoing external works so it was a little confusing working out how to get it but once we were in it was great. He is a car guy and me not so much but I still found it extremely interesting and so well presented. They show a vast array of cars from early times to current along with special exhibitions. If you have the time and can afford the little extra the vault tour is amazing. So many unique and special cars. Including the vault tour allow at least 2 1/2 -3 hrs. Johnny rockets is also at the museum and a great place to have breakfast if you get there early as we did. Congratulations to the museum on a great collection. Definitely worth putting aside a morning or afternoon. Bus stop right out the front for tourist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franpaul
50,Explore the Vault,"We have spent time at this interesting museum in the past and for this trip to CA we decided to opt for the vault tour. This is what they bill as a 90 minute tour but our group was there for nearly a full 2 hours. The docent was very knowledgeable and informative. You walk around an underground garage while the guide describes each car. Since it's packed with cars, not only in the parking spaces but in the aisles, you are often inches away from very expensive an exotic vehicles. Of course there are guards always lurking to let you know when you stray where you're not supposed to be.The variety of cars was extraordinary from touring to racing to movie cars. I can't imagine what the value of the total collection is when a few of the cars were in the multi-millions by themselves. My only ""complaint"" is that two hours is a long time for me to stand and I could see others flexing their legs and stretching their backs from walking on the cement floor. Not sure how that could be improved but I fully expect to come back in 10 years and find this area turned into a Disney-like ride where the cars are offered on turntables while you sit in comfortable chairs ;-)This tour would be a perfect bore for children, if they are even allowed. this is a treat that should be reserved for the real car aficionado.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianem3

There were free popcorn, and other goodies we could purchase for a small fee. It was great to pass by these classic cars as we made our way to the screening room. At the end of the movie, my kids asked to come back during the day to see the other automobiles in the museum. We are returning this weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramone364

See you there : ),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YardSaleLdy
40,Under Renovation,"I always love coming here, there are plenty of cool cars and they rotate the collections around enough that you see something new each time. I took my family this weekend and the 3rd floor which usually had a bunch of cool stuff for the kids was closed. Seemed like some of the exhibit space was empty not nearly as impressive as other visits but still worth going for a few hours. Note that during the renovation the parking structure is open although it did seem closed and I heard from other visitors that they parked elsewhere thinking it was closed off. The façade was boarded up a bit but we were able to easily spot the opening for the parking garage. I think that the museum should offer a bit of a discount for the renovation time due to the 3rd floor being closed off and a lot of exhibits missing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andre2411
50,Visit to Automotive Museum,"The Displays were very good. The Live Interaction with the expert in the morning visit was thrilling as the expert was very knowledgeable. All in all, it is a must for car Lovers",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunilvk64
30,Reasonable collection of cars - one for diehards only,"Unless you are obsessed with cars or need to visit every car museum, I would give this a miss. I love cars, so found this museum a pleasant place to spend an hour, but at the time of visiting contained very few vehicles of note. I suppose as a Brit visiting a US museum it holds an interest because of the large quantity of US classics than you wouldn't normally find in any UK or European museum. So at $15 for the basic ticket and $35 for the full vault tour you could stay their pricing is optimistic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesSanders81
40,A very unique experiance...,"I am a native Angeleno and a current resident of Los Angeles. The museum is a one of a kind experiance that is constantly changing. There are a number of permanent cars on exhibit as well as highlighted marks, models and types. If you love cars you should visit, there is always something special to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KVSLA
50,"Great place, if you even like cars",Varied collection and VERY interesting. This is a must visit for families. Kids of all ages can enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulE_000
30,Not the most amazing collection of cars,I am a massive car fan and had heard of the Petersen from across the world so when I saw it was nearby I dragged my poor wife along to see it.I was quite disappointed with the main section however. It was more like a museum that had some cars in it rather than an amazing collection of cars. It is definitely more focused on the history than the cars themselves and there were no cars of great individual value.We did the add on vault tour which while being quite a bit of extra money was actually better to see. The cars down there were far more interesting to me. Sadly however that tour is very slow paced and even I started to get bored despite being car obsessed. I think for the casual fan it would all be a bit too much.I had pretty high expectations I guess and they were not met.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S_MurrayNZ
50,Awesome collection,Fantastic range of cars on display. Paid extra for two hours down in the vault to have a guided tour of the priceless historical cars that dont get displayed. Enjoyed my time there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/911shaneb
30,Where are all the cars???,"My dad and I went to the museum last weekend. Haven't been there is 15+yrs. We were surprised at the small number of actual cars to see. Yes there are some amazing vehicles that are rare or belonged to someone special but overall not as many cars as there use to be. We have been to the Nethercut and El Segundo car museums and would recommend to go there if you want to see cars. Also those two are free and free parking (I do recommend making a donation though). We asked someone at the museum and they informed us there is now a special vault tour (for more money) to see more cars. And they have many special engagements (private parties or the wealthy) so some areas were closed to the public on a Sunday too. But he even understood our comments on the lack of total number of cars. He informed us the museum will be closing in October for a year to remodel. Hopefully they get back to cars and don't make it an architectural and art show with few cars. I have a place in Deer Lodge, Montana and the car museum there next to the prison museum I think has more cars on display than Peterson. Also many of the cars only had info on the famous person that drove them and nothing about the actual car (engine model etc) To be honest Peterson is nice but if you are a car person go to nethercut or el segundo while in LA are (or come to the one in Deer Lodge, MT). Peterson has some one of the kind cars and very expensive cars just not enough cars. We read every item and were done in 90 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fishMT
40,"Fun free showing of American Graffiti, but surprise $8 charge for parking","We attended a free special showing of American Graffiti, with $1 milkshakes and free popcorn. Unfortunately, I was disappointed and surprised that parking in the Petersen parking lot was $8. We were running late, so parking on the street wasn't an option. It would have been good to know ahead of time that parking would have cost as much as it did.By the way, we've been to the Petersen once before and enjoyed seeing the collection of automobiles and learning about automotive history. Fun museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/892timv
40,night at the movie,i had no idea the Petersen had a movie night until PLB sent the invite. i wish i had known in advance about the parking fee. i would've walked if i had known about the fee in advance. since the movie was free i thought parking would've been free,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindabY6491RC
50,Great date night :-D,"Came to watch the American Graffiti on a date night. Nothing better than being surrounded by wonderful cars to watch a classic movie. And the milkshakes were delicious!The only issue I had, was the mother with her teenage kids and her friend in tow, sitting in front of us. They spoke so loudly during the film and she was busy playing with her phone (and forgot to shut the ringer off) , it made you wonder if they had ever been to a movie before. Just plain rude.Staff was friendly and cheerful. Thanks to the staff for making a fun evening for us. Only suggestion I can give is to maybe stagger the seats a bit so it's easier for everyone to see the screen:-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tbirdgrrl64
50,Cars Movie Night,"Although we didn't get to peruse the museum since it was after regular hours, the whole family enjoyed the Cars movie showing. They had free popcorn and they even had a surprise treat for the kids (and adults too)! The food that was for sale was also very affordable. Overall, it was a great family event. Looking forward to future events like this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nappy177
50,Awesomeness!,"Movies at the Petersen Auto Museum was a great treat! Free, affordable snacks and beautiful cars and bikes. Nice movie selection and all around fun. Parking is a bit pricey but there is select neighborhood parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnawhi
30,High quality vehicles,"I am a car guy so while on a Los Angeles vacation I dragged my partner to the Petersen. The cars they did have on display were exceptionally well restored, but all in all, there were not that many vehicles to actually see in the main museum unless you pay the up-sell price (which is more again than the basic admission fee of 15 bucks) to see the cars in the ""vault"". I am not a big fan of this kind of pricing structure as it feels a bit sneaky, but that is just me. If you don't go to the vault you may find that your non-car companions will find the museum ""just about right"". For true car fans the Petersen is not really worth the trip unless you pop for the extra fee for the vault.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royn98
50,California Dreaming for PetrolHeads,"The Petersen museum has something for everyone, the top floors are filled with great vehicles and displays that allow you to 'travel in time through automotive history' the details given on the display cards are fascinating even to non petrol heads like myself who had arranged the trip as a surprise for my Husband whilst in LA. However for the extra dollars I cannot recommend the 'vault tour' highly enough. The guide was so knowledgeable and passionate about his specialized subject that you couldn't help but be swept along on his vehicular magical mystery trip.Some of the cars that we saw literally made the hairs stand up on the back of your neck due to their stories and that of their owners, I won't go into further detail as I wouldn't want to spoil the surprises that are in store for future visitors.This is a fantastic collection of the most beautiful vehicles that you are ever likely to see go and be amazed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wickfoodie67
50,One Amazing Collection of Cars,"If you are a car buff like I am, you'll love this museum. What an amazing collection! And the really wonderful part of it now... they've finally opened the vault, which contains cars that you will never see in the the ""upstairs"" part of the museum. Why? Because they are too rare and valuable to risk being accidentally scratched. The vault tour is optional, carries an extra fee, you are escorted by a guard and no cameras are allowed. Why again? Security... can't have someone snapping pictures of the security setup.I highly recommend the museum and the extra tour of the vault.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/131RichardM131
50,Automotive Heaven on the Miracle Mile,"The Petersen met my expectations - and my expectations were high. It is a multi-faceted automotive museum where you could easily spend several hours traversing the history of motoring, not just in Los Angeles, but worldwide.Downstairs, you will discover the roots (and routes!) of California car culture through fantastic displays that you can actually walk through. Upstairs, there are many, many cars and interesting displays that cover everything from autos of Hollywood fame, to expensive exotics, to innovations in motoring. (The 3rd floor Discovery Center was closed for renovations).When I went yesterday, there was a great space devoted to the ""World's Greatest Sports Coupes"" according to a handful of celebrities. Some of the cars were nearly eye-watering.The price is fair - for an extra $20, you can check the ""vault"", which purports to feature many more, rare cars. I didn't opt for the vault on this visit. Plus, there is a Johnny Rockets restaurant right inside if you're hungry.Bottom line, if you are an automotive enthusiast, you will find a reasonably-priced haven for all things auto on the Miracle Mile.Located on the corner of Wilshire and Fairfax.Getting there by car: there is a parking garage on-site.Getting there by public transit: take the Purple Line to Wilshire/Western, then upstairs, get on the 720 Rapid bus to Wilshire and Fairfax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCJonB
50,Great Attraction even for those who might not consider themselves car lovers!,"I visited with 2 car lovers, and found the exhibits most interesting and fun. This is a great value, as well, with tiered pricing, depending on how in-depth your interest is. The higher priced tour of the Vault received rave reviews from my travelling partners, as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/922susanf922
40,"Take the vault tour, worth it!","Very nice museum with a lot to see. I visited with my son and we loved it! Take the vault tour if you like history and special insight. The upper part of the museum was nice enough although it won't take very long to see it all (1-2 hrs). Book the tour when you show up as it only goes every 1-1/2 hour or so, then see the rest. The vault tour was insightful and our guide was very knowledgable about all the cars he showed. The tour took 1-1/2 to 2 hours, was all on foot, and there were no restrooms in the vault (lower garage), also NO pictures allowed on the tour. There is a 50's type diner in the same building as the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertD931
40,Great collection - one of a kind,A great collection of beautiful cars. If you love cars (or just like pretty things) this the place for you. Be sure to check hours of operation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C7473PKmichaelg
50,Petersen auto heaven,"Many of the treasures from the Petersen Automotive Museum have featured on Jay Leno's Garage and it was one attraction we just had to see! Certainly not disappointed with the display of beautifully restored and original auto creations. Our visit coincided with the 50 years of Mustang and Town Cars - Arriving in Style displays.To ogle at two floors took an hour or two and for those with a stronger desire, upgrade your admission to the premium level to see (guided tour) of the vaults of cars which wait their turn for display.Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andybags
40,Interesting museum with a lot to see,"Adults could easily spend a whole day reading all the great info at the museum. Kids will enjoy it, but move through very quickly. Wonderful half day indoor activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuziReckless
40,Interesting auto museum,"For auto buffs, this is a very interesting little trip. The collection and condition of the vehicles and displays is very good. The docents are helpful and the trip to the place is not unpleasant. Overall a worthwhile expenditure of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chingachgook
40,Great Place for family,"Arrived here thinking i'd have to smile through another round of 'boys talking cars'.The museum is a wonderful experience which started in the parking lot with exhibits dotted around.The museum itself was clean & bright & the staff welcoming & all very knowledgeable on the exhibits. We did the vault tour first which I would say is a must,.Its 90 minutes of walking round the underground garage & children under 12 are not allowed.Our guide had a security guard with him as many of the cars are worth obscene money but oh are they wort seeing.Our guide was great and told us many stories linked to the cars & their owners.It gets hot down there but its worth it.Johnny rockets is in the museum & we fuelled up there before our tour.Again staff were great & food was delicious!Overall a great trip.Without going into the vault the 2 floors of cars & related histories & lifestyle displays were worth a visit in themselves if you have younger children.I'm sure we will visit again.Only downside - after being so wowed and enthused by all we saw - the shop was CLOSED for stocktaking!! I dropped my overall review 1 mark because of this.It was really disappointing & no warning was given.This should have been done in a closed to public time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joey2665
40,Cool museum,"Enjoyable lots to see if you like cars a bit pricey but well worth it, if your a car enthusiast! Lots if information and cars to view and see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matts_jones_travels
50,A fantastic experience for any gear-head,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Petersen Automotive Museum. It was a little on the expensive side if you wanted to visit ""The Vault,"" but this turned out to be well worth the money. The tour guide (Annie Octane?) was truly passionate about all things automotive, and the holdings in the museum's vault are really spectacular: the 1952 Ferrari 212 Barchetta that Enzo Ferrari gave to Henry Ford II is essentially priceless; you can also see a Popemobile, Saddam Hussein's Merc limo, Steve McQueen's Jaguar, and a variety of muscle cars, automotive works of art, and downright quirky vehicles.A 50 Years of Mustang exhibit is currently being staged, which I thought was pretty cool, too. There was even a Hot Wheels exhibit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ottawatraveller88
40,Enjoyable and informative,"I visited this museum on the spur of the moment because it is right across the street from the LA County Museum of Art. I did enjoy the museum but I felt it was a little expensive.I'm not particularly a car enthusiast but I appreciate good design and aesthetics and it was good to see how it evolved over the years as the museum takes you on a journey from the very earliest years to the modern high performance cars. This would no doubt be a great place to bring children or teens, I saw many excited reactions to the cars from the younger patrons as I was walking through.Some of the dioramas and scenes to house the vehicles have been very well produced, including the garages and autoshops from the 50's complete with authentic furniture, fixtures and fittings.My favourite exhibitions were the World's Greatest Sports Coupes showcasing the choices of celebrity guests, as well as the 50 years of Mustang exhibition. Both of these exhibitions end in October 2014.This was an enjoyable museum to spend a couple of hours and a definite for motor enthusiasts or families with children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lonewayfarer
50,The Vault,"Make sure you arrive in time to take a tour of The Vault! It is well worth the extra cost. You will be taken down into the underground storage facility of hundreds more cars and escorted through with a tour guide under the watchful eye of a security guard. The cars in the vault are very valuable and rare, lots of historical cars like: the first bulletproof Presidential limo (used by FDR), the Round Door Rolls Royce (insured for $25M), a couple Dusenbergs, several celebrity cars (Katharine Hepburn, Carole Lombard/Clark Gable) and other items of interest like bikes and unusual vehicles. The Vault tour is approximately 90 minutes in addition to your tour of the regular museum. The regular museum has a large collection of great cars also, a 1950s Mercedes 300SL, Jaguars, Aston Martins, Liberace's mirrored limo, Steve McQueen's cars, motorcycles, Hot Wheels and a large towncar exhibit with some interesting quotes from a chauffeur manual! We had a great time and could have spent more time there. For car enthusiasts, the Petersen is a must-see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAK314
30,Not that great.,"I love cars and museums, but this place has always been a bit of a disappointment. Like the Paley Center (formerly the Museum of Radio and Television), I feel like they are just a location to have events. By all means though, attend an event there if you are invited... but you're probably better of finding a car show to go to, if you are interested in looking at cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markwT471OW
50,Awesome Place!,"First, let me say, do the vault tour!!! You get to see 100+ (170 on the day we were there) and many of them have much history or uniqueness. Such as the round door Rolls Royce, insured at $25 million.The museum was very large and offered a wide selection of cars. I was worried it would be more hot rods than anything, but that was not the case. Cost is $35 a person for the vault tour and $10 for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshCory
50,One of the best collections!,"If you are into antique auto collections, this is one of the best, with a chance to visit the private vault where millions of dollars worth of the most pristine autos are housed. Worth the pay for the guided tour.......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Groves1960
50,Superb Automobile Museum,This is a very good automobile museum to go to when in the LA area. I liked the exhibits that showed both the cars and life style at the time. I enjoyed the short film about driving so fast on the streets in Europe. The car collection was very good as well. We stayed about 2 1/2 hours. There are special exhibits as well as some changes in car collection from visit to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
50,What a Cool Place!,We were looking for things to do near our hotel while my husband was in a conference and we found this gem. The Hot Wheels collection was awesome. My sons (9 and 12) loved every minute of it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coffeesmit
40,"Expensive, but good","General admission will get you two floors of early model cars and classics. For the price, I thought it was a bit expensive but the museum was very good.

40,All car guys need to go once,"I've been to the Petersen twice. Our most recent trip was on July 5, 2014. The theme/exhibits change from time to time. Check to see what's on display before you go if you have specific interests. There was a big exhibit on Mustang's recently and it was good ( I'm a GM guy) for Ford guys it was probably excellent! It's a little pricey $15/person,$10 parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greeley_COWizard

50,Husband was in heaven,My family loves cars so this was the place to go. My husband went on the vault tour (couldnt take my daughter she was too young. Kids need to be thirteen) he came back fron the two hour tour with the biggest smile on his face. You cant take pictures on the tour but he has some great memories. Would highly suggest going here if you live cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mom2marci
50,Car-vona,"This is my favorite car museum. Not only do they have a fine collection of restored cars, but they're displayed on themed sets on the first floor. This gives you a sense of not only stepping from car to car, but also traveling across time and place.They have changing exhibits on the second floor, so check their website to time your visit.Another thought: the Page Museum is right across the street and also worth a stop for a nice double-play.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tennisbump

40,Wedding Venue Review,"My husband and I attended a wedding here on Saturday April 19th.I've actually never been here before so we could definitely kill 2 birds with 1 stone.The parking entrance is located on Fairfax Avenue and was free for wedding guests. Both the ceremony and reception were going to take place on the 2nd Floor.I'm taking off 1 star because it was a bit awkward in the beginning. The invitation stated that the ceremony started at 6:00PM and to arrive on time. So we get there around 5:35PM and guests were told we were not allowed upstairs until 6:00PM. The front lobby area started to build up as we were all waiting. Eventually, the bridesmaids started arriving and even the bride and groom! They weren't going upstairs either.I heard from one of the bridesmaids, that the bride was actually upset about this. She never got to make her grand entrance since everyone got to see her in the lobby.Anyway, once 6:00PM hit, all of us made our way up.The ceremony took place outside in the 6,000 sq foot promenade. It was beautiful day and the sun was starting to drop. Following the ceremony, we had hors d'oeuvres and cocktail hour and the reception was located in the Grand Salon surrounded by cars on display.There are no restrooms on the 2nd floor so we had to go downstairs.During cocktail hour and following dinner, all the guests were free to roam around and look at all the displays which included the following:Gordon R. Howard Gallery, Hollywood Gallery, Art Wall, Alternative Power, Concours Gallery, Bruce Meyer Gallery, Otis Chandler Gallery, Hot Wheels Hall of Fame.They had cars from movies (The Hangover, Batman etc) and also the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles on display. There were also a lot of security guards around so that guests don't mess up any of the cars or displays.It was a very unique experience and very spacious. For once, you don't feel couped up in a room for the reception and able to walk around and look at things when you don't feel like participating in/listening to the Macarena or YMCA..... hah...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleneC393

This museum flows, it is like walking a path through time, you never know what will be around the next corner or in the next display hall. The architecture inside compliments the displays.

It truly was an education about the history of cars in America and related topics like gas stations, famous cars used in movies, license plates, etc. Free docent-led tours are offered and ours was outstanding.

40,Must see if you have enough time in L.A.,"This is a no-brainer for car enthusiasts. However, it is also very much enjoyable for those who love the spectacle. The museum is huge and has countless awesome cars, the Packard for example. Many of the cars are set in a certain theme, which immerses you further back into the times.The only drawback is that there is an entire area dedicated to Ford Mustangs. I love the Mustang as much as the next person; seeing one 1965 Mustang is more than enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshrafB862
30,Ok car museum!,"It has a large variety of cars, but mainly pretty old cars. The decors are great and the audio guide really helps you understand the history of the automobile if you have time to listen to all of it. I would recommend this to car enthusiasts. I think a car show is more worth it than this museum. If you don't have more than 3-4 days to stay in LA, there are better places to see/visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mprica

I quite liked the in dept installations such as the gas pumps and rail exhibit, but my children were quickly bored, which is to be expected. They did have a nice kids section on the second floor, but overall I'd say skip the kids and send DH and his buds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255suet
50,Brill,We found this by chance and it was good. Johnnie rockets is in here so had a burger first. the museum is very good and the bit about Hot Wheels is different.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oscarsmad23
50,Car Lovers Rejoice!,"The Petersen is getting better and better. If you love cars, this is the place to go to see a wide variety of vehicles without fighting the crowds at the L.A. Auto Show. The current Town Cars exhibit is fascinating. The new Sports Coupe exhibit is worthwhile as well. The permanent collection needs some updating, but is still really fun for families. The museum will be under construction soon, so try to visit before then. The vault tour is really cool, with some great docents. Good children's play area and party venue. Check out the live radio show interview on Saturday mornings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RabbiWendy
40,"Great for Car Buffs, not bad for others.","My husband loves cars, so made this trip for him, but I enjoyed it as well. They have very nice displays in addition to the amazing cars. We did The Vault tour, and extra charge, but it was worth it. It added about 90 minutes and I would have liked only an hour, but saw many different cars. Enjoyed hearing the stories behind the cars and their places in history. They have a Johnny Rockets inside the museum. Close to other museums and tar pits, so you can probably do one or two others on same day and park only once. They are building a new museum and it looks very interesting, would love to return to see when completed. Our son is 12 and did well on the tour. There is an attached parking garage to the museum and large gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curley888
50,Fantastic,"Wow, what a place! I've been waiting a couple of decades to have a chance to see this and it was even better than I thought it'd be. I was super excited when I saw that there were four floors, but there are really only two, with the 3rd floor being for kids and I'm not even sure what's on the fourth floor, but it said reservations only. There is a thing called ""the vault"" that you can add onto your admission for another $20, and if I would have had time I definitely would have done that. I'm guessing, that means there are more vehicles and exhibits downstairs somewhere..The displays and vehicles are great, a lot of work and money in there for sure. I would highly recommend this. Parking is right on sight (it was a fixed fee of $10 the day I was there, a Saturday). I didn't eat there but there is a Johnny Rockets on sight with both indoor and outdoor seating and good prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottyG777
40,Really enjoyed,"This is a great place for car buffs. A wide range of US cars with helpful and detailed information giving the car's history, background, and context. The street scenes make it interesting for kids and families. Also, there is a history of the development of the LA freeway system, which is very interesting for those of is from other countries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewA962
40,Man day/Vault is a Must,"My husband and 15 yr. old son visited the Petersen museum while my daughter and I shopped near the original farmers market. It was a short walk from the original farmer's market to this museum so it was a great time to split boys and girls. They stayed at the museum about 3 hours. They did the VAULT upgrade and agreed that you must do this or the whole thing is a bust. The VAULT tour is where all the good stuff is and where you learn all the information. They loved their ""guy"" time and were glad they went",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cearn
30,Expensive,Parking was $10 for 3 hours. Museum tix were $40. Not worth the money but had interesting exhibits. If we had known the nethercutt museum was free would have went there instead.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dumptrumpco
50,Worth your time,"My wife and I visited here during our vacation to L.A. It is a terrific museum with a terrific staff. When you visit make sure to purchase the ""Vault"" tour as well. You will get a wonderful tour of vehicles you will not see anywhere else. You can spend hours or probably a full day if you really wanted to. Located close to both the Farmer's Market and La Brea Tar Pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raymonds581
50,GO TO THE VAULT!!!,"What a treasure this museum is for car buffs! Took two boys to see the Vault, the large underground private collection of the museum founder. From vintage Ferraris to one-of-a-kind Rolls Royces and Jaguars to racing bikes and hot rods, this is an amazing tour with an excellent, well-informed guide. Pay for the Vault tour and enjoy it - we did!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NelsonP338
50,Much More Than I Expected,"I ended up at the Automotive Museum because the Arts Museum over the road was closed Wednesdays. I had a few hours to kill so decided to pay the extra and do the Vault Tour. This was fantastic. Our tour guide obviously loves his job and knows his stuff which made the tour very informative and enjoyable even for a non car freak like me. There were also free guides available to take you through the ground floor as an introduction to the museum. Lots of stuff, as well as all the cars, there's the history of the building the museum is in, history of LA. Spent about 5 hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JodieG68
50,Worth the money!,"If you are planning a trip to this museum, I strongly suggest you spend the extra money to go into the vault. Whether you like cars or not, the vault is a must. It is a guided tour of more than 100 cars and you will experience history you would otherwise never see. The guide is very knowledgeable about every car in the vault. The rest of the museum is amazing too, but the vault was by far my favorite. If you are in the area, it is a must see museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/370ryano
50,The Vault is a MUST,"We paid the extra money for the tour of the vault and I highly recommend it! Our guide was well educated on every car down there (which was hundreds) and they were unique and interesting. Each had its own history and story to tell and it stood out on its own against the rest of the museum. It's a little pricey, but the tours are usually small (ours was 6 other people) and you get up close and personal with some very famous cars. The rest of the museum is interesting as well. We really enjoyed the set ups for the displays of the cars and like how it helped to tell the story in an easy to understand way. This is someplace I would visit again after a while because they switch out and receive new cars regularly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/981alexandraf
50,Very interesting,"Soem ladies would probably not find this museum as interesting as I did but guys will be fascinated. The museum is not about just cars but everything which came with the cars - gas stations, roadside advertising, drive-in businesses. Basically the evolution of cars from early 1900's until today. Add quite a few classic cars on display as well, I guess some 20-30 of them. Highly reommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/popkutt
50,Thank you Jeff!,"Wonderful museum , you have to see the Vault. Jeff was a very good guide and very knowledgeable. We did learn a lot and did admire the restoration work done there.This was worth the time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sookeod
40,Fast and curious.,"The Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles should definitely be on the must-see list for any car buff. But those in your party who may not share your enthusiasm for all things automotive will also enjoy seeing the movie and celebrity cars. We were treated by our out-of-town guests to the Vault Tour. This is an extra cost on top of the already somewhat pricy admission fee. However, we felt it was well worth it. We had an excellent guide who took us on a 90 min+ trip through the history of the auto along with many unusual autos. Saddam Hussein's limo (creepy), Magnum's customized Ferrari, a Pope Mobile, and many other fascinating cars. One caveat: lots of standing on the vault tour. Tired legs and back at the end of it. You cannot wander around the vault on your own and no photos. Photos in the main galleries are fine. There is a Johnny Rockets on the site if you need lunch. The location is good for an LA themed day for visitors. The LA County Art Museum and La Brea Tar Pits/Page Museum are right across the street and the iconic Farmer's Market is just a few blocks away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OCOzzie
20,"Needs a facelift, new employees.","This used to be my favorite museum. After today, I don't foresee a return anytime soon. First, the special, temporary displays that rotate seem to recycle some of the same cars they have in other displays. The permanent display hasn't had any significant improvements in years. The Children's 3rd floor activities is also old, not updated, desperately needing improvements. The staff was not so warm at the front desk, the 2 women working on the kids floor sat behind a table on their phones and really did nothing. My son suddenly threw up on the floor in the kids section, so I walked him over to them to tell them of the clean-up duty, then we left. In the garage, my ticket wouldn't work at the exit gate, and the guy in the speaker told me I had to park and come back in to pay. I told him I didn't want to take my sick son back into the museum. So they sent out a manager with a clipboard. On the clipboard was a waiver for me to sign that I was refusing medical treatment! I told him I wasn't offered medical treatment, signed the stupid paper, and left. Goodbye, Petersen. Nice knowing you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinT872
50,Cars Cars Cars,Interesting museum with lots of great cars and interesting dioramas with the cars. Interesting for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel4bourne
40,A fun day,Visited in December 2013. Excellent displays. We didn't do the vault because it would have been way to expensive for 6 people - 3 generations. Wish they had more benches or places to rest for my parents. Enjoyed the history of LA section.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DB823
30,"Perhaps I missed something, but I wasn;t all too impressed.","Maybe its because we didn't have access to the vault, but I couldn't think that the regular exhibits on the first and second floors were mediocre at best (considering the admission price). There was a private event taking place during our visit so there were tables and chairs set up throughout the display areas, and various security staff were constantly asking to see our wristbands, The most interesting part of the museum is the selection of about 8 cars from movies such as Ghostbusters, Batman, James Bond, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craig_traveler
50,Classic Vault for special customers,"We spent 3 hours owing wowing and checking out Peterson's private car collection.Model A,Model T,historical show cars,one of a kind car,Batman mobile,green lantern car,first bike,first car.

50,It's absolutely stunning!,"Fantastic museum! They have these breathtakingly amazing cars! I enjoyed having my picture taken with Dr. Fate's car, and we brought my sister, a big 007 fan, a picture of the 2002 green Jaguar!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikol535
40,Make sure the vault tour is available,The first floor evolution of the automobile (mainly focused on development in the US) is nice.The collection on the second floor is limited and the Kia Optima superhero car exhibit is not very interesting for auto enthusiasts.Make sure to plan ahead so that you can see the vault tour (apparently well worth the extra cost) as those cars are only available to be seen with the tour. I came on a weekday and missed the tour so I did not get to see it which was very dissappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/446jeremyk
50,"WOW!!! (I don't need to go further, do I?)","What a place!! This place is fantastic, we just did the self guided tour as we didn't know if our legs would hold out for the 90 minute guided tour of the ""Vault"". Next trip WILL include that tour, without a doubt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sergeant2057
30,No photography in the vault.,"This was going to be one of the highlights of our trip to LA. The Petersen is near the La Brea tar pits, which is a good location. There are two types of admission, the standard admission gives you access only to the museum's upper floors, for a load of extra money you can go on a tour of the vault, This is where they store cars which are not currently on display. The biggest issue was that they do not allow you to take photographs in the vault (supposedly for security reasons) This is a fact that they don't tell you until you arrive and have paid. Very disappointing. The above floor parts of the museum have some nice street scenes and the few cars are nicely displayed. There are some gems in the vault and the tour guide was knowledgeable, if not that much fun to be with. The tour group was 15 -20 people. Steve McQueen's Lead Sled was my favourite. So would I go again probably not. Was I glad I went yes, but would have been much better with some pictures to remember it by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DwightDEisenhower
50,A wonderful walk through American automobile history and culture.,"Since the automobile is such an integral part of American culture this museum is a must-see. One floor is a walk through series of dioramas tracing the history of not just the automobile but how life evolved around it. Displays change throughout the year focussing on various aspects of the automobile and are exceptionally well done. In the basement ""the vault"" contains hundreds of vehicles ranging from presidential limos, Sadam Hussein's limo, cars of many celebrities, prototypes, race cars and many more. On our visit there was an excellent display of the evolution of the iconic pickup. Regardless of age, and even if you don't share a love of automobiles this museum is a must see and perfect for children of all ages also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterAZ
40,For the fans of cars is a must to go,"I have been here 3 times and everytime is more exciting than the previous one with many things different.Now that is being renewed for the coming months I hope it will be even better than now.I stayed there for hours taking pictures and watching details... and the store have some products not available in the stores, you have to search but it deserves the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albertom349

40,Take the vault tour,"This is one of the premier auto museums in the world. Petersen is the publisher of Car Craft, Rod & Custom, Sports Car Graphic, and Motor Trend, among other magazines. The collection is incredible, but the Vault holds the very best and most unique vehicles. It is a little more cost but very worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Billibong64
40,A Fun Little Museum for Gearheads,"Located on Los Angeles' Museum Row, the Petersen Automotive Museum is a wonderful tribute to the world and history of automobiles. With a great permanent collection on display, as well as regularly changing exhibitions, one can visit once every few months and see something new every time. The one thing to be aware of, though, is that food options are a little limited, and a full walk around the museum will probably take just over 90-minutes. But considering that tickets are just $15 for adults, I'd recommend the Petersen for a quick and fun afternoon with the entire family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaellE5725VO
50,If you can go to the Loft,"It was a bizarre start, I had to enter the place from what looked like a parking lot. The misconception that you have to be a massive petrol head to go here is untrue. That said if you like your cars you will love it. I chose the option to pay extra for the vault (think it cost $20 but please check), I'm not sure if you would need to book this in advance in summer months as i went in October i paid the extra on the day. If you go to the vault then allow at least 2 hours on your visit time. But it is truly worth it, you will not even notice the time. The tour guide was very engaging and even though he must have done the tour countless times his enthusiasm didn't appear to drop. i won't spoil the shown but there are couple of awesome sights. Apparently the owner has sold off some items in his collection, but still was amazing. F/N no cameras allowed in the vault, but fine in main museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/250jasonc
50,Not just for old car enthusiasts!,"My husband knew about this museum, being an antique car hobbyist. So, we decided to go while in the area to visit with family. Even I am so glad we visited. Well worth the admission price. We arrived about 9:15 and they didn't open until 10:00, so we spent 45 minutes in Johnny Rockets having coffee and a second breakfast! Food and service were great, but our server also validated our parking ticket for a discount and gave us a buy one get one free admission to museum. We purchased the ""vault tour"" ticket also. If you want to get the best experience you MUST do the vault tour. It took an hour and a half, but they take you through the basement storage of cars not on display, and our tour guide Kevin Blackley (I think), was very knowledgeable and told us details about every car down there. Awesome, amazing info! The museum itself covers the 1st and 2nd floors of the building. We've been through many car museums, but this one far surpasses all of them in terms of quality of displays and cars themselves. We had to check out the 3rd floor which is the kids' area. Would love to take my grandsons there...lots of fun and educational things for them. Great gift shop also. Allow at least 2 and 1/2 hours for the whole experience! I'll have to say the guy who have us the vault tour made the entire experience worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darwil2
50,Great!!,"Very easy to get to from Hollywood, catch bus #217 outside CVS on Hollywood Blvd and for $1.50per person you get there within 20 minutes. Entry fee is USD$15 per person and for anyone who is interested in cars, this is a must do. Would take about 3 hours to see whole museum. Approx 2 blocks from Farmers Market/The Grove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen1985

50,Great kid space,"The Petersen is a terrific museum for all ages with wonderful and unique automobiles from all eras. However, it's the upstairs area for children that is really a stand out. It's a museum where little ones can run and play with multiple toys and learning exhibits. Kids have free rangecoupled with a multitude of interactive, hands on displays.. There is a Johnny Rocket's restaurant on the premises which makes a great ending to an hour or two of educational play time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulajeand
30,"The displays were nice, but it is expensive for what you get","We took our boys (12 & 16) here on a recent trip to LA. The boys enjoyed themselves, but they would have liked to have seen more. The third floor activities are for younger children. We did not go to the fourth floor because we felt it was way too expensive ($100) to look at some cars!!It was nice to have a parking garage to use, because LA parking is a nightmare. But of course that added to the expense. Glad we went, but we don't need to go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fun2travel66

50,Petersen Auto Museum,"We had a really wonderful experience at Petersen's. There are 3 floors of beautiful cars, well preserved and informative boards in front of each one to explain what you are looking at. There is everything from new cars to the really old classics, motorcycles, trucks, race cars, etc. Really worth the trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommomb
30,Disappointed by the collection of cars.,"Staying here in LA for a few days before heading to the SEMA car convention we decide to visit the Museum. Having read the great comments and reviews about this Automotive Museum here on Tripadvisor, truthfully we where disappointed by the selection of cars at the museum. If you google picture Petersen Automotive Museum, you will see a far a lot more cars such as a Bugatti Veyron, Lamborgini models , Ferrari F40, etc none of which were there. Please be warned, as admission is $15 then an extra $25! to see extra cars at the basement, plus $5 for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Normy2013
30,Nice cars but nothing special,"I'm married to a car nut so we visit a fair few car museum/exhibits - the best I can say about this one is it's average, we did the main exhibit in under 1 hour. I thought it was quite expensive for what it was. Also I expected my credit card to get a fair amount of damage in the gift shop - as I said married to a car nut - bit again this was disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeddyScare68
50,We were impressed,"My husband and I visited this museum with a friend who lives near LA. The three of us were very impressed with the museum. It is well laid out, and they have some really cool vehicles. We spent a couple of hours there, and we found street parking right around the corner (although the museum also has a parking lot). There is even a kid's floor--I wished my grandkids lived nearby so I could take them there! We would all recommend a visit to this small, grand museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBT36942
40,Great museum for car fans,"The tix are expensive, and parking adds to that. There are some truly unique cars there. They have separate wings for trucks, for movie cars, art cars, and even a Hot Wheels display. They had a great display of hot rods that was cool to look at.They were setting up a VIP event to unveil the Maserati Ghibli while I was there, so some of the cars were blocked. All in, I thought there would be more cars there on display. I'm a car enthusiast, and I would've spent no more than 45 minutes going thru the entire museum, were it not for my friend who became enthralled with spending 5 minutes per car.Even still, in and out in 2 hours+. Not really sure it's worth the price, but if you're a car enthusiast it's a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/838greggr
30,Lacking in American Muscle Cars,"Visited this museum with my husband and daughter with the GO LA card. Nicely done, clean and well maintained, they obviously treasure their cars with attendants on both floors. Displays are well done and not ""cheesy"" set ups as in some museums. Took us about 1 1/2 hours to go through the whole thing. Stopped on the 3rd floor for a the daughter, sat in a race car and on a police motorcycle. Hubby was disappointed in exclusion of the Corvette, Camaro and even the Mustang. But, the museum does rotate cars in and out, so perhaps we were just on a bad day for what he was hoping to see. Bought a t-shirt, well priced at $20 and ended up with free parking because we purchased and didn't stay for hours. Would probably try it again on another trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dme3
50,"I'm not a car lover, but...","I never thought I would be a fancier of historic or unusual cars, but when I went to the Petersen Automotive Museum, that changed. It's a two-story, clean and well laid out museum, easy to meander from car to car. You don't walk around blindly, as they tell you what you're looking at and the history. What excited me the most was an old Helm's Bakery truck, which brought back many wonderful memories from childhood. I would say it takes a couple of hours to go through the museum. I highly recommend visiting; even if you think you aren't interested in cars, you will be when you leave!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/birdie57

I didn't know how long I would take in there, and we had two kids (6 & 9) in tow. We spent just about 2 hours and saw everything. I could have spent more time, but it was enough and since I took 100's of pictures I will never forget it. The store inside also was nice and many reasonable items and I have my memories forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffTraveler2000
40,Excellent Museum for the Car Buff,"A visiting brother-in-law specifically asked to visit this museum, so I tagged along. The estimated time to see everything was 1-2 hours, and that appeared to be accurate and quite adequate. My relative took a ton of pictures (picture taking is encouraged, unlike some other places in L.A.) and I even found myself (a non-car enthusiast) taking a few photos of the wonderful large fin cars from the 50s. The vehicles are all in great condition and in very professionally done settings. I really enjoyed some of the little ""sets"", e.g.old grocery store with vintage items on the shelves, a vintage gas station, etc.I enjoyed most of the museum, especially the really old cars from the turn of the century and Fred Astaire's Rolls Royce, but my relative snapped away and was thrilled with everything. They do some shorter term exhibits such as the pick-up trucks displayed during our visit. Not my cup of tea, but my brother-in-law snapped pictures of every one of them. Hint: his wife didn't want to do the museum visit, so I dropped her off at The Grove which is in the vicinity, and she very happily shopped until we picked her up after our Petersen tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentTraveller034
50,Many beautiful cars in great condition!,"I'm not a car buff by any stretch of the imagination, but the Petersen Automotive Museum helped me appreciate classic cars--their original beauty and the great work that has been done to restore some of them. The museum is well designed for easy foot-traffic flow, and the cars are separated into their appropriate groups (trucks, cars with fins, Hollywood cars, etc.). I loved seeing such a wide variety of cars virtually from the beginning of car history. Very cool museum. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brittany_11_10

The original batcycle was there from the 1966 Batman TV show and a batmobile from two of the early Batman movies.You can pay extra to visit an additional floor to see items that aren't on display to the general public.This was a fun museum.

The Petersen is a fine museum for the auto enthusiast. Tours are broken down to two different venues. Upstairs in the main area the displays are more contemporary in the styles and history of the automobile. This tour runs about $8 per person for groups. The most worthwhile tour however is the VAULT TOUR which is $25 per person. The Vault (which is a secured underground parking area) contains some of the most unique and interesting cars seen in our whole trip. Well worth the fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrbpm
50,A Temple to the Motor Car,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit. A well done, roomy, and laid back way to see the amazing variety of cars that have the world these past 100+ years. A very good gift shop and a capable staff made the visit highly entertaining. There's a Johnny Rockets eatery in the museum but we didn't care to use it. Parking is IN the museum building and not at all expensive. Enter the garage on Fairfax St.Try the extra-cost guided tour of the ""vault"" to see more cars for which the main museum hasn't the room to put in the main display area.Worth a visit for all car lovers. There's a small section of early motorcycles too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iH8Flying

Many cars are not roped off so you can get up close - but don't touch!They have a number you call and punch in a code to hear more about certain cars on you cell phone. Some of them are recording form the owner of the car. Very interesting.Took my wife, 11 & 13 year old boys. We are car buffs but all had a good time.

I was impressed with the number and quality of restored cars as well as the level of detail in the entire first floor ""California street set"". The second floor was also well done, though without the same level of set detail, and included exhibits on car fins, pick up trucks and vehicles related to movies. Admission cost of $15 pp is on the higher side, but again, we did enjoy the quality of the museum. There is a Johnny Rockets off the lobby which provides a good lunch option for your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrishG87

I understand they have a vault, my suggestion would be to pull some of those cars out and fill the spaces between the cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RT88394
50,Terrific Museum,Great place to come and see the evolution of the car! You start a time travel with a mock up from the 20's to current day. Good for family members of all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllyDee2013
50,Another fun place to visit with young children,"It is interesting for kids to learn some of the automobile history visiting this museum and also fun to play at the upper level playground. There are two ""race tracks"" for matchbox/hot wheels type of cars as well as some displays about how engines and cars in general work.For grownups there are many interesting items, I, personally was surprised by the Italian cars exhibition and enjoyed it much! I wish to visit again when they open the part that not on the regular display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LostAngeles
50,Great Auto Museum,"I didn't know what to expect, but it was room after room filled with some of the oldest cars, trucks and motorcycles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jmpeters
50,Petersen Automotive Museum,"We were going to the Petersen Automotive Museum. It is located on Wilshire Boulevard along Museum Row in the Miracle Mile neighbourhood of Los Angeles. It is one of the world's largest automotive museums, a non profit museum specialising in automobile history. Not the entire collection is displayed at the one time. There is only about 150 vehicles on display with the other half in storage.There are vehicles previously owned by ""stars"" eg Fred Astaire. There is also the BMW driven by Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible IV. Other vehicles from Batman and a couple of the Bond movies are also on display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kangatraveller_12
50,A must for everyone with even a mild curiosity,"I have no real interest in cars and I decided since it was walking distance from the art museum and tar pits I would stroll down the street to have a look. It was beyond amazing, beautiful set up and fascinating stories, really worth anyones time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lelanies_13
50,Must for a Batman fan,Went to this museum as son is a huge Batman fan and he wasn't disappointed. The museum really surprised us and was much more interesting than originally thought. Hot wheels was great and the third floor for the kids was great fun and really well thought out. There is free parking there if you need it. Very close to La Brea Tar Pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lottie73_11
20,Disappointed with the Petersen,"This was my second trip to the Petersen, the last trip was 2 or 3 years ago when they had more cars on display. Now they have a vault tour which costs an extra $25 per person. I left the museum feeling ripped off because we didn't pay the extra fee for the vault tour so what we did see were a few nice cars but it appears that if you don't pay the $40 (total for entrance and vault tour) you won't be seeing all that much. Maybe if I hadn't been before I would feel different? Forty dollars is a lot of money and just don't see why it costs so much? Go to Vegas and see many more cars at the Imperial Palace for a fraction of the cost... I'm sorry if this sounds to negative but don't expect too much here unless your willing to spend the $40. Also they charge for parking, another $6 bucks...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMas777_10
40,Beautiful restorations,"We enjoyed a visit to the Petersen on a Sunday morning in August. It was much quieter than we expected and we had lots of time to look around.We ate at Johnny Rockets, which was busy. The staff were struggling to cope with all the tables being full and service was slow.The cars are well presented and look wonderful. Some of the 'movie cars' are a bit 'B list', which was quite funny. (Bond car, but not from the 'good' Bonds, Batmobile, but not from the 'good' Batmen...)Bathrooms were clean.Overall, an enjoyable visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ravelling
50,A trip to the past,"My family and I had a wonderful time at the museum. Everything was presented so well and was far better than we expected. We will certainly recommend it to others. The Diner was a high spot since we had such a friendly, smiling and helpful young man as our server. He added a bright spot to the day. My only complaint is the young man who worked security. He accused me of touching a car in a very forceful and threatening way. I had been very careful and would in no way think of touching the car but I said I was sorry and left it at that. He could have been kind in his manner, even smiled, while issuing a warning, not a threat. I'm sure the management would rather give this impression. As far as the museum itself it is wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gloriaf665
50,Car Enthusiasts Heaven!,"Don't expect to be welcomed at admission - definite attitude problem - maybe she was having a bad day, but no excuse. The exhibits are displayed in the era of time - ground floor especially, great displays. Upstairs magnificent vehicles. Good value for money. Good security presence. Don't miss out on the exhibits in the car park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudithC903
40,BE ADVISED ...NO TEST DRIVES,I thoroughly enjoyed the Petersen Museum .My back was sore from dragging my wife and daughter from display to display explaining the historical significance of each auto .Some of the finest autos ever designed are on display .Everybody will come away with a different favorite car .It was enjoyable and educational .I highly recommend this facility .But remember ..NO TEST DRIVES ...it is not a sales showroom ...they are very sensitve about that .Sheeesh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomchuck19
40,Lots to see,"If you can brave the traffic down Fairfax and Wilshire, then take the time to see the Petersen collection. When we went, there were some special exhibits of choppers, baja motorcycles and pick up trucks but things move around and you won't be disappointed with any of their exhibits. Others mentioned that there is a lot of space in the museum but I thought it was nice as there were children's groups there when we went, so there was plenty of room to walk around the tours. My kids loved the hotwheels display and my husband was thrilled to see some of the hotwheels he had as a child. It is a bit pricey if you pay full price for the tickets (we were lucky to find a groupon) and parking set us back another $4 after spending $25 for souvenirs - so all in about $60 for 90 minutes - but definitely memorable and we did take lots of pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineess
30,Pretty nice car collection,"Though the car collection was nice, they had room for at least twice as many vehicles than those displayed. And the cost was a bit high than I would have expected...especially since there are other automobile museums in the area that are free (or by donation).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler1960
50,"If you love cars, this place is a must!","Whether you are a history buff, a fan of movie/TV show vehicles, or just love the aesthetics of the automobiles the Petersen is a worthwhile visit. They have many exhibits on rotation, and now they have even opened up the vault (many of cars which have never been on exhibit) for an added fee! It's always an interesting & enlightening visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mystica33
50,WOW!,If you like cars or motorcycles or trucks – this is a must place to visit! There is so much to see and the museum has done a wonderful job in providing great narrative enhancements – in both written and audio formats (you can use your cell phone as a free guide). There is something for everyone – a real fun museum experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cleomissy
50,I love this place,I'm a car nut and I visit this place several times a year. The collection and the exhibits connecting cars to Southern California is very well done.They have recently opened up the storage garage to the public for an additional fee. it is worth every penny. Don't miss it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianbeavis
50,LA Gem,"A great history of the automotive and its place in SoCal, there are some spectacular vehicles on display from the awe-inspiring to the quirky. Not too crowded on the weekends which is a rare blessing in LA. The museum has a treasure trove of vehicles and the displays are always changing so it's worth plenty of repeat visits. Great for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielaA279
40,new addition,"I really hate to see the museum waste money on this monstrous addition or whatever it is they are planning. the amount of money to build and then to maintain is outlandish. in my humble opinion, an auto museum should be about the cars and not a building that someone builds as a monument trying to make a name for themselves. I would much rather see the money spent on a very nice building with square walls that can be maintained and utilized for more displays. I think this will bring in more visitors and less ridicule for attempting to make a monument to one self.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/willardv_13
50,Excellent displays,"We are not ""car buffs,"" but we enjoyed this immensely.The layout, organization and general customer experience of this museum are among the best I've seen. This a quality attraction.Other reviewers have mentioned more details about the displays and cars, but I'll say I was most impressed with the old city street-- showing an old car dealership, gas station, and mechanic shop.One thing that I found super interesting was a small display board along the street scene that could easily be missed. It explained how the car contributed to the advent of the department store in southern California. It turns out the Petersen Automotive Museum is in a former department store building. In fact, the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures is planned for the department store building across the street. I imagine once that museum is open, the crowds are going to take over. Go now before they arrive!I would allow at least two hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/formeryogi
50,Wonderful collection,"The museum has two floors of display with the history of the automobile from the 1890s. They have Hollywood cars, Baja race motorcycles, a wonderful exhibit of the FIN era of cars, and original hybrids, steam and solar cars. The displays are wonderful and the cars are pristine. The third floor is for kids and has learning and interactive exhibits. The MUST see is the Vault. It takes 90 minutes and costs an extra $25. You must be 13 or older to enter, but it is a unbelievable treasure trove of automotive history. It's a combination of movie, heads of state, two of a kind and one of a kind cars and motorcycles you will never see anywhere else. I booked the vault tour as my stepson is a car aficionado but my husband and I also thoroughly enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/voyager52
50,well done and lots of fun,Enjoyed this museum. The first floor exhibits were very well put together with wonderful street scenes. Enjoyed the stars/movie cars section. And my teen boys loved the hot wheels display - brought back lots of memories! Worth the couple hours we spent there - would recommend to friends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DRG-ASG
40,Vroom! Vroom!,"For car enthusiasts this is a very impressive museum. Very informative displays on 3 floors cover the evolution of the automobile. Celebrity owned cars as well as famous movie vehicles (bat mobile, BMW from Mission Impossible, etc.) are all here. The third floor is a hands-on experience for the kids complete with a dress-up/play area, Pinewood derby racers and interactive science displays. The lower level houses ""The Vault"" for an additional $25 fee. I did not do this but hear that it is very worthwhile for those true die-hard car lovers. If in LA and you've done all the other ""touristy"" things, this museum will offer a nice diversion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLFLosAngeles
50,"Cars, Cars and more Cars",If you like vintage cars...don't pass this place up. Teenager loved it....I like looking at the Hot Wheel section,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivelkDying
30,left wanting more,"Only went here because the TripAdvisor reviews were so positive. I was impressed with the display of cars on the ground floor, but the other floors were a bit naf for me. Only found out there were more cars to see in the basement after the final tour had begun (an additional fee!). Might stick to car shows for quantity and variety of vehicles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidUnitedKingdom
50,Vault is a Must See,"The basic museum was OK, but the Vault Tour was excellent! We went on a two hour, guided tour of the basement vault, with an excellent docent. I think he could have talked for hours about every car. You will see one of a kind vehicles from the early 1900's to modern day. The tour is not cheap, but worth the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LBJPortland
50,Local Gem- Great even if You're not a Car Lover,"I'm not a car person at all, but I have been to the Petersen Museum several times and always find that it is a great day out.My latest trip was for the May Sunday Breakfast Car Show. My boyfriend and I have Smart cars and we went with our local group, The SoCal Smarties to display our cars. The event brought out many amazing cars from personal collections and is located on the top floor of the parking structure. It's a free bonus for museum visitors and I highly recommend going on the same day as the monthly event.The museum itself is really well done, with a lot of atmospheric elements and the education components slickly hidden beneath fun displays. It's engaging and you don't even realize how much you have learned until you are telling people about it later.They have a huge collection of cars from all eras and all styles.This is really a gem of a museum that we are lucky to have in Los Angeles.Please visit my blog for my review of the Sunday Breakfast Car Show at the Petersen, with tons of pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenH644
50,Car enthusiasts or not......,Everyone can enjoy this place. It is so much fun and really does give a history of our age with the cars on display.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/infaymous
50,C-7 Corvette,They had the new C-7 Vette on display plus a car show also took the tour of the cars in the vault well woth the extra money really excellent cars on displa;y,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hotsilver
50,A must see in Southern California,"The Peterson Museum highlights the impact of the automobile on American culture. There is an expected focus on Southern California and how the area was shaped by America's love affair with cars. A series of dioramas on the first floor take you on a walk through time with appropriate vintage autos on display. There is a free ""cell-phone"" walking tour which is an interesting idea.The second floor houses several rotating exhibit galleries. On our visit they featured movie and TV cars, a display on fins as a styling element, the Baja off-road race and Hot Wheels. There were a few noteworthy cars but fewer than I expected knowing the reputation of the museum.This truly is an Automotive Museum, not a just a car collection. A facility run by enthusiasts that understand the enormous impact the car has had on all our lives with an appreciation for the passion the automobile inspires in many.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Late_Apex_014
40,A Hidden Treasure,Great museum even if you're not into cars. The first floor is particularly nice with beautiful period appropriate displays framing the cars. This includes an old fashion gas station and similar displays from eras gone by. The second floor is for the car aficionado and essentially are autos only displays. There is also a restaurant on-site so one can have lunch while visiting the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/723Kingscroft
50,"If you love cars, this is a wonderful place.",It only takes an hour or two to go through this museum. It's well organized and full of interesting things. It's a nice stop on the way to the airport to wind up any LA visit. The cars and motorcycles just put a smile on you face. It's a lot of fun for people of all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dorkchester
50,Better than most car museums,"Every auto in this place actually runs. Some of the displays are in dioramas that are as interesting as the cars themselves. Information and pictures about how L.A. grew around the freeways is a plus. Eat at Johnny Rocket's 50's diner to enhance your experience. Parking ramp is adjacent to make that easy, too. If you love old cars, don't miss this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeD916
40,American Auto History,This is the second time I have been to the museum. A gap of many years. It's a great place to send an hour or so. History from the buggy days through to the days of aerodynamics. Lots of fins a race car history with videos of Indy car racing. Reasonable price for admission and on the day I went (Friday) not at all crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AL9999q
10,Disappointing. A Very few Mummified Vehicles,"What a surprise. A tired collection of a few vehicles scattered over two windowless floors. Worn diorama displays that lack the most basic information about the nature of the vehicles on display, their motors, their manufacturers. The kicker was to learn that the real collection is in the basement of the building and can only be accessed by paying a $25 premium over the ""museum's"" entrance fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/209PAT
50,Great to kill a few hours,Took my 5yo son here to kill a few hours. I love cars and enjoyed reading some of the history and my son loved the kids section on the third floor. Not a day trip but you can spend a good few hours in here. There is a good gift shop and a Johnny Rockets attached to it as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissMinelli
50,Los Angeles - Petersen Automotive Museum,"I'm not even into cars, and I LOVED THIS PLACE! You will see some incredibly interesting vehicles ... You won't believe your eyes! YOU WILL HAVE A GREAT TIME AT THE PETERSEN AUTOMOTIVE MUSEUM! Children ... adults ... everyone will love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackieG634
50,California Car Culture at it's Best,"Anyone who has any interest in cars at all should make this a destination. There is something here for everyone automobile-wise. There are also special exhibits that change throughout the year.Also, from time-to-time car clubs will stage special shows on the top of the parking structure. I recently entered my car in one for a memorial to Carroll Shelby. Great day and a nice view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikew938
50,Cool autos,They have a wonderful selection of classic and obscure automobiles. Plus a fun NASCAR room and a million dollar Bulgari.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terryw864
30,Cars,A little overpriced in my opinion. Managed to get through thr musuem in less than an hour. Interesting collection of mainly American cars. Accessible from Downtown via 720 Metro rapid bus.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manchester_UKSteve
50,Very cool...even if you aren't a car enthusiast,"My husband really wanted to go to the Peterson Museum during our recent trip to L.A. although I'm not a car enthusiast as he is, I was very very pleasantly surprised with this experience. The amount of detail and thought that went into these exhibits is still very impressive to me. They must have had the great people that work for Disney help out with some of the exhibits. The wax figures, the time period furniture, clothing, sets is unbelievable.The tour takes you through the history of the automobile and the different design changes through the years. Design failures and Design triumphs.There is also a section dedicated to hollywood cards where you will find the batmobile, and other famous vehicles. There is also a section dedicated to Hot Wheels and the history of the hot wheel toys by mattel. Very cool.We didn't spend the extra money on the vault but the $12 each we did pay for the regular museum tour was well worth the money spent. We were there for at least 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pfed
50,Take the Private Tour in the basement,"We were dropped on S Orange Grove Ave, right behind the Museum, where there is street, and a small lot for parking. We had lunch at Johnny Rockets and received a discount at the Museum ticket office. Nice start. We then spent that right away on a ""tour"" of The Vault. If you are going to go to the museum, then it is a MUST see and worth every penny! There were some 90 (?) vehicles downstairs that the tour guide gave us a history on vs some 30(?) on the display floors. The Ford GT, Newman's Jag, a Jag XJ 220, were some of the highlights. The static displays were very good, but nothing like getting some interactive history on their superb collection in The Vault.After our tour, some 1.5 hours, we spent about 45 minutes going through the rest of the Museum, and then shopping for a souvenir.Great way to spend an afternoon, lunch, then cars, cars, cars.Cheers,BritishehPS I had my teen boy, while my wife went shopping at the massive Beverly Shopping center 7 minutes away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Britishcanadianeh
50,Like cars? You'll love this museum.,"If you like cars you'll love this somewhat small but very impressive museum. The first floor chronicles the history of the automobile and its impact on SCal. Second floor has rotating exhibits; while we visited this time there was a history of fins on cars, famous movie cars, & an exhibit of hot rods. Third floor contains a small childrens' interactive zone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAHappy
30,lucky day,"Some unusual and rare cars kept in a clean but sterile building with no atmosphere.Very good if this is your thing but only good for half a day general interest.Luckily there was an outdoor Corvette show on the day I was there which was great but packing up by 1300 hrs.Plenty of food outside on ""gravy wagons"" but cafe was packed with a quege.Gift shop was pricy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/japurv
50,Great collection of cars.,"I was amazed that they had so many one off and prototype vehicles. Every car there is in mint condition, except for a couple left original for a reason. You might as well park in there parking structure, as there entrance is from inside there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffreyS969
40,Very nice,"We were very plaised to see all those beautiful cars. The aerodynamics part was great but we were sad to see that they switched the Veyron Bugatti for another car! In my opinion, and I know that it's an american museum but some companies were not present and they should have been there,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sk8cool5
50,A must for car buffs!!,This is a must see for all car buffs. The had a wide variety of different cars and exhibits. Barry McGuire was filming for his show when we where there. Cool hot wheels exhibit. Hollywood movie cars. Very nice gift shop. Great presentation of all the vehicles. Across from the La Brea Tar Pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erikb179
40,"Always enjoy the museum, the new tour is even more interesting.",They offer a tour of their 'garage'. The tour guide had lots of facts and interesting stories about the cars that are not on the usual display. The changing displays make going back worth the trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RAMspeed
50,Outstanding auto museum,"Outstanding auto museum. Even if you are not a car fanatic you will enjoy the Petersen Museum. Check out the movie cars on the second floor, quite neat. The manner that the cars are displayed, they are a treat, are also a treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,Fun and easy,"Great place not just for auto enthusiasts but for anyone. A wide variety of cars and their history are on display. Full displays of the era transport you back in time. Kids and adults will love it. We have been back a couple of times now and the displays are constantly changing. We were treated to the ""vault"" where cars are stored in the basement and saw the Pope mobile, Saddam Husseins limo, bat mobile, Elviras car, and JFK's limo. This section is unfortunately not open to the public but the vehicles are rotated in the museum. It is another great LA attraction!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffM844
40,Super fun place for car geeks,Loved the breadth of cars that they have. And it's just a fun place. My favorite was the old trailer mobile homes they had. Super cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sashu2
30,Fun place to take your boys,"I have a hard time calling the Petersen a ""museum"" its more of an attraction or fun place to visit with boys of all ages who are into cars. Nice place to have a boy's birthday party.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel72
50,Something for everyone.,"The Petersen is not just a big show room with cars lined up in a huge room. The extremely well done displays show how the car has changed the American landscape and society. Small signs at exhibits give you a toll free number to call for fuller explanations...so much better than the usual deadly dull talks on ear phone systems. Upstairs the displays focus on energy efficient cars, hot rods, aerodynamics, some motorcycles and yes, even hot wheels. The third floor has interactive displays for kids and you can reserve rooms for kid parties...including all sorts of activities. What a great idea. If hunger strikes, there is a Johnny Rocket restaurant with a retro menu of burgers and shakes. The museum seems to attract a wide variety of visitors, with a number of dads and sons...and some daughters too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YpsilantiFoodie
30,"Nice cars, weird set-up- tour of the vault super cool","Ok so the car museum part is a little too cheesy with it's set-up with dioramas & such. The cars are super cool, but I don't like all the fussy stuff they did around the cars. So the museum overall I give an ""average"" to.HOWEVER- they are currently offering 2 hour guided tours of the ""Vault"" which you have to pay for separately (and only happen 2x a day at I think 1pm & 3pm) and this was really cool! The ""Vault"" is the basement parking garage where they store everything that is not on display- it's HUGE. Also I just prefer seeing cars without any other fussy stuff around them- lots of cool stuff down there, definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachela72
40,Lovely shiny cars,"I know very little about cars, but I do appreciate the beauty of them - and there are some good looking cars at the Petersen! We went to the museum for an event and so got to see the cars as a by product of that - and I am so glad we did! I wouldn't have gone to the museum of my own accord, but to see it at night, with wine and food made for a lovely evening. I had just seen the movie Gangster Squad, so to see cars and costumes for that was pretty cool - as was the merc from The Hangover and the Thunderbird from Thelma and Louise. There are better museums in the area, but I am really glad I got to this, An unexpected treat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moogharrison
50,Have visited many times...,"As an automotive journalist the Pete is iconic for me. Named for and funded by the founder of Hot Rod magazine. Bob Petersen knew better than anyone how to 'give back' to the city he loved and to the industry that made him wealthy. Rotating exhibits are great, but the real draw is the tutorial it gives about the history of Los Angeles and the accompanying west coast car culture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickr442
50,"Amazing Collection, Close-Up Views","We toured when ""The Vault"" was open. for an extra $25, we joined a group of about 25 people with a docent who amazingly knew everything about almost all of the 200 autos and motorcycles in The Vault, the Museum's underground storage area. Fantastic. How that much car history gets collected into one room and how a ""volunteer"" knows so much is amazingWe also toured the regular showrooms on three floors of the main building, where many cars have been placed in period settings (a garage, gas station, or street scene). Very realistic and helpful when trying to understand so much auto history in a couple of hours. There is also an exhibit of Auto Energy Conservation showing how fuel efficiency has been viewed and has affected auto design over the decades. Even the display in the upstairs Kid's area was fun.I only wish they had more hoods raised so we could see the engines of the cars. Two of us were car nuts and two were not, but we all were surprised at what a fine time we had!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExplorerMundi
50,Exceptional - not to be missed,"The Petersen Automotive Museum, is in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles, on Wilshire Blvd. It is a registered non-profit educational institution. The building used to be a shopping center but Petersen found the near windowless structure would make an excellent Museum to preserve artefacts. (No ultra-violet rays). Four of us spent an afternoon to browse through all the amazing exhibits, cars, and miscellaneous vehicles they had there. They had a great Hollywood section. I saw Fatty Arbuckle's car. (If you've never heard of him, he was a rotund early movie comedian, whose career ended in scandal, and a murder trial!) The entire lower level was built almost like you were on the streets of LA in the 20s, 30s, and through the 50s and 60s. The other floors have exhibits that are exquisite. There were modern supercars and cars made for scientific studies. There were masterpieces with exceptional engineering. The place is as clean as a hospital. If you have an interest in cars, it's definitely a must-see museum. It’s only a 15 minute taxi ride from center of Hollywood (Loews Hotel-Highland Center).Hint: Set aside more time than you expect. Also, there is a Museum shop and a cafe ground level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelAugust
50,Pleasantly Surprised,"I'm NOT a car enthusiast, and when we accidentally stumbled on this museum, I had no desire to visit. I was out voted by the rest of the family. Boy was I wrong - had an amazing time and could have spent more than the 2 hours we had. I liked the exhibit of cars from the movies including the Batman, Thelma and Louise, Fred Astaires Rolls Royce etc. Not just the cars but displays and info on costumes, props, cinematography...not too much over whelming info but really interesting. Upstairs was a large hands on area for kids, where the boys enjoyed racing hot wheels cars on a large, steep track. There was lots for the younger ones to do! Favorite area was the ground floor showing the relationship between LA and the car. Recreated garages, diners, shops, homes that included incredible detail. This museum is well worth a look, even if you are completely non mechanical with zero interest in cars.Enjoyed a snack at Johnny Rockets which is connected top the museum- perfect theme!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CeeB_13
50,Surpassed my high expectations,I'm a car lover and this was heaven. Super clean and modern museum with excellent exhibits. I loved how Petersen displayed not only historic cars but also the modern supercars like the Bugatti Veyron and McLaren SLR. Admission was only $5 for students. We did the vault tour for $25 extra and it was the best part of our day. Our guide was excellent and told the stories behind all the unique cars the museum had acquired over the years.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MagnusB159
50,Even for non-car lovers,Very interesting and informative even for those of us who just drive a car. There was a great interactive exhibit about force and motion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosanneA123
50,Great Auto Museum,"I was lucky enough to be there for the 'Vault Tour"" . Only criticism was that no photography was permitted in the vault, some very unique specimens and excellent guides.

A must see for those who love classic cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palmerjer
50,Highly polished!,"We took the Vault Tour on 1/6/13. The Vault Tours have been extended to 1/25 (call to confirm). Our tour guide, Kevin, has an encyclopedic knowledge of their autos and motorcycles and relayed the information with humor and enthusiasm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socforward
50,Docent tour is outstanding,"This is a magnificent overview of how cars shaped LA (and how LA shaped the car industry). It is an outstanding value, and a must-see for any visitor to LA. It is a great celebration of what makes So Cal unique and yet defining America.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda235
50,A Must Do Visit,"Its a MDV (must do visit) great motor museum all the cars & bikes are in tiptop shape,something for all ages( I belive all the top floor is for kids),The museum seems endless so allow plenty of time around 3 to 4 hours,lots more if you are a motor fan and want to read everything,Don't take my word for it look at all the other reviews !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveC663
50,Enjoyable learning experience,"I'm not a car buff or a gear head, but this experience was a pleasant surprise. From the influence of the Italian designers, to the Batmobile to the realistic ""sets"" in which the cars are placed, this rainy day activity was a hit. The family wagon and the Triumph in the unfinished family garage of the 50s and 60s was spot on!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerrys881
40,Excellect selection of vintage and modern cars,This museum contains an excellent selection of vehicles from the early 1900's through to the latest sleek sports cars. The museum is well laid out with vehicles set in appropriate settings which include garage workshops to street scenes from that period in time. The museum is set on two floors with an escalator between floors. The description associated with each vehicle is comprehensive and easy to understand. Parking is available at the Museum for a reasonable fee and a 'Johnny Rocket' restaurant is part of the Museum. This museum is well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamH5
50,great day,The Petersen automotive museum was an unexpected delight. The car are displayed beautifully. It was a great day. I only wish we could have got there earlier so we could have had more time there. Great value.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesJ413
50,Fabulous car museum. One of best in world!,As a car buff I was in heaven. Dioramas are fabulous. Johnny rockets was great. Would return again and again. Parking on side street possible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmjesq
50,Great Collection,"Awesome car collection, interesting write-ups, and enough to fill an hour or two of browsing. The only downside was that the Bugatti Veyron was gone, but other than that, loved everything else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DevonE303
50,This is the Place for Car Lovers,Had a really great time at the Peterson. Was staying at a hotel along Wilshire Blvd. so just took the #20 bus to the museum. Only cost $1.50 and was dropped off at front door. Will also save on entrance fee if over 55.Got there around 2:00PM and was just in time for the guided tour. The man conducting the tour was a former engineer at Mercedes and brought a lot of insight to the tour. I would call ahead to see when the guided tours are since I think you will get more out of the exhibits than just walking around on your own.The guide told us that we were only seeing a small part of the collection and that cars are rotated so that you will see some different ones each time you come. Of course cars like the Batmobile are there almost all of the time. I enjoyed hearing about the car Rita Hayworth owned which was on display during our visit.We had a couple of burgers at Johnny Rockets which is onsite and then headed across the street to the Los Angeles Museum of Art. They have free jazz concerts in the main courtyard every Friday evening.We were going to visit the La Brea tar pits down the street but just ran out of time. You may want to do either before or after visiting the Peterson since its right in the area.Had a great day before heading back to the hotel on the #20.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelFleetwood
50,All car museums are cool... this one is a step above,"I can never get enough car museums. Even ones with just a few cars are cool. But there are at least two that I've been to that are a step above all the rest. The first is the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Museum in Auburn, Indiana. If you love cars, you must see that one.The other is the Petersen Automotive Museum. It's not as large as the ACD Museum, but it has a ton of extremely rare (or one-of-a-kind) cars. The first floor I believe is pretty permanent in what it has. A ""street scene"" (which seems like a standard at car museums) and a little bit of history of cars.The second floor is where it gets good. They have rotating exhibits up there. When I went this time, the exhibits were Italian Design and Aerodynamics. I missed an exhibit that I would have loved to have seen - Super Cars. I was hoping one car made the transition from that to the Italian Design - the Lamborghini Muira. Sadly, it didn't. I was also under the impression that the Bugatti Veyron was in the Aerodynamics exhibit, but it wasn't. Not a big deal. Not when you walk in and see cars like a Delahaye.I believe most of the exhibits last for about four to six months, so you can expect pretty regular refreshes.A must for any car fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mobycat
40,Ed Roth is not roth,By now Ed Roth ought to have his own postage stamp; it would greatly help the Post Office in sails with Rat Fink. Great for cars and guitars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerenceW459
50,Go if you can,"We were in LA for a conference which was in Downtown LA. It was easy to catch a bus from down the road from where we were staying. I am not a huge car fan but thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent here and definitely came away with some favourites. We had seen spectacular classic cars in England on this trip when we were at the Goodwood revival, but many of these were one of a kind. There is something that will appeal to people of both genders here. We had a bit to eat at the attached diner and considered the food to be tasty and good value for money in comparison to some other places we had eaten.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbeforeyoucant
50,If you love cars - a must,"I have wanted to stop at the Petersen Museum for quite some time. Finally, I had time on a recent trip to LA to visit. Now I am kicking myself for all of the times I was not able to attend and at all the special exhibits I missed. The place is simply amazing. The cars are well displayes with plently of lighting and space to get around and see the vehicles. On the lower level, I like how the cars were displayed in mock cities, roadways, etc. Maybe it was the time of day or day of the week, but it seemed like I had the place to myself. Cannot wait to stop by again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dad-n-son

It won't take long to get through the museum, but if you even remotely like classic cars, you'll like the Petersen Automotive Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachkindy
30,slightly disappointing,"I love cars...especially rare cars. The exhibits that the Petersen owns and the special exhibits they host have some awesome vehicles. But I am not crazy about the venue. I don't think it shows off the cars well, the ceiling is too low, and it is rather dark. It smells kind of weird too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferJ207
50,What a neat car place!,"If you have any interest in cars, do go here! What a nice collection of cars from various eras. I feel like I went back in time and saw cars from my youth.

I certainly will be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gizbab
50,WAY cool place!,"I've been here a couple of times. I've enjoyed walking through this immaculate venue and seeing the beautiful cars from years gone by. There's a restaurant downstairs (I think it's like a Johnny Rockets - really great hamburgers, fries, shakes). If you enjoy cars, this is a must-see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JER_1962
30,Good but not great,Nice selection of cars and well set out. Bugatti Veyron and Jaguar XJ220 my personal favourites. Had hoped there would be more film and race cars though - only a few racers and most of the film cars were ones owned by stars rather than stars of films. The HotWheels section on the Cars films was fun though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMTID
40,A Must for the Car Nut,"This is a great museum if you are a car nut. There are lots of interesting cars and exhibits. When we were there, a lot of their popular cars were gone (there was a lot of empty space) but it was still very enjoyable. This would not be a place for small children as the cars are off limits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null

50,Changes on every visit,"This was my third or fourth visit to the Peterson. I come to the LA area each October for a Hot Wheels Convention. Every few years we come back to the Peterson. Each time there are different things to see. There is a core of displays that remains, while other things are rotated in and out. I enjoy it everytime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankhamil

40,"Excellant, but.......","My wife and I toured the museum last Friday, Sept. 14, 2012, while visiting family in LA. We were very impressed with the quality, selection and settings in which the cars were presented. You could ""get up close"" and we really enjoyed the write-ups with the history or other interesting information displayed with each car. The exhibits are diverse, but conspicuously missing, however, were cars of historical significance in American automotive history. There were no Chevys from the '54 - '57 era. In fact, there were no GM cars from that time period other than a '57 Buick police car. Also missing were Corvettes and Ford Thunderbirds. There might be a good reason....if so, I would advise creation of a highly visible poster communicating that.Jack CipolettiCharleston, WV",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackC329

50,Do yourself a flavour and stop at the Petersen.,"Found the Petersen on TA and decide to stop by as first thing in the morning. Found parking attached and walked into the main lobby of the museum.Kept on walking into Johny Rockets for a burger. After a quick bite the server asked if we were going into the Petersen. He then passed over a 2 for 1 voucher which was good.The Petersen is spread over three floors. A street scape display on one and fantastic autos on tw and kids interactive on threeAutos range from current models to classic dusenbergs. Some movie cars and electric, turbine and steam powered.Enjoyed the morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greg8780
50,Do You Like Cars?,"I'm not a big automotive fan, so when I say I like visiting the Petersen, it's got more going for it. The ground floor has many dioramas featuring cars in realistic scenes and buildings, from cops hiding behind billboards to car dealers, garages, drive-in diners. The second floor is more traditional displays including Hollywood cars, and a Children's Discovery Center is on the third floor. There are also motorcycles. Exhibits change often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828

50,A blast from the past,"If you plan to visit LACMA across the street, a trip to the Petersen Auto Museum is a refreshing diversion from high art. Grab a 1950's lunch at Johnny Rocket and try to catch a docent-guided tour. The docents are knowledgeable and great entertainers, putting the collection in regional-transportation historical perspective. Try to watch the episode of the American Restorations (on the History Channel) restoration of the Pep Boys on display to get a feel for the effort involved in every meticulously restored car or scene in the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hankkacz
40,A must for auto buffs,"This museum has improved greatly over the years...display signage is well done, their rotating exhibits are always interesting & descriptive and there is variety in their permanent displays.

10,No F40 :(,"I was in LA for three days and visited this place three times, the first we could not find parking, we didnt know there was parking in it. The second was a monday and after parking and eating in Johnny rockets we found out its closed on Mondays. Then we came back on Tuesday, i wanted to see a Ferrari F40 which a flyer said they had, it turned out they didnt. I was really pissed off, though part of it was just my dislike of LA, it was kind of the last straw. Anyway dont go expecting an F40..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rowanhealy
40,Of Interest to Car Enthusiasts,"My 10-year-old son loved the Petersen Automotive Museum. As a historian, I found myself scrtching my head saying, ""Okay--neat cars, but what's the story? Why are some of these cars here?"" There doesn't seem to be any rhyme nor reason to most of the collection. I wondered what the curators were thinking. If they're trying to offer the public a building filled with interesting automobiles, they've been successful. There's not much beyond that, though. The museum's collection comes off as a bit of this and a bit of that.Anyway, upon entering, my wife and I were unimpressed by the woman staffing the ticket desk. She seemed barely alive and was unhelpful. She neglected to tell us that there was a kids' discovery center on the top floor. We would have missed it if not for a helpful gift shop employee who asked if we had been up there.Information on the signs next to the automobiles was appropriately detailed and informative. My son especially enjoyed the museum's collection of Hot Wheels cars.There is a parking garage and inexpensive parking on the street behind/beside the museum. A Johnny Rockets is attached to the museum. Allow 2-3 hours for a thorough visit with kids or 1.5 to 2 hours without.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsctraveler
50,One of the best car collections I have ever seen.,The Petersen collection is by far the best collection of cars anyone could ever see. They have such a unique collection. It ranges from an early quadracycle to hot rods to a life size hot wheels car. They even have a Bugatti Veyron on display. This is a collection for car lovers of all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BR4DW77
40,Well done - good for the whole family,"Peterson has a great collection of vehicles from all eras, and does a nice job with presentation to tell the story of early automotive history. Lots of rare early vehicles, but also some modern vehicles and even some supercars. Well done enough to even keep the interest of non-gearheads in the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bucsfans13
40,Fun Place for the Whole Family,"The Petersen Museum has every kind of car from the Batmobile to Fred Astaire's Rolls-Royce Phantom (which he brought back and forth between the US and England on the Queen Mary), so there's something to interest all family members. The Mattel's Hot Wheels exhibit is guaranteed to delight any small kids or big kids who still have some of these toys hidden in their closet. Visit the excellent Johnny Rocket's restaurant before visiting and they give you an entry discount.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/torontogal-99
50,A must-see for ANY automotive enthusiast!!,"My husband is a huge fan of anything automotive, so this was the first stop on our vacation. Our teenage daughter was with us as well, and we all found this to be a well-done and interesting museum.We know what we like when it comes to museums, if they are done well, etc. I would rate this one as ""Disney Quality"" meaning that no attention to detail was spared. The displays start in their parking garage. This is not just a walk-through with cars and motorcycles; the entire place is themed superbly! You walk down ""streets"" where the shops lining the sides are even detailed inside.We thoroughly enjoyed eating at Johnny Rockets restaurant after our visit. It's right inside, and has just the right vibe to end your time at Petersen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/disneygirl62
50,Disneyland of car museums,This museum is a fantastic bang for your buck. The dioramas and displays are like no other museum. It is well worth the price of admission and parking ( dirt cheap). Where else can you see high end cars and a Hot Wheels display room to die for ? There is something for everyone and all ages. The vehicles are stunning. A combination of a Barrett-Jackson auction and Disneyland type display for cars all rolled into one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LVaddict4life

50,An Outstanding Atuomotive Museum,The Petersen Automotive Museum is Fantastic. I have been there a few times and I have enjoyed every minute of it. They have wonderful display of autos throughout the museum and they did an excellent job of the scenery around the autos on display.

50,Car buff heaven,"My first trip to LA was to see the Petersen Automotive Museum above all else. I had only ever heard about the museum. I did not really know what kind of automotive history it would contain. It would be an understatement for me to say I was like a kid in a toy store. It was all like eye candy. I had been to the Henry Ford Museum but this was light years ahead of that. I saw the actual cars I had only ever seen just in pictures.Some of the cars I saw stirred feelings in me I did not know I had. For example I fell head over heels in love with a silver Porsche roadster. Totally unexpected. It just went on and on like that. If I tried to describe my feelings for everything, you would think me a bubblering fool. Trust me it was all that good and more.As good as everything was that I saw I was blown away when I learned that the exhibits are always changing. I want to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJL117
40,Very educational,"While there weren't as many cars as I expected at the museum, they did have a lot of very rare autos and a lot of information on the history of automobiles. There are three floors of exhibits, and each floor has a theme. There is a lot of information to digest, and I learned a lot from my visit. The third floor is geared towards kids, but it is totally woth it to go through even as an adult. It is fun, and you learn things that you didn't know.This is a great museum to visit if you love cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyv526

50,"Cars, cars and more cars","We had a coupon that allowed buy one get one fee on admittance and this made this museum even better value for money.Hubby and son were blown away by this museum, the only disappointment being that the Bugatti Veyron was no longer on display - we did get to see one on Rodeo Drive through.Cars from all eras were displayed as well as from the movies, futuristic designs, racing cars and even pedal cars and hotwheels. Motorbikes and scooters were also exhibited.The gift shop had a huge range of items, as proved by the amount we spent there. There is also a Johnny Rockets Diner located in the museum which was a good place to have lunch.I highly recommend this museum even if you aren't a huge car enthusiast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/puddletink

30,"A car lover will like, but not love","I always wish for more. Such a great location. Such a wonderful idea and yet it seems underwhelming. It really needs a curator with absolute passion to go in and create rolling exhibits (pardon the pun) around specific automobile era's, types, etc. I just feel as though a facelift is needed here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unprocessed_cook
40,Nice Auto Collection,Very Nice. Nothing like it in town. Petersen was a nice man and his love for cars comes out in the collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorRetired
30,Mix between Nettercutt and a Wax Museum,"Survey say, ""Its alright."" Not the worst, not the greatest. With stellar museums in the area, Getty Center, LACMA, Exposition Park, it is hard to rank the Petersen Museum as great. Perhaps, I am a bit harsh? As former Auto Claims Adjuster, seeing cars did not rank high on my list. I do respect the workmanship of the vehicles and the evolution of cars, the museum has provided. However, I felt it was not a great value. Paying $10 for entrance fee and then $8 for parking, it was not worth it. One can get go to Getty for parking fee. Exposition Park and see 4+ museums.One suggestion: make it a museum day. Hit the LACMA, Petersen, and Tar Pits on the same day. They are within walking distance. Guess, that why they call it Museum Row? Be mindful when parking lot ends and plan accordingly.If cars are your thing, then Petersen is your museum. Hands Down. Nettercutt comes a distant second. What sets the two the variety of activities and exhibits. Johnny Rockets, Kids area, and various exhibit. Vehicles are new and old. Nettercutt are mostly unchanged. Mostly vintage and classics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/galahad17
40,Only gearheads need apply.,"The Petersen Museum is very large in size but it's not packed to the rafters with exhibits. That's the good and bad news in one. If you're expecting hundreds of cars to gawk at, you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to see a couple of well-curated exhibitions, this is the place.They happened to be showing an exhibition on Italian design that included some very important pieces from Italy of course, but also from England and the US (that reflected an Italian aesthetic). It was just fantastic.You do have to be a little bit of an aficionado to really get the museum though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benja764
40,Great for car buffs,"I've visited on two different LA trips with my son, once when he was three and once when 7. At three he was blown away. At 7, he enjoyed it, but was a little past his car fascination stage, so he was less excited. There are a few good hands-on exhibits for kids, and a CHP motorcycle they can sit on. Adult car fans as well as movie and TV buffs will love it, too. Both times I've gone on weekdays it's been basically empty, and its convenient to the LA Farmer's Mkt, so good for a combined visit with that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/254SusanC

50,"One of the ""Musts"" in LA","We were so glad we made it to this museum on our last day in LA. You get so much appreciation for car history after the visit. There may be other museums, like Getty's and so on, but since we have travelled the world, we saw Luvre, Hermitage, St. Peter's, El Duomo and Getty's probably would not stand a chance against those. Petersen Museum is very unique and even if you have been to the Turino's Automotive museum in Italy, you would still enjoy this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cosmo003

50,An Eldorado for any car enthusiast!,"The Petersen Automotive Museum is located at the intersection Wilshire Boulevard /Fairfax Avenue, straight across the LACMA and not far away from Farmers Market and The Grove. This is not a traditional collection of vintage cars, lined up one by one, but a modern museum with cars and different kinds of vehicles from the last 100 years, displayed and explained in a way that attracts all ages. My personal interests are the cars from the 1950: s and 60: s and what is also interning are the original movie cars, such as the “Greased Lightning” from the movie “Grease”, the “Batman” car to mention some. There are for example electrical vehicles from the beginning of the 20: s century and a great number of concept cars, customized cars, rare cars that used to be owned by movie stars and some exclusive, modern super sport cars. The museum sometimes has temporary exhibitions, such as some years ago the original drawings from the animated movie “Cars”. This museum is a must for any car enthusiast and also my teenage daughter and her girlfriend were fascinated by the collection. There is a “Johnny Rocket’s” hamburger restaurant, in the building, right at the entrance in the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mietzner

50,Quality and originality over Quantity,"The Museum consists of two public floors telling two different stories. The main floor is a less altered display about the history of how cars and the City of Los Angeles grew together. It includes a dealership recreation, home garage and a diner setting taken from the real world. It is faithful to the city it depicts.The second floor has revolving displays. These displays tell a story of a type of car, period or other theme. The cars displayed seem individually selected to tell a specific story instead of simply placing many cars lined up as in most car museums. These displays are carefully coordinated. Most cars are approachable or easily seen from close range.Special programs are conducted from time to time about a display or a topic of interest to car enthusiasts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alextalksbusiness

An amazing gallery contains scenes of the LA racing scene which highlights 5 of the most famous auto shops all within miles of the museum. Amazing, all with Indy connections.

Varies from vintage autos and motorcyles to elite cars for the rich and racing cars. I do not go to car shows and I loved this museum. The midget racing cars are cool and my favorite was the purple 1939 Lincoln Zepher Scrape. Great for all ages. There is a Johnny Rockets restuarant inside. My only disappointment was in not seeing the MACH 5 racing car from my Speed Racer cartoon childhood. They rotate the cars and this one was in the vault during my visit.

Instead of room after room of cars, the first floor is laid out as a history of the auto, with rooms set up as vignettes starting with the earliest steam-powered buggies. One of the most surprisingly interesting rooms was set up as a vintage gas station, with examples of gas pumps from the very first hand cranks all the way to the pump of the future. On the second floor are the special exhibitions. When we visited, there was a tribute to racing legend Phil Hill, a display of motor scooters, and a large collection of supercars.

Great overview of the history of cars (mostly US perspective) but the exhibits expands to motorcycles and mopeds. In the 2nd floor they have a small Hot Wheels exhibit which kids will be interested too (but the whole place could interest kids, teens and families as well). The 2nd floor has famous movie vehicles and a great collection of sports car from around the world. You could stay here for as little as one hour or three plus when I visited in July 2011, it wasn't crowded at all. There is a Johnny Rocket's attached to the Museum and the gift shop had some unique t-shrts and books.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chaseihl

40,Hot cars with a historic twist,I took my family (kids 5 and 7) to this fantastic car museum. There are very few car museums in Australia and to find one in LA with so much range was a great delight. Especially my son who loves cars! They even have the Batmobile and the Herby Car and of course the classic cars from all time periods. There is also various gas pumps from different times. Hot Wheels and motor bike/scooter section is also very cool. The only disappointment was that there was not a few more cars for the kids to sit in and a few more interactive exhibits which they could definitely install! Automobiles have made a huge impact on the way we live our lives and it is important for people of all ages to be educated about the history and the beauty of these great inventions. It is short walk from The Grove and you can also get the bus to the exhibit if you do not have a car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bigholidaydreaming
50,"If you love cars - classic, muscle, cool cars","This museum is a hidden gem - my brother suggested as a way to spend an hour or two - I wound up spending 4 hours! I have always been a big fan of classic cars but the display on the out of sight (price wise) cars is totally cool. My favorite was the $1.6milllion Bugati with 1000hp - one of the most beautiful cars I have ever seen. My true favorite was the sky blue Jaguar at $500,000 (roughly) - never thought it was a Jaguar but again a beautiful car. As the saying goes - they just don't make 'em like that anymore. Take your kids - the docents are very sweet and a wealth of knowledge. Great Johnny Rockets on site too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BusTrav106

Set on 3 levels there all all sorts of cars to satisfy any car lover.My husband was a little disappointed that there were not more Hot Rods on show, seeing that that Petersen was the founder of Hot Rod magazine. However he enjoyed the trip just the same.We took a bus from Downtown LA, which took us about 30 minutes. The bus stop is right in front of the museum.Had a bite to eat at Johnny Rockets which is right next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowprofile1
50,Wedding Reception @ the Petersen Was Awesome,"I used this facility for my wedding reception and I have to totally give the utmost respect and thanks to the Petersen for totally going above and beyond to make sure my reception was awesome. Mandy Hanalon was exceptional. She is extremely professional, very accommodating, and a genuine person. The maintenance staff was excellent, and worked with me and my wedding planner in creating a seating scheme that was amenable to about 175 wedding guests that included children and teens.And let me not forget to tell you about the cars. WOW! Absolutely breathtaking. We were on the first floor, so our ambiance was late 19th Century to mid 20th Century. It was set up like a street and we had so much fun. The guests were able to look at the cars and party.I must say, we turned that place out, and the Petersen will never be the same. Even my 92-year-old grandmother was rocking in her wheelchair.My night there was unforgettable. BRAVO and thank you Mandy and staff. You were all absolutely fabulous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iExcursionista
50,Cars as art and history with a little Hollywood glitz thrown in!,"I planned this part of our trip specifically for the guys in my family; not really for myself, but I enjoyed this place more than I thought I would!When asked about our favorite parts of the museum, we each answered differently, so I guess this place truly has 'something for everyone.' There's the first floor that features diorama-type scenes to show how the development of the automobile contributed to the development of Los Angeles... I really felt as if I was stepping back in time.The second floor offers some movie memorabilia (the Batmobile and Herbie from The Lovebug remake were fav's...). Then there was the room of supercars where my guys could examine up close Bugattis, Maseratis, and Ferraris - the cars of their dreams. We also appreciated the section featuring Phil Hill, the best American racer in the world, and the cars from his collection.The third floor is a 'discovery center' for learning about the science behind cars, and my kids thought it was a great way to end their visit.We grabbed a bite at the Johnny Rockets in the museum after, but you should go there first because at the bottom of your bill you'll find a two-for-one admission coupon.Parking is $9 in their garage, and Johnny Rockets validates to make it cheaper, I think, but we went on Sunday so street parking (on the street to the east of the museum is close) is free on Sunday, so at least I saved there...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgn5cs
40,Excellent presentation of autos,"If you like cars, this museum is a must. If you appreciate historic presentations, you will love this museum. It is much improved over prior visits. The museum was reserved exclusively for my 50 year high school reunion and we all had a great time. .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ConcernedCalifornia
50,My favorite place to spend time in downtown LA,"If I ever have a few hours to kill in Los Angeles, this is the place to do it! More cars than you can imagine, many in their natural ""environment"". Nice gift shop as well. Cafeteria isn't much to speak of, but food is decent. And the people here speak car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markmcguire25
50,Great Find in Downtown LA,I'm not a real car buff I really enjoyed this museum. My 10 yr old has never been into cars either and he had a great time. There are very rare cars and even a whole floor dedicated to interactive play for young kids. It's a great find and just a block away from the La Brea tar pits Page Museum.We walked from our hotel near The Grove. An easy few blocks for even a 10 yr old.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Firstmmo
50,An Automotive History Adventure!,"This museum was a total surprise to us. We had visited other auto collections, but this was outstanding. The lower floor history of the auto and the Wilshire district and LA in general was fascinating. Beautiful exhibits and great information well presented. The special exhibit upstairs of the most fabulous European cars of the twenties and thirties and fashions designed to go with them was hard to walk away from. Well worth the time spent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catrinatravels
50,Great way to spend a couple of hours - superb layout,"We parked at the Rancho La Brea and did that first. A 5 minute walk brings you to the Petersen so no more parking fees. Thought we would try it on our last day in LA to fill a couple of hours. Entrance $10 but that didn't stop us, thank goodness! It was a superb place, the cars were displayed immaculately over several floors in some fascinating settings. I really liked the petrol pump display!! Good mixture of old and more modern vehicles.Very enjoyable visit, suitable for both petrol heads and people who just admire beautiful card.Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Somuchtosee01
50,Great place for the whole family,If you are a gear head like my family and I .. this is the place. Great history lessons. they are always doing different exhibits. My family and I go at least 2 times a year. If you have the money you can even host a party here. If you are a LA native this is a must that you visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgmancera
50,Heaven for Petrolheads,"This museum houses the most amazing collection of vehicles presented in really eyecatching ways. If you love cars (or scooters) whether old or new, you will find something here that will appeal. My absolute favourite was the Batmobile, but I found it hard to choose. Take a camera and wear flat shoes, you'll walk several miles. We ate at the burger restaurant attached to the museum and got 2 for 1 on the entrance fee, which was a real bargain. I believe you also get discount on parking if you eat there. As we were starving and the food was good, we were really pleased. You will need at least a couple of hours, maybe more - the only thing which stopped me was sore feet, as we'd already done one museum that day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mishkamitten
50,They Don't Make Them Like That Anymore,We visited the Santa Monica area for our sons granduation. After the graduation we all went to the Petersen Automobile Museum. Everyone was excited about going except me. But after going in and seeing all of the beautiful automobiles from all eras it was quite a phenomenal experience. Cars have defintely made quite a transformation over the years. The cars from the 40's to the 60's were my favorite with all the ornate body styles and chrome. The history learned was quite fun and interesting. It is definitely set up so that all ages will enjoy the experience. The service station pumps lit with their glass bodies were very interesting a beautiful to look at. Even had displays of solar cars which is quite interesting for those who are interested in more of the space age technology. Overall a very enjoyable tour. Don't forget to see the gift shop and to visit Johnny Rockets and enjoy a chocolate shake and fries.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeanette55
50,Wheels of the past,"This museum is a must visit for those who love cars. The place houses 3 floors of cars from the early days to present including vintage motorcycles, scooters ....even a display of every hot wheels cars ever made. A hidden treasure that needs more advertising I think.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travlady2
50,Be amazed in the automotive world!,"I visitied Petersen Automotive Museum during May 2011. It contains a variety of auto dating back to over 100 years ago till the very recent ones. It's a nice place to visit. It is located nearby Los Angeles County Museum of Arts (LACMA) which you can visit afterwards. Besides, the 0.99 cents shop is also a walking distance away from this place. You can easily get to these places by taking Starline Hp-on Hop-off buses. Red route passes by this area (stop number 9).The normal entrance fee is 10$, but as a student you can pay only 5$ which is a value for money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mehran_2008
20,not worth it - $10 enterance fee and I was back in my car within 40 mins,My wife and I attended this museum after it was highly recommended on trip advisor and I am a bit of a car nut. The museum is 4 stories tall but failed to meet my expectations. The cars were nice but there was only a few that interested me. $10 enterance fee and $4 for 30 minutes parking in LA was over the top. I felt it wasn't value for money. we then went to Las Vegas and felt that the Car Collection at the Imperial Palace was awesome. My recommendation - give Petersen's a miss and definitely check out the Imperial Palace Car Museum - it's 100% better than Petersen's. Sorry have to be truthful here - I was disappointed with Petersen's.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nevandbeths
50,If you love cars this is both brilliant and immaculate,"Bugatti Veyron, F40, F50, Batmobile, Herbie, its all there, in an immaculate setting, hundreds of rare cars.This place also has an immaculate and very cheap authentic 50's diner and a kids play area, where they can sit in an authentic NAsCAR and others.Finally some of the cleanest restrooms of any venue Ive ever seen !!!Well worth a couple of hours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lazyoaf
50,great place,"the petersen automotive museum is a really cool place to go with kids, families, etc. the cars are beautiful and the museum is amazing. it is maintained so well and looks beautiful. my kids loved taking pictures with all the cool cars. don't miss it when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bargaingirlsyosset
40,"Easy Parking, Inexpensive, Neat Cars","This is one of the most reasonable museums in LA. Easy to park here (and stay if you're going to bum around Wilshire Blvd). As a car buff, I saw a lot of unique cars I had never seen before. Its great that you are allowed to take photos (some areas you could not use flash). There aren't as many cars on display as other auto focused museums (Henry Ford, Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum) but the cars on display are for the most part one of a kind. We spent about 3 hours at the museum, reading every placard and stopping to take photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanprint
40,Surprising Fun Spot,"We stopped at the Peterson Auto Museum last week while in LA, and while I’m not into cars or anything, I thought the museum was quite nice. There were two floors of cars to look at, and since it wasn’t that crowded, we were able to see the museum in under an hour. It was pretty cool to see all the old cars and they even had a few from the movies.They have a parking garage onsite and will validate inside. So – if you’re in the neighborhood and want to see something different, I would recommend stopping in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferLynn
40,A lovely car museum,"This museum was SO much better than expected!We went here during our trip to LA and were not disappointed. They have a great selection of cars - it's not MASSIVE but takes around 1 hour - 1 hour 30 mins to do.They are excellently displayed and the information is very slick and not too wordy and boring for people who don't even like cars.They have an awesome section titles ""What were they thinking?!"" which had a selection of around 20 or so cars that we're prototypes and just some of the wackiest cars we have ever seen!Good fun for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shell4Andy
50,"We had a great time, fun for the whole family!","http://www.petersen.org/We went here on a rainy day during our recent trip to LA. This was one of those places that was a pleasant surprise! It was quite large with multiple floors and lots to see. There is also a kids area on the top floor with some interactive activities, books, coloring, toys, and more, so that was a bonus. Also, the museum has a large gift shop with lots of neat items.We enjoyed seeing many cars from movies we've seen over the years, particularly Herbie the Love Bug (the old one and the new one), and the Mach 5. There are many others as well, so you are bound to recognize some if you have seen movies with cars in the past. We also really liked the Hot Wheels section. My daughters particulaily liked looking through all those Hot WheelsTip: The Johnny Rockets (which is on site) had a special running that allowed getting 2 for 1 admissions to the Peterson Auto Museum if you ate there. Not sure if that is always running, or if it was just a special when we were there.Also nearby and recommended are the La Brea Tar Pits and LACMA (LA Art Museum).All four of us had a great time, so we give it 5-stars. Thanks for reading!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyVacationsMN
50,The Petersen Museum is well worth a visit if you'r a car fan or not.,"This museum doesn't simply display cars, it features them in interesting settings like an old garage, a car showroom, or outside a California house of the 50's. It also relates how the car affected other areas of life like public transport (or the lack of it), drive-in restaurants and movies, the history of gas pumps and gas stations, etc. Besides old cars, there are race cars, hot rods, custom cars, Hollywood cars, motorbikes, electric cars, Hot Wheels, etc. There's also a Johnny Rocket diner where you can eat lunch and have a chocolate milkshake. :) The museum is large with 2 floors, so allow about 4 hours if you want to read a lot of the signs. They give an AAA discount of $1. A quality museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwfr
50,MUCH better than expected,"I am NOT AT ALL interested in cars, but I thought that this place was wonderful.I went because it had a good write-up in a travel-guide, and I was in a mood to do some sights that I would not normally dream of visiting (e.g. the Ronald Reagan Library at Simi Valley). I went with a female friend (who is also not interested in cars, and not very interested in museums) and we ended up staying a few hours, until they closed.Some of the cars are just amazing. You can't believe them till you see them. But in addition to the deliberately bizarre ones (the batmobile, a Rolls Royce with round doors, etc.) there is a really fascinating array of ordinary ones and quirky ones.For example, when we went (July 2008) there was an exhibition of caravans and the history of mobile homes. Again, this might sound really dull, but the variety of vehicles was fascinating, as well as the historical context (many people bought mobile homes when they had their houses repossessed in the Great Depression, while others just wanted to explore the Great Outdoors of America).There are art galleries in other cities, but no museum like this: I recommend you visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JdeP
50,Great Stop for All,"Robert Petersen published a lot of the magazine titles hobbyists and enthusiasts read for years. It is only fitting that this museum carries his name.Unlike other car museums, this is not merely a collection of cars on display. Rather, most cars are set in dioramas, which give the viewer an insight into the connection between the automobile and Southern California culture. My wife, who is not a serious car buff, enjoyed the telling of history and the understanding of how Southern California became what it is today. In addition, there are a number of rotating exhibits, which add interest. We were there between exhibits, so a portion of the museum was empty. You may want to check the website before visiting to see what is there.We toured the museum on a Wednesday morning at about opening time and it was not crowded. Depending on how much of a “car nut” you are, count on two to three hours to see everything. Convenient parking is available in a garage next door for a ~$8 fee. There are other museums in the area, so with proper planning you can see a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/basicgrandpa
50,"Great museum, floors and floors of cars",First off we were impressed because the location is easy to find and there is plenty of parking around the building at parking meters. We only paid about $2 to leave out car for about 2 hours and we're glad we did because the parking attached to the museum was $8.We used our AAA discount so for 2 adults and 3 teenagers it cost around $32. They let you bring in strollers but no backpacks and they will hold them for you at the security office. You are allowed to bring in a camera.The museum has several floors and we spent about 2 hours looking around but the teenagers were done and sitting in the lobby after the first hour.The displays are in great detail and most areas are set up like regular street and stores from that time period its representing. The lighting is excellent and you can tell that a lot of planning has went into the different eras and which cars they use to showcase that time in our history.We went on a Wednesday in the afternoon and it was not crowded at all. There were many times that we were the only ones in an area. I did feel weird that the security was walking around so much. I wonder if I just noticed them more because there were so few people there.The museum has elevators and escalators so if anyone is traveling with someone in a wheelchair or has small children using strollers it would be easy to navigate.There is a Hot Wheels display that although it is a small area it is great both visually and is packed with information.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaSue24
10,think twice........ :( don't bring your young children,Absolutely horrible experience. An employee told us that our child could not touch the guard rail around an exhibit. It seemed like the workers followed you around making sure that you didn't sneeze on any of the cars. I'm an avid car guy and was totally disgusted with this joint due to the attitude of the employees. I will not be back and would encourage you not to go if this sounds bad to you. I seriously doubt that the man who founded the museum had this experience in mind when setting up the business.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j_hmadden
40,A must visit for car fans,"Visited here in October 2006. We called in on a Sunday morning at 9.30am, opening time. No crowds, so great to take time to see everything. I wanted to see the original TV show Batmobile and was not disappointed. Herbie the Love Bug, Jack Lemons car from Around the World in 80 days amongst others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussie064
50,Great Car Museum,Visited the Petersen Automotive Museum in February 2005 with my wife and 3 kids. The Petersen has succeeded to explain the evolution of the Car the impact on our culture. Perfect Car museum for families.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nikon
