50,Great AMC Theater,"I love this theater. It's always clean, never really crowded and the staff are great to interact with and always helpful and nice. They also have an IMAX theater, which is the best format to see a movie in. It also helps that it's pretty close to my house. I definitely recommend seeing movies here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottimusPrime
50,Great neighborhood show,"We attend this theatre once a week as the layout of the property seems well designed, the parking is plenty and the staff is great. They offer food products outside the usual and the seats are extremely comfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbajet

40,"Great movie theater, spend extra for IMAX","I've seen many movies at this theater. The parking is easy and there are at least 10 places to eat before or after watching a movie. You can order your tickets online then show your pass by printed means or from your Google wallet. No lines, no money to carry just your phone. I gave it one less star because the food choices are all calorie laden and over priced (bottled water) also if your movie is on one side of the concessions stand, it's ladies only and the other side is men. Maybe more family/gender neutral stalls would be nice. Add a dine and movie theater, I've been to one of those, nice change of pace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/822kelleyh
30,Expensive 2 hour movie,"Normally one maybe two ticket windows open no matter how long the line is to get in. Long wait to purchase food with usually only one cashier any time we have been to this theater. Food was extremely expensive but now outrageous as they no longer serve small popcorn sizes or drinks. Cost us over $20 for the smallest size drink, popcorn, and a small box of nachos chips. A $40 movie for us seniors is now more than many can afford or would even want to visit with the added frustration of waiting in lines prior to getting a seat. We are looking for a better managed theater that is hopefully more reasonably priced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aerocopter
