50,So much fun!,We had a blast with this exhibit. It was one of the most fun things we did on our trip to LA. I wish they would open more of these in other cities/states so more people could enjoy them. Definitely something that any horror genre fan will appreciate. All the staff were wonderful and made the exhibit even better. Would definitely go again if we have the chance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderer071981
40,Great but small and expensive,It was really fun! The place is made to have fun taking pictures in it. It would be of zero interest if you haven't seen the movies on display. The installation are amazingly well done. The staff is adorable and helpful. However despite what it says on the website it took us 30mn to visit and we made tons of pictures. I wish the price was lower. We had fun but my wallet hurt,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lutitlu
50,A must see for horror movie fans,"I was very happy this exhibit opened back up because I missed it the first time it was around. This is a must see for any horror movie fan, especially if you love taking photos. The details on the exhibits were amazing, plus everything is interactive so you are encouraged to touch (gently!!). Staff super friendly and on hand to assist with taking photos and provide suggestions and the best angles to capture the best shots. One member was even lying on the floor with me to get the perfect shot in the IT exhibit.Definitely wear something that allows you to move as you can really get ""in there"" on some of the exhibits, like the real coffin for example,and definitely bring a camera. My group was there about an hour and a half as we took our time getting shots, and no one rushed us.I highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarah1427
50,Scary Movie Selfie Fun,"If you love the classic horror movies: The Shinning, Beetlejuice, Nightmare on Elm Street and more - you will love this place. So many good photo setups with interactions and top notch lighting. The staff is very helpful too, taking as many photos as you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyntheWolf
