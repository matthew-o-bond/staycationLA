40,Fresh food,"We experienced Santa Monica Market on Saturday. It is a fairly small area you walk through quite quickly. However, there are still good selection of fresh fruits, veggies, bread, nuts etc. Parking was easy. If you happen to be in Santa Monica on Saturdays certainly worth checking out.",BeachStone2C
50,"First Class Farmers Market; Go for the local food, the experience and the vibe","Santa Monica has a few farmers markets; the downtown Wednesday market is the best. The Saturday morning Virginia Park market, which we attended today, is tiny by comparison. Tiny as it was, it was a great stop and a great way to finish our Santa Monica trip. Read on for details.Located near Santa Monica College, the free parking starts to fill early; we arrived a few minutes after 8am as things were warming up and parked easily. The vendors have arrived from 2-3 hours away in multiple directions. There were trays of giant strawberries, tables of beautiful heirloom tomatoes (at $3.50/pound), fresh flowers, apples, persimmons and an array of vegetables. Food trucks offered fresh juice, coffee and baked goods. The winner for me: beekeeper Don from Saugus and a jar of peach blossom honey.If you have never been to a farmers market and are in Santa monica when they are running, check it out; you will leave a fan.",doctorbobster
50,Guys. Just. Yes.,"Buying from local farmers and food producers is one of the easiest ways you can support sustainable, healthy agriculture. And the taste is so much better, it's well worth planning an outing. Bring your reusable bags! There's honey, bread, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, nuts, fruit, vegetables, cheese, lotion, flowers...all the things! They make it so easy and affordable to Shop Local. Super easy way to vote with your dollars.",Christine S
50,Get the strawberries,Great market with lots of variety of stalls and lots of acvitivites going on. I had the best strawberries ever here and still can‚Äôt get over them! Produce is very reasonable and it makes for a beautiful morning out.,Amy L
50,Lovely Market,I was in Santa Monica for 16 days for work. I enjoyed visiting the Santa Monica farmers market for breakfast on Saturday morning. I enjoyed fresh squeezed orange juice and pastries. The market had so much wonderful looking produce that I was bummed I wasn‚Äôt home to be able to stock my fridge with fresh veggies and fruit. Friendly people and great atmosphere.,proverbs321
40,Pleasant and small enough to visit quickly,"Good collection of local producers with all categories of food covered. Also plants and other stuff, good atmosphere, no hassle and seems like a friendly vibe. Drifted through here whilst looking for a cool shady spot for a drink.",Craig R
50,Beautiful market!,What a nice way to start Saturday morning. Grab a cup of coffee and wander through the stalls chick full of beautiful produce and flowers. Wish we had more time as we would've picked up goodies for a beach side picnic!,Mirandalou
40,Small but some nice produce,"The market takes over a few blocks of Arizona (not the pier) on Saturdays and had good fruit and vegetables. I was surprised by the low prices for great peaches compared to the crazy prices for cherries and strawberries. There‚Äôs not much in the way of breakfasts, just a couple of good bakery stalls, and I couldn‚Äôt see any coffee available.",mrdom
50,The best farmers market in the US!,"I may be biased but our Santa Monica Farmers Markets are the best I've ever been to - they feature the highest quality of fresh, local ingredients coupled with great atmosphere. There are four weekly markets, each with its own distinct character. The Weds SMFM in Downtown SM (Arizona Ave between 2nd - 4th St) is the biggest and best for celebrity chef spotting. The Sunday SMFM on Main St is fun for families and for brunch with live entertainment. The Saturday SMFM on Pico Blvd is the smallest and part of the neighborhood, and there's another on Saturday in Downtown SM. Try them all and see for yourself which one you like best!",88jet88
40,Heritage Square - Sunday,"We arrived shortly before the market was packing up & it was a great experience. More about buy & eat than fresh produce for the week ahead although both was available. There was live music, a chilled vibe - lots of people & their dogs etc. Close to Community Garden which is cute.",Caroline H
40,A fun market place,"Not that it's unique but like most people, I love markets. It changes the character of Santa Monica from an upmarket seaside location to ""almost"" a rural area. Lots of choice in produce although it is relatively expensive",RonWamberal
50,Medium-sized market with fresh produce,"We visited on a Wednesday and found so many organic farmers offering produce from all over Southern California! Great strawberries in March. Bring your own market tote if you plan to purchase. There was one lotion/soap vendor, one bread vendor (mostly olive-based loaves) and one olive oil vendor in the mix. I expected some crafts or jewelry as well, but this is a true market and not a crafts fair.",CleopatraBunny
40,Loved The Market A Lot...,I think that this is one of the best Farmer's Market I have ever visited.It is a wonderful≈ü feeling to walk around the market and also have the lovely clean sea breeze.I just happened here on our walk around Third Promenade while my wife and daughter were shopping.This is a great Market to grab some fresh fruit or sushi or cooked food and has very many organic varieties.Loved this place a lot.,Bilge S

40,Very good farmer's market,"Had a great time, lots of local producers, but not nearly as big and varied as I hoped. Prices were quite high also.",Pirate828
50,The best,"I think that this is the best farmers market in Los Angeles County. The Hollywood has perhaps a slightly better selection, and certainly better people watching, but this one has brisk sea breezes and super-clean air. It's worth the extra drive.",califcasl
50,Great find,"We just happened on the market on our walk around Third Promenade. Great place to grab some fresh fruit to take back to your room or beach. Oh Henry peaches delicious,",Steve B
40,Great farmers market!,"We went on a Sunday morning around 9:30AM and it was a great time to explore the market and stock up on fresh fruits and vegetables from the local farmers. There was a band playing and plenty of vendors to get pre-made food and drinks as well (we had coffee, aqua fresca, and a delicious egg avocado and veggie scramble on a coconut tortilla with salsa and it was a delicious and large portion). We bought fresh sourdough, avocadoes, peaches, and asparagus and there were also fresh flowers, pastries, meat, and art/craft vendors in addition to the produce vendors. This is a great market to spend a weekend morning at enjoying fresh food, music, and stocking up on fresh produce for the week! Not many vendors accept cards so would recommend taking cash (there is an ATM on site but you will pay a fee).",Emily T
40,Authentic,"At least the majority of stalls carry local produce and there seemed to be few boring, everyday knick-knack vendors. And, it was geographically neat and tidy. Luckily one was around on a Saturday morning.",DavidG897
50,Great place to walk and eat,"I love this farmers market, so much health stuff you can buy and eat. But if you were to go here, I recommend you go to Bezian, an older gentlemen who has been making bread for decades, you will have the best sourdough bread in the world, not only that, probably the healthiest, but don't call it bread, he doesn't like that. If you have time, ask him about the process, ask him how he makes it, how long he ferments the dough, why it is the best bread you can eat. Great place",sethmichaels2017
50,Original and Organic,"Loved the fresh produce, the drive and passion of the locals offering some great produce from potatoes to herbs to honey to bread to vegetables to coffee to cheese and the never ending list of food, glorious food",SydneyChin_Chin

20,Organic prices,"This is a Organic certified farmers market. Which is nice in one aspect but expensive to your wallet. I went on Saturday morning and i thought it would be a lot bigger but it wasn't.They have organic fruits, veg., meats, seafood, eggs. It's also not very wide so you're constantly bumping into people or they into you. There are a few food booths as well. There's also a bread booth. The location is very nice as it's only a couple blocks from the end of the street where there is a park and a view over looking the ocean. On a beautiful gorgeous sunny California day it's a grand place to be.",Shannon P
50,Santa Monica's many great farmers' markets,"Santa Monica holds several regular farmers' markets on different days of the week and in different locations. The big one, on Wednesdays, radiates out from the corner of Second and Arizona and attracts an amazing array of vendors, from fruits and vegetables, to eggs, flowers, meats and sea foods, cheeses, honeys, nuts, and plants. If you go early, you'll see top local chefs picking up their standing orders. The vendors are generally friendly and happily will answer your questions (although don't assume you can automatically take a free taste of what ever is on display). Saturday's market is all organic and is much smaller, on Arizona between Second and Fourth Streets. Same idea, smaller selection. Sunday's market is on Main Street, and is more family friendly. In addition to the produce vendors, there are several prepared food stands, and a small lawn where people sit to listen to live music. Last time I went, there were also pony rides for the little ones. All three of these markets put you a block or two from the ocean, so be prepared for foggy mornings, especially in June and July.",HAZinn
50,Not to be missed!,"Our Santa Monica Farmer's Market is one of the best in LA! Such variety, so many wonderful organic farmers bringing their bounty for us to enjoy. Fresh veggies, greens, fruit, cheeses, eggs, flowers! It looks fantastic, smell fabulous and of course taste great! You can sample almost at every stand and even get vegan cookies :-) It's very therapeutic to stroll through even if you are not shopping.",GOSIA P
30,Amazing produce,"First, who knew LA even had a metro? It was convenient to ride to the large and vegetably spectacular Santa Monica Farmers Market from downtown LA. Downtown Santa Monica stop is one block front the market. Citrus crop was the big star on my visit. Tons of stuff to taste and buy.",ChrisfromRoanokeVA

50,Nice Small Farmers Market,"We drove here from Carlsbad and it took about an hour on a Sunday. Parking was easy to find, the market was full of friendly people, great product, eggs and food. There wasn't anything I couldn't find here. They offer live music with plenty of seating under tents which is great in a rainy day or to get in the shade. I couldn't have had a better time. Love the market.",Vinnie1973

50,Fun way to spend a Sunday morning,"We visited the Santa Monica farmer's market last Sunday. It is very centrally located; we walked along the beach to get there. There was a wonderful assortment of vegetables, baked goods, and vendors selling coffee and breakfast foods. We grabbed some breakfast, sat under a tent and listened to a still drum band. A great way to start a day.",Maribel5951
50,Santa Monica Farmer's Market is the BEST!,"I've been to a lot of Farmer's Markets and I rate the Santa Monica one as one of the best. The produce is truly fresh and high quality, there are blocks and blocks of vendors, and there is something for everyone there.... not just produce!In addition, it is part of Third Street in Santa Monica and close to the mall, the pier, and ocean. I used to stop at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf on Third Street and pick up a latte and then do my shopping.If you are not on foot, public parking is available on 2nd and 4th Street, it's free I think for the first 90 minutes.",Leah B
50,Excellent Farmer's Market,"This is such a fun atmosphere! There is no better way to bring local farmers together with the community of Santa Monica and the neighborhoods around this beach city. There's plenty of amazing food, plenty of amazing crafts for kids and even pony rides. You can invite all your friends for a Farmer's Market Brunch and set up right there on the grass in the square... That's if you get there and there is still space to set up a picnoc brunch. Then you can purchase all your tasty goodies from the vendor's including your corn on the cob, polish sausages, variety of cheese, jams and breads including gluten-free and yes multi grain and nutty ones too. Beverages are also sold as well as of course fresh vegetables, fruits, nuts and flowers, orchids and the kind. It's a great way to spend your Saturday and or Sunday mornings. Biking is preferred but there is a parking lot available too.",Coachjo1
50,Great grazing!,I ran in to this on my last trip. I grazed through the stands and enjoyed all of the fresh options. It's a great place to stroll and see the local fresh offerings.,Todderup

50,Huge Selections,You have to go to this if you need items. Lots and Lots of fresh veggies and other food items. Found some spices there that are just not available at other markets. The vendors were very friendly and all had a good selection. The Market is very large but you can easily walk around all of it. It is in the middle of the Promenade and many shops and restaurants surround it. Ocean and beach is a block away. Prices are in the organic range.,Jim K
50,The best!,"I've been to farmers markets all over Los Angeles, as well as many different countries and this is one of my favorites. They have the best selection and variety and you can't beat the location just one block off the beach.",CignoNero
50,Main Street Farmers Market,"This market is open Sunday's on Main Street. We found fresh sourdough as soon as we entered, followed by page mandarins, strawberries, avocados at great prices, berries, multicolored fingerling potatoes (white, orange and purple), white and purple eggplants, cucumbers that we're golden yellow, heirloom tomatoes, lettuce bigger than my head, broccoli, green beans, baby carrots, and pastry. All of that and we didn't stop at half the stalls. If you're hungry, booths are set up to sell prepared food from inlet ted and waffles to sandwiches and burritos. Great for small children with music in the front and a small grass area.",CindyZach
30,Eh...average,"I came here to find some good food. Sure, there were plenty of vegetables and some fruit, but I did not find any of the other vendors usually making an appearance at these things like bakeries, restaurants, etc. I would not suggest making a special trip to this one unless you're also continuing the day to either the beach or the third street promenade.",Erika G
50,Great market,Visited this and bought some organic blood orange olive oil - tastes so nice. Strawberries and raspberries to test - so much tastier than back home. All sorts of fruit and veg. Bought jam too. Great atmosphere wish we had this back home.,samfis

30,Fresh from farms,"On our third day in Santa Monica , we managed to visit Farmer Market along 2nd Street next to the Promenade. Although we reached there at last minute( they closed at 1.30 pm), we were able to buy few fruits apricot, strawberry and nectars. The price is ok but it was sweet due to its freshness from farms. Almost all selling farm produce and nothing else. However it was quite experience to have the market right in the middle of downtown.",Latifi A
30,Try Another Location,My wife and I enjoy going to Farmers Markets and heard that the Santa Monica Farmers Market was considered one of the best in the nation. Well we were very disappointed in the Sunday Farmers Market on Main St. Maybe the other locations on different days are better. I don't know. I just know that this did not compare to the Hollywood Farmers Market or even the Santa Barbara Farmers Market. It was surprisingly small and I didn't see a great selection of quality produce. In fact we left without buying anything and went to the LA Farmers Market on 3rd and Fairfax and found a better selection of produce there. That was very surprising! Maybe someday we will try one of the other locations on another day of the week. But we will definitely not be rushing back here again anytime soon.,ughdoug4
30,Very disappointing - DON'T GET HERE EARLY,I normally love markets anywhere but perhaps I got here early - took the PR too literally re market times and arrived when everybody was setting up. Lots of fruit and vegetables but it was all relatively expensive.,RonWamberal
50,Produce amazing,"We came upon the Farmers market by chance while waiting for the hop on hop off bus and were taken by surprise at the superb quality of the fruit, vegs, fish in fact everything and a group of lovely young guys playing their music.

50,Awesome!!,"Bucket list for me and it fulfilled all of my expectations! There was so much to look at, to taste and to buy. This is what I expect a farmers market to be. My daughter and I bought some strawberries and ate the whole basket before the day was over! My daugher also bought a succulent and the vendor was very helpful on telling her how to maintain it. If I lived in this area, I would come as much as possible because everything was so fresh.",threepowells
50,GREAT,"I wish my home town had something so wonderful. Fortunately during our visit it was lilac season (my favorite) so I could walk from booth to booth and smell the flowers.

40,"Veggies, Fruits & Nuts in SM ...","Santa Monica has a nice local Farmer's Market two days a week, with convenient street closures for access. We like shopping and browsing on Sunday morning, looking for the freshest produce and for trying new or seasonal items. Fun. Enjoy.....",David B L
50,Fun Chill and filling,"The Sunday market was lots of fun with a cabaret singer providing entertainment. There was someone face painting kids and another person making balloon animals. There were some seats but many more spots to sit on the grass. We bought some delicious strawberries and apples -and had a very tasty monster of an omelet with cheese, mushrooms, spinach and tomato - very tasty. My daughter had a crepe - oddly the crepe took 3x as long as the omelet but it was all good in the end. I am a sucker for farmer's markets and this one was really good - there were a few vendors who did not make it, but it was a great relaxing way to spend a Sunday morning.",James H
30,I don't get the attraction,"I guess that maybe one day this place was a down to earth market with small businesses and local food, but now it's just another corporate place in disguise. I wouldn't mind this but I didn't like how it tried to present itself as something else.",Gary M
50,"Great place, awesome Ingredients","First time at this Farmers Market, went here with a few co-workers and my boss. I have to say that there were so many options to choose from, all good local produce, I only wish we had a same sized Farmers Market around Murrieta area.",AlexHealey94
50,Wednesday Visit,"tried finding this with a GPS. It sent me a couple of miles away. We asked several people, they couldn't help. So I give up and decide to go to the third street promenade and run smack into it. It cross the promenade, not far from the pier. Fresh produce, nuts, fish, meat. Several parking garages close by . We liked it.",Joe B
50,Great Market,"My wife, son, and I recently attended the Santa Monica Farmer's Market. The market, which features all organic food, was fantastic.

50,Best Farmers Market!,"Santa Monica Farmers market is often ranked as one of the best in the country and if you come you will see why. This location ( more of Arizona then the pier as described above) has Farmers Markets Weds & Sat am. Try to stop by on a Weds they have more vendors and thats when a lot of local restuarants do their shopping! Also dont get confused and go to the one on Sundays on Main st- thats more of a jam and jelly, let your kid ride ponies type of event more than an actual farmers market in my opinion",allison r
50,A Saturday must...like breathing.,"This is my Saturday ritual, be there by 10:00am or you can miss a lot. The farmers only bring the best of what they have each week and you have a pick of the lot if you are early.I start with the shiitake mushroom dude. He will more than likely be out of mushrooms by 12:30. They are a treat because he grows them in wood boards so they don't need cleaning, no dirt, cool!When in season off to the strawberry chick they carry 7 types of delicious berries. Then the potato dude for the best fingerlings. Then pick up an orchid for $10-$15 bucks. At that price you can buy one a week. Now pick some herbs. Then avocados again 4 to 6 different types to choose from. Don't forget to get broccoli with the flowers still intact. At the end of the street find some of the best organic grapefruit in California.This of course is just the beginning. My biggest problem is not bringing enough bags to carry everything in. There are a few ATMs just off fourth street. You need cash baby!",Bradley1965

The Arizona market in downtown is held on Wednesdays and Saturdays, the Virginia Park market is also on Saturdays and the Main Street market is on Sundays.

It was one of the largest that I've seen in Southern California and went on for numerous blocks. Winter now so variety of the selection not that large, but my husband had a great time getting samples of all the different types of oranges and I had a few too, and they tasted great! The market is in the morning from early until about 1:00, so combine shopping with having lunch at the many surrounding restaurants (see my review of Locanda del Lago) and/or a walk down the pier or along the beach a few blocks away. A nice way to spend part of a day.",OCfoodie92648
30,Typical shopping area in the states,"We travelled on starling buses with an open top so got off at the farmers market after our concierge told us it's an enjoyable day.

Further, two of the only three ""terrible"" reviews and the single ""poor"" review all come from these same five curmudgeons.In a news interview the keeper of the ponies showed they were treated to the finest vet care at their lovely ranch several miles north of the city.What angry, unhappy lives these five fake reviewers must lead, to have the time to diminish the joy of these children and the productive employment of these otherwise bereft ponies.",karmakelli

30,Wish they would stop the pony rides,"The Wed. and Sat. Markets on the Promenade are very good, but the one on Main Street on Sunday is just depressing. As you walk in to the market the first thing you see at the Main Street Farmers Market is the pony ride. Ponies with children on their backs going around and around in circles. It is shocking that something like this is going on every week at the farmers market. It is depressing to see. You can't get the thought of the ponies out of your head the whole time you're there. It's just a primitive spectacle of animal exploitation.",RebeccaED
10,Skip the Sunday Santa Monica Farmers Market,"It's more of a flea market than a farmers market, with too much Main St. commercialism.I agree with the the other reviewers...the pony rides and animal petting area are very disturbing. Exposing children to this cruel treatment of ponies is wrong...so if you must go, leave the kids at home, or better yet, skip this market and go to the wonderful, cruelty free market on Saturday in downtown Santa Monica. Lots more organic fruits and vegetables also!",SandraTASSC7
30,"Yes for Saturday, but No for Sunday","The variety and produce in the Santa Monica Farmers Market is generally wonderful, but I can only recommend the Saturday markets in Downtown SM and on Pico. These are great places to pick up fresh produce, herbs, flowers and walk the community. However, the Sunday market (on Main St.) includes a petting zoo, which puts on display, among other things, ponies tied to metal poles for circle rides. I was shocked that our progressive community permitted this petting zoo in the first place, and I am even more disappointed that it continues to do so in the face of continued complaints.",Nicole P
10,Does anyone notice the miserable ponies and animals?,"I have lived two blocks away from this market since I moved to Santa Monica many years ago - but never go because I cannot stand seeing the sad ponies tied their sensitive muzzles to an iron bar- in the heat- going round and round- on the cement- music blasting in their ears- barely being given water because they will urinate- it makes my heart hurt to watch the parents smile while they watch their little kids tied in to the saddles- some miserable - some excited- while the parents never notice the condition of the animals- how can anyone love a child and feel nothing for animals- i will never know- the petting zoo is even more depressing- the small animals- constantly bred to have 'babies' cringe in horror and try to run from these small children who run after them- petting zoos have long been known for being terribly abusive to animals- Santa Monica- a world- wide destination and a supposed ""liberal palace'- has allowed this abuse to continue- and previously allowed worse- the vendor doing it before - had dead animals parked in the truck- no one cared until a neighbor heard noises- there is no oversight here- the city is not honest and although I feel for the other vendors who work hard at a not easy job- I cannot wait to see the ponies get a better venue and this slavery- which is what it is stop- I am sorry to see so many reviews here where almost no one even notices- no wonder the slaughter of animals and horrid things are going on- no one even sees it- I will not go to this market for anything and I am sad to see so many reviews going on and on about a garlic clove or other things but never even seeing the ponies and babies animals-",dannie C
20,Depressing pony ride and zoo not organic or sustainable.,"How unfortunate that visitors to this market a few blocks from my home must pass tethered ponies and penned alpacas before purchasing pesticide-free fruits and veggies. There's nothing sustainable or organic about tethering ponies to a metal bar and forcing them to plod in a tiny circle for hours on concrete, car exhaust in their face, band music hammering their ears. Even some of the market vendors have signed a Move On petition to shut down these exploitative animal sideshows. Yes, the honey walnut butter is tasty and, yes, the blueberries are good for you, but normalizing animal exploitation is not, especially when it come to teaching our children that tethering is the norm. Santa Monica could learn a lot from studying farmers markets in Portland, where cooking contests and arts and crafts attract families without featuring animal exhibits from a bygone era.",Marcy W
50,Great vendors and variety,I love Farmer's Markets and this is a really good one. The location is great and I really enjoyed tasting some of the fresh fruit. It's a great place to buy fresh produce but also just fun to walk through.,Shelly M
50,Must go!,"This was the best farmer's market I've been to anywhere in the country. Tons of choices, lots of organic farmers, pricey, but I guess that's the norm for LA. Ends almost on the beach. Can't remember the name of the stand, but there is a homemade bread stand that I bought a sourdough boule with roasted cloves of garlic in it....AMAZING!",Syounis
50,Great Way to Spend a Sunday Morning,"We always try to schedule in Sunday‚Äôs at the Santa Monica Farmer‚Äôs Market when visiting Los Angeles. The produce is pricey, but gorgeous, and we all deserve a treat now and again, right?!Many vendors provide tastings so that you can actually begin to know the difference between 10 different varieties of oranges, or 8 different varieties of dates. Food vendors sell everything from sandwiches to crepes, and live bands provide background ambiance to keep your feet tapping as you move from booth to booth. If you park at beach a few blocks away, the Farmer‚Äôs Market will validate your parking pass and your cost will be reimbursed‚Äîbut we think it‚Äôs worth the price to keep the car parked and play in the ocean after the Farmer‚Äôs Market has shut down for the day!",Julie W
50,One of the Best Farmer's Market -- Early Bird Gets the Best Stuff,"This is one of the best farmer's markets in Southern California. You can go anytime of the year and get lots of really good produce, but it is not cheap. There are certain times that you should go, like early June to July to get the best berries. First stand, they will have black berries, blueberries, red raspberries, golden raspberries, and occasionally orange raspberries, black raspberries, wild strawberries, goose berries, boysenberries, mulberries, and more. The really special ones are limited to June, so you want to come then and early before they run out. As you wander down the street, look for other places that have ollailaberries and boysenberries. You want to also stop at Harry's Berries for Gaviota strawberries. These are small, and the most sweet berry you will ever taste. The melons can be incredible as you get to the end of July through August. Look for potatoes, fingerlings, red, gold, purple and blue. Avocados of all kinds. I love bacon. Greens of all kinds. Asian, chard, kale, what ever you want. Look for herbs of all kinds, different varieties of basil, purple, lemon, thai, sweet. Tomatoes of all kinds, red, green, purple, yellow and orange. Stone fruits of all kinds, peaches, plums, apricots, etc. I like to start looking in the fall for elephant heart plums. They are really sweet and melt in your mouth. Citrus of all kinds, lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits and others. Be sure to look for Satsuma tangerines in January. You can get meat, fish, cheese, eggs. You can get some of the best shitake mushrooms I ever had. I like to walk the whole place first (but I actually buy the berries first), to see what I want to buy, and then shop my way back down the street. Be sure to stop at the bread vendor in the bank parking lot, as he has really good bagels, pastries and bread. July and August, and even September are good for tomatoes. In the fall you can get really good salad greens and cauliflower and broccoli. Look for purple asparagus, purple artichokes and purple and orange cauliflower for something different. On rare occasions, you might find purple green beans. Look for Romanesco broccoli for something different as well.You can also buy plants from the gentleman in the center, like tomatoes, peppers and herbs, if you want to have your own garden.There are nuts and oils and herb boxes. There are oyster shooters. There are pastries of all kinds, sweet, savory, and so on. You can also get fresh juice. Jams and nut butters.In the winter you can find numerous varieties of squash and pumpkins and other winter vegetables. Each month, each season will bring something new.It is a total smorgasbord of shopping pleasure for a kitchen aficionado.Saturday is good, and Wednesday is even better. So, if you are looking for some really good variety in produce and a fun adventure, go to this market.",Mary Jean
30,Just ok,"If you are visiting for the fresh foods, hou will find them in abundance. I was also surprised by all the prepared food to purchase. However, many holier than thou people that don't abide by the city ordinance of no strollers beyond a certain point. No 'excuse me's' and even the vendors act annoyed when you ask them questions about their products. I've never visited such an unfriendly farmers market. It seemed to be more of the locals weekly hangout so I'm sure they enjoy it. The parking is a nightmare and if you aren't lucky enough to get a space on the street make sure you only visit the merchant the parking is for as you will be towed in a very short time.",Bankerchic77
50,You gotta visit this place,"I know most fresh vegetables come from CA, but this place was awesome. It's not terribly large, but the variety and quality was fantastic. We picked up some flavored pistachios, but you can get anything from scented oils t walnut oil to flowers and dried fruits. Definitely worth walking through if you up on the Third St Promenade on the weekend. We happened on it by blind luck and were glad we did.",Heath H
50,Best Farmers Market In LA (wednesday),"The Santa Monica Farmers Market is a must visit, whether you're visiting or you live close, it's a MUST! I shopped here almost every week, mostly on Wednesdays because they have more venders than Saturday but I was always in awe of how much there was to offer, how beautiful the produce was and the basic, yet, not so basic, atmosphere. It's a busy market, so stay off your phone, take it all in, but focus on what's there and talk to the venders‚Ä¶ they're lovely people!There isn't really ONE vender I can tell you to visit‚Ä¶ just make sure to check them all out.As far as parking goes‚Ä¶ there are a few parking garages around Santa Monica, that's the best option‚Ä¶ the first 90 minutes are free!",Misty B
50,"Year-round, rain or shine","A Farmer's Market is a vacation highlight? Absolutely. This is one of the most impressive farmer's markets in the country, and it's in the heart of Santa Monica, just off the 3rd St. promenade. Easy walking distance from most hotels.We love the Santa Monica area, filled with great restaurants and cafes, and then we stock up here for things to take back to the room.Two vendors not to miss: Emiko Corey and her almonds, grown on her Fat Uncle Farms, and organic pistachios from the Santa Barbara Pistachio Company - both ship.",zadkine
50,Must see on Saturday morning,"Fresh local fare with free tastes, and great people watching. I love farmers markets and this was delightful!",Cynthia O
50,Fun Day,"Went to visit Santa Monica. Went to the Farmers Market, what a fun place for fresh vegetables, fruits, and even some fish.Stop thru if you are there.",dinerdon
40,Adored the fruit!,I recently returned to Santa Monica and bought beautiful punnets of strawberries and apricots. The apricots I had were sweet and very juicy and the strawberries were beautiful. A very popular farmers market packed with plenty of fruit/veg stalls.,bilby2009
50,Delicious!,Went for Sunday brunch and people watching and wasn't disappointed. It isn't the largest farmers market but they had a great selection of different foods and all obviously super fresh. We settled on omelettes which were excellent but planning on something else next time as it was a tough choice. There is also fresh fruit and veg which looked really good,Jakkster67
50,Wednesday Farmers' Market,"The Santa Monica Farmers' Market held on Wednesday from 9am to approximately 2pm is a great way to buy fresh produce - tasting before buying assures you that the fruits or vegetables are as you like them. This makes a huge difference in my home cooking! It is always fun to meet the farmers who are properly enthusiastic about their produce and eager to talk about what new crops they are planting. People watching is another attraction. If you go early, popular chefs prowl the stalls for their restaurants, stocking up with cartons of fresh berries, baby carrots, exotic mushrooms and fresh greens. If you are a local, you are sure to run into someone you know.The management of this market takes very seriously the certifications and methods of their farmers and you can trust that when they say sustainable, they have been tested.",MichellePage
10,You may get towed!,Be very careful where you park! My wife needed some things from the drug store so we parked in the lot. Walked across the street to grab a couple of other things and when we got back to our car it had been towed. The reason given was that we had left that mall and had walked across the street. All of the vehicles in the tow yard that had been towed from this lot (and there were many) had out state plates. People tell us its a racket.The Farmers market is not worth the hassel.,John E
50,Everything you need and more,"My husband and I frequent our farmers market in our small town and this blew it out of the water. Fruits, vegetables, herbs, fresh lavender, olive oil galore. There was a great vibe with lots of people, good music and great food. We bought a breakfast sandwich and some lemonade for breakfast and it was amazing. They even have tables where you can sit and eat, as there were multiple tents selling ready made food. It was also very kid friendly, but they weren't all over the place. The unique food, music and atmosphere was one of the highlights of our trip to Santa Monica.",JackieHud
50,Don't miss this fun spot!,"California cuisine starts here. The farmers bring in their fresh veggies, herbs, fruits, flowers, cheeses, the list goes on and on.....The atmosphere is terrific here. People totally enjoying themselves, picking out only the best and then sharing recipes with others. You will see famous chefs shopping alongside the rest of us. This may well be my most favorite spot to be in California",Buttercup60
50,"Not at the pier, at the Third Street Promonade","Wed and Sat morning, even if you are touristing and not cooking, try to visit the Farmers Market. You'll enjoy blocks of real farmers, showing off fruits and veggies that never make it to your supermarket, and never show up in our Midwest town. Stands display multiply types of strawberries, carrots, citrus, and everything which grows in fertile California. All vendors press samples upon you. It's really a pleasure, and there are coffee or breakfast places if you need a break.",Beth M
40,Great,Farmers markets are like treasure hunts. Always fun to see what you can find. Santa Monica farmers market is fun. Loads of fresh fruit and vegitalbles. Very nice.,Fbhfour
50,Fresh Produce & Fun!,"Every Wednesday & Saturday morning until 1 pm. Wednesday has the largest number of purveyors and is packed with people. I prefer Saturday for that reason. You can sample before you buy. This courtesy has caused me to buy twice as much as I originally intended. No complaints. I ate & enjoyed everything.Recently, I decided to bring only the amount of money I intended to spend. It worked out very well. When I ran out of cash I had no choice but to stop buying and go home.In addition to fresh produce, there are baked goods (yum) and pop up restaurants. The latter offers delicious food at below menu prices.Can't say enough good things about Santa Monica Farmers Market.",cuppajoe2
50,"Fresh, colorful produce, goods and more!","Santa Monica offers not one, but four different markets throughout the week. Only been to the Farmers' Market on Wednesdays so review reflects most recent visit.Depending on season, you'll find a variety of fresh produce and products. Personally, I like to visit in the summer when the most fruits and colorful veggies are available. Just a few samples here and there and you're hooked! Prices are high, but then again, you ARE shopping along side local chefs who demand nothing but the freshest ingredients! They offer not only produce, but breads, delicious guacamole, dried fruits and nuts, pickled/sweet items and much more!Tips: Park in nearby structure and bring a cooler to store perishables (especially in summer); bring extra 'green' bags to hold your goods while cruising stalls; talk to the growers as they provide a wealth of information on how to prepare and store their produce. Enjoy and happy shopping!",Shimadog
40,Farmer's Market,"Another little bit of history. A good break in the middle of the day to try and find something for lunch. The problem is choice, everything is available here. Expect the usual American sized helpings with sides, but not too expensive.",AusRabbit
50,A Most Delicious Experience,"If you're in L.A. and find yourself near the famous Santa Monica pier on a Wednesday or Saturday morning then you must simply amble over to Arizona Avenue at 4th to visit the most unbelievable and delicious farmers' market I've seen since travels in Europe. Organic grown, from exquisite fruits to plump and mouth watering heirloom tomatoes and all types of veggies and beautiful flowers, this is an experience not to be missed. It's what this country's finest bounty is all about. The parking garage nearby is convenient and inexpensive and you're in the midst of Santa Monica's shopping district. This venue is open year-round, rain or shine, and at this location on Wednesdays and Saturdays but moves on Sunday and has a second location on Saturday on Pico. Check online for the activities, chef features, location. You will have spent the best few hours of gastronomic experience and be primed for a great meal at one of Santa Monica's wonderful nearby restaurants!!!",Tulip46
50,Fresh!,Fresh fruit. Fresh veggies. Fresh flowers. Fresh air. Fresh faces. I love the Santa Monica farmers market! Sunday 9:30-1pm.,happytravelers97
50,A highlight of the week!,"This is a good enough reason to live in Santa Monica. The farmers market is stocked with fresh and fragrant produce, organic, sustainable grown and absolutely delicious. The market is located at Arizona Ave and 3rd street and really does sell fantastic produce. I gather on a Wednesday it attracts a lot of local chefs, whilst on Saturday it is busy with locals buying their goodies. I can't begin to describe how beautiful the berries are, how sweet the peaches, ripe the avocados ... I could go on! And it's such pleasure to see produce like English peas (in their pods), edible flower salads and the fresh flowers. As there are a few food trucks there and a little patisserie it's a cute place to visit for breakfast even if you are not in the frame of mind to do your groceries there!",NicolaAlpe
40,Fruit & Veg!,"Come here for summer fruit! You won't necessarily find a bargain (3 pints of strawberries for $17) but the quality is high. You can also find body products such as soaps, oils, lotions, etc. I went to the one on Arizona Street.",Lacey J
50,simply great,"Very tasty home veggies and fruits, also fresh flowers. We've especially liked strawberries and dates.Many local chefs shop here and then serve these fresh food in nearby reastaurants.",kosenko
50,"Come for a breakfast or lunch and take away fresh, sustainable food for dinner.","If you want to know what fruit and vegetables are in season, come to the orginal and best locally grown farmer's market in the country. Join the chefs from throughout the US who come here to purchase the same produce as you can for their gourmet restaurants.",DosChicos
50,Main Street Farmers's Market a feast for the senses.,"On Sundays, just a short walk from the bicycle path along the beach is a wonderful farmers' market that has something for everyone. It is filled with locals and tourists alike enjoying the food booths, children's attractions, buskers and of course shopping for a wide assortment of organic products. Loved it. Parking is available for free for the hours of the market down by the beach bike path. Just tell the parking attendants in the booth that's what you are there for and leave before the market closes at 1:30. We decided to extend our stay and paid the very reasonable fee of $8 so we could shop on Main Street and have lunch. To top off the perfect day, we pulled our bikes and helmets off our car and took a two hour bike ride along the beach path. FABULOUS!",Konstandena
50,"Everything a farmers market should be, and then some!","Spent a lazy Sunday morning here and was surprised at the breakfast offerings. Most farmers markets that I attend are primarily produce...this one was different. The beautiful produce was there to be sure, but there were so many breakfast choices! Lovely craft items and live music to boot!",writesabit
50,"Organic, fresh fruits and vegetables",The Santa Monica Farmers Market is a must do. The Wednesday market has more vendors than the weekend market. Either way you are guaranteed to find some delicious fruits and vegetables.,show2you
50,Real Farmers and Real Prices!,"I have been to many so called Farmers Market in So Cal and many are just another type os swat meet. This one is real with real farmer from all over the Southland. I met one that came in from Hemet, CA. And they found it to be the best place to sell their herbs. The prices are also not out of line. Better food than the other markets. Worth the drive. I was in the area from Victorville and made the stop just because I was there, but they have items that I would not be able to find in the desert, so for me it worth the drive.",Mou2
50,Santa Monica Farmers Markets,"Santa Monica has four farmers markets each week: Wednesday, 2 on Saturday and Sunday, held at a variety of locations - visit their website for directions and location details farmersmarket.smgov.net.Fresh, seasonal produce year round, rain or shine and open all holidays (except X-mas and New Years days).These markets really do it right. All the produce is beautiful, grown in California and often organic (look for the signs).The Wednesday and Saturday markets are focused solely on the produce and the farmers while the Saturday Pico market has a few more prepared foods and is located in a nice park and the Sunday market is a whole community festival including farmers, prepared food, local retailers, pony rides, bands and other fun children's activities as well as a nice picnic area for relaxing in the sun.",yogajod
40,Yummy smells and tastes,"A great, vibrant farmers market filled with locals and all variety of food and produce. We went on a Sunday and it was jam-packed with people. If you dislike lines or crowds, its probably not the place to be. But there was great food, music, just a really bustling place. Try the massive cooked to order pancakes, or one of the many stands offering ethnic food.",proscribe
50,The BEST Produce and a Fun Way to Shop,"Interested in buying fruits and vegetables from local farmers, who picked them the day before market day? Want a taste before you buy? Want to learn how to pick the best fruits? Want to get some beautiful flowers? Looking for organic produce? It's all this and more. I love the farmers markets in Santa Monica and haven't met anyone who doesn't.There are several markets on different days of the week (my favorite is Wednesday's market). You can get detailed information on timing and locations on the website. The Sunday market is special if you like to sit outside, purchase breakfast at a stand and listen to good, free, live music. They also have some children's rides. It does get crowded and busy so come early on Sunday.",Rashi
50,The creme de la creme,"This is a market for everyone, from the tourist to the professional, probably the best in southern California. Here you do not buy a strawberry, but a Camarosa, Seascape, etc. not a lemon but a Meyer, and so on. Fruit is often so ripe that you have to protect it on the way home. The average consumer here is highly informed, some of the farmers actually have PhDs, the varieties here are beyond belief and highly seasonal, and in the early morning you will rub shoulders with the city's elite chefs. If you've only ever bought produce in a supermarket, the SM Farmer's Market will seem like a strange new and wonderful world.",Stay7743
