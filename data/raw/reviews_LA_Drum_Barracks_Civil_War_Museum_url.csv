50,A marvelous find for Civil War buffs,My husband is a Civil War buff and this museum was a real treat. Being from the east coast we had no knowledge of the Civil War in California. The guide for our 90 minute tour was entertaining and knowledgeable. This site was one of the highlights of our vacation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/531paulinek
50,A fine museum about the Civil War in California,"The museum has free parking. There is no admission charge, but there are boxes for the suggested $5 cash donation. The museum only has guided tours, you are not allowed to wander about the exhibits on your own. My docent was friendly and knowledgeable. Tours take about 1 to 2 hours depending on the size and inquisitiveness of the group. There are 2 floors and I do not think that there is any wheelchair access to the second floor. There is a good history of the war in the far west with plenty of relics and other presentations. There is also an excellent Civil War library available if you want to do research, but that must be arranged separately. There is no dining available, but there is a nice little gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ransom007
30,If you are in the area or on the way to other museum drop in,"It is an odd place. Yes, old building, interesting history. Could not walk around by yourself. We had a guided tour. Guide was a nice young lady but it was just her and the three of our family. Rather awkward way to go through if you are familiar with the history. It is an odd mix of items. Surrounded by residential with some questionable locations near by to get there. Not suitable for young kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynthiatucker
50,Civil War History in California,"As seen on Unsolved Mysteries and Most Haunted, the Drum Barracks a little bit of Civil War History in California. Unfortunately our visit resulted in not being able to tour the house as they only offer tours twice daily but we already have plans to make another trip this coming weekend. If you notice the camel statue in the front, it's because of camel pack history with the US Army and camels were stationed here during that time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andre2411
50,A must-see for Civil War buffs,"Housed in the last remaining wooden structure (the Junior Officers' Quarters) of what were once 22 buildings on a 60-acre, Union Army training and supply depot is a wonderful collection of photographs, artifacts, period furnishings and clothing, recreated rooms, weapons, munitions, and archival records. There is an extensive library of Civil War records (both Union and Confederate) and resource books. There is also very interesting information on the army's ultimately unsuccessful experiment of using camels for military transport.Our group's docent, a very knowledgeable and personable young woman named America Lopez, gave us a fascinating tour of the museum, library, and remaining grounds. We spent two hours at Drum Barracks and could happily have stayed even longer, but families with school-age children could easily go through in an hour. In December, there is an annual, interactive program portraying Christmas time during the Civil War era. Admission at that time is free to the public. During the rest of the year, admission is $5; $4 to AAA members.Other than at Christmas, only guided tours (not self-guided) are available to the public. Call ahead to schedule a visit or to use the resource library. There is free parking on-site.Drum Barracks is in Wilmington near the Port of Los Angeles, a very heavily industrialized area, but it is only about a 10 minutes' drive to downtown Long Beach and the Aquarium of the Pacific. It would be easy to combine a tour of Drum Barracks with a visit to the Aquarium, harbor cruises, or lunch or dinner at a Long Beach restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lornwal
50,Awesome Little Museum with Big History!,"Myself and husband took our son age 9 and his buddy age 7 who are very into Civil War and our other Wars, this was such a treat for ALL of us!! Out tour guide(must take a tour $5 for adults kids free) was a very very nice you gal named America! She was so knowledgeable and fun!! The tour is about 90 mins long I'd say and can be very warm in the building and rooms. There is a nice little gift shop too and a park across the street! We loved everything about it and it's history(you can look it all up online). They even have the actual signatures of Pres Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant and so many more!! A Gatling gun and an entire room of all weapons(at the end of the tour)! So worth it!!! No photos allowed inside the rooms. The history of the camels there is great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinkkid

50,A Sensational Museum for Civil War Buffs,"Sometimes we forget that a modern city like Los Angeles does have its own unique history and has more to offer than amusement parks and beaches. The Drum Barracks Civil War Museum is an amazing part of Los Angeles history. Who knew that Los Angeles had a connection to the American Civil War? Indeed it did and the history comes live in the Drum Barracks.California was relatively new to the US when the Civil War began. It was California gold that helped finance a good portion of the Union's efforts in the Civil War. 3,000 Union soldiers were sent to protect the Los Angeles harbor at San Pedro and here the story begins.The soldiers were housed in several buildings but very little remains but thankfully, what became known as the Drum Barracks survived the years and is wedged in a residential neighborhood.The Museum has been lovingly preserved and is worth visit for anyone fascinated with history.The museum is open for guided tours and on a very limited schedule so be sure to check their website for tours. I was lucky to be the only person on my tour and had a most remarkable experience with a young guide who loved history and was willing to take his time to explain the artifacts in each room. Each room has a true connection to the Civil War and one of my favorite items was an actual Gatling Gun.The Drum Barracks also has another unique claim to history. It was here that several camels were housed during an ill-fated experiment to use camels in the military. Here is one very special museum that locals and visitors should not miss.Just down the street is the beautiful Banning House museum that is another must see. A short distance away is San Pedro and the harbor. The museum has a very nice gift shop with items relating to the Civil War. It's also well worth a visit.Don't miss this incredible piece of history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackbear
