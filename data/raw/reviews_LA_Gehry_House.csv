10,Not worth a drive,We drove by because we were basically right there. There was nothing to see. The house actually had chainlink around the second story and was hidden behind other “stuff”. Needs some love. So sad it isn’t more visible from the street. Wish I’d taken a picture.,22scadoo
40,Homage to Frank,A simple house that is privately owned on one of the back streets of Santa Monica. Really just a place to pay homage to Frank Gehry and see one of his original designs.,Aussie_2012
40,Fascinating because of its history and provenance,It's got significance because of the history of being his first residence but today it almost looks like another suburban house. You could almost drive past without knowing it was there unless you had made a special drive to see it.You are far more likely to remember his other works like Guggenheim in Bilbao which are clearly unique and out there.,RonWamberal
40,Not so different as his more modern works,"Although it may have been ""out there"" when first built and clearly unique for a residential neighbourhood house, it is nowhere near as different and diistinctive as his more recent works",RonWamberal
50,Early Gehry,"A Santa Monica residential neighborhood home is an example of this architect's experimentations in his use of conrstruction elements outside the box. The structure does not resemble the others in the area, but that didn't bother me. I saw the current owner arrive carrying groceries and see that it was used as other residences and could imagine living in the home with alternative views looking out. It looked like a fun place to live.",TNAllison
50,Unique and unreal,"Unique and unreal and an indication of the architects mastery earl in his careeer. Nice to walk around the block to visualize the context, or lack of context to its environment. Difficulty is imagining what he was thinking. Perhaps showing the use of alternative materials or deconstructing the house.",Cavydad
20,"This House is Located in a Neighborhood. Don't bother the Neighbors for this Silly, Ugly House.","If you love Gehry, and I mean love Gehry than go to the house, get out of your car and take your photos and leave. It is in a neighborhood and people don't need lines of cars looking at a silly house.It is totally out of place for the area and I am sure Gehry cared not when he built it. I think it is ugly house with corrugated metal tossed on the walls and God knows what else.If you are on vacation and love Gehry you will want to see it along with Loyola Law School in Downtown LA, that he ""designed.""If you are not into this type of architecture, I can not imagine why you would go to it.",elizabethlascheid
30,Stands out as Wacky Home in Nice Part of Santa Monica,"I walk by this home near my own home in Santa Monica some evenings. The structure looks different with corrugated metal and raw-looking wood elements, but it really looks like a bizarre house within a house. I don't think the space would feel very nice, light, roomy inside, and to me it's not very appealing on the outside, either. A friend who is an architect told me this is a very important work, and perhaps it is, but it's not an aesthetically appealing one or by all appearances a particularly useful one.",Melissa D
40,Gehry House,"Knowing very little about architecture, this house has always perplexed me. I remember when it was built, wondering what he did & why he did it. People from all over the world can be see observing it. I still find it very interesting after all these years. He must be happy with it because he's lived here for many years. He even bought the house next door, razed it and gave himself a backyard. The large wooden wall is also his.",JudyA
30,A visit because of my architecture masters son,"The Gehry House is an interesting visit, especially after seeing the Walt Disney Concert Hall in LA, the Spruce St building in New York City; however, not a fan of the additions he made to the house.",Ben C
10,a waste of time,"while its in a nice residential area, and the house is mildly interesting, had it not been a ""gehry"" house, you'd simply drive by and say isn't that kind of weird. not special nothing spectacular.",pandpCalifornia
30,Worth a visit,"If you are interested in the architecture of Frank Gehry, a trip to the house is definitely worth it. Of course you can only see the exterior of the house, but that is quite interesting. Walk around the corners and stand across the street and you can see angles, sun roofs and places where he has changed the space but still has managed to keep the original character of the house.",Caroltod
40,"Interesting, doesn't fit neighborhood","Looking at this house by itself, it's an interesting piece of architecture. Interesting angles and features, giant cactus, see thru panels, etc. not what you see elsewhere in this neighborhood as the house definitely does not fit in. But definitely worth a stop to take a look.",rduinc
10,Why would someone want to visit a home that does not fit in the neighborhood???,"Ugly, arrogant, I honestly don't know what kind of statement Frank Gehry was trying to make when he designed this structure. I am sure glad I do not live in this neighborhood and have to see this thing on a regular basis. Your time can be better spent elsewhere in my opinion.",Bob P
50,"If you're a Gehry fan, love architecture...Yes, yes yes","If you love architecture, ya gotta see itOnly takes 10-15 minutes and it's way cool.Love the different materials, shapes and texturesI’m sure the neighbors are used Gehry fans coming around to viewSee this house and think of his other work in the area: sm place, disney concert hall, loyola law, artists’ studio, etc.If you’re a Gehry fan, yes yes yes",Summerasalifestyle
50,Wild Gehry House of Santa Monica,When this one went up I was confused about what Frank was doing but is sure has lasted so I guess he knows what he is doing. One thing is for sure he doesn't worry about convention.,Tom R
10,Architect Gehry's residence,"Just to correct another review, Gehry's former name was not Levine but Goldberg if we are going for accuracy, and he actually did not get his start while living in this house which he bought in 1976 when he was already well established and known among other things for his creative corrugated cardboard furniture and had already done some major projects. He designed the Santa Monica Place mall and in this, own residence, he tore out the walls and exposed wiring and pipes, etc., and changed the house from a rather charming pink two story 1920's bungalow to what you see today ,a house surrounded by chainlink and corrugated iron which in its day made quite a controversy in the neighborhood as well as front pages on LA Times and Architectural Digest. Gehry bought the house from us in 1976. He later said publicly that he had made some mistakes with its design. This is not a house for public viewing, as someone else has said. Just drive by it and think how progressive or otherwise, you may have found it to be in 1976 when he bought it from a young couple in a quiet, established neighborhood of many retired people, before parts of Santa Monica became yuppified and trendy. .",Helen A
40,Where Frank got his Start .....,"Fun to take a Drive-by & see where dear young Frank Levine (now it's Gehry) got started in his monumental new age architecture in Santa Monica. Can't tour as its private, but you can look around at the varied materials used. Enjoy ...",David B L
50,"Chain link fence, corrugated steel surround an old house.","I pass by the house often, and can't help being fascinated by the variety of materials, the angles of the details, and the surrounding fencing. Don't miss it. Great example of Gehry's incredible talent.",Karen M
40,Very interesting house in Santa Monica,We were on a bit of an architecture tour of Southern California and made a point to track down Frank Gehry's house in Santa Monica. Note that this is a private residence on a residential street and stayed in the car as we quickly viewed it. I would only recommend it for fans of the architect's work who can be discrete!,TTTraveller76
40,The home Geary lived in for many years.,This is a drive-by home to look at not a tourist attraction.This home is lived in. Great architectural features all done with a mix of inexpensive materials. As angular as the home is it somehow blends in with the rest of the old neighborhood.,paul_nancy1
