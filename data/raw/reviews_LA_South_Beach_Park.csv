40,Entertaining park for children,"I would bet you that any kid (regardless of their age) will love to spend some time running around this park.I came to Santa Monica for a few hours (more like 20 hours) and got pleasantly entertained walking around. I imagine if I had kids and we were walking around they would find this park pretty entertaining (in addition to the Santa Monica Peer). Additionally, you'll find some food around and a place to chill, not too bad.",rodrigoelp
40,Good Older Kids Park,We stopped by this park the first time with our 6 month old and most of the things are a little too advanced for him. If you have kids that can run around and climb this park is in an ideal place and it is kept clean. We did find a swing and a patch of clean grass for him to enjoy. It is actually a little bit of clover and he could run his hands through it and enjoy a roll and crawl.,Mitchel N
30,Kid spot,The South Beach Parn on Barnard Way in Santa Monica is a good place for the kids to work off some energy and let the parents enjoy being near the beach.,buffalojim67
40,My kids love this park!,The park is really great and the kids enjoy it! There is something for every age group. It does get hot and some equipment gets hot to the touch. The location is great and the park is clean.,travelnmom31
30,Good for little kids. Lacking shade,"The biggest problem with Most playgrounds in Santa Monica is that it is hard to find parking. South Beach Park is on the beach so it takes that aspect up a notch.South Beach Park playground is very nice, it's small, and good for little kids. Bigger kids only have monkey bars to keep them entertained.The other aspect this playground is missing is shade: would be great if they could install some kind of umbrella or something.If you are visiting just for the playground there is a very small parking lot for $1 an hour, with a 2 hour max.",ItsMikey5
