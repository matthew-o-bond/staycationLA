40,Fun W LA Canyon w Views ...,"Sullivan Canyon has lots to offer, as has been discussed in prior post, but it's the horseback riding here that's of great interest. It's zoned as a ""Horses"" area & many homes have stables, plus there's a large riding ring about Â½ mile inside. You'll see lots of horses & riders here. Pretty level walking for 2-3 miles before getting into the hills. Nice nature walk / hike. Pretty scenery. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Great westside hiking spot through canyon woods,"Sullivan Canyon is in Brentwood just west of Mandeville Canyon.Sullivan is popular mountain bike track and you will also encounter local residents walking their dogs, half not on any leash. So you put these two together and you better look out.The canyon is packed with Sycamore and Oak trees and when it rains, a nice creek. It gets warm so bring a hat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomrT3113SC
40,"Dog, hike & bike friendly, lotsa trees/shade","My dog and I hike this easy ~8 mile hike every other week or so mile. The trail ends at Mullholland and it's another mile or so to nike missile site (top of the westridge hike) Lots of tree coverage on the hike so much cooler during the day than Westridge.Dog friendly on a leash---A great place to take your dog for a walk. Please don't leave your bag of dog poop along the trail---Pack it out, cause you already put it in a bag! Let's keep our trails beautiful.Not much elevation and it's a fire road so any sorta walking shoes will work.Good for solo, groups and families. Gets crowded like all LA trails on the weekends...We always hike during the week. Pay attention cause there's lots of bikers.Lets keep our trails beautiful and pick up trash if we see it---Don't walk on by--pick it up.Parking is crowded and pay attention to the signs. They ticket weekdays and weekends!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
