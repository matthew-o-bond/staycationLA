50,Great foot/body massage,"I been here several times and love the experience. I always get a combo which for me is 39 minutes of foot massage then a body massage of 30, 45 or 60 minutes which ranges from $45 - 65 and currently if you pay cash they will discount your ""combo"" service $5. You can make reservations and request a particular therapist and they are all online. I have one therapist who was very strong and really helped get out the knows in my upper back/shoulders after a stressful school year of teaching. It's the bomb!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenannk2018
50,Great relaxing massages!,Excellent service here. I got the 1 hour massage and left super relaxed and the prices were very fair as well. I still need to go back to try out their foot massages that I've heard a lot about on here and on Yelp.I wish I lived closer to these guys!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsltdan
