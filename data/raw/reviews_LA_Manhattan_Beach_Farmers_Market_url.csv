40,Organic Tuesday.,Nice Tuesday afternoon weather. Perfect for strolling along & checking out the produce of this small & friendly farmers market.Organic veggies looked colorful & fresh. Homemade goods were nicely packaged. Food trucks had no lines. And there were plenty of open picnic tables.Was curious about the different shades in the jars of the honey producer.She said it came from different flowers. Remarkable & very tasty indeed.Looked so unique compared to the industrial stuff sold in the store chains.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lapster2011
