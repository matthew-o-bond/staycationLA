10,Not really a museum,you can finish the tour in a few minutes...The works of art are debatable..Go to a real museum elsewhere...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jordand6
10,A Sad Demise of a Small Museum!,The Downey Museum of Art hasn't been open in years. It still stands at Furman Park on Rives Avenue between Florence Avenue and Firestone Blvd. in Downey. This place is a sad story of the loss of a museum that though was small but the first of its kind in Los Angeles County. The art collection apparently is stored elsewhere. The private groups that used to run it had disagreement so the City of Downey shut it down!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JEFountain
30,Intimate and Inviting,My husband and I attended a short play held at the museum. The live art was interesting and thought provoking. The smaller size of the museum made more a more intimate performance. We enjoyed both the venue and entertainment. A recent visit to the museum website revealed other unique events. I wish I lived closer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thewinsomewench
