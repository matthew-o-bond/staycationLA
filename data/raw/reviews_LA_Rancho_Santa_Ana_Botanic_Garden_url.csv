50,Wonderful Oasis,I have visited with a class of students; with family; with my husband; and by myself. Wonderful oasis away from the stresses of life.

A really special place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reedheiress

50,Prepare Yourself,This place is a long walk but it comes with great views and wonderful hike through some of the most spectacular kinds of plants. If you play ingress be sure to start the mission early as it is a long one. There is minimum shade and a lot a lot of seating area around the facility. Except if you head out to the far seating lessons. Try going in one of the free days then its a lot more fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acobian2

30,Botanical Garden?,"Honestly, every botanical garden I have visited had been extremely beautiful with trees, shrubs, and flowers blooming with extraordinary color. Now realizing where I was, I probably should have expected the desert like experience I found. To me it wasn't much to look at and enjoy, but they had various trails to enjoy a very nice walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U9368YZandrewb
50,Very enjoyable,"To me, the botanical garden is part of the heart and soul of Claremont. It's a place than can be enjoyed all year long.

But I just wandering through on a beautiful day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigate790985
40,Welcome to the Garden California,"Desert summer s day intro to local terrain and flora, with some fauna as well. Boojum and Joshua trees very different from desert vegetation in other countries i ve visited.

40,Wedding venue,We visited the gardens for my nieces wedding and I feel the venue was great and the staff did a good job. Certainly very different from your usual wedding venue. From the parking lot you will take a tram to where the wedding is held and then we walked to the reception area. The bathrooms are located a little ways away so you can either take a tram or walk. The path is not lit so good idea to bring a phone to light your way if walking. There were about 100 guests for our group and although seating is a little tight we seemed to have good enough space. Maybe a little tight to walk around the tables and such as well.The staff did a good job in keeping up with our group and were polite and pleasant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shargurl

50,self guided garden-forest for $6,"I am sure there is more going on behind the scenes than what anyone imagines.The maps given at point of entry served us well. Plenty of space on about 86 acres to roam around. Paths are paved and compacted dirt/rock. Plenty of hills. I do wish more of the trees/vegetation had markings so I knew what I was looking at and could have identified what it was.Small gift shop with bathrooms and inside same building looked like classrooms.There is some construction causing some issues: one of the exits was closed and no signs indicated such, met a couple walking back from the closed gate and non too happy about having to reverse their walk to get out. Luckily they said something and kept us from doing the same thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mel1150

Its is very interesting to learn about all the different types of plants that are native to our state.We also got a chance to go into the work area and see how they grow and care for different plants. It is also a good way to get some exercise in a safe outdoor environment. I will definitely make another visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandraa333
40,Memorial for a dear friend.,"No charge due to special event. Adequate parking. Lots of trails for normal visit, but in this case, we were provided transportation to and from the event. After the service, we had a catered meal about 50 yards away. Nice seating , meal and slide show about our friends life. Lots of wonderful sights in garden. Great photo opportunities. Wear your hiking shoes for normal visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonaldF593
40,"An interesting stroll, any time of year...","The garden is an amazing place to wander among nature, unhook from the city (although it is nestled in Suburbia), and even learn some things. If you become a member, you have access to many interesting events throughout the year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benbull
40,Nice place to walk through,"I really enjoy coming here and walking around. There's a lot of trees that create shade on hot days and lots of paths to take. There are some hills but once you make it up the hill, its relatively flat. There are usually different exhibits there to check out. I also enjoy going to their nursery if I need to purchase a California Native plant. One thing I wish they would have, but not sure if they want to encourage, would be a picnic table to eat at throughout the gardens. There is a few picnic tables in the parking lot though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCinpas

50,A hidden gem in the middle of Claremont...,"We visited Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden on the day after New Year‚Äôs Day 2019. We specifically visited because of the banners on the lights in the Village advertising the Origami art display. We were not disappointed in the least. First of all, this sits right off one of the main streets running through Claremont. Finding a Botanic Garden is the middle of town seems counterintuitive but there it is! We pulled in an paid for admission. The price was well worth seeing the exhibit and was $50 for 4 adults (2 educators), 1 senior, and 2 kids. As we walked up the hill we saw a number of Origami art installations made of metal. However, more importantly the area surrounding them was beautiful. The trails were well maintained and the people in the gift shop and working in the garden were very friendly and knowledgeable. The overall hike was relatively easy and not nearly as steep as walking the Claremont Wilderness Trail. Having been to Claremont many times I was truly surprised at the beauty and serenity of the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden. We will definitely visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjogg11
30,Not Many Flowers.,Mostly Catues or dry Plants. They do have some Beautiful Joshua Trees. Nice Park like setting but not very eventful. They do charge $9. I prefer the Botanical Gardens in Riverside which was free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Prax-Tammy

40,Good Walking Spot,"We always visit the gardens while traveling. This garden is special with hills, woodlands and some great views. They keep it more natural so you feel like you're in a national park. They have art exhibitions that change making it a new place to visit. There isn't a cafe but they have a small gift shop that wasn't simple for us to find on our first visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoxStudioLLC
50,Charming Rancho Santa Ana!,"I have visited this lovely botanical retreat at several different times of year when I visit Claremont and it is always worthwhile. An easy walk from the Doubletree Hotel, only 15 minutes away by foot. Best to go first thing in the morning when the air is cooler. Meandering paths lead you to many idyllic spots. Volunteer staff are very welcoming. Nice to see and support a not for profit project in California. Recommended highly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/228jeffreyr

50,Wonderful day,"Spent a wonderful taking in the grounds. It is a truly beautiful garden, and everyone seemed extremely excited to share their work with me. One of the high points for me was a tour of their nursery and how they were keeping all the soil clean. It is well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BHuggs
50,The Jewel of the Foothills,"This is a wonderful place to visit to learn to appreciate California native plants. It is wonderful to walk along the long paths and see and smell the different ares. If you are thinking of doing any landscaping, you can purchase native plants that will thrive in our climate with little water at the native plant nursery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swmacc
50,Beautiful and fun!,My niece was married there in October and it was breathtaking. We go every year in July for the events (music) and it is a great place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reograd
40,Butterfly Pavilion,"We've been to Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden many times before, but we wanted to visit the ""Butterfly Pavilion"" before the weather was too hot. It was an easy walk from the entrance to reach the pavilion. We saw and photographed about 5 or 6 species of butterfly including the ""cloudless sulphur"", ""monarch"",and ""painted lady"". There's a little classroom or learning center for youngsters to learn about butterflies. Along the trails, we didn't see many flowers blooming at this time. Maybe we were too late for wildflowers and cacti.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelers2016

Nice to walk the trails and look around, a nice quiet sanctuary away from suburban sprawl Interesting programing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pianisthaohuang
40,Beautiful and interesting oasis,"RSABG is a beautiful suburban Native plant oasis. The long trails take visitors through different plant environments on paved, easy walks. There are lots of different activities throughout the year, from compost workshops to evening concerts. I especially appreciate the Native plant store and advice on how to care for them in my garden. The plants I've purchased from here are some of my favorites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skaerje
20,Needs some TLC,This botanical garden was disappointing. There is a lot of maintenance required...tons of dead trees and the gardens seemed to be left to their own devices. The maintenance that was being done while we were there was being done on a Saturday morning on the Easter Weekend. Wood chippers and chain saws. Saving those activities for the off hours would be better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melaniedawnmartin
50,"Great place to learn, exercise and relax","The 85 acres are full of native Californian plants. The paved paths and optional gravel trails take you through many types of plants from cactus to pines. The specimens are well marked. There are benches and maps throughout the property. Very unusual special display of thorned plants. We also saw squirrels, chipmunks, rabbits and many birds and butterflies. The property is so large it feels like a private garden. Very nice gift shop. There are flush toilets available in several places. The paved paths are wheelchair accessible. Would highly recommend this for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/familyfun625
50,Peaceful,"Beautiful well keep gardens, love it üòç peaceful and relaxing.

50,Lovely Botanic Garden featuring native plants,Wonderful relaxing and enjoyable botanic gardens within the city of Claremont. Volunteers are friendly and helpful. We have visited many many times (as we are members) and each time is a quiet respite. Lots of space and benches for solitude or just enjoying the views. It's a gem in the San Gabriel/Pomona Valley,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W552DZgaryg
50,Lovely place to walk,This botanical garden focuses on native plants. Gravel trails meander around the well kept property. Wildlife abound throughout. We saw a huge hawk resting in a tree. Many birds squirrels and bunnies scampering about. They also have a nursery that sells native plants.It is a wonderful place to walk and talk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smartwmn
40,Pretty Afternoon,A great place to unwind - it's beautiful. The signage is poor...and it's very hilly so not a good place if you're unfit or in a wheelchair or with difficultly walking. A bit expensive in my opinion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CiaCiaKat01

50,Good hike or zen experience,This garden is a wonderfully quiet place for a good hike with family or friends . Or if you just enjoy the atmosphere and revel in the beauty around you!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnB585
40,Needs some love!,"I want to say that first of all I have been a supporting member of the garden since 2009. I walk the property at least 2 to 3 times a week. I love the garden. That being said, RSABG could use much work! Especially the back half of the property. The more visited front of the property receives most of attention and is pleasant to meander through. Often there fun interactive displays and coupled with the beautiful surroundings, invites one to linger. There are ample benches to be found - I have my favorites. Sometimes I bring a book and stay for a couple hours. The garden is most crowded on weekends so I try and come during the week. While the garden does have a cohesive layout, the stressed California Plant Communities area, along its crumbling asphalt access roads and spray painted signage make if feel more ad-hock than deliberate. It is this area needs the most work. In the meantime, I will continue to support the garden and hope that someday this property's full potential can be realized.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zippytongflockings
50,Summer Concerts ROCK!,"Thursday evening summer concert season a bonus in this glorious place: Terrific groups (Susie Hanson Latin Jazz Band my latest rave - lotsa salsa dancing), lovely food available, stunning mountain views.

50,Wonderful native plants,"Have been wanting to come here for years but didn't have a chance until now and what a delightful experience it was! The gardens had their special wildflower show as well, which was just icing on the cake. Delighted to have an electric cart system to show visitors around the grounds with a knowledgeable tour guide. This is an amazing working laboratory for native plants!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/revett2016
40,Too Early for Wildflowers,"When we visited in March, we were a little too early in the season for seeing wildflowers and cacti in bloom. There are good trails to check out the native plants and get a little exercise. We were here on a ""plant sale"" day and were lucky to have free admission. Since we live so close, we will go back when things are blooming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelers2016
30,Meh!,"This wasn't so much a botanical garden as it was a nature preserve. It is not very well kept, and many of the plants are dying. The place could really benefit from signage. The paths sort of meander, and it is difficult to tell which way to walk to get to the plants/trees that you want to see. It is a bit pricey for what you get. If you are looking for a place to walk or sit peacefully, this would be a good place to go. But, if you really want to enjoy the plants and flowers, I recommend going to Huntington or Descanso Gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom_of_Alex
50,Wonderful place to visit!,"Spent several hours there yesterday. There's much to see, and the gardens are beautifully landscaped. As I have some mobility issues at present, it was great to see a lot of benches available, so that one could sit and rest awhile, after walking along the easy to navigate paths. There is no restaurant on site, so it might be best to take a picnic along, if you are planning a long visit. There's a nursery, selling plants, but it is only open certain days of the week, but the gift shop contained a range of attractive items, and a limited stock of cold drinks and snacks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gtbham
50,Delightful in any season,"All plants are native to the area but since this botanic garden is near three climatic zones (mountain, desert, coastal) that provides lots of variety! Extensive paths lead to various levels. The ancient live oak tree on the lowest level is magnificent. We've visited numerous times and never tire of the explorations!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwightwvogel

40,"Fun day , short excursion","We were searching for something to do which was close to home, easy to get to and not crowded. We found it!Most plants were dormant because it's still ""winter"" but I can imagine how different it would be in the spring when flowers are in bloom. Loved the redwoods and Joshua trees. From the recent snow storms, Mt. Baldy, covered in snow, was shining through the trees. Beautiful sight.Make sure you follow your paper map. A person could get really turned around and disoriented.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AShibalover
30,Beautiful retreat from the hubbub,"Though those who have an interest in botany can surely gain something from this, even the untrained visitor can appreciate getting away to this secluded area to rest, relect and enjoy. It offers a gift shop and docents as well as self-guided ventures. This is not a grand scale garden like neraby arboretums. But it does nicely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IslandPearl

50,Great place to see natural California,I had to come for a school project. I lived in the area since the 80s and only been here a few times in junior high.

You can have your wedding here if you want.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4786ZBjamess
30,"Pretty gardens, a little expensive","This is a nice place to come for a walk or date or just to clear your mind! However, the price is a little steep, especially for students (of which there are many nearby at the Claremont Colleges) and I think a lot of students would be interested in coming here more often if it wasn't so expensive. I love that it's all native plantings, which you don't see very often in botanic gardens, especially in California! That being said, don't expect extravagant landscaping of the European style so common in most botanic gardens. Lovely place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eebarry
30,Bad Time of year!,End of summer weather took its toll on the Gardens. There was a lot of suffering plants and shrubs. Also a warm day. I suspect that spring would be the best time to visit.

50,An Oasis of Tranquility,"My wife were staying with our Son and his family and we opted to visit the Botanic Garden. Wow, what a lovely place to spend a hour or 2, or an afternoon. It was very interesting to see the wide variety of trees and plants native to California and the way they are presented is superb but what I wasn't prepared for is the peace and quiet the Garden priovides. OK, there was a distant rumble of the 21st century addiction to the motor car and the occsional interuption of a plane but generally speaking, the tranquility this facility offers is a wonderful bonus. If I lived in the vicinity I would become a Member and regular visitor in a heartbeat. During our visit we were able to visit the Butterly House (an additional $3 entry) where a volunteer (Alan J) gave us a wonderful insight into butterflies and moths - very informative and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1849IXalanp
40,"Great garden, expensive for students","An absolutely charming and walkable layout, with palm oases and Joshua trees, and a huge collection of native plants. But it is completely ridiculous that there is no reduced rate for Claremont college students--it should be free for them. Because it is expensive, none of them ever go there, and in fact don't seem to know that it is there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TripGirlMaryland
50,Lovely spot to walk. Smells heavenly!,My teenaged son and I spent some time here to enjoy seeing variety of native California plants and wildlife the plants attract. Lots of lizards and birds! The density of plants makes the air smell sweet and delicious! Serene environment. I would come here often if I lived nearby!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wfstravel
50,A great place for a lovely walk,I have been here twice and have enjoyed it both times. It is a wonderful place to spend an afternoon. Lots of plants and trees. Some wildlife . You can either make it a short walk or make a long afternoon walk. You have complete control over where you go and what you wish to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tym4mom2
50,Great micro adventure!,"One of the best collections of native plants in So Cal! Beautiful place with lots of information about native plants and their uses, and lots of birds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhbkinney
50,Lovely Walk,A great escape in the middle of town. Stroll among oak trees and sage. There are benches to sit and contemplate. Or the more adventurous can pick up the paths and go on a longer walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJ2002
40,Peaceful Bird Walk,"It was the first day of my Spring Break vacation, and I was looking for an easy, non-strenuous outing that was nearby. This was perfect! My husband and I (both in our late 50's) drove down from the high desert, and picked up my mother (in her late 70's) to try the Saturday bird walk advertised on the RSABG website. We were met at the entrance by some very helpful staff, and they pointed us in the direction of our bird walking ""guide"" Chris and the other participants. There were about 12 total, ranging from a young child to a spry senior with a walker.Chris spent a full two hours with us, and I swear he could identify every bird and/or bird song in the vicinity! Many times I was grateful that he carried a small laser pointer to silently show us where to train our binoculars. We moved along at a quiet, slow, leisurely pace‚Ä¶which is exactly what I was hoping for. No loud talking, no kids running around, and the only time I saw someone bring out their cell phone, was to take a picture!I've read that some other reviewers were ""disappointed"" with the garden, but I respectfully disagree. Of course, in all honesty, I tend to like my gardens a bit unkept and less formal. Seeing the wildflowers in bloom and a menagerie of birds in this ""native"" setting lead my husband to remark, ""When can we come back here?""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love2teach3rd
30,Disappointing,"With other gardens down the road like LA Arboretum, Huntington Garden and Descanso Gardens this places pales in comparison. I remembered it a lot better many years back, this place has many unkept plants, more of a nature reserve than a garden so any price is steep. Nice gift shop and people though. I hope they ""clean up"" their act, i.e. hire some gardeners or something. I went during the recommended ""spring"" season also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PumaCalifornia

50,Great Place to Relax!,The RSA Botanic Garden is a pleasant diversion from the hectic pace outside the Garden. Check their website for special event and exhibits. I just like to walk around and enjoy the plants and the fresh air! They also have an educational center and small gift shop that has some interesting items for sale. You can get great ideas here for drought tolerant landscaping as well!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyR406
30,Not so well kept,I was somewhat disappointed in this garden. I had the feeling that it was not so well kept. The container garden was rather sad. Many plants seemed not to be thriving. It might be worth a visit in the spring when there is more color.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wardnick1
50,For Every season There is a Reason to Visit,"Over the years I have been to many events and we have never been disappointed. At Christmas, we have walked through the Garden at night and enjoyed the paths lit with luminarias, the sound of music and the warmth of hot chocolate. The Butterfly Pavillion in the Spring is magical. Musical events never disappoint. The annual plant sale always has some plant that you just have to take home. What is also so nice is that this is somewhere that you can take anyone and they will be able to enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaC199
40,Great garden with emphasis on California native plants,"Somewhat low key but expansive gardens, be sure to visit the meadow and the other things on the south end of the grounds, and then depending on your interests and how much time you have, explore the northern and western regions. Wear a hat and bring water on hot days, it is a big garden with not that much shade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P8014LXbillb

50,Enjoy the plants of California,"This is a great place. Like a library that has a lot of books, it's a place that has a lot of California plants. Only California, arranged in ecological groups (e.g., chaparral wilderness, closed-cone pine forest). Lovely place to walk, and you can learn as much or as little about the science of plants, birds, insects, etc., as you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HowardCalif
40,Informative and different,"I've been to many botanic gardens around the world, and Rancho Santa Ana is striking in its own unique way. If you're expecting a lush, verdant garden experience, think again--this is the real deal, an environment and conservation effort reflecting the original biodiversity of the desert landscape. We were lucky to be there for the Butterfly Garden event, and one of the staff was very knowledgeable about all the species of butterflies in the enclosure. The RSABG is a good stopover for an hour or two, and well worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Untourist12
40,A real treasure for Claremont,"This is a beautiful botanical gardens hidden on the outskirts of Claremont near the foothills to the mountains. There are numerous varieties of plants and trees as well as a butterfly pavilion and some well placed statues. Small exhibits show up periodically as well as different celebrations throughout the year. My main difficulty with walking through the extensive grounds of the gardens themselves is that I seem to always get ""lost"", so would wish for a bit better signage. I like that the gardens are not overly manicured and are more natural. The different foliage areas do have good informational signs that are good instructional tools.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlisonS600
30,Interesting walk,"It was a little warm the day we were there and the humidity was very high. We still enjoyed our visit. Take water with you, good walking shoes, and maybe a staff. They need more information on the native plants you see there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcpcmp
40,Great afternoon,"Took the whole family - Grandma (me!), kids, and grandkids. We all had a great time - butterfly pavilion was a favorite, but the adults enjoyed the relaxing walking paths, and the kids loved chasing lizards and squirrels! Highly recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/327amk
40,Great local botanic garden,"The Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden is a wonderful place to visit for a few hours and explore native vegetation. The container garden had a great display of sage and mint. The majestic oak was incredible as always. Through July, they have a small butterfly pavilion ($2 extra charge per person) that all enjoyed, featuring Monarchs, Dogface and Swallowtail and Cabbage butterflies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyZach
50,Kid Friendly Garden,Great place to take kids. They can run around and try to see the butterfly exhibit. Nice for an afternoon in Claremont. They have art classes and fun activities for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beckys382
40,Visit in Spring to see California's native plants in all their glory. . .,"There is often a misconception about California's botanical landscape because so much of what we see is non-native. Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden offers its visitors the opportunity to see the many different natural habitats in full maturity where they attract native insects, birds, and other creatures. California's native flora wakes up in the Spring with glorious displays. The best time to visit is Feb-April when the ceanothus in is its full blue bloom and the twisted red-trunked manzanitas are bearing flowers. Whether exploring the garden's 86 acres or enjoying a short peaceful stroll, this place is a treasure. Music poetry, and art are often showcased in Spring, and there is an ongoing display of a Tongva village. Hours are 8-5 daily. Admission is $8 general, $6 seniors, and this facility partners with other botanic gardens for free member admission. I highly recommend it for garden and nature lovers alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cattylea
40,A Quiet Escape,"One can never imagine how close to the 210 this is by the lack of sound. The garden was a little dry when I last visited, though I'm sure that's due to the drought conditions we're having in California right now. Admission is $8 but can be found for $4 through Amazon Local. Covers a good bit of land and wide variety of plants. If you're looking to take a break from the city or enjoy gardens, this is the place for you. Also has a nice gift shop with knowledgeable staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeremiahg698
20,Save your visit until after the groundwork is completed,"I sincerely wanted to like Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden. It specializes in plants that are native to southern California and northern Mexico and I know they have some interesting plants. I just couldn't find many of them.I had the great misfortune of visiting as they were in the middle of installing a new irrigation system throughout the garden. I recognize that this is important but the excavation to lay irrigation lines has the footpaths in complete disarray. Some major routes are completely blocked by equipment or open trenches and there were no signs indicating how to detour around the obstructions. Moreover, the entire garden is severely lacking in signage. At the junctions of some footpaths there were no markers pointing toward the different sections. Many paths curl around and double back on themselves and are further intersected with secondary paths that quickly got me lost. At one point I tried to find the California buckeye trees and I ended up at the boojum tree, which is in an entirely different part of the garden. I ultimately needed to use a map program on my phone to find my way out!And after I visited, I was curious about some of the plants I had managed to stumble upon, so I tried to look them up on the garden's Web site. Unfortunately their Web site is maddeningly difficult to navigate, and there simply does not seem to be much information there to supplement a visit.I recommend postponing any visit until the irrigation system has been installed. And the garden needs to make a genuine effort to be more user-friendly, both along the footpaths and online. Be prepared to take a few wrong turns. Bring water and a hat ... a maybe a rescue beacon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M0stly_Business
40,PLEASANT GARDEN,"This is a well maintained botanical garden. It is the home to a large variety of native California plants. There are several areas containing desert plants, trees and flowers. They also have a native village exhibit.There is a lot of walking, some up hill. They have good handicapped access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chuck8700
50,A gem in the foothills,"Residents of the Inland Empire are so fortunate to have this facility in their backyard. A few hours spent strolling the grounds of RSABG helps one to relax and enjoy the beauty of local floral and fauna. Gardeners snap up native plants at the garden sales events. The gift shop offers unique nature-themed gifts. Classes and events are offered throughout the year. Tram tours are available for those people with limited mobility. Anytime of year, the grounds of RSABG are worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAPoppy28

50,"""Stop to smell the Roses."" Lovely place for a leisure way to see native wildflowers in bloom.","Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden has to be the best way go and see native wild flowers during the blooming season in Southern California. The garden has many native plants throughout a leisure walk of this of local Botanic Garden in Claremont; they even have a well kept and well stocked nursery area where you can purchase native plants to help you have plants around your house that are well adapted to the climate of Southern California. The employees there are very helpful.There is an entrance fee to get in to the botanic garden area; we feel it is worth every penny, especially in spring. There are numerous benches along the paths to stop and relax in the shade, plus there are restrooms near the entrance and further in along the walk; a lot of native life was seen in addition to the native plants which are blooming now, We saw different species of butterflies and birds on our visit in March.Unfortunately the drought has caused a limited amount of water flowing down the creek leading to the pond resulting in a low level of water in the pond.In short, if you want to see a variety of wildflowers during the blooming season along a leisure walk with native visitors in the form of birds and butterflies, this Southern California botanic garden is hard to beat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJ-Phoenix

50,wonderful garden to wander around,"This garden features native plants but don't let that scare you if you aren't into native plants! It is a delightful garden to wander around. There is great variety in the plantings....from cactus and succulents to oak forests and palm trees. There are many trails and interesting plants to see and they're all well marked for those interested in knowing what they're seeing. They also have special exhibits and events throughout the year as well as a charming gift shop. If you're ""into"" native plants you can speak with one of the staff about seeing some of the fascinating working areas. A special butterfly garden is loved by children as are the many special activities for children throughout the year. I love taking visiting family members at all times of the year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mislerbrunger
40,"Nice place, hard to find our way around","We had a nice visit to this garden. The people working were super friendly. We dropped the map they gave us, though, so had a little trouble finding our way around and so we wandered aimlessly through the areas. It was all nice. It was not my number one garden of all time, but it was great to visit it. My favorite thing was the stone walkway near the entrance. Would love to have that at home. Nice gift shop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere

40,A Wonderful Surprise,"I have lived in Claremont for over 30 years however this was the first year I had ventured into the Garden. Having passed it thousands of times I had always thought the garden was simply an extension of the natural, but somewhat plain, landscaping of the fields bordering the garden.Man, was I wrong.I was there for a memorial service being held for a friend of mine. I was so impressed that i have made pans to return before the year is out. I expect that I will be making regular treks through the garden to experience the impressive and diverse examples of horticulture and forest trees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlyingBarnster
50,It Grows on You,"I took a group to the Botanic Garden this summer. They enjoyed seeing southern California flora and fauna, which contrasted so much with the vegetation in their homeland. We live in a desert which is made green by irrigation, so it's a bit of a shock to see the 'native' vegetation of our region, and a wonderful, educational experience. We also enjoyed the Butterfly Pavilion which was open when we went. I didn't personally get to see the Hutapai dwelling that is on the grounds, but I would recommend a visit to it as well for another aspect of local history.The staff were phenomenal in helping plan and make our trip happen. I highly recommend the place any time of year, and plan to visit more frequently.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marianne_joy

40,Be prepared to walk through nature,"I would recommend visiting in the early morning as there is a fair amount of walking. If they offer a docent, we couldn't find one, that would make it ideal as there are many plants and trees that probably have a rich history that we didn't know about. The gift shop is good and sometimes the Garden offers native plants at fair prices. There is a fee for this. It is best to check and see when the Garden is offering special events to make the visit more educational. Difficult to find so use your GPS. I recommend visits in the Spring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thecarfamily
50,a gem,"Hidden from view at the top of College Ave this large collection of California plants and trees is an amazing collection with a multi-layered history. The current site is many acres of viewing with well worn paths and the need to dodge the occasional sprinkler punctuated with exhibits, works of art and a relaxing covered pond/fountain area. There are facilities of higher learning, research and a gift shop in a centralized location and near the entrance is a plant growing and purchase area.Don't forget to do your background research on where it all started before Claremont became the recipient. This history is even more amazing and a little saddening too since the state/people lost out on the dream of one woman to the apparent greed of her surviving family. Thankfully there is a portion left.Became a 'family membership' supporter and have taken family there many times over several months to watch the change of growth with the seasons, the butterfly exhibit, wild strawberries, bee hive in the oak tree and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelA755
40,California Natives in a Lovely Setting,"This is a large and attractive garden near the foothills of the Verdugo Mountains just north of the Claremont Colleges. It's full of California natives in a natural setting. It's a lovely place for strolling, learning about natives or about plants in general. Allow several hours for a complete visit since there are also special exhibits and events. (For example in late June 2014, there was an interesting butterfly pavilion as well as an art exhibit.) There is a small gift store and a native plant nursery. There are several restrooms around the gardens. Claremont can get very hot and occasionally smoggy during summer months, so visitors should consider coming early or late in the day during that season. This is a great place for Southern Californians who are interested in adding native plants to their landscaping, since they can see the plants at various stages of growth and possibly even buy them at the nursery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arashibi
40,Very friendly but wish I would have went earlier in the season,To no fault of the garden...I wish I would have went earlier in the season as it was dry and I would have liked to have seen more flowers. They did have the butterfly pavilion. But it is a good place to walk around and get some fresh air. The people that work here are friendly.Small admission fee but not bad.

Also on site is a good California native/Mediterranean plant nursery--don't miss this for landscaping your property or a dry spot in your yard.Nice place to walk around and take in the scenery and plants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/713lmd
40,Pleasant Botanic Garden,"We happened to visit Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden in Claremont on a day when the weather was perfect. That made our walk around the gardens very pleasant. I liked that the many trails were paved. The map that you get upon entry was a little confusing and hard for us to follow, so we just let the trails guide us through the various plant communities. There were lots of flowers in bloom to see and to take in their lovely smell. Some of the plants were marked with names but most were not. It would have been nice to know some of their names. The gardens are quite large so plan on spending 2 to 3 hours. There's a small gift shop and a plant nursery. Spring and Fall are probably the best time to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRO_13
50,If you have any interest in plants and an enjoyable stroll don't miss it.,"Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden is one of the very few places that is dedicated to native Californian plants - important, given that we are in a bad drought and it's not going to get better. The garden is set out in different zones representing different parts of California. Very nice place to go for an afternoon stroll. They often have special exhibits of sculptures in the grounds. And if you live in Southern California and have any interest in gardening, they have two big sales a year and a sales area open all year where you can stock up on drought-tolerant beautiful California native plants. Even if you have no particular interest in plants, it is a beautiful, quiet, shady place for a walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nick32215

Unfortunately, there is no street sign for College Ave.I was told at the ticket office that there used to be a sign for College Ave but that it has been removed because drivers were turning left across Foothill Dr causing accidents.

40,Worth half a day at least,"We are not especially knowledgeable about U.S. vegetation or California plants in particular but this garden made learning pleasant and informative. It was neither crowded nor overly ""managed"" and the trails showcased the plants while providing a pipe-opening walk. An afternoon was more than sufficient to gain relaxation and a recharging of the batteries but I could imagine that others could easily spend a day here. There is a half-hidden bench dedicated to the great business thinker Peter F. Drucker who apparently frequented the garden when in need of inspiration or rejuvenation.

50,Great place to spend an entire day,"Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Gardens is a real gem of a place. If you are ever in the area, set aside at least half a day (or more!) to spend wandering the paths of this beautiful place. It has the one of the largest collection of native California plants in the world. The guides are very knowledgeable and will provide the best experience if you really want to know about the plants. You can also go on a self-guided tour, which is just an wonderful. The paths in the garden are beautifully laid out, with places to sit and just experience the place.

40,Loved This Botanic Garden,"I love visiting Botanic Gardens when I travel, and this one did not disappoint. I spent about 2 hours here one morning, and I could've easily spent more. Lots of paths to wander, and benches scattered around as well. For only $8 for an adult admission, I felt like I definitely got my money's worth. As I'm not from the area, I enjoyed seeing all of the native California plants. Saw hummingbirds and heard lots of other birds (couldn't tell you what they were though!).The next time I return to the area, I look forward to coming back to the Botanic Garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atljs
40,The largest botanic garden dedicated to California native plants,"Spread across 86 acres, the Garden is nestled in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. It offers beautiful blooming flowers, magnificent trees (California Oak, Palm, and Manzanitas), quiet paths, and grand mountain vistas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gl0baltr0tter
40,native plant garden,Not a garden like Buschart gardens in Canada but very pleasant walks among native plants of CA and northern Mexico. Best time to go is in the mornings what ever the season if you like birdwatching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcbrit2
40,Check it Out,"Most trails are accessible... lot's of identification signs, great docents with interesting information. A LOT of plants and trees. Great frog pond. Can observe many birds and insects. A great place for all ages. Often has school kids on field trips.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dynamic8
40,Idyllic Oasis,"We visited with guests from the UK on a hot summer morning and enjoyed a lovely experience, which included a special butterfly exhibit, wandering on our own rather than taking a tour.The collection of native vegetation was amazing and beautifully grouped in a natural setting. Because of the heat, we stayed out of the desert areas, but still found plenty to keep us interested for nearly three hours, some of it spent just sitting on one of the plentiful benches and watching birds, insects, lizards, squirrels and other wildlife flitter through the trees and shrubs.The free map was nearly worthless, but other visitors we met on the paths (often members who walked regularly in the gardens of attended yoga or tai chi gatherings) were more than willing to point the way and suggest interesting things to look for. One even showed us an enormous beehive high up in the branches of a majestic oak.Inside the gift shop, we learned more about the gardens. Do wear a hat and bring water, especially if you come in the summer. Any time of the year, I suggest long pants and closed shoes, rather than shorts and sandals. My friend, who wore the shorts and sandals came home with a supply of insect bites as souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelnan8
50,Peaceful retreat,"This is a great place to go to get some ideas about using native plants. We are members and go to walk, think and relax. The concert s here at night are wonderful as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachrwoman
40,In our own backyard,"If you like natural southern california plants, you'll like this place. It's nice to walk around, see plants in their own environment and hear the birds & bees. While I appreciate the docents discussing the gardens as you walk with a tour (if you want a tour) the one we had didn't know too much when asked specific questions. I'm sure there are very knowledgeable people there but our guide wasn't one of them. People in our group were the better guide. Still a nice relaxing (cheap) place to stroll around and enjoy the day. The proceeds go to a good cause too. There is also a gift shop and an area to purchase plants, succulents etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrStogie
50,Fantastic Collection of California Native Plants,"This garden was much bigger than I expected. It covers 86 acres and includes thousands of native plants. There are three areas to explore: California Plant Communities; Indian Hill Mesa, and the Alluvial Gardens. I suggest you bring a lot of water and sunscreen if you plan to stay more than an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertPC118
40,Very nice,We attended the Folk Music Festival held at the Botanic Garden so got to enjoy the gardens as well as the music. The gardens have a lot of signage so you know what kind of plant you are looking at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CWB878
40,A Quiet Oasis,"This garden is a gem in an otherwise busy area. Once you turn off Foothills Blvd, park and walk into the gardens, you're a world away. I visited here in February, when there was very little, if anything, in bloom. I needed a place to think, reflect and just walk. There were benches along the way to sit in the shade. It was the antidote I needed. Just walking along the paths with views of the snow-capped mountains did wonders. I saw very few people. It was just me and the California landscape. I look forward to returning someday in the late spring when more is in bloom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancyld
50,Best Collection of Native California Plants,"This garden, tucked behind the Claremont School of Theology, has the best collection of California natives. It's great to see what California had before all of the imported plants took the place over. The plants are well kept and the grounds are uncrowded. Walking the garden is easy and peaceful.The gardens also offer information/classes on drought tolerant landscaping. We have used some of that information to make our landscape beautiful and save water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acscf
40,No bikes,"If you want to get a sense of the diversity and beauty of California plants and trees, this is a great place.Quiet, essentially unpatrolled, you can walk a mile and not see another face.Sadly, no bicycles permitted. This would be a perfect spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M9703TSwilliamd
30,A garden away from the crowds,"This was an average garden but it was nice to get out of the town and into some natural space. Much more ""natural"" in feel, this is not a manicured garden but a natural garden and had many paths for walking. My husband and I visited three gardens while in So. CA: Lotusland, the Huntington and this. Of the three this was our least favorite, but if you are not near the other two gardens, I would recommend it as a chance to see local plants and to get away from concrete sidewalks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzanneGrecophile
50,Pleasant walk,"Great to see indigenous plants. Well kept up and great for an afternoon walk? No waiting, but during the week there may be school visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teacherdeb1
50,Beautiful scenery,I planned to stop here for natural beauty and inspiration before heading off for a personal retreat/planning day. I loved it so much I changed my plans and spent the whole day here. The grounds are so beautiful that it made the top 3 spots to have my 25th wedding anniversary vow renewal here as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kris_Lozano
40,"Very rustic, but distinctly Californian","Interesting garden, to be sure. Much of it seems very untended, but therein is the beauty of this place. One can wander around for a while and feel away from it all. We were there in the winter, and much was dormant. I imagine in the spring this place would be beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skiddered
40,Peaceful!,"This place is so peaceful. I actually got lost because it is so big! There are walking trails and so many plants to see. Do not take small children there unless you have a place to carry them in (stroller, backpack) because it's a big place and walking will get them (and you) tired.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AprendViajera
50,A Garden for Native Plants!,Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden is a gem of a native plant oaisis in Claremont. It was started years ago so plants are well established. It is on many levels so is difficult for handicapped people but a good place for a nice walk! Only minus is the entrance fee which shouldn't be as the giver of the place said of the gift it should always remain free and in tough economic times this has been forgotten and they charge a hefty fee for admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryandchris1969
50,Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden,Beautiful displays of how native species can work in normal landscapes. Visit many times in as many seasons as possible to get the full advantage of the use of native plants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imahomebody
50,Beautiful and Quiet,This is a wonderful place to walk and talk with a friend. I took my 89 year old Father who loves flowers. He was able to walk around the grounds comfortably. We could drive to the higher level and so he did not have to climb the hill. This was very helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamaicanExplorer
50,Love this place!,"We discovered this place not long ago and fell in love with it. The grounds are beautiful and well taken care of. It has a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. There are different paths to take and many benches to sit and contemplate the beauty around. They have different events throughout the year. We visited the butterfly pavillion in the late spring/early summer and really enjoyed it. We also went to their ""Things that go bump in the night"" event and had a blast. The kids very much enjoyed walking around with their flash lights and visiting the different stations. They had animals, insects, plants and a variety of crafts for the children to do. This is definitely an event to attend! We are now looking forward to their Acorn Festival.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peacemomma
50,"IF you love California wildflowers, don't miss this in the Spring","There are separate areas for the differing ecological areas of California, each with the native plants for that area. The grounds are well-tended and it's a restful, relaxing walk through California in one area of the state. I'm a wildflower enthusiast, having driven all over the lower half of California to see wildflowers almost each year since 1964, and I love going to RSABG to see what I'll be looking for as I go on my trips hither and yon. It's a condensation of what you have to drive miles and miles to see otherwise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puttermutt17
50,"Peaceful, beautiful walk","The different pathways you can take to see the different climate and plant areas. Beautiful blooms, makes for a nice walk while learning about different plants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaG470

50,"Have membership, go all the time","We love it there. My kids love to run around, we grown-ups like to walk with our coffee! They have great installations and musical evenings. We have taken picnics there and spend hours sitting on a bench talking. Beautiful gardens, quiet vistas, lovely trails. A respite in the middle of a city. We feel INCREDIBLY lucky to live close to the garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aimeecarpenter
50,Great way to spend a few hours,The butterfly exhibit is wonderful. The guides show you how to identify the different kinds along with the stages caterpillars go through to become butterflies. Great for kids. The grounds are really nice for lots of hiking and nature viewing. The gardens make you feel that you are a world away from the hectic pace of southern California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/efp54
40,VERY NEAT!,"A fine example of local plants and vegetation, but more than that, a really fine walk you can take through various really cool untouched local wild vegetation. Big, big, place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DantheMountainMan
50,Beautiful area to walk/hike,You can actually walk thru here and not see another person. The last time I was there I sa a coyote and a roadrunner!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynnea24
50,Beautiful colors,Wandering the acres of paths was peaceful. Great examples of native plants. A lot of the plants were marked so as to tell what they are. Staff was friendly and helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EileenH372
40,Plants were beautiful and we liked the old oak,"We liked the bug sculptures and the beautiful plants. The butterfly outdoor garden was wonderful, but the man was netting the butterflies and putting them in a very small netted area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheLGFour
50,Great for so many reasons!,"I love this place! It is great for so many reasons. The staff are friendly. They do neat educational, artistic and community events year-round. The grounds are beautiful and I can go for just 30 minutes or for hours. It is great place to go alone, on a date or with family. It is kid friendly and I always am glad I visit. If you live locally I totally encourage you to get the year membership. The garden needs this kind of loyal support and the price is so reasonable (around $50 if I remember right).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/131JessicaB
50,School Field Trip - 4th grade,What a wonderful treat for our kids (and adults) to have a guide lead visit to the Botanic gardens. Currently the gardens have a large bug art exhibit with is amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trailersrfun
50,Springtime: CA poppies and other wildflowers,"This place is beautiful! In the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, right below Mt. Baldy (which still had snow on it on April 8), the botanic garden was in full bloom. Tons of California poppies mixed with blue eyed grass, iris, CA lilac, flannel bush, monkey flower, and more. A feast for the eyes. If you can't get out to Antelope Valley to see the poppies in the wild, this is a must-do place. Just a delightful way to spend a morning or afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plumeriad2017
50,Native California Garden,Very walkable garden in Claremont. They have an annual plant sale and docents to tell you about what you're seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldrunner
30,Great if you love natural SoCal plant life,"My favorite botanical gardens is Huntington, and this place is a lot different than that. It's more educational and only has plants native to the area, so most of it is brown. It's not bad if you want to walk through real nature for a while, but it's also not all that big. Students get a discount, so that's a plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hisserbee
40,Relaxing brief getaway,It does let you have a moment where you feel you are away from the hustle and bustle. Peaceful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Havenu
40,Native California walk,"This is nice easy walking trail showcasing native Californian plants. There is a small fee to enter and then you can meander among the ponds, dirt and paved trails.We saw turtles, birds, lizards, and squirrels among other wildlife.There are bathrooms and water fountains, but if you are jonesing for some shopping there is a cute shop/education center in the middle of the garden where you can purchase nature inspired products.They also offer classes in native plants as well as have sale a few times per year of those plants.On Saturdays there are volunteers with carts housing informative exhibits.Most fun is to watch the artists set up along the paths and see their work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimCa
40,A nice place to relax and read a book on a warm day.,"This is exactly what it says it is. It's a large garden full of vegetation of many kinds. The garden is divided into sections and plants are grouped based on common climate needs and native locale. You wander through the various areas, a relaxing walk, for as long as you wish. You can easily spend a few hours. One of the stopping points for many is the huge oak tree in the back of the grounds.If you bring a good book, you can easily spend half the day in this restful location.There are sometimes classes you can sign up for, and there is a small gift shop which often has plants for sale, along with cards and other 'nature' gifts.Don't look for 'action' here, but if you want a walk (not too strenuous, but there is an upper area and a lower one, separated by dirt paths, not for wheelchairs, though I believe you can enter on the upper or lower level) or a place 'away from it all' (though located between Foothill and the 210freeway) this is the place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traylee8
