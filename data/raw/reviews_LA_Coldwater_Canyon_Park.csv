30,Nice little park,"I go here often with hubby and our dog and cat. Its a nice little park with a nice playground but again its by the very busy road, so it can get very loud till very late hours of night. Sometimes coyotes go there, but its nice for little relax and walk.",romanka2017

40,"Clean little park but avoid ""hot and sunny"" days!","Pros:The park is pretty small that makes supervision of your kids easy.They have several picknic tables: needs to be reserved for weekends but first come first served during the week.Nice clean bathrooms.Security guard comes by every now and then.Clean environment.They offer soccer classes for kids 2-7 years old through the city of Beverly Hills (registration and pay are required).Cons: gets very crowded in evenings and especially weekends.Not enough shade: the play constructions are under open sun. Slides swings get too hot to be used during day time in sunny days (most days in California)No store to buy snacks/water- bring your own.Construction workers often take all street parking-no designated parking structure.Overall it's a nice park but only early morning/evening hours due to lack of shade over play constructions. No libruary, no additional activities for kids. Gets boring if you go offer.",Veronika8000

50,"Spectacular views, easy walking","This place is perfect if you like amazing views, easy to walk trails, few bugs, great facilities, and good parking. I went there at sunrise, and the views were stunning. It is impossible to get lost here, as the trails end at neighborhoods or main roads. Also, there is shade, so unlike other canyon areas, this one is more lush and pleasant.",Allise W
50,Nice place to stop in,"While driving around in Beverly Hills, we chanced upon this little park on Mulholland Drive-West. Since we had been driving around for a while, we stopped in to stretch our legs and use the facilities. This is a nice, information stop run by the TreePeople.org. It was a pleasure to see the cistern system and how they are trying to encourage the use of native and drought resistance plants.",ShadySpot

40,Don't bring your chairs....and don't go to the bathrooms,"Very nice playground for young kids within this small park. In the summer time there is a shallowl stream next to the playground and the kids love that as it is in the shade and it gets really hot in the playground. I don't understand why these playgrounds are not covered as the metal and plastic gets burning hot during the summer time. Another thing I noticed last year that a small group of people ( maybe 6 total) was getting a ticket because they had brought their own chairs to the park, never heard such a ridiculous thing in my life but apparently you can not bring your own chair........ The bathrooms are usually disgusting ......",MakeMyBed
