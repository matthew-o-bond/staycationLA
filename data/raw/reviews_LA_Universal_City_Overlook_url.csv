50,Gorgeous Views,"The views here are simply stunning, and it is such a picturesque area. You are so high up and in such a perfect spot that you are guaranteed amazing views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark42139
50,Magnificent view of the San Fernando Valley,"Every trip to Los Angeles should include a drive on Mulholland Drive. There are several overlooks that offer breathtaking views of the city. My favorite overlook is the Universal City Overlook that features a magnificent view of the San Fernando Valley area that includes Universal City, Studio City, Sherman Oaks, Van Nuys, Burbank and North Hollywood. Just before sunset would be the ideal time to go so you would be able to see the view in sunlight and at night. Please be mindful of the residents who live in the area and drive slowly and be quiet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kanemochi
50,Good view north,"There are many viewpoints along Mulholland Drive but this was my favourite northerly one. Universal City stands out with the studios and fun parks but you can see a lot of the valley, including Burbank airport and the mountains surrounding it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
30,Views for days,There are many great views available at the Universal City Overlook. It is amazing that it is a full city (mayor/gov) without any full time residents!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbmusic
