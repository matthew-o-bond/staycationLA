30,Visited A+D Museum for Museum of Failure Exhibit,Visited the A+D Museum for their Museum of Failure exhibit this weekend. It was a bit crowded and not in the best part of town and it was difficult to find parking. The museum also took a long time to enter and there were people there to help but they weren't identified so it was a bit confusing. The exhibit itself was fine and well displayed. There was a lot of interesting material but felt that the anti-Trump material conflicted with a lot of the other messaging in the material and wasn't warranted. The museum charged $15 per person and I don't think that the insight into the exhibit warranted that charge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fogerdaddy
20,Not worth the $7 they charge,This wasn't a museum - it was really just a gallery of designers work. In one room. The adjoining gift shop had more interesting unique items than browsing print ads and books by graphic designers. There was nothing museum or educational. Maybe a $3 charge would have been ok but $7 gives you the impression you are actually going to see something worthwhile. There was absolutely nothing architectural on display either. Parking is free - that is the only positive comment I can make. Location listed here is incorrect it is now at 900 E 4th Street in the Arts District of downtown LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mctrvl
10,Waste of time and money. Not really architecture or design.,Single story only about 15 works on display and none pertained to architecture much less design. More of a modern museum of art. Don't waste time or money here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonC93
