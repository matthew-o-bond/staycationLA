50,A must-visit enclave,"Feels like one of the magical parks you find in Europe. Small, but very well-maintained...this space is relaxing and comparatively quiet. Recommend it for a picnic or some quiet reflection",LeavingOrangeCounty
50,Great walks/hikes,"Lovely place to go walking/hiking. Gives you a sense of the old West thru Hollywood eyes -- Will Rogers' house, for example, is there.",miriyamg
50,A Relaxing Park,"A beautiful, relaxing and historic park in Beverly Hills.Across the street from the Beverly Hills Hotel, so the park is in a prime location.With a fountain, water, flowers and plenty of space, it is for the entire family.Enjoy.George Vreeland Hill",George Vreeland Hill
50,Will Rogers Deserves this Park,"There are few kinder, wiser actors and celebrities associated with Hollywood than Will Rogers whose humble beginnings he never forgot. He would be grateful for this memorial park.",TravelPlenty5
30,George Michael was here,We stayed in the Beverley Hills Hotel opposite so a trip to the infamous restroom was a must What a terrible toilet However the park is really a nice oasis The pond in the middle with the fish and turtles makes it a very relaxing place to be,MIke B
40,Lovely little park,"Its a really a lovely little park. Its right opposite the famous Beverly Hills hotel. Nice for relax, picnic or walk. We live near by so walk our dog and cat here sometimes. Its usually not busy. The fountain has some really beautiful colorful carps in it and little turtles :-). Sometimes you can see green parrots here. Its surrounded by roads, so during the day it can get pretty busy. Best is at night or on sunny weekend day.",romanka2017
40,special part,"We have visited this part a number of times. The scenery is lush, with a fish pond, beautiful palm trees in the Beverly Hills neighborhood. We have even been able to observe hummingbirds fluttering in and out of the park. Great place to take in a little quiet amid the hustle and bustle of LA.",michaellW6666JY
20,"Average park, a lo light of our day","Not much to brag about here but The Beverly Hills Hotel view. I wouldnt make this part of any itinerary, the best views in my book are at either Getty or the Griffith Observatory. This park rivals a hotel grounds landscape for thrill factor.",Michelle_Haley
30,"Photo opportunity in front of the Beverly Hills Hotel, but not much to do...","Popular photo spot for tourists, wedding pictures and an occasional dog walk. Not much else to do here, bit it is scenic...",Adam A
30,Avery small park that's not really close to anything else,"Across from the Beverly shills Hotel, the big pink behemoth, sits this lovely little park. Many commercials and movies are filmed here. But it's hard to access, limited parking and pretty small. If you are close by it is worth a stop for the decamp des old trees and lovely well maintained apgarden. Plenty of walking paths and sitting. It's about a 20 minute visit, and you are done. Maybe combine with a lunch at the Apollo Lounge if you want to splurge....and walk a little of lunch off by heading across the street.",BCMCLover
40,Small and Lovely in Beverly Hills,"Will Rogers Memorial Park is a small park with lots of places to walk and enjoy peace and quiet. It is green and beautiful.The park is in the center of Beverly Hills and located near Rodeo Drive and other areas where a visitor would like to shop or see the sites.It is never crowded and it is quiet. If you need a break, you will love this little gem in Beverly Hills.",elizabethlascheid
40,Beverly Hills Pastoral ...,"Will Rogers Park is a nice green space in the heart of Beverly Hills right across the street from the classic Beverly Hills Hotel, home of the Polo Lounge & site of many star crossed memories. I like to walk the park to get away from the hustle and bustle of Rodeo Drive. Nice aside to enjoy! .....",David B L
40,Absolutely gorgeous,Great place to enjoy a quiet moment in Beverly Hills. The palm trees and landscaping are fantastic. A great place for a picnic or to admire the Beverly Hills Hotel,Jaypowen
50,Beautiful Little Park in Beverly Hills,"Some of the reviews confuse the Beverly Hills Will Rogers Memorial Park with the Will Rogers State Park in Pacific Palisades.The pretty little Will Rogers Memorial Park on 9650 Sunset Blvd. in Beverly Hills is not the same 187 acre Will Rogers State Park in Pacific Palisades/Santa Monica Mountains with the historic Will Rogers home, polo field, and hiking trails overlooking the Pacific Ocean.The Will Rogers Memorial Park is a very small, triangular-shaped park, also on Sunset Boulevard (in Beverly Hills) with limited parking. Originally named Sunset Park, the park was renamed Will Rogers Memorial Park in 1952. Will Rogers, actor/humorist/political commentator, was the first honorary mayor of Beverly Hills. Drive west on Santa Monica to the Pacific Ocean and you will be at the Will Rogers State Beach. Drive west on Sunset Boulevard and travel to Pacific Palisades,1501 Will Rogers State Park Road, to visit the Will Rogers State Park. Three very distinct places named after one influential humorist, Will Rogers.The lush, little (1) Will Rogers Memorial Park in Beverly Hills, lined with palm trees is pretty. However, it bares no resemblance to the (2) Will Rogers State Beach in Santa Monica or the (3) Will Rogers State Park in Pacific Palisades, the latter with its polo field, historic home of Will Rogers and trails overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Highly recommend the three different locations for three very different experiences.",RikiUSA
40,Nice views and interesting history,"When you get to the park, walk to the house area if you want a map (it's in the intro brochure). Oddly, there is no trail map near the trailheads and only a very limited one near the peak. We hiked early on a Saturday morning (starting at 7:30) and there were very few people out and so, we were able to enjoy the hike mostly in quiet, though you should note that locals use the park to walk dogs and exercise and during that, chat with friends (not always quietly). The views are nice, but if you like pure nature, this isn't the place for you because you can see buildings from almost every spot. Views of the Pacific, Santa Monica, LA and within the Pacific Palisades. We were too early for the hourly tours of Will Rogers' home (on the hour from 10 a.m.), but we enjoyed the exhibit and film in what I assume was a garage. Lots of good information about him and many good (and quite currently topical) quotes.",intl_bus
40,Lovely park,Beautiful park with lots of different areas. There are green lawns for picnicking and hiking trails with views. Will Rogers home has daily tours and is really lovely. You can spend hours exploring the park. Entry is free but parking has a fee. Bring a picnic and water as there isn't any food.,Claudia M
50,Great hike,"We went on a 2 hour hike on NYE while we were here for the Rose Bowl. Hike was great. Only complaints were that mapps did not seem to agree with the paths. Was also a little freaky when mountain bikes went passed on a narrow path, with one biker thanking us for getting out the way, saying he did not think he could stop.",IowaCityMD
50,great park great location,"nestled in the foothills between santa monica and the palisades close the ocean. despite being in the middle of the city is very secluded and has some nice old Will Rogers history from his house to the grounds. besides that, its a great place to hike and see a portion of the local santa monica mountains.",pandpCalifornia
50,A Landmark,"This is a must see little park, There is history, romance, and tranquility here. In the middle of Beverly Hills, yet miles away from urban stress.",Emad A
40,Must see,"A visit to L.A. is not complete without Sunset Bvd and a walk through Will Rogers Memorial Park in the Pacific Palisades.We attended a polo game, which was great fun.Especially stamping in the divots.",worldtravellersdream
50,One of the few places to watch polo matches in Los Angeles,I love this place. It is up in the hills by Pacific Palisades. You can see Will Rogers old home and get a tour. The tour guide will provide a lot of information on Will Rogers life. There are great trails to go walking and they often have polo matches on the ground lawn. There are also areas to have picnics and birthday parties. It is very family-friendly and I also see many people walking their four-legged friends .Please note that at this time the area is a little dry due to the drought Los Angeles is experiencing.,Janet M
40,Nice tribute to one of the greats,Nice park with fish and turtles in the pond. This is a good stop for photo opps.We stopped here on our bicycle tour and were not disappointed.,Justmyopinion
50,A Beautiful Venue In Tribute To The Mark Twain of Oratory,"Will Rogers who perished in a small plane in Alaska was one of America's most beloved celebrities as it suffered through its most difficult period between the Roaring 20's and Second World War during the heart of The Great Depression and Dust Bowl.His unique humor and infectious smile brought comfort and smiles to millions and millions of Americans who had little else to smile about.Located in Pacific Palisades near the western end of Sunset Boulevard the park is lush and a great escape from the craziness of the City of Angeles.Here one can watch an exciting polo match or simply enjoy an impromptu picnic and just ""chill out.""",Richard C
50,Great park in Malibu Canyon,"Home is open for touring and very enjoyable to see the collection of western art and furnishings. Great grounds, stables, picnic areas. You'd never know you were in Los Angeles.",sjmbdm
50,"My favorite park spot in Beverly Hills to reflex, relax, and draw.","Directly across the street from the famous Beverly Hills Hotel is this little triangle park sandwiched between the major cross streets of Beverly Hills. The center fountain and koi pond is the main feature, but there is also a walking path and rose gardens. This is an excellent spot to see some of the nannies of Beverly Hills talking smack about their employers with other nannies, watch the who's who of Beverly Hills take wedding shots in front of the fountain or with the Beverly Hills Hotel in the background. Or, it is a wonderful spot to watch a couple of the regular characters do what they do there. One particularly, a half nude man older man in impeccable shape that comes with his boom box and does interpretive dance for hours under the baking sun...then, gets on the #2 Metro Bus and heads back east to wherever he goes at night. Every time I've been there he's been there. I like to sit an draw the fountain. I've drawn that fountain so many times I can do it in my sleep. If you see me there, say hi! The other feature of this park for those that remember this - is it hosts the George Michael Memorial Toilets (listed as such if you Facebook locate it) where he was caught back in 1998 and precipitated his coming out. For the longest time I didn't understand the significance of this toilet in this park...as in the afternoon there are craft trucks strung out along the drive alongside. Then it hit me, this is where all the day laborers of the Beverly Hills estates go to use the toilet and have lunch and take their breaks. They wouldn't of course do that at the estate they were hired at.As long as you're at the park, walk across the street to the Beverly Hills Hotel and see it up close and for yourself. A piece of history, and if you know the album ""Hotel California"" you'll identify the spot where the album shot was taken. The lunch counter on the lower level is a great spot for coffee or a sandwich, and who knows, you may just see ""someone.""",DoctorBuckles
