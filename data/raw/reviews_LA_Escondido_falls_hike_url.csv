40,Nice little hike - perfect distance for kids,"Nice little hike. You have to park at the bottom of a huge hill and then walk a while through a residential area (mostly up hill) before you actually get to the trail. That was not well marked at all. Otherwise it’s a beautiful hike. We were easily able to do it (ages 7, 9, 36, 44). The path was mostly clear and wide. A few very small streams (like you could probably walk right over them and barely get your feet wet) are in the trail which the kids loved. The falls were really nice and there was enough space at the bottom to play around. There were some trails to the top of the falls but we didn’t venture up them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maegan2450
40,"May be easy for hike, but more than just a walk","This was reviewed as an ""easy"" hike by most reviewers. They must all be in better shape than I am. Within my group, I was the only one who got significantly tired, but everyone else seemed fine. I think the walk through the residential neighborhood was tougher than the actual hike, as the inclines were steeper. Had I stopped to rest more often, think I'd have enjoyed it more. However, the return from the falls (just a trickle) was easier than the way in to it. Very popular, saw many people there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amN2194OK
50,Escondido Falls Hike,"Length: 3.7 miles out and back Effort: easy Climb: 626feetParking: Park along side of the road or in lot is $8.Dogs: on leashThis hike gets crowded so if you don’t want to hike a long way from your parking spot to the trailhead, get their early. Also have patience as its located right off Pacific Coast Highway and you may need to park here. The hike is easy and pretty. Parts of Malibu Canyon burned in 2018 but with the rains of 2019, vegetation is returning and the wildflowers along with the butterflies were beautiful. At the end you’ll find the waterfall and its worth the time and effort to see.See more at simonemcfarland.com",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonemcfarlandtrav
40,Waterfall near LA,"Very easy hike with children...very flat. There's not much of a waterfall at the end, more like a trickle but it's only a short drive to Malibu and a short hike that is easy to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D60126
50,Malibu hike,A friend recommended this hike and it was easy/moderate in parts and there is a gorgeous waterfall at the end. The beginning of the trail was not well marked but we didn't get too far off course as it started to get very busy as the day went on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sacsoup
40,Lots of Water!,"The hike is relatively easy. Although we did the hike after many days of rain, some of the flat trail had eroded. And, there were 5 creek crossings before getting to the waterfall at the end. Each of the creek crossings had small rocks or logs to help with getting across without getting wet (I opted for wading through the water). Also most of the trees in the canyon were burned by last summer's fire. But the grass is green and growing and the waterfall at the end is fun to see. Worth the effort. Word of caution...if you park in the lot off of Winding Way, be sure to PAY. They do ticket and it's not cheap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LookwhatIfound1
40,Easy hike with a little water at the end,When I hiked Escondido Falls I can't really say there was any falls but it was still a nice hike. Most of it was shaded which was nice and when you reached the falls it was a bit cooler. You could also climb up onto the falls via some steep rocks and a rope. Its a very easy hike for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessiAnn85
50,Hike,This hike is really cool and easy; you can take your kids and dogs there. If you are around you should go there and have a good hike,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V3359CNvictord
50,"Dry, but still great","After parking you have walk to the beginning of the hike through a residential area. It's a significant uphill walk next to paved road, then up and down a bit until you make it to the trail. The trail is relatively easy, mostly flat with a few uphills, enough for you to take a breather at the top if you are not in shape, but still totally do-able. The Falls are just a trickle at the moment, but still interesting and pretty, as you can look up close at the moss on the rocks and the sun still glints off the water that's there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbajzak
30,"Great easy to follow hiking trail, but plan to go during high water",Small parking lot off the highway and relatively easy route to follow into the hills through the expensive houses. Around 45min walk to the waterfall. Best to pick a day the water is flowing through to avoid only finding a small creek and not a vast flowing wall of water that is sometimes there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773devanc
40,"A nice day walk, with a pretty grotto at the end","I wanted a short day hike, and Escondido falls seems just the thing. The first part of the hike is alongside a residential road with palatial houses. Then it takes off into the dry canyons of the Santa Monica Mountains. The walk is generally flat, well marked and about an hour total. At the end is a waterfall,which in June was still wet, though not running with lots of water. Still, the grotto at the waterfall is delightful.If you like walking in solitude, this is not the hike for you. I passed perhaps 100 people during my hike. Once you leave the beach weather, it gets quite warm... bring water. But it was fun walk on a warm day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luke2John
50,The Waterfall is Back!,After years of drought it is so great to have the waterfall back!!! The hike is as beautiful as ever but made even better by the waterfall finish line!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fayegarrow
50,Beautiful Hike with Waterfall!,This hike was such fun. It was an easy hike with great views and some shade. The temperature was wonderful and there is a well-defined pathway. At the end you are rewarded with a beautiful waterfall and grotto. We truly enjoyed it! There are amazing photo opportunities here. Also to top it off I ran into Valerie Bertinelli on the trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATXGirlie
40,Super impressed by the size of these waterfalls for being in Malibu,"This hike was quite the adventure because of the mud but if you go when it is dry it would be friendly for all. You go down one large paved hill; then the path is flat and crosses creeks. Really pretty down in a valley and about 3.8 miles round trip. The second waterfall is about five times the size as the first highly recommend going to this one too. When you leave the first look up the hill to the right, there should be a path to your left that is more of a path then rock climbing. Take this path, it will bring you to the bottom of the second fall. If you take the rock climbing one it is very fun, kind of sketchy and you end up looking down at the waterfall and can't really get to the bottom. Highly recommend going right now since they are flowing so much!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ership
50,Raging waterall after massive rainstorm,"Went on 2/18/17. It had been raining plenty recently, w a record storm the last couple days. The 5 creek crossings were knee high w very fast water. Had to walk carefully but we did not fall in! The lower falls were a raging torrent of brown water. Maybe in a day or two it will clear up. There was a strong wind coming off the base of the falls due to the flow of water, carrying a spray that quickly soaked us. Im glad my cell is waterproof or else I would have no pictures. Lots of muddy sections of the trail, but since we were walking through swollen creeks, all the mud washed off our shoes. Fun walk. Small parking lot just off PCH. Easy start on pavement, then switching to unmaintained trails, which pass through a pleasant forest. Its crazy how massive the wster flow was. Very interesting adventure this close to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haroldl29
10,Ugh,"Park along PCH, way below the trailhead, hike, and I do mean hike, the winding residential road to the top and finally reach the entrance...to then have to navigate hordes of oblivious or alternately obnoxious kids. It's like going to that Starbuck's right next to a high school at lunch time. Give me death. Cool waterfall but there are literally hundreds of better hikes in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BadBlake
40,Beautful easy hike in Malibu,This was a nice hike in Malibu. Hardest part is getting from parking lot of Pacific Coast Highway to the entrance where that's all up hill. Then it's just an easy hike to the waterfalls. You can see the falls during rainy season so we got lucky!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicamW6370JM
10,The guide books are wrong -- this place is awful,"There's almost no parking in the tiny lot so good luck finding a place along PCH (where dozens of people are killed each year by passing cars). Even if you do find a space, you have to walk about a mile just to get to the trailhead. After that, you will eventually find yourself stomping through muck so thick that pounds of it will end up sticking to each shoe/boot. Once you've endured all of that, you'll find a tiny trickle of a waterfall that stinks to high heaven of sulphur. Of all the trails in Malibu, this is by far the worst -- definitely NOT recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
10,Don't go here,"Far too crowded and full of trash. The place has been trampled down like a 12 year old shag carpet on a Time Square crosswalk. Sad too. Used to be great. Now it looks like the shiny brass on door handles that you don't want to touch. If you do go, pick up a piece of trash on your way out. That would be so awesome of you. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F258HMandrewg
40,"I would rate it higher, but you need to walk a ways to the trailhead","Two areas to hike. First is to the first set of falls and that is a very easy hike, especially in drought conditions. the second set of falls is north of the end of the first trail and is much more technical a hike. Be aware that there is tons of poison oak on that second trail, even in the dry season",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyp400
40,Hard hike but fun,"My daughter lives in Hollywood and has took this hike several times. Our family went to visit so she took us on this hike. It was nearly 2 miles to get to this hike after parking. The parking is free. the trail itself is somewhat flat. it gets pretty tough if you want to go to the falls. The day that we went, it was hot and very dry. there was a cool breeze every once in awhile. We had to free climb some of the rocks to get to the falls. There wasn't any water when we got to the falls. It was very dry and dusty. We did get some great pictures of our grown children. My daughter makes these really neat spears so we all carried one. coming back down the rocks, I just sat down and slid a few times hoping I wouldn't fall. It was tough but I'm glad we did it. The view and family memories were worth it. Bring lots of water and wear very comfortable climbing shoes. Watch out for snakes and lizards. My daughter came across one when she hiked this trail before. It was probably about a 5 mile hike round trip. Most of it was flat with a few inclines. The rocks were pretty steep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirbyfive
30,Light to moderate,"An easy, gentle hike on narrow path, but busy during weekeds. Terminates at a very dry waterfall that has but a trickle. Better off going to Solstice as there's more to see & explore along the way & at the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632
50,A pleasant hike,Start by parking free at the lot on the corner of Pacific Coast Highway and after a road hike through a residential area you reach the trailhead. Interesting hike that brings you to a very high waterfall that is best seen after a rainfall. The hike is short and not difficult. Hiking aroun the side and above the falls will bring you to the creek and small natural pools.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom734
50,"Gentle hike, good for families, dog friendly","It's past via Escondido and before P. Cove. Ya gotta drive on up to Winding Way ( just before P. Cove).There's a very small parking lot but plenty of parking on PCH. Please be careful on the highway. This trail gets very busy on the weekends/holidays. Hope you like people.It's a dog-friendly trail (leashed) so bring your dog. Check for ticks afterwards.This is an easy-gentle hike and accessible for the whole familyWalk uphill on Winding Way, a paved road, to the trailhead sign and off to the falls.Clear and well-maintained trail. Ya can't get lost.We went to the falls today after the rains. We were hoping for falls that were spectacular...it was still a trickle but an easy hike and a beautiful walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,Hike,Great hike. 2 hours walk. Clean. Good people. Nice lil water fall. Park on Pacific Coast Highway and winding road. And take a walk through a half a mile of mansions,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerrickM576
40,Hiking in Malibu Hills,"Great hike with beautiful ocean view through georgious homes, mostly shaded, very quiet and away from the noise and traffic of the beach. Fairly easy, but lots of up hill on the way to the falls, which happened to be dried up in Feb, no surprise though. Would definitely recommend this hike for a fairly short but beautiful get-away from the craziness of the city. Plenty of street parking but mind the no-parking signs, they do ticket!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/881MaryC881
