50,RELIVING MY YOUNG MAN'S AUTOMOTIVE FANTASIES,"As a young man growing up in NJ in the 60's, I can vividly recall waiting impatiently each month for the next issues of Hot Rod & Car Craft magazine to arrive. Living on the east coast was a world away from the California car culture and those magazines were our connection to what was going on customs, muscle cars and, of course, drag racing.Back then, the NHRA only ran a handful of ""National"" events but there were more classes and different types of race cars than we see today. Besides the Top Fuel, Pro Stock & Funny Cars there were Gassers and Fuel Altereds, Stocks, Super Stocks and Modified Production cars too.Visiting the Wally Parks NHRA Museum was like having every issue of Hot Rod Magazine I read as a kid come to life right before my eyes. There was Mickey Thompson's Challenger 1 ""in the flesh""! The Stone Woods & Cook Willys Gasser! The Greer, Black & Prudhomme Top Fuel car! Mooneyes! Tommy Ivo's Buick powered 4 engined dragster! The Pure Hell Fuel Altered!....and on & on & on. The cream of the crop from drag racing's heyday lives on at the Wally Parks Museum and it's a MUST SEE if you're into cars and are visiting southern California.The hot setup is to time your visit in conjunction with one of the bi-monthly Pomona Swap Meets held on the same grounds at the Fairplex. Hit the swap meet and car show first (come EARLY!) then as the swap meet dies down head over to the Parks Museum.You'll be exhausted but you'll have a day to remember.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/930waltw

10,Terrible Vote only because of the LA Fair.,Don't go to this Museum during the LA County Fair in September. We were told we would have to pay $15 Parking then we could walk through the Fair. Reluctantly we did this but after parking we found out they wanted $14 each to get into the fair to get to the museum. Unbelievable. We gave up and I will say Battled to get our parking money back. Provision should be made to get to the museum during this fair. I did contact the Museum that night about out disappointment and they tried to get us in the next day via a lot of mucking about but we were head back to Australia. we will probably never get an opportunity to go there again so never go in September,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/561JeffM561

40,NHRA Museum,I thought the Museum was pretty good. It was smaller then I thought. I really think it would be better if they had a few more interactive items or videos to watch why you were there. Also the gift shop didn't have to much to offer. If they got better in those 2 areas I might increase the grade to a 5. I went to the John Force Museum a couple of days later and I thought it was better then this one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psteelerfan77

While dragsters abound, so do hot rods, custom cars, land speed record vehicles and other racers. You get to tour at your own pace, and spend as much time as you like at any one exhibit.

I was a real treat to see these cars in person.The racing cars included machines of all kinds including rails, funny cars, and more. The Force funny cars were very special. Then there was the twin engine dragster, then there was the . . . well, you get the idea.The museum is located in Pomona, just off I-10. It is very easy to get to. Just find Gate 1 of the Fairplex.

What memories. The displays are fabulous. To have all these machines preserved and in such wonderful shape is a feast for the imagination and the eye. I would be a docent if I lived near by, really. Be aware of some special setups that they have at the museum, special cars that travel around the country to various Museums and car shows. I had the opportunity to take a friend who loved batman so much she had a logo tattoo installed. When the docents at the museum saw it she was allowed to get in the bat-mobile for a photo shoot. How nice. It is a must see for drag racing fans and a good show for everybody else!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleySays
