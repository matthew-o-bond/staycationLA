40,A Must Visit Ostrich Farm!!!,"We took a family excursion to check out The Quail Run Ostrich Ranch and am so glad we did!!! We pulled into the Ranch (which has plenty of parking) and were immediately greeted by Jacquie, the owner. Jacquie is SUPER friendly and is quick to make you feel at home. She also is an incredibly talented artist with her ostrich egg art! They’re truly remarkable.The tour started with being able to see and hold a fresh ostrich egg! It was very cool! They sell them for $40. Then we went over to one of the paddocks where we were greeted by three ostriches. I’ve been to Ostrichland USA before so I’ve had the experience of being up close with ostriches. But these three were WAY more docile than the ones at ostrichland! It was very cool being so close and having them just chill out while Jacquie told us about them.They have quite a few ostriches on the property (I think she said 26 or something like that) along with chickens and some goats. I had a great time and will absolutely be coming back here in July when they have babies!!! The reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5 (5 being “as good as it gets”) is that I wish there was a hint more to the tour. It was pretty much just the one paddock and we were done. Don’t get me wrong, they invited you to stay as long as you wanted, but a few extra stops on the tour would have been cool. Full disclosure, unlike Ostrichland USA, where they are open as a tourist attraction, Quail Run is a working ostrich farm and they decided to start allowing guests to share these amazing birds with people. So it’s a bit of a different thing. But again... 4 stars (Yay, I’m a fan!!!) is pretty darn good!I would absolutely recommend visiting!!! It’s only $5/person with free parking and available restrooms. I’m excited to go back!!!Ps. You won’t get reception here so plan accordingly when going home or to your next stop. We guessed wrong.
