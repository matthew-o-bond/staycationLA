40,Great brews,"Ran across this place while out for a walk in Burbank. Kind of hidden off the main roads but well worth a visit. Theyâ€™ve been open for 5 months. Nice selection of in-house beers and snacks. Comfortable bar and seating area, staff is friendly and happy to answer questions.No restaurant on site but they hope to have one soon.",dougw340
