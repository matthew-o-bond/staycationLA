40,Skip the North and do Playa Del Rey to Torrance,"Lucky enough to have friends at Manhattan Beach with a handy collection of bikes, so did several rides in varying directions, either down to Torrance Beach, or north to Venice Beach, and the best section is from Playa Del Rey to Torrance Beach.The ride is fantastic, but do it during the week if possible, as come the weekend it is mayhem, especially when you hit Venice Beach, when even during the week, the cycle ways with graphics of cycles and the words 'Cycles Only' must only be for aesthetics, along with arrows pointing in either direction to indicate which side of the trail you should be on.But other than that, during the week it is a great flat ride along the coast, with gentle onshore breezes. It really makes for a relaxing cycle, and really a must do. The scenery between major stops is going to be monotonous, as it is basically vast wide beaches and ocean on one side, and beach front mansions on the other, but that is why the cycling is the only way to go. Please note that e-scooter are banned on it, so don't expect to hire an e-scooter as a quicker and easier way to do it.Best place to stop along the way for a Beer and Lunch is Redondo Beach Pier. Under the Car Park, along the front of the Pier (easily missed if you don't go down the stairs) is a great collection of casual Bars, where you can sit by the window and watch the world go by. If you opt for Venice Beach, check out The Venice Whaler opposite the Car Park but right on the Beach, great collection of Beers, and excellent Pizzas.So for a great day out, hire a bike and hit the Bike Trail, great way to see a lot of the coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/649eugeneh
30,got lost getting to Venice Beach from Manhattan beach,"Definitely fun to ride along the ocean front for all the miles your body can peddle! BEWARE though that from Manhattan Beach (south of the harbor) to Venice Beach (north of the harbor) the signage is poor. I got lost, following the pack of other cyclists and ended up far to the east. After meandering my way back through some not-so bike friendly areas I got to my destination. The signage to go north simply says Marina del Rey and Coast Guard something-THAT is the route across the bBay! The way north to south was a little better marked. When I stopped in a bike shop in Venice Beach to find out exactly the way to head southwards, I was told (by a ""stoner"") to simply walk across the beach to the other side of the Bay-really?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattyM340
50,Excellent trail,"I rented a bike in Hermosa Beach and went to Venice Beach and return (around 42 km)It's a very good way to know the different places they overlook the sea (Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, El Segundo, Marina del Rey, Venice Beach).There is a part in Marina del Rey that the path is cut and you have to go down the street. Maybe this is the only bad part. If you can continue until Santa Monica is ideal but in my case i was a bit tired and decided to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuanPabloTraveller
50,Brilliant Idea,We were in California for a wedding but used some extra days to tour the area. This bike trail is great. You see a lot and get great exercise. Use a lot of sunscreen as you are out in the open and the sun is strong here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamvose
50,What a bike trail !,"Rented the day before a beach cruiser at Hermosa Cyclery - quality bikes by the way - and went for an early 7:30 am bike ride between Manathan Beach and Venice and back. Total 44 km.Loved it to bits.Loved the ride by the sea front.Loved the ride in the city around Marina del Rey, so well sign posted and always on secured bike path.Loved the ambiance, the cyclists, joggers, e-skaters and the sunshine.Go early at sunrise!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frenchfrog39
40,Bike trail from Playa Vista,"Great way to spend the day; excercise, good food and great views. From my apartment in Playa Vista, I rode my bike straight down Jefferson through the Ballona wetlands right onto the bike trail on the beach.Continued on with my music fully loaded, I coasted past views of the Pacific Ocean and the LA river.The path drops you onto Fiji way where the boat harbor is, then leads you to Venice Blvd.Awesome day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdolotina
50,Fantastic paved cycle track along the beach,"This excellent flat paved cycle trail is 22 miles long and runs between Will Rogers State Beach in Pacific Palisades and Torrance County Beach. We were staying in Playa Del Rey for a few days which is approximately the half way point.For the most part the trail runs along the beach, only deviating very occasionally. There is also the very occasional sections where you have to ride on cycle lanes on the road. But for the most part you are riding along the beach with great ocean views.The trail is used by cyclists, skaters and some walkers. But there is plenty of room, so it never feels crowded.We used it every day we were in Playa Del Rey, great way to get to Venice and Santa Monica, much better than taking the freeway in the car.There are plenty of places to hire bikes all along the trail, a great way to spend a half or full day and get some exercise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueJim126
50,Great Path from Torrance State Beach to Marina Del Rey,"This is a great paved path from Torrance State Beach to Marina Del Rey that runs along the ocean with great views. Unfortunately it is not exclusive to cyclists, so either go riding early before the dog walkers and joggers clog the path or be patient. I tend to go early as speed and fitness is my motivator and get my 20 to 30 mile ride in before breakfast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveZ739
50,Best Way to Spend a Day along to LA Beaches,"We rented Bicycles from our Hotel for $30 each and spent the whole day along the bike path (you can rent the bikes a little cheaper from the bike stores on the beach). We started at the Santa Monica Pier at 8am, stopped on the Boardwalk in Venice Beach for Breakfast, rode through Marina del Ray, stopped in Manhattan Beach to watch a bunch of twentysomethings/teenagers play volleyball, stopped in Hermosa Beach for their annual surf festival were we played games and listened to live music. Rode to Redondo Beach where we ate at a great seafood restaurant called Captain Kidds and did and little window shopping on the Redondo beach pier. We then bicycled to the end of the trail, turned around and headed back to Santa Monica (returned at 5:30). Total distance was 40 miles, but its flat and paved the whole way. What a perfect way to see the LA coastline and experience everything the beach communities offer. We didn't find the bike path to be overly crowded (we rode on a Saturday) or difficult. Some experienced rider will complete the trail in two hours. Let then fly by you; sit back enjoy the beach for the day and hum the tune ""Peaceful easy Feeling"" by the Eagles as your coasting along this sunny southern California trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Golfer15544
50,Great way to see the beach cities,I brought my inline skates and did different parts of The Strand - the best was Manhattan to Marina Del Rey - on a weekday - not much traffic. There are places where the sand has blown up on the path which can be tricky on skates but all in all it was great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randomhappiness
50,wow. Great biking by the sea.,"I really can't say enough about what fun it is to bike on this path. All flat and scenic. Well marked. Pretty busy (wouldn't be good on a weekend). Part of it is on a busy street, so we drove our bikes from one section to the other, which was a nuisance and expense having to pay to park twice. Most people would probably be ok on a few blocks of street traffic, but for me, it was not safe. The south section of the trail, from Pacific Avenue Bridge to Torrance is along the beach, but there's construction there as well as power plants, so it's not as scenic as the northern half, from Venice Pier to Will Rodgers park. There's an excellent map of the trail, which we got from our hotel. It was accurate and very helpful and shows the distance for each segment of the trail. The total distance is 22 miles one way. We had our own bikes, but there are bike rentals near the path at Venice Pier and Fisherman's Village. Definitely worth doing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X-NYr
50,Wonderful Trail Along the Pacific Ocean!,"I rode this trail for second time when I last visited Redondo Beach. I’m from Ohio and it’s awesome to bike along the Pacific Ocean! The wide, paved trail travels 22 miles from Torrence County to Will Rodgers State Beach in Pacific Palisades. Whether you bike, walk, run, rollerblade or skateboard, this trail is for you. The locals know the Marvin Braude Trail as the Strand. Both of my bike rides were on a fall weekday. I’m sure in the summer, you will be dodging people in the more popular areas. Watch for sand on the trail if you’re biking. The trail ends for a short distance in Marina del Rey and you ride on Washington Boulevard for a several blocks (lots of traffic!) and the trail runs through the parking structure for the Redondo Beach Pier - a sign requests that you walk your bike.Forget your bike? There are numerous bike rental shops along the trail and helmets and bike locks are included in the price. Grab a trail map and enjoy! Restrooms are plentiful as are restaurants – the reason to bring a lock. You get a real sense of the California beach scene as you ride along. Pass by several municipal piers, an amusement park, volleyball games, a skate park, the LA airport where planes fly over your head, a large population of homeless near Venice Beach and lots families enjoying the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovetoWalk51
40,Paved Path Along the Beach ...,"The path is a nice smooth & wide concrete thoroughfare which rests at the high end of the beach and seashore all along the beach cities. We watched bikers, skaters, walkers, hikers, runners, joggers & moms w strollers, all somehow sharing the same real estate. Fun to use & fun to watch the mixed menagerie. Thanks Councilman Marvin Braude! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,What can beat riding along the beach on a sunny day?,Rode the bike trail between Dockweiler beach and the Redondo Pier. Beautiful pathway (with the exception of riding past the power stations). This section of the path is much less crowded with pedestrians then the section in Santa Monica and Venice Beach. Nice too that you don't have to navigate through any vehicular traffic as you do on the section that goes through Marina Del Rey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerjon
50,Nice and flat bike trail,Great way to see all of the beach towns on this path. Venice Beach is the busiest part of the path so you need to be careful of lots of walkers on the path.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billg829
50,Miles of Beach riding,"You can basically ride from Torrance, to Malibu. 22 miles with one hill. Best prt is you are right on the beach for 97% of the ride. Bike, blade, skateboard, walk, run..plenty of options. Most parts are not that crowded. Plus great for people watching!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/695judj
50,One of the BEST Bike trails in Southern CA,"This bike trail runs from Torrance Beach on the southern end up past Manhattan Beach, Venice Beach and Santa Monica Beach on the north end, all the way to Will Rogers State Beach. I really liked this trail because it is easy for anyone who is reasonably fit, and because it is for biking NOT hiking. The closer that you get to Venice Beach, however, you will encounter lots of walkers crossing back and forth across the bike path, as well as sand on the trail which can be dangerous. As an example, people were standing along the path waiting to cross over when my sister in front of me slid out with her bike on the slippery sand, and I narrowly avoided crashing into her, and the crowd of people by coming to a sliding sideways stop. I also liked the quarter mile markers along the path telling me how far I had travelled. One can end up traveling over 40 miles end to end and back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickiG555
50,My favorite thing to do at the beach,"This is a wonderful 22.5 mile bike path from Torrance Beach in the south to Will Rodgers Beach in the north. With the exception of going around the Redondo Beach Pier / King Harbor area and Marina Del Rey where you will have to ride on a marked separate bike lane on the road it is a two way paved path along the beach. Restrooms and places to buy food and drink are plentiful along the way. The least crowded time to ride is mid week in the winter. This is also the best opportunity to catch them filming something along the coast. Other times, try to go early in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbielab
40,"Great exercise, watch for pedestrians","My husband's parents lived in MDR and we keep bikes in their garage for use when we visit. Today we rode 20 miles on the Braude Bike Path from the Marina up past Will Rogers State Park and back. It's always better to ride early in the morning or weekdays before the ambling tourists and other pedestrians appear. There are many places where the trail is shared LEDs/bikes but tourists don't often stay out of the bike lane. There can be sand on the cement, too, making for a possibly treacherous ride if it's crowded. Wear a helmet and pay attention. Regular bathrooms and water fountains and showers available along the route. Goes all the way south of LAX/Dockweiler to Manhattan Beach/Redondo Beach.Lots of places to rent bikes if you're visiting. Just please stay to the right and if you're walking stay out of the bike lanes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saragrad
50,Here's Where You'll Learn That L.A. Is Not Just About Cars!,"A ride on the Marvin Braude Coastal Bike Trail will give you a unique, relaxing and VERY L.A. experience. The ride takes you through Santa Monica, Venice, Marina del Rey, past the Ballona Wetlands, under planes taking off at LAX and into the trendy cities of the South Bay. The trail is mostly along the beach, with only two short stints on city streets. Some areas are crowded and others almost deserted, (depending on the time and day.) There are lots of places to eat along the way, on the adjacent streets, especially in Santa Monica, Venice, Playa del Rey and in the South Bay. I'd recommend taking along a picnic lunch. Fun things to look for: surfers, seals, pelicans, sailboats with spinnakers, jumbo jets taking off overhead, crew teams rowing, outrigger canoes, seagull opening mussels by dropping them on the trail, skaters, and all manners of tricked out bikes. For me, this is one of L.A.'s great unsung attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arashibi
50,My favorite thing about Southern CA,"I have been biking and roller skating on this trail my entire life. I absolutely love it! It's long, but so amazing. I usually start in Torrance and ride to Manhattan beach and back. But on Labor day I did the entire trail. The beaches up past Manhattan Beach are so peaceful and quiet with perfect white sand and dolphins in the water. The refinery is in El Segundo so the beach access is limited, this is where you can have the entire place to yourself. Ride a bit more and you go around the marina (follow the signs) and into Venice. Oh, I love Venice Beach!! I can spend hours watching the skaters dance at the skate park or the guys at Muscle Beach showing off. This Beach is a treat for your senses. Get something to eat here then onward to Santa Monica. So beautiful! Then look back at how far you have to ride home. Round trip is about 42 miles, the pavement is marked so you know how far you've ridden. Work your way up to the 42!! And always walk your bike if any lights are on at the Piers- big tickets if you don't. It's not a race, it's a day to enjoy!! Bike rentals are available in Redondo Beach and other places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chipsahoy67
50,Fantastic Ride,Beautiful ride by the ocean from Santa Monica to Torrance Beach. 22 miles mostly directly alongside the ocean. Plenty of cafes along the way. Best done in winter during the week when it is reasonably quiet; otherwise it can get very crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickyH169
