10,Disgusting,"Foul mouthed transients everywhere, the stench of urine permeates the the park. Couldn’t leave fast enough! Such a disgrace for such a lovely part of the city. We did not feel safe at this park.",sixxmom
10,Disgusting!,"I had heard this park was a great place to go midcity. Forget about it, it is disgusting, it has the strong smell of urine all around. There are homeless laying all over the green space so there isn’t a chance to kick a ball around. There is cigarette smoke as well as marijuana smoke all around. The mentally ill people who appear to live at the park are quite frightening. This is one park to pass on until it is cleaned up.",sixxmom
40,Great park for family outings,"Nice park with tennis courts, mature trees. Great for walking during the day light hours. The place is sketchy during evening hours with people loitering and sleeping in the park.",SMOgal
50,Nice park in mid Santa Monica,"Good greenery, good tennis courts, nice playground, easily reached on Wilshire Blvd and Lincoln. A popular local park.",Chingachgook
30,"Way too many homeless, hanging around in the park and the grounds.","So this is a great park location, th tennis courts are great, and the grounds which are on the north side above Wilshire are nice, but the homeless problem has created an atmosphere of running the gauntlet, of being begged or hounded for money instead of being able to just enjoy the park.Although sympathetic to the needs of the homeless, there are a number of very overbearing homeless in the park all the time.",AARDVARKKILLER
40,Park is hidden in plain view ...,"You see the pleasant green space as you drive down Wilshire. Recently redone & nicely upgraded. Has kiddie areas, water feature & nice tennis courts, often with minimal wait time. Neat picnik areas under the trees. Formerly this was Bum Central / Homeless Park, but that has improved a great deal, but not completely. Nice walking ...",David B L
50,Great local park.....,"recently redone with a nice water feature and equipement for ball playing and kids to swing. well maintained, but there is a near constant homeless problem the city is incapable of handling.",pandpCalifornia
50,Lighted Tennis Courts with Ball machines,These courts are very conveniently located and a ball machine can be rented. We used them in the winter and getting court time was not hard. Maybe harder in summer. The courts are free for drop in non reserved use and $4 per hour for non residents per person if reserved. The ball machine is $12 per hour. There are many courts in Santa Monica which can be reserved fro here. More info can be found on http://www.smgov.net/Departments/CCS/content.aspx?id=32262,Sanjay B
