40,Famous for its history,"The Sunset Strip is really just a portion of Sunset Blvd that stretches through West Hollywood and it is really just a bunch of office building, restaurants, shops, and nightclubs. But it is iconic, especially if you know the history of the Sunset Strip and why it became one of the go to nightlife spots in Los Angeles. Read up a bit about it first (even if its just the Wiki page) and then take a drive down Sunset and stop off at one of the iconic spots. Also keep your eye out for both the views and a famous celebrity spotting.",cjfbruno
30,Not like what I expected,Couldn’t post much photos since well it was juSt a dark and gloomy area now. Guess tourists need to go during the day although I wanted to see the lights at night.,felinefrannie
50,Great place to stay!,"Looked at two hotel; one on the strip and the other near Hollywood boulevard. Glad I picked the strip because Hollywood boulevard was a waste of time. It was a 1.75 bus ride but only stayed about an hour. The strip had plenty to do including good restaurants and live music. Plus plenty of famous places including the Whisky and Chateau. Also did not have the crowds. I also saw Joni Mitchell's ""They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.""",Comanderkody

You also can just be a spectator and not dee the shows etc. But that is half the fun.Obviously no strollers to see the show. The nnightlife is for adults basically.

20,Not a fan,Had heard about the Strip most of my life and finally made to this part of the country to see it many other things. Walked with my teenage daughter for a few miles and kept expecting to see more than I did but it was a nasty place. Liked the billboards of all the new shows and movies that are coming out but saw too many homeless people laying on the sidewalks and several barking out like nut jobs and wanting money. Was couple of well known comedy clubs and some decent looking restaurants that I had planned on eating at but we never did.,Tommy P

Nothing was open of course, except the Chateau bar, where we strolled in like rock stars in Raybans, for brunch in the Patio bar. Another one ticked off the bucket list.",dgt2017
30,"Try it day (blah), try it night(life)?",We took the tour bus down the strip during the day and saw all the famous night clubs. Looked down on its heels. Took a taxi out there in the evening and it seemed to have a bit more life. Went into one or two clubs and it was ok but not really my scene.,Chinapjs
10,What a let down,We went in the day it’s just a long road which is very dated old fashioned and not even well maintained.

There is The Chinese Theatre with hand prints of stars, than the Hollywood Walk of Frame with the stars of actors, musicians etc. Also a lot of homeless people & the area isn't very clean.

30,Legendary status but somewhat average reality,"I was totally stoked to have the opportunity to stay on The a Strip and visit some of the legendary venues. As a lifelong rock fan I am very much aware of the key venues along this area. I still go to watch some of the bands associated with The a Strip when they come to the UK, often in very small venues to small audiences, but I love the whole scene and still buy albums from bands just setting out now who fit into that certain category.Sure The Rainbow, Whiskey and The Viper are great, even a The Roxy but maybe I was expecting too much. We were there over a weekend and visited all these places, which were excellent but there was little else to shout about along the rest of The Strip.For me, what I saw was what I wanted to see but I just didn’t get the overall vibe or think the whole strip offered up too much.Maybe I should have been there 25 years or so ago.Well worth a visit but maybe ends up shattering a dream or two.",Ian A

Only saw the outside of The Viper Rooms.

40,The Glam of La La Land,"Well, I would totally avoid the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but there's still a mystique about the ""Strip"". I agree with a previous traveler that it's not the same place it was back in the 80's. I played at The Roxy Theatre in Christopher Cross's band in 1980. Limos, sold out crowds, and the audience was filled with stars, and paid ""ringers"" from Warner Communications. It's just not like that anymore. Maybe I'm nostalgic, but I remember Kookie and his comb, from 77 Sunset Strip, the tv show in the late 50's. So, ... nothing stays the same, no matter what. Just try to adapt. A block off from the strip are many fine restaurants, and you really should drive on past and go down through Beverly Hills, and past UCLA, and on to the beach. It's just a great road. Skip the bad parts, but drive up and down on a weeknight, and you can catch the Glam of the billboards, and lights.",music-professor

50,Busy place!,We had a great time on sunset strip! Our hotel (Grafton on Sunset) was right across the road from the Comedy Store. Very busy road tho! Lots to do.. lots of restaurants. Some night clubs (the Viper room). It's known for the night life!,Connie G
40,Neat area,"This is a neat historical area. We visited during the day and I was harassed by a panhandler to the point of being terrified, but other than that it's pretty cool. There's lots of stores and restaurants.",Callielyn83
30,It was just alright for me. Different experience for sure.,"I guess if you want to see the freak show or get pickpocketed, its ok. As you drive further down the road, the shops, restaurants, and homes are very nice.",bat121
50,Amazing!,"Stupid me! My very first visit to California and I chose to spend only 26 hours there! However that poor choice was alleviated by going to dinner on the Sunset Strip.....fabulous! We had a bistro style table, the weather only accented the entrées. The meal began with three different types of bread. We ordered a pizza and two pastas. Absolutely delicious. Service could have been better: it was the waitor's first day on the job so she couldn't help much with the choices, constantly referring to her notes which was a bit off putting, so we eventually decided to order what looked good on the menu: I certainly can't complain about that. We finished off with Tiramisu. OMG, to die for! Have to recommend this place.....location, food, ambiance, it's got it all. Maybe next time, we'll have an experienced server. And I'll stay longer.",Kathleen Q
50,You can't beat the vibes along this iconic avenue,"Go here to eat, drink and shop 'til you pop. Best Chin Chin in LA with sidewalk seating or indoors or take out. Love the boutiques and night life. Parking is free for customers of the shops.",Pattithediva P
30,Vintage,"This is ok. It is a bit run down. It is great to see if you are into 'old' hollywood and old movie stars. I thought it was a bit of a dive. Good to see just to tick off your list, but I wouldnt stay too long",Shell C

50,Not what it was but still fun,It's not the heydays of the 80's but it is still cool. Lots of great music and clubs and food. Tons of cool shopping too. Makes for a great day trip.,Curb
40,A great neighborhood to walk around with some of LA's most famous sites.,"Most of the action is east of La Cienga, in fact east of Fairfax along Hollywood Blvd but the whole area is an interesting walk. The Hollywood Walk of Fame can be brutally crowded during peak seasons.",Don T
50,Legendary,"You come to LA, where do you go? Sunset Strip!! You know, the history was made here - all the people who influenced the modern world started out here. No movie/music star anywhere in the world is complete without putting their name on the map here. I feel it's mandatory to come here when you're in LA. It's like Paris and it's Eiffel Tower",lucretiasantos
40,Interesting and diverse and worth the visit,"We were staying a block from Sunset Boulevarde and explored a number of areas along Sunset strip. The range of restaurants, bars and shops and the various walks of life on the strip make for a fantastic experience. Worth the visit",David N
30,OK place to visit in small doses,"There is definitely some history there, it worth seeing but I would not want to spend too much time there specialty shopping. Everything is highly overpriced and overrated. Almost pretentious I would say. They are though a few good bars and restaurants even though they are overpriced. If you have not seen before definitely worth seeing but would not want to make it a regular spot",Asad K
40,Fun drive,"Started near Santa Monica and went through Hollywood. Got a little run down in some areas, but overall a good overview of the So Cal lifestyle.Passed by a lot of very expensive cars.",John F

50,amazing experience,great sharing all the excitement of the famous Sunset Strip that we have always heard about. Looking at the famous stars in Hollywood Blvd was great.,Margaret S
40,Great place to eat n drink,"This is a good place to eat n drink as well as celebrity spotting and you will see some stars here for sure, very central to Hollywood and Beverly hills, I love Hollywood",Jackie C
20,What's the big deal?,We drove down Sunset Strip on the advice of someone from LA. It didn't seem to be anything special. We very much more enjoyed the Hollywood Walk of Fame.,WednesdayNightGirl
40,Better for night life,"During the day, it could be seen as just another street but it comes alive at night - lots of bars and places for music. I'd avoid the tourist shopping.",RonWamberal
30,Tired and seedy,"Sunset strip, like the rest of LA has seen better days.It is run down and in parts, very seedy! I walked the length of it some years ago when it was a pretty good happening place, but time has taken its toll!By all means, give it a go or drive down it if you are in LA - just don't expect much.",Phil6554
30,Bit disappointing. But go.,It's lined by cheap (well actually not) tourist shops on both sides for a lot of it.The west end of the strip is better.But it's fun to walk down both sides of the road to take some photos.,MarkHippo
50,Sunset Strip vs Hollywood Blvd,"I live off of the Sunset Strip so I drive and hang out in this area often (if not daily). When you think of ""glamorous Hollywood"" or ""ritzy Hollywood"" or ""where the movie stars hang out in Hollywood"", you're really thinking about the Sunset Strip, which is the cleaner, fancier, nicest part of Hollywood. Interestingly, it's actually West Hollywood, not Hollywood, and it's a series of nice hotels and bars that is close to Beverly Hills. The closer to Beverly Hills you get, the nicer it generally is.While you have the Viper Room, The Whiskey, Roxy, Rainbow Room, etc., which are serious rocker bars and music venues, you also have the Sky Bar at the Mondrian, The Standard, Katana, BOA, Chateau Marmont, and Sunset Plaza, all of which are very upscale restaurants/hotels where you're bound to run into models and movie stars. It's also a tourist area, but it certainly doesn't feel like Hollywood Blvd., where the stars you see are actually imbedded into the sidewalk you're walking on and it's definitely not nearly as upscale as the Sunset Strip. You should definitely see both, but you'd want to hang out/eat at the Sunset Strip.Also, there's typically a lot of traffic on the Strip so be aware of that, and try to avoid the right lane after you cross Crescent Heights/Laurel Canyon driving West on Sunset Blvd. as the right lane is usually clogged with cars waiting for Chateau Marmont valet at night. It can be dangerous if you're not paying attention because of a sudden stop. Enjoy the show.",Michael_Saleh
50,Iconic Sunset Strip,"Experience the feeling of Sunset Strip...when the biggies lived and partied! The palm tree lined street makes you feel that you have gone back in time almost expecting to see iconic stars that made Hollywood magical.Sunset Strip is vibrant...from Whisky A GoGo, the Viper Room, the Comedy Store and Laugh Factory...to a cocktail or two at Chateau Marmont Hotel. There are plenty of designer stores and amazing restaurants with a plethora of interesting people.",Joanne A
50,The stuff of legends....,"I'm a 90s rocker so HAD to see the Sunset Strip and seeing all the places you heard about in songs is awesome! Hello Whiskey, Hello Roxy, Hello Rainbow etc etc......",SwissSooosi
20,Not a great highlight,"I walked this during the day on a Sunday and found it woeful, none of the sights such as Whiskey A Go Go, Viper Room were interesting, there was no one about so didn't have any vibe or atmosphere. Not worth the time, was glad when I got off the Strip.",MakingMemories
50,Must Cruise for the Scene,"Billboards Legendary Clubs Whiskey a Go Go Rainbow Grill Chateau Marmont Sunset Tower and Bar Soho House Stunning Sculpted People Outrageous Fashion and the Best people watching.Fun to walk as well to get a better feel.Night has a special magic to it and yes,the ""Stars"" do come out...",mike h
50,A Tourist MUST,"Hollywood is DEFINED by ""THE STRIP"" - it's got everything you come to L.A. for. Great places to eat - tons of things to see and enjoy - lots to excite and sometimes even SHOCK your senses....The Strip has ALOT to see and do - decide what excites and you can find it on the strip.",David P
40,Nice place to visit,"If you grew up in the 80's listening to hair bands, no matter where you were in the world - you have heard of the Sunset Strip. It's a great place to visit. All the places in the songs of yesterday are still here - Roxy, Whiskey, Rainbow. There are some great places to eat here so come over hungry - Dough is one of them.",R Giansanti
50,I love this place,"Even though it changed quiet a bit before my first stay in L.A ('09) and now, i still love this place, specially in the evening. Great parties, good neighborhood, musical history , and that's one of those places in LA where you feel safe walking alone at night",Candycaiiine
40,Don't just visit... live it!,"When you see the famous Sunset Strip on TV or in movies, they show you what it once was, a frolicking 24/7 sex, drugs, and rock n roll party. Then you get there, and it's not that. It's not even close to that. Don't get me wrong, it's still cool to visit, and I love walking the strip to see all the bars, clubs and hotels that helped make it famous, but for the most part nowadays what you'll find is a busy street filled with celebrity homes tour vans, a couple homeless guys, and a few people out walking around with cameras. Most people don't visit the Sunset Strip for what it is, they visit Sunset Strip for what it once was. You might see a celebrity hanging around Sunset Plaza, but don't count on it. On a Friday or Saturday night it does get a bit more interesting, but if you're on the outside looking in, any other time of the week most people will find it's worth spending a couple hours walking around, but that's really all you need. To get more out of the experience you really need to be prepared to actually VISIT those bars, clubs and hotels, and that's where the fun truly begins! Simply touring Sunset Strip is underwhelming. Living Sunset Strip, even though it may be long past it's glory days, is where the experience is. Have a drink at the Rainbow. Get tickets to a comedy club. Take in a show at Whisky or the Viper Room. Have dinner at Chateau Marmont. There's still plenty of fun to be had for those willing to get into it.",TravellinDaveHead
30,Probably depends when you go,"I walked this stretch of the Blvd on a Sunday afternoon and, aside from restaurant patrons on patios, didn't really see anyone out walking, everyone drives and it was a hot day so I don't blame them. At night this place must come alive, this afternoon there wasn't much to write home about. It is pretty cool to finally see famous places you've heard about - Whisky a Go Go, the Roxy, Hyatt ""Riot House"", all fixtures of the classic rock scene.",Ydnar
30,Somewhat disappointing,"As part of a tour from Vegas to L.A., we were given two hours to explore the famous Sunset Strip on our own.OK - it's iconic, world famous, a ""must see""....... but, honestly, I struggled to fill in the allotted couple of hours, spending more than half an hour in the famous Roosevelt Hotel lounge (sumptuously decorated and furnished), sipping a cold beer; and escaping the crowds.OK - there are the stars on the pavement (sidewalk) with the movie, and other, names on them. And, by the Chinese Theatre, the handprints, captured in concrete, of many big names.But...but, that was about it, sorry.At least, I've been and have experienced it, and although this review is somewhat lacking in praise for this street, I'm glad I went.By the way - for older readers - I didn't get to see ""77 Sunset Strip""; it's probably now a comb shop run by ""Kookie's"" grandchildren!!! :)",Sandy S
40,Great people watching on a Sat night!,"While not near it's former glory of the 80's and 90's, it's still a fun place to visit on a weekend night",carl c
20,"if you like tourists, go here","Well I was unimpressed and stayed for only 5 minutes.....yes there are stars with peoples names all over and the Chinese theater has hand/foot prints from some famous people......but , only if you have to say you have been there. That's why I went but left after 10 minutes.",bartpic
30,Sunset Strip at Sunset,"I live a hop (not even a hop, skip and a jump off Sunset) and have been up and down this street, restaurants, shops and a few nightclubs over the last few years and have to say it is worth a gander.Walk it, stroll it or you will miss most of it. There are bakeries, shops on the backside of shops. There are lots of stars eating next to you. Heck, they shop at Whole Foods in West Hollywood everyday.I enjoy a lot of the restaurants for a quick bite and have brought guests to the Comedy Clubs and even a few nightclubs. I just really enjoy walking the strip at Sunset.",Holly K
40,Interesting drive,"I drove from the Getty Centre to Hollywood along Sunset Blvd. It was an interesting drive, but I would have liked to stop more often than I could. There was limited parking so I could only stop where there was off street parking. Next time, I will park and walk some more to be able to see everything properly.",vickikersey
40,"It was so, so","We rode down Sunset Strip a couple of times. We saw the Viper Room, Rainbow room, and whiskey GoGo bar. I guess you need to go at night when they are open.",StoreOwnerTeacher

50,Loved the nightlife and vibe of the strip.,"We loved staying just off the sunset strip @ the sunset marquis. We were a short walk to coffee/breakfast, dining at night, cocktails, shopping, etc",JMR1965
30,"No people, only cars","In summer time, this place is feels deserted. Due to the heat and the great distances, people just take their cars to the places they wanna go, so no people walking in the streets (apart from to and from the parking lots). Also: huge distances between places. Not really an opportunity to be spontaneous. My tip is to do as the locals: know where you wanna go and take the car there.",Edward S
30,Nice neighborhood,Nice lively street with a multitude of shops and restaurants. One could walk it but it can be done by car as well. Huge colorful billboards are the signature of this street.,Tanmouss
30,It's ok...,"Sunset Strip doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is. Some good bars and restaurants, a few places we recognised.",Fiona2804
40,A walk to see icons of pop/modern culture in person.,"A short walk down Sunset is definately worth it simply to see the sights, the clubs, locations (Whiskey a go go, Viper Room, Tower Records, etc.) that are so embedded in our modern pop / LA based culture.",KansaTraveller

30,Still Under Renovation,"Apparently, they got some new apartment buildings being built there. But be careful especially when walking the streets at night. Traffic loosens and speedsters erupt from the bowels of Beverly Hills. Also, Doheny is a strange road; watch your step. If you want to be diverted for fun for FREE, go to the nearby dog park across from the Barrel Bar and not a long shot from the House of Blues that I never found out why it's closed. Also, if you need somewhere inexpensive to park, go all the way up the hill. You can find good parking if you look hard enough. (Also a bird's missing from there. You'll see flyers.)",Danny Archila
20,"The Old, Tired, Unimaginative, Dull, Strip",The quote un quote music scene is dead here. Pay to Play hopefuls still think they will shoot the moon. The Highway of Dreams became the Parking Lot of Nightmares. Don't buy into anything around here its a bad scene.,Larry F
50,See and be seen on the Sunset Strop,"Never a dull moment on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood.

40,Worth a drive to take in this famous palm tree lined street,"While driving around Los Angeles, we made sure to drive down the Sunset Strip so we could see all of the different places on the Strip and also admire the really tall palm trees that line Sunset Blvd. It was certainly worth the drive to take in the sights and grab a picture or two of those famous palm trees!",ssy24

40,Made it to the Strip,"Our stay in Hollywood allowed us to venture out to explore the landmarks. Sunset Strip is not too far West of Hollywood and has so many thing to see and do. From the many clubs, to restaurants and shops I think if possible you should take the venture both in daylight and at night. See some of the same clubs where many of our entertainers first started, from comedy to performing (singing). I was a little surprised of its unassuming look however.

Many eateries with celebs trying to hide their identity and many historical places to stop in for a drink or and appetizer.Places like the Rainbow, WhiskyaGoGo, and Pinks make things worth while.While strolling the sidewalk of the boulevard you still see people that have the lifestyle we envied in the past.

From the variety of clubs wiith history that goes beyond any history book - you had to be there, to the moments you create for yourself. Bring a camera and point the camera to others, not self! Carefully though as some vehemently do not want their picture taken and they are not necessarily stars! Yes, go to the famous clubs, but also, the tiny shop and alternative areas. Be careful, especially at night. I used to play guitar in a studio off Sunset Blvd. and it was a fine time. So much to see and if you see Hugh Jackman (good luck) send me a photo! (-;",131catlyn

The views are iconic and you will really feel like you are in the heart of Hollywood.If you are going at night, there are certainly some fun bars and clubs to check out like Whiskey a Go Go.

50,The Strip is quintessentially LA,"I love Sunset Strip. There's all the history of the 70s music scene when LA was arguably the music capital of the world; the venues, the drinking joints, the amazing houses perched in the hills above silently observing all that happens on the Strip below. I once walked straight past Ozzy Osbourne at 6am after waking up early with jet lag and spotted Gewn Stefani driving down the road in her convertible. The views of downtown LA are stunning and the city fans out below so you feel like you're walking on a ridge between the city and the hills. It's been gentrified over the years but at least that means there are great sushi restaurants alongside the dingy clubs and bars that make Sunset what it is. The real stars of the show, although they're often overlooked, are the giant billboards that soar over the strip. You won't see anything else like it. If I only had time to visit one place in LA this would be it. Way better than Hollywood, which is like London's Leicester Square on steroids.",james r

Famous rock & roll clubs like The Whiskey a Go Go and Gazzarri's, which featured scantily clad dancers in hanging cages, launched the careers of many including The Doors, Van Halen, Motley Crue, & Guns & Roses. The Strip crosses the top of La Cienega's Restaurant Row making it a perfect location for after-dinner nightlife at its many clubs like House of Blues, Laugh Factory, and The Roxy.

30,Sunset Stripped,"We've all been raised on a diet of Hollywood entertainment and stars, and Sunset Strip is embedded in our minds as the place the stars congregate for entertainment. Hey, you have to go there if you go to Hollywood, thats it!The Strip, especially at night is certyainly alive with the various clubs and bars that still hold that 1960s live entertainment and nightclub frenzy we go there to see, It's there but a little worn out and a bit grubby, but it's worth a visit .To fly opast in a bus tour in the daytime is a waste. It's a drab street with only the Iconic place names to catch your eye. Go there on foot at night and walk amongst the crowd, feel the neon lights and experience the most limos and exotic cars you'll ever see in a one mile street, this is what you came to see,There's a few good live shows, meals and lots of night clubs that you'll ceryainly see some of the glitteratzzi of Hollywood entering or later stumbling out of.It's a street of pure indulgence after hours.

The sides od buildings have become giant billboards advertising the usual with a heavy empahsis on the entertainment industry. Lookey loos on the weekend. Venture off strip a little. I personally love the Sunset Marquis Hotel. Nice restaurant and spa with a rock and roll heritage many of the others don't have. There's also Book Soup - an AWESOME book store. I suppose this is sort of the Times Square of LA. But made for cars and valet and in the end, it's way cooler than the Disneyfied Times Square. Despite the weekend lookey loos.",roadwarriorla
50,"fun, exciting, very touristy, and chock full of celeb citiings","I always enjoy walking the strip and eating, shopping and being a lookie-loo. When the weather is nice it is great to do this after rush hour but before the car ""cruising"" starts.",Greg W
50,must take it in,"has to be done, such an iconic place & the atmosphere is great. Busy & always on the move but so many iconic & famous places to visit along the way, why would you not",lasqueezee
50,Fabulous,"Walking along the sunset strip in the evening was an amazing experience: the bright lights, the restaurants, the cool breeze etc. like a dream come true.",skyeky
50,Worth a visit!,"I've been many times on Sunset Boulevard, it is worth a visit if you want to taste the strip ;) What are you waiting for? Let's go",MarcoP1973
50,Sunset Strip - WOW,Sunset strip is a place that you need to experience yourself. We had a great time hanging down here.Must see !!,Belinda B
50,Lots to do,Take an evening to wonder down and see the sights and eat the foodOur hotel was here and it's a great position,Harri R
40,Nice for an evening stroll,"full of top class restaurants and shops, we enjoyed strolling around after dinner. fascinating to watch the endless amount of sport and classic cars go by!",gary r
30,must see?,"If you are visiting California for the first time, I would hate that this place be the one that defines us... there are much better places to site see and visit, but I guess it is nostalgic/history/blah blah. If it is on your bucket list-go for it. I recommend going to some of our amazing museums, beaches, hiking trails, etc.",JackJack6
50,Must visit,"This place was amazing and as a rock fan you can't help but appericiate this place, it still has the vibe of proper music area, packed with amazing bars, you can also get great photos up here of LA",JerseyBenp
30,A little overrated,I guess it was much better back in it's hay days or maybe it still is if you are on drugs but the whole concept of the sunset strip was lost on me a little. I understand the historical significance of it in the music world but put some plaques up and lets move on. The buildings are all old and in disrepair. They none tell you the significance of their being there in the first place. So why bother? If something deserves to be preserved then preserve it correctly!!!!,TheArdsofSC
20,Blackpool in LA. Overrated.,"Don't waste your time visiting here or if you feel you must, drive and don't walk as we did, it's a waste of a good half a day, there's nothing to see just shops and restaurants.If you are limited with time durning your vacation, choose to do something else over this as you'll honestly not miss anything!",lee t
50,Can't miss if you are visiting LA,"One of the most famous LA landmarks! Everyone has to drive through the Sunset Strip, it's one of the most famous parts of LA, fun to drive through and see the sites and watch people specially at night time :)",Juliana_Lim
30,Do it ...once ...then move on,The Sunset strip .Heard it mentioned often in song and literature .Had to visit just to say I was there .Not much more to add .Home less population gravitate to area to hit up the tourists for cash .Parking lots are a cash grab .Celebs do not frequent area .Not much to add beyond ..do it to say you did,tomchuck19
30,Drive it once !,It's interesting to drive it once but once will be enough. You can't see many houses unless they are so large that they tower above the security gates. Outside Bill Cosby's house you are greeted with a promise of a ten thousand dollar fine for trespassing. That's Hollyweird for you !,Travel Man
20,Once is enough,Stayed here with my teen-age son for a different experience over Beverly Hills. Our impression was seedy; like Vegas without the big casinos. If you are looking for a party/pick up scene then you will probably love it. But we won't be back...when in LA next time we will be back at the Wilshire.,JmorganTexas
40,"very good, and...","very noisy, dirty, crowded, popular, cool, chic, fun, impressive, scary, over rated, under rated, gotta love it, boulevard of broken dreams - indeed. LIke Huey Louis said - Somethin' everyone should see...",topjoe
40,OK,"If you are visiting Los Angeles, go for a ride down Sunset all the way to the ocean.This way you will see the many personalities of Sunset Boulevard. If you know where you are going, usually the shops along Sunset are very good. Langer's Luggage & Handbag Hospital @ 7561 W Sunset Boulevard is a fantastic secret find. If you need a last minute piece of luggage, this is the place to go for incredible deals on state of the art luggage.",mermaidsylvia
50,"Music, drinks, and party fun times!",The sunset strip seemed like the place to be for any kind of night life around Beverley Hills. You can basically pick any spot to start and hop down the strip having a great time.,Samuel O
20,"Over crowded, over grown and seedy","If you are a teener, a foreign tourist or from the Midwest, I guess a visit here is okay but be prepared to be jostled, pan-handled and asked to join a health club. The stars are interesting to explore and to find your favorite artiists. Typical chain restaurants.",Blake48
50,Love the vibe!,"Always great hitting the Sunset Strip, and love the vibe! Although LA is full of hustle & bustle and big dreams, people are always cordial and chilled out no matter what. In LA, you can be yourself and enjoy yourself. Aside from the legendary sites and possibilities of ""spotting a star,"" there's plenty of places to stop in and eat at. My favorite is Cabo Cantina, especially during Happy Hour. As crammed as that place gets, I've yet to have a bad time. If you're still there on the Strip into the night, ""The House of Blues"" is a great spot to post up in. Overall, the Sunset Strip has more than enough to offer singles and couples alike. Parking can be a pain, but it's all well worth it- and always will be on the historical Sunset Strip.",FreddyRob
40,Intresting must see Los Angeles Site!,Action packed weekend spot for driving shopping eating or just hanging out. Many stores restraints and hotels make this the place to be.Rooftop dinning with a view of the city and ocean.,ladady
50,Been many a times.,"If you know what to expect Sunset is a lot of fun. But like any city, on a weekend, be ready for crowds, busy parking and possible waits. There are a ton of restaurants, bars and cool shops. I love Saddle Ranch and House of Blues. Overall, great place to get a bite, create some excitement or just have fun people watching.",Erik4Travel
30,Not impressed.,"If you like long lines, no parking and lots of ""posers"" you'll love the strip. Oh, and did I mention ridiculous cover fees? It's not like you're going to see celebrities . . . unless you like the Lindsay Lohan type.",Nicole F
50,night life,"And also interesting during the day. Interesting shops and restaurants, live music venues and great people watching",Bill M
50,A great taste of what's hoppin in Hollywood,"The truth is, if you are not interested in going clubbing or bar hopping, there's barely a day's worth of interesting things to see in Hollywood, and most of them are on the Sunset strip. There's a few blocks of great shopping on Melrose, and some cool stuff around the Hollywood and Highland area. If you are lucky enough to be invited to the Magic Castle, that is amazing. If you do cruise down Sunset, be sure to check out Book Soup, which is one of the city's best bookstores.",LDavis1968
50,STRIPPED DOWN,"Sunset Blvd is all it's cracked up to be. Lots of traffic, star spotting and flashing lights! It's so L.A.",Lisaizhappy
30,Nothing special,"Can't see what the fuss is about , it's dirty and full of junky eating places. We only saw it by day so I can't comment on the night feel",angieMelbourne
50,Fun Vibe,"Excellent vibe -- eclectic mix of restaurants, bars, shops. Can go dancing, have a nice quiet evening, enjoy cocktails in a fun bar... just whatever you feel like! Great for people-watching as well!!!",Vicki D
30,For Nostalgia Only,"Of all of the supposed great places for a tourist to visit, this one hits the VERY bottom of the list, just above Rodeo Dr. It's a haul from anywhere on the pulse of the city, and ever since the club scene proliferated away from this concentrated area of 60's and 70's rock history, the Sunset Strip has been in decay of poularity and importance. But hey, there's still a Saddleranch, a Cabo Cantina, and the Hustler store, so if you've got a few extra hours feel free to brave the bumper-to-bumper to go see....nothing particularly special, unless you're into rock history. Then go see the Key Club and the Whiskey for sure.",cbucka
30,Cool,"Definitely a LA experience. The family enjoyed the walk, the locals, and even the buskers and beggars. Thats right I was a little shocked at the number of homeless and beggars.",David M
50,sunset in LA,this place very good scenery while sunset so dont missed it.. you can see hows pretty LA,amazinggirls
50,R&R Heaven,"On the Sunset Strip, shop a little, eat a little, people watch, catch a show, eat a little, party",Lailo1 AllthingsLaila
30,Like to drive the strip...,"see all the architecture and unusual places in the area. If you do your research ahead of time, you will get alot more out of the visit. Best advised to not keep driving up and down the strip many times, the police frown on that.",B J
30,Tourist Trap Fun ever for a local,"Fun to drive through or stop by for people watching especially weekends. As a local, not the place to hang out.",2remem
50,Exciting Street!,An exciting street! There are lots of upscale hotels and restaurants along this West Hollywood street. Try 24/7 at the Standard Hotel for a late night snack and cocktail or the House of Blues for a southern-style Sunday brunch with live gospel music.,VanessaCalifornia
30,not what it once was,"seedy, old, and in great need of a facelift. I do not go here very much.",mflickermd
30,Traffic nightmare,"Sunset strip is tourist heaven which makes for traffic hell. I don't care what time of day, always traffic. There are some plaves on strip worth a visit so if going, plan ahead so you can hit everything in one day amd hopefully not have to spend more time in traffic",nolaqueen
10,The Hollywood strip experiance,"What a disappointment , words to discribe -dirty , cheap , trashy, street hustlers, excess fast food ,tacky shops, rip off merchants, noise , air and light pollution, stay away and visit some nice parts of California.",Rosiehill
