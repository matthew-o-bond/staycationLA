50,Cool L.A. History,"I’ve lived in L.A. almost my whole life and never knew this house was here until reading about it in The Library Book by Susan Orlean last year!We visited on a Saturday. There is no parking lot but plenty of street parking. It’s a self-guided tour of the first floor only. When we were there there were about four other people in the house and a couple wandering the garden. We were there for about an hour. If you skim through everything you can probably go through in twenty to thirty minutes tops. If you take your time reading and looking through the displays as well as speaking with the docents (which I recommend because they are very knowledgeable and friendly) it could take an hour or more. I definitely recommend visiting and pairing it with a visit to Heritage Square Museum which about half a mile away, and is exactly what we did. Great way to spend a Saturday or Sunday!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bookish_B
40,Los Angeles History worth checking out!,"Now operated by the Los Angeles City Parks, this historic home is worth checking out. I can’t believe I’d never visited before today since I’ve lived in LA for so many years. Charles Lummis built this with his own hands over 13 years using many locally found stones etc. Evidently he was an avid photographer and he printed many photos on glass. In the living room are original windows where these “prints” are the panes. The grounds could use some TLC. The rangers on site have a lot of knowledge and they’re very happy to share. All you need to do is ask. Open on Saturday and Sundays and free of charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
50,An insight into the life of an amazing man!,"Before this visit, Charles Lummis was a minor figure in Los Angeles history, not worthy of further exploration. This visit certainly motivated and change in my thinking. This guy was a mover and a shaker in the cultural history of our region, a fascinating figure in so many ways. His life history would equal most of the biographies of five of our local luminaries. Just the recounting of the luminaries of his time that visited him in his personally constructed home is enough to awe you. The home itself, built of rocks from around the area, is breathtaking. His authorship of books, his record of public service, and his devotion to the locale in which he lived, are monumental. Go to his home and find the history of a man devoted to public service and the greater glory of humanity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaldYokum
40,Work of Charles Lummis is Spectacular,Charles Lummis walked across the country and gained a following before becoming the editor of the Los Angeles Times. He hand built his house from 1897- the 1910s. It is spectacular and is mostly original. The grounds need some TLC weeding but you can imagine what it once must have been. Open for free through the City Parks Dept - should charge for the tour to help offset some expenses. The docent Christian was very knowledgeable and made the experience with his vast knowledge of the man and the property.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10janeto
50,An amazing example of a wonderful man,We came upon the house by chance on our way to the Heritage Square Museum and were so please we did. Its amazing to walk around the house and feel the atmosphere. Very helpful guides too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caroline-Bennett
40,Worth a quick stop:) Check hours!,"This is a hidden gem in LA. We have been driving portions of Route 66 from San Bernardino to Santa Monica. This isn't technically a Route 66 icon (it actually pre-dates the road), but is a fun, quick stop along the way. Small gardens to walk through, and the bottom floor of the house are free to check out. A knowledgable docent is there to give background info. They are still in the process of changing over management from the Historical Society to the City, so phone numbers and web information is a bit confusing. It is open Saturdays & Sundays from 10AM-3PM, but some sites state a noon-4PM time in error.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SB1114
50,"What a house, what a story!","Old man Lummis was a truly pioneer, what with this beautiful house that he designed and built himself, the amazing gardens and grounds.Clever chap, one wing for the Doctor Wife, and one for the Mistress.Ah, Cali, so full of stories, and most of them true.Come check this place out, I came here as a kid and 55 years later it still knocked my socks off, and I'll bet CF Lummis would be delighted by that.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/335williamm
50,The house + the story make and amazing trip,"When my daughters birthday surprised me with a visit to Lummis House, they both said, ""well, we don't know what it will be like, but the gardens are supposed to be interesting and the man built the house himself.""While strolling through this amazing house, my daughter mentioned that we could have a ""tour"" if we wanted. I was dubious, there didn't seem that much more to see, but we were all thrilled that we did. The story of how Charles Lummis walked to Los Angeles from Cincinnati in 143 days in 1885 for his new job at The Los Angeles Times, interested me so much that I went to the library and got out a couple Lummis' books.Finding out that Charles not only built the combination Craftsman/Adobe house himself, but that he built one wing of it to house his mistress while his physician wife lived in the other part...well, for heaven's sake, the story would make a great movie.I'm not a historic house person, but found every part of the house and its nooks and crannies to be fascinating. You can even see one of Birch Bark Books that John carved out and wrote upon. What a unique experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73KC
50,Hidden gem of cultural history,"I had heard a few things about Charles Fletcher Lummis but did not know much about him. During a visit to LA I decided to stop by his museum home, El Alisal since it was on the way to the house of some friends. I could have stayed all day. Another visitor and myself were treated to a personal tour by one of the curators, Mr vanZandweghe, for over an hour who was very knowledgable of the details of the home, of Mr Lummis' life and influence on the arts of the early 20th century in LA and of the perspective of the history of the US at the time. Mr Lummis walked across much of the US to California in the 1880s, became a champion of native American rights, popularized Spanish culture in California and was influential in the literary and artistic world of the time. Much of his collection of art and artifacts made up the nearby Southwest Museum, which, sadly, seems now to be closed. El Alisal is a lovely, artistically created mission-architecture house he designed and built much of, himself, and is almost stereotypical ""southwestern"" until one learns that Mr Lummis pretty much came up with the concept of the ""southwest"" that we take for granted, the mission style furniture and rustic architecture, and the pastel paintings of desert scenes we all are familiar with were invented by a painter in his artistic and literary circle. Much of the neighborhood in the early part of the 20th century was an artist and writer colony of the ""arroyo culture.""The house itself was very beautiful, with hand-carved art, stonework and woodwork and historical artifacts.I could have stayed much longer and learned more fascinating history but I had to be somewhere else. I left El Alisal with a broad perspective and much new knowledge of the creative and cultural history of Los Angeles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and its effect on current art. Thank you, Mr. Ariel vanZandweghe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wings-it
40,a worthwhile free attraction,"Charles Lummis was sort of a John Muir of the Southwest. Hired by the Los Angeles Times over 100 years ago, he walked from Ohio to Los Angeles, reporting along the way. A friend of Theodore Roosevelt, he built this house out of local stones with walls so thick it has withstood numerous earthquakes in the last 100 years. Open on weekends at noon; combine your visit with the nearby Southwest Museum founded by Lummis, and Heritage Square (unrelated to Lummis) where historic houses from the area have been moved and are slowly being restored. .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fromdelmar
