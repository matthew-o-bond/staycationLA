50,Great spot,"Checked it out for future camping. The rangers were friendly and let us check out the park.Available for dry, and hookup camping. Right near the beach, and lots of shade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6halleh
50,Great Beach with many coves and lookouts,Leo Carrillo is a great public beach in Malibu. Generally less crowded than the wide sands of Zuma with many cliff top rocky look outs. I enjoy the variety there is a sizeable beach and then a series of coves in between rocky coastline. At the right time you can also scramble out to many tide pools- just be careful to watch the waves and tides. Many look out points along a trail on the cliffs and a few coves. There is a cave accessible during low tide as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JKPImageFusion
50,Best Dog Beach in Malibu and LA areas!,"Grab your dog! Grab your friend's dog! We love this beach for its dog friendly rules and people. It's a rare find to get your pooch on the beach, but this is the place to go. You can get your toes in the sand and your dog's toes too. You can't beat it for its absolute beauty too. It can be windy so be prepared, but you can walk, sit, splash and generally soak up the sun and make it a great day for your pet too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuSteele
40,BEWARE OF CLOROX BLEACH,"For whatever reason, people with RV's keep putting Clorox/Ajax/Bleach around their tires. I hear it's to stop ants from getting into their RV. ants. In nature.Then they don't clean it up. They leave it in the parking pad.So then we show up with our kids and we're getting clorox EVERYWHERE. Kids might as well be licking it.Inconsiderate a-holes these RV people are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bitva77
30,Nice for a Quick Dip,"We drove down Route 23 from Thousand Oaks and arrived at Leo Carrillo at around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. Despite the lack of parking on Pacific Coast Highway, we were pleasantly surprised when the camping parking lot folks told us there was parking directly near the beach. We paid $3 and spent the next hour or so running in and out of the water with the other beach goers. There wasn't anything particularly special about Leo Carrillo that I noticed. There was clearly lots of damage due to the fire and there were tons of dogs everywhere you looked, but everyone was in good spirits and this was the Pacific ocean after all. There are certainly more ritzy beaches down the road, but for a quick dip with easy parking, Leo Carrillo fits the bill nicely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sloomis31
40,Happy Canyon and Surfer Vibe,"My wife and I camped here in a 27 ft class A motorhome. We had electric and water hookups, no sewer. Had site 133, but trees to low to get in, so luckily we could move to 137, right across from a bathroom. Bathrooms were clean, showers available. Cool little camp store in the middle of this campground that weaves up a canyon from the ocean. No sites on the beach and the only cell phone coverage is within 200 feet of the entrace closest to the beach (both AT&T and Verizon had no coverage in most of the park). No cable and no stations can be picked up in the canyon. But this place has a very happy family vibe, the beach is accessed by going under a bridge outside the campground to a rocky beach with cools rocks in the water where great surf breaks abound and many surfers got a great ride. Kids played in the water, but it was rocky, not sandy. I'd try to get a site closest to the entrance next time, but we actually enjoyed the cutoff of the internet for a day. Finally, there is no sunset at the beach, this beach points south.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lost_bobcat
50,Dogs loved the surf...go to the staircase beach section where dogs are allowed,"We took our dogs...must wear good sneakers to get down the winding, narrow, rocky ‘staircase’ to the beach. Once on the beach you navigate a lot of large rocks but the sand itself is fine. Dogs are in heaven, running in and out of the surf. Also many surfers at the beach - fun to watch them at their craft. Parking is tight but we have been twice and if you go early enough (arrive by 10), you have parking. Make sure you google before you go so you make sure to take the correct turn-off. Fun! Fun! Fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krdee1993

There are several tide pools that you will see little fish, sea anemone and we even saw a small octopus. It's an enjoyable beach destination. It does get crowded on the weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamarahammer
40,Camping at Leo Carillo,"Spent the night at Leo Carillo in early May and was amazed by how close it was to the water. Facilities were clean and the gate attendant was super helpful. After surfing she even let us come back and take a shower before hitting the road again.Only complaint was they closed the gate a little early (I believe around 10pm). We got stuck in traffic in LA and pulled in just before the gates closed. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and a beautiful park, enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theagapeco
50,Perfect View,"I came here with my boyfriend recently and it was a wonderful morning activity.

40,Four family camping trip with children 10 & under,"As someone who is newer to camping, this was a nice way to ease into it. Bathrooms & showers are nearby and not disgusting, cars are parked at the campground so no lugging gear a long way, and kids can ride scooters relatively safely and independently. The small store at the front of the property has essentials for sale: beer, wipes, toys, and hot coffee, etc etc. The weekend we went camping, there was a large group of scouts so it was a bit loud but everything was quiet by 10:30pm. Our kids didn’t have any trouble falling asleep even with the distant noise.From the campground, you can safely walk/scooter to the beach by going under the freeway. We did bring a lock for the scooters just in case. The beach was packed because it was a warm sunny weekend- even in October. But, we found a little cove with tide pool just over the hill from the main beach and for about an hour had it all to ourselves.Reservations are hard to come by and the policy recently changed from one time per month to more frequently, maybe weekly? You have to find out when reservations are released, set an alarm and hit refresh until you grab something.If you surf, bring surfboards. The surfing was great and tons of people were out.Tide pools were amazing. The kids found at least 4 creatures including a baby starfish and hermit crab. Remember not to disturb the wildlife although it’s sooooo tempting to want to bring them home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jent202

Dogs were allowed on the beach for extra fun. Definitely recommend this beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pukster27
50,Several Sections of Beach to Choose From,"I lobe the parking availability there and the access to the beach is easy. The sand is nice and the tide pools are fun to look at.

40,"Big Shady Campsites, Walk to the Beach","We loved this family campground. Most sites are big, flat, and shaded by huge sycamore trees, and all are a quick walk to the beach through a tunnel under PCH. Bathrooms cleaned every morning and showers are hot. Many (but not all) sites have electrical hookups for RVs, but plenty of tent campers were here too. Great for small kids to ride bikes and explore tidepools. Bigger kids would enjoy the steep hike to Nicholas Flat. Camp store had all the basics, including s'mores supplies. Our one complaint was that the our campsite and several common areas had litter. Neither the prior campers nor the rangers nor the camp hosts appeared to clean the sites when they turned over. Avoid the sites on the far righthand side of the campground - many are sloped and not shaded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmieeandJohn

I have found the parking on the street to be easy, but if you don't mind paying, there is an entrance on the opposite side of the highway 1 where you can pay for parking. Not to pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Secondavenue
40,Came for the tide pools,"I'm always looking for good tide pools in Southern California and Leo Carrillo was ranked among the best, so we went for a visit. Its a nice, rocky and sandy beach with some areas among the rocky flats and the cliffs to explore, although the sea life was somewhat scant. There were anemones, mussels, barnacles and hermit crabs - but not much else of the sea life that I seem to remember from my childhood (no sand crabs or sea stars or urchins). There was also some interesting bird life, like California Brown Pelicans, but no mammals. It left me wondering if there is less and less sea life on the California coast, but we enjoyed what we found. Definitely worth exploration with kids and young adults. Parking was easy and it was only a very short walk from the parking lot to the beach. We were there on a winter day with few other visitors and the small visitors' center was closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danieloM519JL

We were surprised by the dog beach and enjoyed that with our pup. We saw a couple rattlesnakes sunning themselves on rocks so that was cool too. You are close to restaurants if you want to venture out beyond the campground.The sad part about this place is the amount of trash. We have camped at many campgrounds in the CA State Park system and this one had the most trash I had ever seen….trash on the sites and on the beach.

We recognized this beach in music videos we’ve seen as well. We ended up taking a bunch of photos and videos here. There is plenty to explore for either couples or families. The parking worked out on the side of the PCH, even on a Summer weekend around sunset. Our experience here was a less busy beach, so be sure to put this on the top of your to do list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28mitchm

50,Very nice experience,"It was a bit busier than we'd hoped, but was still a wonderful place to take the pups. While it's only pet-friendly for a certain section of the beach (above lifeguard station 3), there was still plenty of space for play. The rocks & tide pools made for some variety & offered an altogether different playspace for the dogs. We didn't attempt any of the trails. There are portapotties and simple showers for washing off the sand, but no concession stands or vending machines. In other words, bring drinks & snacks. If you think you'll be 3 hours or less, pay the $3/hour parking rate; otherwise, the parking is $12/day. Also, go at low tide if you can; we were not able to be there at low tide, so we missed the caves & some tide pools.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kates9999

The cost for parking is $12.00. There are bathrooms by the camp ground and bathrooms by the beach area. The beach area is average, a lot of rocks with a tide pool that have little crabs with their shells all around the tide pool which is great for both little kids and adults to watch them move about. There is a small area surrounded by huge rocks by the lifeguard building that if you get there early enough you can have the space all to yourself. I got there around 9:30am and I had it all to my self for a couple of hours until other people started to cram into the area and some kids do not respect other people's space. The water was a little rough but still worth stepping into and several surfers took advantage of the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lcjt01

We consulted the web for tide charts and went close to low tide hoping to see starfish. We didn't see any but did see assorted other little sea creatures and some big ones - a sea lion sunning itself on the rocks and seals playing in and out of the water on another outcropping. The caves were also cool - accessible at low tide and are great places to take pictures with the sea in the background. They are located near lifeguard tower #3. Many people parked along the shoulder of the PCH but we paid the $12 and parked in the state parking lot. There was a sufring competiton happening that morning at the beach so we enjoyed watching that to for an hour, Great place to take the kids for an hour or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jwkruz
50,BEST Campsite in the Los Angeles Area!,"For 13 years my family & friends have camped at Leo Carrillo State Park, it is by Far the very best campsite on PCH! The campsite is large and spacious and each campsite feels comfortable enough that even with neighboring campers you don't feel like they are right on top of you or even close enough to listen in on conversations. The bathrooms and showers are cleaned on a daily basis and restocked. Also faucets are easily found nearby your campsite with running water. The rangers make their rounds periodically throughout the day and night and will notify campers if their music is too loud. The beach is easily accessible by foot or car and is kept clean as well. There is a small general store toward the end of the campsite with a super nice owner, employed by helpful and friendly young people. There's a little of just about everything in that cute little store, with Great music playing through the overhead speakers....it makes it fun for kids and adults to go in for ice cream bars, beer, ice,...they even have camping memorabilia to comemmorate your stay. Outside of the store are wooden benches some with umbrellas, making it comfortable to sit outside taking in the pleasant surroundings while you have a snack. As a plus plus, there's an outdoor Amphitheatre further past the store that offers special events, sometimes even live music! Unfortunately this year was completely booked and we took a campsite up the coast a bit that was disastrous! I am still dealing with bug bites since checking out of Sycamore Canyon campsite on August 10th---it is now 12 days and I'm still scratching and now swelling has come back!!! I'm going to see my doctor this afternoon. I HIGHLY recommend Leo Carrillo State Park and Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolyndolin
50,Dog Friendly Beach in Malibu!,"Beautiful sandy beaches. Water is light blue. There is plenty of space for everyone (including your dogs). The whole family plays on the sand? Soccer, football, catch, water guns, frisbee, sand castles.The waves make it difficult to jump right in, and the stones near the shore don't help the process but the water is pristine and inviting. People are good about cleaning up after themselves, so the beach and sand are quite clean.There are porter potties if you need to relieve yourself. Barbecue set ups, and plenty of parking on the street and in the lots. Steps from Highway 1 come right down to the water. There is a bit of hiking if you want it, and great for surfing.Going to the beach with the entire family (means bringing the pups), so for that reason alone this beach gets an extra star. Make sure you love dogs if you come here, and don't worry about poops on the beach-- people are conscious and pick up after their little four-legged companions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabrielamF9842LM

50,Dog friendly beach plus spotted us some dolphin and seal,"The only dog friendly beach in Malibu that I know of. Our 5 month old Shiba loved it!Trail and beach has separate parking areas as well, we should've asked about it at the ticket station because we had to haul our stuff to and back from station 1 (were dogs aren't allowed) not knowing that station 3 was completely blocked by a mountain of rocks and there was beach front parking if you just follow the road, go under the bridge, then tadaaaa! (You'll get it once your there)Went here last Memorial Day weekend arrived around 830 am in the morning and it was just pristine! We were one of the first families to set our tent at the beach and lay our picnic blanket and it was as if we had the whole beach to ourselves! We had our pup go ""off leash"" for about half an hour and he just went crazy running around in the sand in pure ecstasy! (Dogs aren't supposed to be off there leashes here, it was our pup's first time to go to the beach so we gave him a bit to enjoy himself before having the lifeguard on duty ask as to put it back on (worth it tho))At around 1-2pm, we spotted groups of dolphins swimming and some seals sun bathing on the rocks it was a highlight of our day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casmansilla
50,Great views and Trails with several levels of Skill.,"I hiked a few miles of this great park made possible by the funds from Leo Carrillo when he was alive. Fo those not familiar with him he was the Cisco Kid side kick ""Pancho"". His active life style and love of the wild counrty helped develop places that people can still today go and have fun. This State Park offers camping, access across the street to Malibu beaches and some great hiking trails. The heavy rain falls and ggood weather has caused some of the trails to become overgrown faster than the Parks staff can maintain it.BUT the views and efforts put forth by an excellent staff will make this one of the best hiking/camping locations along the West Coast. Start at the Trail head off Pacific Coast Highway and go to then Ranger station to check in. They will offer good information, directions and up-to-date maps. I suggest starting with the ""Willow Creek Trail"" that circles through the Vista point overlooking the pacific and the Malibu surfers. Mind you there are about 70 miles of trails so take a back pack, a trail map, a cell phone, at least 30-40 ounces of water for each person, binoculars and a snack bar. Sun screen and a hat is advisable. Wear ankle high professional hiking boots too, to be safe.Try it and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrodenhausen

40,Great Family Camping Spot Close to LA,"My family and I spent a night camping at Leo Carrillo State Park. The campsite we had was more than large enough to handle our 8 person tent. Each campsite has a fire ring and picnic table. This made it easy for us to roast hotdogs and cook s'mores. There are restrooms and showers throughout the campground, but you need to purchase tokens to use the showers. Beware of the ground squirrels, a couple of them jumped in the back of our van when we were setting up camp and we had to chase them out. They tore up our table cloth on the picnic bench at our campsite when there were a few crumbs left from breakfast. The beach was a short walk from the campground, the tidepools are only visible at low tide. We will return to this State Park to go camping again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Duffyruns
40,Great beach but older park,This Beach was GREAT! Campsites were all pretty private and very beautiful surroundings. The bathrooms and showers were pretty old and actually stopped working on us on the last day. NO FULL HOOKUPS! Also the spot that we originally picked would not pick our RV so we had to switch. I reserved the spot on Reserve America.com so I could not switch the spot apparently online. The girls at the gate said they would cancel my reservation for me and I had to pay every morning with them and hope that no one wanted the space. I called Reserve America and they said I will not get a refund of my money for up to 6 weeks! Kind of crazy to me but that's how it goes I guess.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamieL_11
50,Great Dog friendly beach,"My dogs and I spent a great day here. The beach is clean, Most people keep their dogs on leashes, which I guess is the rule. Parking along the hwy is pretty scary. Hard to get the dogs to the stairs to get to the beach.Overall though it is a fun way to spend the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Piperroo
50,Hiking in the flowers.,"While the trail can be challenging given how it climbs for the first 3/4 of a mile, the reward comes in the beautiful flowers in spring and the amazing views of the ocean. It is beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameskJ2680IQ
50,WOW!,"This beach was totally ungroomed and we liked it that way. We arrived later in the day and only paid $3 to park until sunset. A Great deal! We had waited until low tide to do some beach combing but did not find much. We greatly enjoy running about and adventuring through rocks and caves to new stretches of beaches to explore. It was a bit of a drive to get so far north, but was a fun once in a life time type of adventure for us. There was a modest campground and that could be a fun option down line. Hurray for the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/825dianep
40,Sea Shells,Takes about 10 minutes to get down to the beach and 12 inch to get back up to the road very short hiking for small children perfect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wyobio
50,Dog Beach,"Hard to find a dog beach in LA county, but one area of this beach is just perfect. Park on the ocean side of the road (might have to make a U turn on the highway) walk down the stairs and there you are. The parking lot is closed, the buildings, as they are, have deteriorated, but the dog doesn't care. Bring your own water to drink, and a camera. I have been here several times, worth the bottleneck on PCH.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mntraveler35
50,Beach Caves and Adventure,"I love this beach. We spent the day there an while the girls laid out, the boys got to do some cool climbing and adventuring. There is a few really amazing beach caves you can crawl through, and one huge one that literally takes you through the rock face on to another part of the beach. Very fun day and a new fav Malibu beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CGualano
50,"Don't miss the tide pools, especially at low tide",The title of this review pretty much says it all. One of the best and most interesting parks along the coast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
50,Beautiful beach!,Can't beat the view! Mountains and cliffs and ocean....it's beautiful. I do suggest parking on side of road and walking down instead of the assigned state park and beach parking on the other side of the highway (unless you are camping or making a long day trip). We were just making a quick stop to get pics and they wanted us to pay $12 to park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q8647MAdawnl
40,Great to watch surfers,"This was the perfect spot for a morning run or a great quiet, secluded place to take in the sunrise. Nice for walks and an awesome spot to watch surfers, which was a nice treat for someone who's not from California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478amandas
50,Great mix of tide pools and sandy beach,Stopped here Thanksgiving Day for a picnic with the family. We timed the visit during low tide. My teen entertained himself with the tide pools while I basked in the sun with my book. There are a couple of small caves that become visible during low tide. Had a delightful day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callesol105
50,Great place to stroll on the beach and watch suffers,"I was able to park near the entrance on HWY 1, watch for cars. It was a sunny November day and there were a few surfers here, but not very big waves. Great place to stroll on the beach and it is not a very big climb back up to the highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertkM5959BT
30,Annual Family Reunion spot,"Our family gathers here annually to enjoy the Halloween weekend. Dog-friendly beach, camping areas to accommodate large groups (such as ours), recently installed electrical hook-ups on several sites, small store, coin-op showers, the usual State Park services. Some sites more ""private"" , some wide open for large tent/RV combo camping for family and friends such as ours. Lots of trees, bushes in the camping areas affords a nice ""feel"" to the camp sites. Hopefully the next upgrades will be to the bathrooms and showers. For sure they are tired and can use it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreddyBee1
50,Camping Get-a-Way,"This is a great place to camp just north of LA. It is also great for a day trip. The campgrounds are in a canyon north of the beach. It has large flat sites shaded by Sycamore trees. A mix of dry sites and sites with hook-ups. Hot pay showers. There were a mix of Tenters, Trailers and RVs. Fire pits at each site. They allow 3 cars per site, and will easily hold 2 large tents. Family friendly, dogs are welcome on a leash. There are 2 beaches with in a 5-10 minute walk. South beach, great for hanging out. North beach is a little farther and dog friendly. Much less crowded, but still cool to hang out at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddf563
40,Pocket beach,Getting to understand that each of these beaches are unique but also offer the same fantastic views and are uncrowded,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vonschmidt
40,Great dog beach...,"My dog loves the beach and so do I, but unfortunately there are not many dog friendly beaches in LA. After reading reviews I came across this beach and me and the pooch decided to check it out. The area accessible to dogs is towards the Ventura County line, so you have to travel pretty far out to access it (if your coming from Malibu). I believe it's past lifeguard station 3, keep going and eventually off the highway you'll see a little parking lot to pull into, that's the dog accessible area, no road markers so hard to explain where it is. I never park in the lot rather I park on the highway and take the trail down. The trail is steep but manageable. The beach itself kinda has two sides and very long and wide in area, plenty of room for groups or people with pets to find a spot. Note, no shade so be prepared, I bring a tent and when it's not windy it works. Most folks keep dog on leash but the ones who bend the rules seem to keep their dogs under close watch. I love this spot, very relaxing and enjoyable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristal48
50,Good,Good beach with what seemed like a million rocks. Lots of beginning surfers. Lots of wave pools with hermit crabs and such.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarrieAr
40,Camping with Family,"I have been camping here with Family and friends for years. This place is awesome with the camp sites in the canyon and the beach across PCH. There is plenty to do here for kids and adults, from bike riding, hiking, sun bathing, surfing and fishing. If you happen to run out of supplies during your stay there is a store within the camp ground that is a bit pricey but has most of the items you will need. The beach area is one of the best for photos with all the rocks and cliffs. To the right (south) of lifeguard station #2 the beach is very rocky but the surfing is good, to the left of tower 2 (west) the beach has 2 secluded areas with nice sandy beaches and a big parking lot. This year they just installed power hook ups to approx. 1/2 the camp sites. This was a great addition to the park if you have an RV. They also have a dump station and fresh water to fill up with. Would highly recommend camping here any time of the year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/352rickm
50,Peace in Solitude,"My cousin took me here last year and I thought it was a cool place and I always wanted to come back. My sisters live in LA have never been here, so yesterday I brought them here to watch the sunset. We parked on the PCH and walked down to the beach. There is much erosion as the pavement is being reclaimed by the ocean. I love how peaceful it is here without the crowds. The sun was low on the horizon as we walked on the beach with rocks jetting up and out. As the waves crashed onto the shore and the sun sank below creating an orange glow. Dusk: Peace in Solitude.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariahJ2379SF
40,Great place to launch bicycle rides from,"I only know this beach because when I was training for a triathlon, we'd meet here to ride the hills like Latigo and such. Great place to take off from and return to - plus you can do brick workouts and run afterwards on fairly flat ground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderwithsarah
30,"An Average RV Park, with so -so facilities.","We were 2 families with 2, 30ft RV's..The park is OK, but the facilities here, were average at best, Toilets were dirty and the showers very tired. The shop was good and it's close to the beach, which again is OK.. You'd probably be better off going to El Capitan or Refigio. If we pass this way again we'd probably not stop here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dizzydisney
20,"Nice beach, beware the campground.","This review is primarily for the campground, which is a slum in a pretty setting (alas, this describes most of the Southern California State Park campgrounds I've been to). Nearly every surface- bathroom mirrors, porcelain, signs, doors- that can possibly be defaced is scratched with graffiti. Campsites are grimy, filthy and overgrown with dead brush. Restrooms perennially fouled. Posted campground rules with bold irony state ""quiet hours are enforced"" yet this seems to be an inside joke. You won't see rangers patrolling here at night. I stayed at Leo Carillo last night and was up until 3am listening to 20 year old grown children drink and cavort all night. At 1am, I tried calling the district park service number posted at the front kiosk but the number was no longer in service. A second phone number retrieved via spotty cellular data connection took me to voicemail. I considered waking one of the campground hosts, but was reluctant to drag an elderly person out of bed at 1am to deal with a situation that should be dealt with by law enforcement empowered park rangers. The next morning, as I was leaving, groggy from lack of sleep, I was shocked to find a second campground host stationed just north of me, only a few sites away from the private Burning Man festival that had ruined my sleep and my short family vacation. All of this was nearly a repeat of my previous January 2014 visit to Leo Carrillo. I've decided that I'm done with camping at Leo Carrillo, for good.Having said all that, the beach is pretty cool, especially for kids. At low tide, there are tide pools and caves in the rocks to explore. There is some nice hiking higher up in the park, in wetter years the hike to Nicholas Pond is pretty cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keltytrekker
30,Average beach at bbest,OK beach but recognize it is VERY rocky and not great for swimming. Surfing is great and good spot to watch others surf. Usually very winding. Life guards available. No food. Bathroom facilities are OK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RCS362
20,Lots of hard stones on this beach,"Parts of this beach are very pretty, and often it's not very crowded but it's terrible to go into the water because there is so much rocks. We didn't love this beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henna_mikkila
50,Must see lesser known Malibu beaches (limited parking summer 2016),"Please note: their parking lot is under construction this summer. Even so, it's worth the trip. This park extends for several miles. So there is ample roadside parking. The beach at the entrance is gorgeous. Another beach called ""Heavenly"" is a trek without parking but dog-friendly and lovely. This is a fun beach to walk on the bluff above. Hiking above the beach is wonderful. I've never camped here but would love, too. I'm a local kid and we always cherished this beach growing up. It's still as wonderful now as it ever was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catv2014
50,..another road trip - another stop here.,"Again, love this Beach!!!! Unfortunately, there was construction on the road to the dog beach area, and we had to walk to that beach. There were no lifeguards there when we were there. It is a great beach, and there are plenty of rocks to climb.Be Careful during high tide though....One of the prior reviews mentioned the ""drought"" area. I don't know about that. It looks like CA has always looked. It is not a green area - the camping area is wonderful, parking is great",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KUMtngal
20,We will not return,"This was our third and most likely last time going to Leo Carrillo State Beach for camping. Although the Malibu beaches are beautiful, they are not worth the price of admission. I reserved two neighboring campsites for a nice weeklong family trip - total of five families. I understand that we were camping, but the maintenance of the bathrooms alone is enough for us to never come back – especially since we had children with us.Issue #1: I am not expecting luxury, however, the bathrooms near our campsite, always ran out of toilet paper by 5pm. We always take a roll or two of toilet paper wherever we go, but I did not realize I need a Costco size pack since we are apparently supplying our own toilet paper. During the summer time, and the busiest time, I would think a state park, that is reserved to capacity starting at $45 a night ($60 for sites with electricity), would hire more people for a second bathroom clean up. By the end of the night, enter the bathrooms at your own risk. When many go camping, they eat a little more, drink a little more, and if you are anywhere north of 30 years old, your body does not function like that of a 20 year old. One evening someone had a gastric explosion all over one of the stalls. People are disgusting and all manners and etiquette are apparently forgotten when they go camping.Issue #2: The showers consistently ate up tokens. You are paying 50 cents for 2 minutes of hot water. A 4-minute shower, should only cost $2, however, we ended up spending $4 easily because the machines would eat up our money. For a family of five, that adds up. One of the shower stalls was out of order. There were also more shower stalls then there were bathroom stalls.Issue #3: Parking is also an issue. There is a limit of how many cars can park at a reserved site, and that is three at Leo Carrillo. However, only one car is included with the campsite reservation cost. Otherwise, if you have a couple of families camping with you, then they will pay an additional $12 a night to just park there. Additionally, we had disabled day visitors, who were asked to pay the full $12 for a day visit. One would think that people with disabilities would get a break in the cost of parking for day use.Issue #4: If three cars are allowed to park at the site, then make your parking spots big enough to accommodate three cars. All the sites have enough space for two cars. You can tandem park if you have two vehicles the size of a Prius. The third paying vehicle has to park perpendicular to the other two, per park rules and regulations. The park wants people to block other vehicles in – emergency hazard anyone? On most sites, you can squeeze another car parallel to the other two on the dirt. However, the rules for the park do not allow anyone to park on the dirt, only the pavement. At one point, we were almost issued a ticket by a park ranger, while unloading our vehicle. They did not come and ask if we can move the car, they just stopped and began to write up the vehicle. Luckily we were there to stop them and let them know were unloading our vehicles. “Welcome to Leo Carrillo, folks. Enjoy your visit.” You can smell the financial desperation of the California state parks.Issue #5 - Our fire ring had holes in it. Time to update the ring.With all this being said, the California state parks are already making a killing with what they charge and they cannot afford enough people to clean the bathrooms. One of the days we were there, my sister in law happened to show up when the maintenance staff came to clean the bathroom, and she asked the young lady, why the bathrooms are not resupplied with toilet paper. The staff members response was basically, “no one wants to work in Malibu for just $10 an hour” – MESSAGE TO California State Parks – PAY ACCORDINGLY FOR THE COST OF LIVING. We had to ask the host to resupply the toilet paper.The two stars is for the beaches, hiking trails, and the time spent with our family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zizi1177
50,"Go at low tide for shells, rocks, sealife","This was the perfect spot to bring our kids, 9, 5, 3 to look at ocean life in the tide pools. For best viewing you need to check low tide and be there at that time to walk out on the rocks. Bring water shoes. If the tide is low enough, facing the ocean with your back to the beach if you explore the rocks on your right you will find a small sandy cave. The kids loved this. You have to look slow and careful in all the different pools and rocks to see the crabs, fish, and anemones. Lots of sea plants, muscles, and incredible for shell hunting. Beautiful rocks and shells were everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hnshopper
50,Summer Camping,"I rate Leo Carrillo State Park and Campground five starts because I truly love the outdoors. It has beach access and hiking trails. It also has tent only campsites as well as sites for trailers and motorhomes. It also offers restrooms and showers on site as well as a small market that has supplemental camping supplies, basic food and beverages, and cut wood if you decide to have a campfie in the evening. Great views are a plus and most people are there with their families so making new friends is easy. Make sure you make a reservation during the busy summer season and you will enjoy Leo Carrillo if you like camping and the outdoors. For the reccomended length of stay, I would atleast plan for a day visit to hike and go down to the beach, but really you could stay multiple days and have a lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwesleySHOCK
50,Another Exceptional Malibu Beach To Visit But Beware!,"This is a great beach to spend the day! Easy access, fun tide pools, a bit of surf and an outdoor shower near BUT, DO NOT leave anything in your car that is of value!! There is a big problem at a lot of the beaches and hiking trails of someone breaking into a car and stealing items. A lot of times they will smash a window.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whiteshome1
10,If Leo Carrillo were alive today he would be ashamed !,"This state park is a dump. Upon entering the weeds and over grown limbs/brush cover the directional signs etc. That is the signs that are legible and not peeled or faded. The streets are rough and cracked, they need to be resurfaced, the bathrooms have not been acid washed and power washed in years and are just disgusting. That is the ones that are not ""out of order."" I spent 3 days in this state park and the same ""out of order"" facilities never changed. Some construction work on the dried up creek looks like it's stalled not to be finished.If you have an RV or Trailer, good luck getting them into the tight sites outlined in concrete bumpers. Once you get your trailer in, park your tow vehicle next to the trailer, you bang your door trying to get in or out as the sites are so narrow. You can see many have torn up tires on the concrete bumpers which are covered in tire scuff marks.The good thing is the location to the beach and Malibu. Also the sites are spaced far apart. That is why the concrete bumper parking is so maddening. It doesn't have to be this way.A good cleaning, paint, and some landscape work would do wonders. It's a shame at $60 a night and our tax revenue the place is so run down. Leo Carrillo who it's named after would be disgusted if he were alive today to have his name on such a dumpy state park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rssingnl
50,Get there early for beach day,Awesome place to visit and see where some of the finest Hollywood movies have been filmed and catch some Malibu rays. Get there early though as will fill up fast. They do however have 20 minute parking so you can stay and get a few snaps before having to move along.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christopherv223
30,I was expecting more,"I live in Los Angeles but never made it past Zuma to go to a beach. I heard a lot of positive things about this beach in particular so we decided to try it out today. The beach is surrounded by very dry, yellow brush. It's so sad to see what has happened to the landscape of Malibu because of the drought. The beach is very rocky and hard on your feet. The sand isn't easy to walk on either. The kids were really excited to boogie board but couldn't because of the rocks. The water was fridge as well. There is a lifeguard on duty, which is a plus. They have a camp site on the other side of the beach. We saw many people who were camping there walk to he beach, cool off and go back. I wish I felt more enthusiasm for this beach, like I had found a hidden treasure, but not so. My husband thinks I was comparing it to the beaches of Kauai which we had just come back from. Maybe I was??",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hxa0063
50,Great Camping Spot with Beach Access,"This review is for both the beach and connecting campground.It is very crowded and tough to get a reservation at the campground here. I can understand why...this spot is a nice location set in a ravine with beach access. We've camped all along the California coastline and campgrounds along the beach are always busy. Most campgrounds are right off the highway, which is a huge drawback for noise. This one is set back from PCH, and you hear very little road noise...a plus! Most camp sites have trees that offer a good amount of shade and some privacy given the many people here. We are tent campers and felt like we had a decent amount of space from our neighbors and that each site was not right on top of the other considering how packed this place is. You will hear and see neighbors, but you do have a little space; more space in some sites than others as they are all a little different in layout.Camp ammenities include: token operated showers, a camp store and restrooms.Leo Carillo State Beach is truly beautiful. You access the beach by taking a short walk from camp underneath the PCH by way of a pedestrian walkway. There are natural pocket beaches and ""sea caves"" as well as tide pools. The beach is very rocky in places, so bring a pair of heavy-duty flip flops or water shoes if you plan on wading out or tide pooling.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aztravelers360
40,Leo Carrillo Camp grounds,"If I could I would have given it a 3.5 star, but went for a four vs a three. This camp site really only has one down fall. Not a huge deal because I do realize it's tent camping. The restroom could use a bit of TLC maybe twice a day. Other then that! Here's my pros! Showers do have running water you can take a free cold shower or pay $1 for a roughly 3min. warm one. Yes 3 is enough! Get all of the important parts first though. We stayed in site 64 we didn't have any problem with our location as you can see it has plenty is shade. This spot has no hookups. Other sites do. Many have been insulted this year. We will be back. Parents teens and small children enjoyed themselves!! Feel free to ask questions I'll do my best to get to them. Another plus is the access to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SSORIA2013
50,Beautiful beach with the rocks in shallow water,"We liked the beach and the rocks. Different from what we typically see at the beaches we have been to in Florida, Caribbean, Texas, and on east coast. Found hermit crabs, cute little shells, and interesting sea plants. Would be a nice place to spend the day - could bring a cabana if desired for some shade. Signs said no dogs but as usual some people ignore signs and we did see a few dogs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kloverfield
50,Great surf by the rock,"I surf here from time to time, the beach is great and I can only recommend the place. Fills up fast during summer and nice weekends",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vindensskygge
50,My number one of all the beaches I visited in Malibu,"This is such a gorgeous place! I went because of good reviews here on Tripadvisor and I'm SO glad I did! I'm here in May and there's so many private spots to enjoy the beauty here. There are a lot of inlets between the rocks which creates sort of private mini beaches. The caves and tide pools are fun to explore and the views are just stunning. Easy parking, easy beach access, lots of walking trails above the beaches. I will definitely come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/variyajewelry
50,Great beach without all the crowds,"I'm definitely not a beach person, but our family loved this beach. Kids enjoyed the caves and tide pools. Beach was clean. Went on a Saturday and it wasn't very crowded at all. Added bonus... All The Karate Kid beach scenes (1984) were filmed here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CobraKy

40,Gorgeous beach,"Went with the family on a windy, cool week-day in March. We were able to sit by the rocks, sheltered from the wind. It was perfect! Lots of surfers to watch. No crowds. Interesting rock formations and coves for climbing and exploring. Enjoyed our day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashley125
40,Beat the crowds,"This beach is a little out of the way, but that's a good thing. It is typically far less crowded than beaches closer to the city. There is ample parking, good facilities and even camping available. There are a couple good surf spots that decent surf with both summer and winter breaks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dollyamas
20,Camping at Leo,Usually a great place to camp for a couple days. Loads of construction going on there now with bulldozers pushing dirt right up to your tent door. They should offer a discount to the $45 per night fee with all the noise and dust this project produces. A good place to surf and a nice walk to the west end that's due to close for more construction in September..Come back in 2017 if you want a quiet experience here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BZ4
50,Wonderful Tidepools,"I've been coming here since the 70s, and it continues to be my favorite place to enjoy tide pools. The campground is nice - set back into the canyon away from the highway and the beach. The beach is a bit rocky - not good for surfing or swimming really, but wonderful for exploring the marine life. From seals and otters to hermit crabs, sea stars and octopuses, this is a beautiful location. Check the tide tables, and come at low tide. And don't forget to check out the ""pirate cave"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PilotNate52
40,Great beach! Camping....,The beaches here are very nice! We visited Zuma beach while camping at Leo Carrillo. All the sites are fairly similar and you can pick and choose whether you want to be near the washroom or not. This campsite was not as clean as the other Cali state parks we visited. A few of the visitors drove very fast even though kids were playing everywhere. . We drove into town and visited Ladyface brewery and it was a lovely surprise. We ended up driving and parking in Zuma beach. The kids were so excited when they saw a seal swim up to shore and chill for a bit. Overall it is a good place to camp for the location. Can't beat this price in the heart of Malibu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommy_from_YVR
40,Rocky Coastline Inusual for SoCal,"We have spent a lot of time along the rocky coastlines of the Monterey Bay/Carmel area, but such dramatic beauty is hard to find along the LA/SoCal coast, which is what makes Carrillo State Park special. If it were along the Big Sur coast, Carrillo would just be another outcropping of rock, but being this near the SoCal beaches makes this a unique location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westsidecouple
50,Very Nice State Park - Leo Carillo,We enjoyed our day at Leo Carillo State Beach. There are nice tidal pools here. Its a good place to take a walk or just look at the amazingly beautiful Pacific Ocean. In the summer its great for swimming. This time we were there in November.its also a good place for surf fishing.There is also a campground.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini

50,Best beach ever,The water is a bit chilly so you might want to bring a wetsuit. Water visibility is clear if you go snorkeling or diving. Great kid friendly beaches to walk around. Great for spearfishing or recreational diving. Just a few surf spots along the beach. Don't plan on going snorkeling or diving on a day that it is windy as the kite surfers or wind surfers might come out and run you over,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/801lucasz
40,"Unique, But Cold!","I sought out someplace like Leo Carrillo Beach for how different it is from the beaches on the east coast. The cliffs offer beautiful views and if you visit at low tide the caves are amazing! BUT be prepared. If you're used to warm beaches of the east coast in the summer, you may want to bring a sweater and maybe some light long layers to cover your legs. It was quite cold for the end of July! Maybe no more than about 70º or so. I highly recommend this beach, just make sure to bring layers and a lunch.PS: Try to find parking along the road. It's free! I found close parking, but even if I didn't it would have been worth the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peaceloveelina

40,Walk in a Sea Cave at low tide!,"Follow the creek under Pacific Coast Highway to the beach. Enjoy great tide pools at low tide - I've seen octopus, nudibranch (vibrant orange and purple), sea hare, along with the more common starfish, urchin, anemone, etc. Now follow the beach north at low tide to find the cave! If you are small enough, you can crawl through a hole at the back of the cave out to the next beach to the north!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lee-Tarbet
50,One of 2 DOG-Friendly LA Beaches!,"When my 4-legged friends needs some emancipation from her dog life, we head up the coast and get our bark on here! It's one of ONLY two dog-friendly beaches in LA County---the other being in Long Beach area. So, if you go, don't forget your Shaggy Bestie!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SleepersGourmet
50,Fun and beautiful beach at the LA/Ventura county line.,"Surfers have enjoyed this location for ever, the same for Hollywood movies. Beautiful location, at low tide enjoy the tide pools and the life in them. Bring sand/beach shoes for the rocks and hiking. My grand children enjoy the beach as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greatwine
30,Nice beach but lots of rocks,"The rocks made it hard to enjoy a walk on the beach or getting in the water. Plan a stop to relax, but not the best for family water play.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoySpohn
40,Enjoy the camping and the beach,I enjoy camping and the beach with different hiking and biking trails. The beach was nice with the surf and tide pools but sitting next an intoxicated guy makes me think it's not the most family friendly beach but still enjoy by three day stay.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kyle0690
20,Not for small group which wants some quiet and relaxing time,"The campsites are very close to each other, especially those in the middle ring. They are basically connected to each other with a large shared middle area. Lots of trees but don't seem to be well maintained so the branches are blocking some of the campsite and make it hard to set up the tent at a nice shared area.We went on a summer weekend and lots of large groups of multiple families and grown up reunions. Very noisy as the sites are so packed together. Even after 11PM, the noise are still going on, even though the rules said quiet time starts from 10PM.Not recommend for small family whose wants a quiet weekend getaway.The only good thing is it is very close to the beaches. You can walk to the beach at a trail but the closest beach is very rocky. Should drive to zuma beach or other beaches which are much nicer.Dirty bathroom and always run out of toilet paper at the evening.The shower facility is not clean nor good either. $1 for two token which supposes to last for 4 mins but it did not. Two of the tokens machines were out of services on a weekend evening so should get as many as you need when you see one that is working. The stuff does replenish the toilet paper every morning at around 8AM but it runs out fast in all restroom so bring your own.Lastly, this campground charges way higher than other CA campgrounds. With this quality, we would try other close by campground next summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Minami_SD
50,Along Pacific Coast Highway,"Nice beach off PCH.TOOK SOME GREAT PICTURES THERE. Bring your own food, have a picnic, and enjoy the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatH854
40,CA Beach for Camping,"This the LA spot for camping right on the Beach & savoring the scene. Crowded on weekends, so either avoid that time or get there early. Also is dog friendly, so pack the pooch. If you're a camper, or a family camper, this is the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Best Place Ever (except for dirty bathrooms),"Love Leo Carrillo! My family has been camping here since before I was born. It's a beautiful campground with generous sized campsites as close to the beach as you can get without camping on the beach. Enjoy hiking in the canyons, biking around the campground, and searching the tide pools for sea creatures. Never know what we will find in the tide pools. This year it was an octopus and sea hares and saw dolphins playing not too far from shore. This is not the best beach for boogie boarding but the surfers love it! This would be a five star rating except for the dirty bathrooms. They are not cleaned well every day like they used to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760alicias
50,Stopped on our way up north for the afternoon....,"Love this beach!!! They allow dogs on the right side of the beach... The rocks are great to climb in. The waves were good. Have always liked this beach, and spent a great deal of time here when I lived in CA.There is day use and also camping use. The campgrounds are full most of the summer though.The day use beach is used by tourists and locals alike. Kids enjoyed the break from driving...Highly recommend it...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KUMtngal
40,Great time but dont go on weekend if you can help it,We arrived on a Sunday about 3pm and the line to get in was VERY long. Very nice little beach with locals and tourist alike. The rocks were really fun for the kids to climb on and we over all had a good time. The bathrooms were ok but no water running to the outside sinks or shower. The tide was up so we couldnt explore the tide pools.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelagent15
40,Fun beach,"I like this beach....it has nice views. You can camp here, but we often go just for the best. Typical of Southern Californium a beaches as far as it can be crowded....is a dog friendly beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448cheriep
40,Beach and Camping in Malibu!,"Have stayed in campground several times and they are very consistent. The bathrooms are clean and the showers work! There is water about every third campsite as well as a fire-ring and wooden picnic table. Some sites have trees, but if you spend time on the beach - won't matter. Walking to the beach is not too bad - but driving is best. The rangers at the gate are a little ""off"", so use very specific language - they do not have very good customer service skills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califmac
40,2015 family camp out,The beach was cool! The camp site we had kinda sucked we spent most of our time at another camp site but we had site 007. It's right across from the showers and restrooms and people just walked threw out site all weekend long just rude people! So if your staying there stay away from 007! But other than that had a good time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zentinez
30,Dog friendly; no water to clean up,We went to this beach as it was dog friendly. It was an unsteady walk to get to the Pacific Ocean as the walk from the parking area is just sand. There wasn't a water spout to clean paws and feet. Since all I had was bottled water and wet wipes it was difficult to clean off the sand. A few rocks and no shells to pick up. The view is nice. It will not be a place we go again as it's $12 to park. It's a CA state park so you have to go on-line to get a discount pass sent to you BEFORE you go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TinaA380
40,Fun trip to Tide Pools,Make sure you visit during low tide. There were volunteers on the beach making sure everyone didn't touch the wildlife. Hard and frustrating for the kids of course.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/squatpuke
50,Great Beach,This is my favorite beach to visit. Always very clean - and there are flush toilet bathrooms. Alcoholic beverages are allowed since it adjoins a campground - also an area for pets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karen93550
50,Awesome Beach for kids and grownups as well,"Theres a parking lot next to it, the rate is somewhat expensive, but you can also park for free along PCH1 and take a small walk to the beach.The beach has 2 parts, so to speak. One part is a sandy beach, with great surf. There are some cross currents that can give you a strong pull into the sea, so be aware.Very clean and best of all, at least for people like me, you'll find almost no people.Great sand distance, in lenght and width, so you can relax on the dry part or play on the wet part, whatever you're up to.There's also a rocky side of the beach, here you'll discover lots of tide pools, where youll find all kinds of sea life. Kids and grown ups will enjoy it very much.There are also caves that are very appealing for kids to play.There are some portable bathrooms, the sand is kept clean. Beach is safe and beatiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Akenathon
40,Delightful Visit,We enjoyed a several hour visit here. Very clean and nice beach. Some wildlife and a few accessible tidal pools. Very quiet and family friendly. We made a visit here part of a drive up the coast from LA and then a drive through the mountains back to town. Delightful and recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColoradoDoc
30,Family friendly campground,"First time visitor. I stayed here over the Memorial weekend.Loved: Great location, 10 min walk to the beach & tide pools which my kids (under age 10) loved to explore. I recommend water-shoes or river sandals.There is also a hike trail right from the campground. Our campsite#81 was good in size, had a bench table & fire ring, and right next to the General Store. The store has firewood for $7, also sold coffee & hot chocolate every morning with free refills for the entire day if you kept your cup.Did not love: The campground & beach was crowded. The campground streets are narrow and can't image how trailers/campers make it in & out. The bathroom was a gamble, sometimes ok sometimes extremely dirty and out of toilet paper. The showers required tokens for hot water, but that did not guaranteed hot water. Site #81 has no shade & surrounded by squirrel dens. The squirrels were ruthless and out of control. They were everywhere! It seemed as though you could not look away for a minute without one trying to snatch your sandwich right out of your hand. On one of our walks we witnessed more than one campsite invade by them. One squirrel entered a partially opened tent and ran off with a loaf of bread. And another squirrel broke through the screen/mesh house to get through to the food supply. We used plastic storage bins to store our food and made sure not to leave anything out nor in our tent.In spite of it all it was a good family trip. The children had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/checklistMom
40,Remote family-friendly Beach,"Two lifeguard dtations (3 and 4) patrol and watch as you swim. There is plenty of free parking on PCH, but if you dont want to hike all over, $12 will get you in the lot and there is a campgrund on the east side of PCH. There are restroom faciities on the south side, out-houses on the north side near statin 4. Nice day visit. Hopefully you wont have the tar ball residue (wear sandals or sneakers till that problem clears up)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tamale624
50,Rare Combination of Beach AND Woods,"140 Camp Sites. $45 per site - extra vehicles (up to 3 per site) $12 each.Also offers ""Day Use $12 and ""Hike and Bike"" $10.Hard to go wrong in Malibu, so much natural beauty and plenty of scenic stops on the way (or on the way back). Both beach, mountain marsh and restaurants.The ability to be submersed in the woods and then walk a few hundred yards to the beach is very special!Tide pools for kids to explore, sand for lounging, good surfing, dive the kelp... there is a lot to do here.The ""General Store"" is stocked well enough, the restrooms are cleaned and replenished often and there are showers.Dont be surprised if sea birds wake you up at sunrise and/or the occasional party people keep you up at night. But the Rangers are attentive and it is an all around great choice for a diversity of adventures or relaxation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat
50,Great for peaceful walks and playful dogs,"The fact that they allow dogs past the 3rd lifeguard tower is super convenient, and the beach is gorgeously well kept. I love climbing the rocks, relaxing, just enjoying the surroundings. Meant for relaxing more than water play.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PassportGirlie
40,Nice beach,"This beach is very nice, but if you're looking for seashells, you're not gonna find many if any at all. Very clean. No lifeguards so swim at own risk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christenh1981
50,"Surf, sun and tide pools",Great little beach and rock area. Generally serene.Great for couples and small groups/families. Good for surf.If you don't have s state parking pass---The usual winter and summer parking prices.Buy a parking pass and support our state parks!Fun to surf with a small take-off zone---Locals are a strange crowd--Mix of sunset longboard kooks and ventura-style meth heads.Show respect and don't snake--drop-in and you'll have fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,Dog friendly beach!,This was a great beach to take the kids and the dog to- nice clean sand- free of rocks and not too crowded. If you are planning to go to the dog beach- park all the way at the end of the parking lot and head to the end of the beach for the most privacy.There is a per-day charge to enter the beach - which is worth it if you plan to spend several hours there. There are restrooms at the beach but there aren't any restaurants so pack a lunch.You can leave the park and come back on the same day but be forewarned- this beach is not close to very much so plan for a long round trip if so.Midday was the best time of day for a visit. By late afternoon the wind had picked up and the breeze was pretty cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Desert-Girl-At-Heart
50,Breathtaking views!,"We walked along the beach trails, very beautiful! Lots of cool rock formations, some you can climb on. We got a lot of awesome pics and videos here. Fun watching the surfers as well and lots of beach space to relax. $12 to get into the park (to park), the visitor's center is only open on the weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeb381
50,Love this park!,"Great tidepool areas. Saw a passing whale, wading birds, lots of rock formations and a trail above the beach to walk as well. Definitely go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/defiantone
30,Hit and Miss,"This is a very popular campground as it is close to the beach, provides showers and flush toilets and there is a small camp store, but..... it takes early reservations to ensure a spot and one really has to be careful to select a spot as there are big differences between one or another and the price is still the same. There are some really nice secluded and private spots on the south north side of the campground but there are also sites which are very close together. Great for a group, not so great for a couple seeking some chill out time.Also, this campground is popular with families (kids and dogs) as well as young folks who preferably camp in groups and like to stay up a bit longer :)So this is not a very quiet campground. But .... the beach and surroundings are awesome and you can't beat the weather either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertH586
40,Great place to camp,"Clean restrooms , showers , campground and beaches.Check tide tables . Don't miss a low tide beach walk .Online booking shows Completly booked , but many sites are available .Just fill in card at gate (after you've driven thru and chosen your site #) and put $ and card in drop box .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FredSquarecut
50,Best Tide Pools,"Every a group of our middle schoolers go to Malibu for a week of outdoor science. I got the opportunity to visit for the day. I have been to a few tide pools along the California coast and found this one to be one of the best. The tide out gives a really nice large area of sand and rocks with many little pools where I found starfish, many many anemones, a sea urchin, and a lovely vistor of a white Heron who was turning his head sideways to look into the water searching for lunch. Oh and these amazing tube worms that form an odd looking grey sculpture on the many rocks. Great place to take kids, great place to take pictures. Heck great place to stroll along the beach with a date or significant other.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristiZ_12
50,Nice change from just a strip of sand,"Leo Carrillo is a very interesting beach in Malibu. I am from Maine originally and it kind of reminded me of my days at the beach there. It is a much more natural beach with tidal pools, sea weed, rock formations and little inlets. The nice thing is dogs are allowed here on a leash. If you are lucky enough to get there early, you can put your chair in one of the rock ""caves"" along the water's edge to get out of the sun. This is a nature lover's beach. Kids will love exploring to see what is hiding in the tidal pools.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbbiew
40,Camping,Great place to visit and camp. Ocean was calm when we are at the beach. The breeze of the tides ashore were breathtaking. Amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/batac2015
50,Beach With A Rocky Bonus,An interesting diversion from the usual plain sandy Californian beach. We were there at low tide so there was plenty of craggy rocks to explore including tiny rocky caves below the bluff. Please respect the crabs and sealife clinging to the rocks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caml77
50,great legal beach for dogs!,"Beach to the east of the lifeguard station for tidepools. Lovely cliffs with a couple of caves. Then to the west, you can take your dogs on the lovely long sandy beach - but keep them on the leash. Park along the road, in the first large state park lot, or keep going once you're past that lot, under the bridge, and to the bigge rlots furtehr along. Small museum open at weekends in season. Flush toilets along the western beach. A few picnic tables. Deserted during winter weekdays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdkLosAngeles

50,"Perfect day on the sand,Leo Cabrillo","First, street parking is free! This a great beach for adventure.The beach public facilities have just been updated, always clean. Even when the life guard stands are closed they patrol by truck and helicopter.The beach is sub divided by lots of, climbable rock walls and tide pools. Great photo locations!!!!We try to go after a storm as we always find lots of unique treasures.Easy access by the restrooms. If you bring children they will love it, but, they will strict supervision!If you surf this is a popular spot.Check the tide table and go for low tide!There are area for picnics, be prepared to share with the birds.El Matador Beach is also nice, $8.00 to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bertaannf
50,Favorite place to go as local family or for taking visitors,"If you can only make a very quick stop to a beach, certainly it makes sense to visit Venice Beach or the Santa Monica Pier. They are quick and full of local cultural vibe. But if time allows and you would like to enjoy more coastal beauty…then I highly recommend driving up the coast just 45 minutes to Leo Carrrillo State Beach. It is a picturesque small bay with a large rock set off the shoreline with surfers on longboards enjoying nearly year round. You can take a nice walk along the beach… enjoy one of the best tide pools to explore whenever the tide is even close to low…and climb up on some rocks for one of the most beautiful panoramas and pictures you will get. Afterwards… drive just a couple miles further north and have a meal at the local hangout called Neptune’s Net. This is our favorite place to go as a local family as well as for taking visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrBLosAngeles
40,Nice campground,"This is a nice family friendly campground. Bathrooms generally clean and hot showers! If anyone is interested in shaping spots for Memorial Day weekend 2015, please reply!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackson1traveler
40,nice beach,"The beach is nice and family friendly. Parking is a bit dodgy if you decide to park along PCH, but you can pay and go into the park and that is much easier. Surf spots look nice. Coming from Florida the water is much colder during the summer than our waters from the Sunshine State.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orlando_Couple
40,Great day spent here,"Our sister inlaw took us here, it is their family's favorite beach in North LA and Ventura Counties. We enjoyed ourselves for 4 hours, I surfed for most of that time. The facilities are nice, you can park for free on the PCH, the walk is not any longer than in the state beach lots.Want to go back again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/958JasonK
40,Great dog friendly beach,"It's one of the only Los Angeles beaches that allows dogs. The dog owner seem to be responsible, didn't see any dog pop on the beach.There are grills and pi chic tables, but you'll need to get there early to lay claim.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jgiorgianni
50,Nice beach for sure,"Yet another great beach near Malibu, the rocky outcrops are where the start of Grease was filmed for those movie buffs.Clean, lots of lifeguards, I suggest trying to park along the highway to save some cash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WelcomeMat
30,No better than any closer beaches in LA,"From my research, several sites stated this beach is good for a one day beach goer. There are a lot of things to do and it worth a longer drive and it should not be crowded, I took the bait. We had to wait one half of an hour in traffic to turn in to the parking lot, the cars were line up waiting to go in. The parking fee is 12 dollars. There are 2 parking lot to take you to the beach; the first left or go straight in. We decided to drive in, the road took us under the highway and another 500 ft to the parking lot. We could not find any cave or anything else other than beach. On our way out we drove pass the first parking lot which leads to a nicer beach for walking. For us the beaches closer in to LA are as nice as this beach. For me this beach is not worth addition one half of an hour drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d2s1c2j
50,"Best Views, Best Beaches, Best Trails","You can camp, swim, scuba, fish, kitesurf, stand up paddle, surf, hike, or just sit and have a beer watching your campfire. I visit a lot, just to ride my bicycle around the camps , and under the bridge to the beach, and up to the lifeguard lookout for views. This place is a gem ! You really need to book in advance in the summer though if you want a spot. I wrote there is a fee, but if you're an adult and can safely walk to the beach from the highway, you can park on PCH. BE Careful ! It's a highway, and people are driving by in the 55 zone at 70 plus. Stay off the shoulder, walk between the cars and the land. NOT between the cars and the moving traffic. It's great here ! There is a store in the summer open. Otherwise you will need to bring everything, because the nearest store is miles away .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeT394
50,Sea Caves & Tide Pools!,"Wow! What a wonderful place to explore! The beach area was a bit crowded, but it was June anyway. The tide pools were incredible to explore, we saw crabs, snails, fish, mussels, birds, etc. What was really exciting were the sea caves! We'd wait for the waves to roll out to scoot through and around the crags to the next section! Before we knew it, we'd covered a huge portion of the beach! Then the rocks and mountains that we could climb to watch the waves and the pools were awesome. The life guard started shooing us away when the tides started to come in and higher (on the rocks, which become slippery - so just for our protection not to be bossy). We went to the little store in the camping area which was night and day different from the coast to the green camping area, being only a short distance away from each other! Nominal parking fee required.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/795nicoleh
40,Great beach for kids and adults,"Tide pools are amazing for those with young children, and the first time I've been on a beach with lifeguards that interact with people. The only drawback is the tar which (according to the lifeguard) is naturally occurring and also from oil fields near by. Had it stuck all over our shoes and feet. Still a great beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollyJetter
50,Love this beach. Always worth the drive.,Ok so I know it's a little further up the road but it is such a lovely spot. I'm someone who prefers the ocean cliffs to just long sandy beaches and this beach has both. The sunsets there are just fabulous. Really worth driving up the coast further.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janew79
40,Great Beach!,"I've been here for day trips only. There is a campground that is within walking distance of the beach as well. You can access the beach from the street and there is some street parking (which goes fast, so get there early). I recommend paying the $12 parking fee for the day. That said, the beach is excellent. There are several coves along the beach with different segments along the way. If you go at low tide you can see the fish come up along the shore. This is a popular draw with the young ones who like to look at the fish. There are other coves that are better for swimming / surfing a little further up.This beach has decent bathrooms, but not much else. No fires or grills allowed anywhere on the beach which can be a downside if you're planning a beach cookout. There were some dogs around although there were clear 'no dog' signs posted. I'm told that dogs are allowed certain times of the day, but I did not verify this as we are not dog people. I'd check into this deeper if you are planning on bringing a dog.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler9826465
50,Great Beach and our Dog's Loved IT.,"It was a great beach to have the dogs, beautiful views, clean, and lovely views. Good facilities and well maintained. A great beach park, we will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoodTimeBillyPeaches
50,Worth the extra drive to visit,"You really can't go wrong with any of the Malibu beaches along the PCH, but we continued onto this park and we were not disappointed. Beach has some interesting rock and cave formations that are fun to explore and features which are not at every beach. Beach was also uncrowded but we did go on a weekday. And since it was May, there was no ranger or fee and just porta potty toilets-I expect there are more facilities open in the summer months.The only caveat is that the area north of the rocks does allow for dogs on leashes so there were a fair amount of dog walkers in/around the beach, but they were all behaved and did not bother us. If you have time, drive the extra 15 minutes up here just to see the rocks and caves-very unique.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skierz
50,Well worth a visit,"Time frame did not allow for visiting during low tide so was unable to enjoy sea life in the tide pools. I was heading north on the PCH but asked the park ranger at the Leo Carrillo State Park entrance if I could park within the 20 minute visitor parking spaces and he agreed. Walk to the beach was scenic and pleasant. Took photos of the ""wall art"" on the overpass support structure. See below. Great views. Hope to visit at low tide next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/46Lil
50,Starfish galore!,"This was one of our favorite beaches along the Pacific! Absolutely beautiful scenery, rock formations, caves, very nice beach and the tidepools were filled with starfish, anemones and other cool creatures! We'd never seen so many starfish- watch for them clinging on to the rocks at low tide! Spectacular! Be sure to park on the highway for free and walk on down for a day at the beach!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaChHa
20,Worst camping experience ever,"Beautiful, clean. Staff is nice. Unfortunately they do not enforce the rules. Expected a quiet, relaxing weekend. Got just the opposite. Loud music from several spaces all afternoon until 2am (not supposed to be allowed at any time). A lot of loud partying before and after 10pm quiet time. Apparently no one patrols. Complaints to camp host brought promises but not results. We like to sit around the fire at night, but the music and loud people made it difficult to enjoy. We had rap music on one side, Country on another and Techno on another blasting all at once. First night it was 2am before it was quiet enough to sleep. Last night wardens were called in after 10pm to walk the roads and quiet campers down. One group, in particular continued to blast loud music, play a drum and had a strobe light. They also lit sticks on fire for torches and were running around with them. They didn't stop until after midnight, even after the wardens had walked through. We have to wonder why they were not told to pack up and leave. Got 2 hours sleep the first night and not much more the second night. Showers require tokens, but still no hot water. Very stressful and frustrating weekend. Disappointing that the staff is not able to control the partying. It is such a beautiful place, but we will never go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/326debrav
40,Beautiful campground,"Wonderful campground; very well maintained and lots of amenities. Each campsite has a picnic table and a fire pit. The restrooms are clean and there are token-operated showers.The area is beautiful. There is access to the beach; although when we were there the north beach (and unfortunately the only beach that allows dogs) was closed when we were there because there was some kind of filming happening. The security guard was nice enough to let us take our dog on a brief walk on the beach.There are lots of hiking trails; the one we took was relatively easy, but I think that there is variety in the difficulty.Important to note: the daily camping fee is $45 ($43 for seniors) and this must be paid either in cash or by check. There's a little drop box you can place the cash, but the rangers will come by and collect around noon each day if you'd rather not put cash in a box. You can also reserve a space online.The tokens for the shower will take $1, $5 or $10 bills only. The showers turn on without tokens, but will not get hot. If you turn on the shower and turn the lever so that it points to about 12:00 (pointy end, not the handle end), then you can put the token in and get the full benefit.The camp host sells firewood, but it's $7 a bundle and the bundles are the same size you can get at the supermarket for $1 to $2 less. There's no wood collecting, so it's good to pack in as much wood as you can.The rangers were really friendly and helpful. The restroom areas are cleaned daily.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hop0409
40,Camping and tidewater,Great hidden camping area with beautiful beach across the street to walk to. Kids love the sea urchins and other sea creatures in the tide pools. Surfing also available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinkQ7630MZ
40,Dog Friendly Beach,"North of lifeguard house tower 3 is the dog friendly part. We absolutely love it there as the beach is not overly crowded. Dogs are overall very well behaved. Great place to spend a few hours or a day there... Bring some food for a picnic, some beach chairs, umbrella and you're all set! Access to the beach is free if you parked by the PCH or pay for the $12 parking to the state park so that you can park right near the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/junet277
50,Love this Place,Hiking in this park is amazing. You will see lots of cactus and sage. The climbs are mildly steep but the walk down to the beach is reward enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrishHurler
50,Lovely ocean spot,On the side of the Pacific Highway short of Neptune's Net past Pepperdine. Nice place to climb a rock and sit and walk the beach. Many fond memories now that I live in Mississippi. Take advantage you lucky California folk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/borckman
50,You can almost picture Annette and Franky there,"This picturesque beach was named after the 1940s and 50s actor Leo Carrillo (who I sipped Lemonade with when I was 8 years old, at his house), whose family owned it and adjoining countryside since the Spanish Land Grants. It is now a California State Park that is a Surfing and Windsurfing paradise, but be careful of the rocks. If you ae old enough, you will remember this beach from various 1960s ""Beach "" movies. Next time you dive by, stop and smell the clean Pacific breezes. Invigorating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenS306
40,Beautiful new Accessible Trail at Nicholas Pond,Just took a hike on a beautiful new trail rebuilt by the State Parks. High above the mansions of Malibu at the end of Decker School Road is the trailhead for this wonderful half-mile hike to Nicholas Pond. At the end there is a great vista overlooking the Pacific Ocean and Decker Canyon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravlinNacho
50,Amazing...but watch out for tar!,"How can you not love this beach? Sandy and Danny spent some time here (for those of you familiar with the movie ""Grease"" ;)There are beautiful rock formations surrounding the little coves of pale tan sand beaches. With a little bit of climbing around, you can find interesting creatures like starfish and others that I couldn't identify!Even though we just loved the beautiful beach, there were tar spots all over that would stain your shoes, feet, clothes etc! We asked around on how to remove this with a suggestion of sunscreen ( not waterproof ). The park ranger there suggested baby oil instead which did the trick with a bunch of effort.On the opposite side of where we parked were hiking trails and a camping area. We took a small hike but made our way back to the car with a few too many encounters with bumblebees that day.*fee for parking only--and probably for camping if you choose to stay there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Missy99
40,"From hammocks to motorhomes, there is room for all.","This was our second family camping trip (or better known as, the annual school camping trip) and our second time at a California State Park.One of the many nice things about this park is it's close location to Los Angeles. About 28 miles up PCH(Pacific Coast Highway).The camp site:The camp site can handle the smallest tent to RV's.We spent two nights and three days (over the memorial day holiday) at the park. We had space #25 (middle road, there are three ""roads"" that access the sites, like a circle with a road in the middle)(parking at site, 2 cars side by side, 3rd car blocks the other two, keep in mind if you need to get out and the blocking cars owners are at the beach or hiking). This was a very big space for the three families that were going to share the space, 6 adults, 6 kids).There were lots of trees and brush surrounding our site. There was one metal fire ""drum"" and one picnic table. We brought in our own fire wood, but you can buy bundles from the camphost for $7. Having only one table ment that we really had to share space at the table. Kids ate at the table, adults sat in folding chairs. I would have like to have had another table. But It seems that each site just had one table.One of the nice things about this camp site is the amount of trees. I saw a number of hammocks set up.There is also a camp store that is well stocked, and you can get hot coffee there!Bathrooms/showers.I give the park an ""A"" for trying to keep the bathrooms clean. At least once a day, I saw someone cleaning the bathrooms and restocking. For the amount of people at the site, they did a great job of keeping the bathrooms ""decent to use.""Our site was between two bathroom/shower areas, with one being three sites away from ours. The showers require tokens ($1 for two tokens, 4 min of shower time). The showers we used (near site 30) did not have a token machine, so I ended up taking showers at the other shower area that did have a token machine (near the camp store). The shower water was hot.I have only one negative comment about our time at the park. As I mentioned, our site was off the middle road. Due to the luck of the draw, our site was between two groups of friends who liked to stay up and party. Our site became the ""shortcut"" between the two. During the day, this was not a problem, but at night when the party fun began, it was bad. One of group did ask them turn down the music, but sound really carries and it sounded like the party was in our tent.One night we went to bed around 10pm. A funny but sad moment came when the group of friends who had one to many bud lights, came trooping thru our site to get to the other site, yelling to each other that they had to be quiet because people(us) were sleeping, and to prove the point to each other, they shined their flashlights at our tents. I think the park rangers gave them a warning.Granted, this was memorial day weekend and for some, this is a time to celebrate life to its fullest(and to see how many bud lights one can drink). And if it had been another weekend, I don't know if we would have had that type of situation. Bottom line, I would camp there again.The beach:You can walk to the beach from your camp site, the campsites are not on the beach but across the highway and in the canyon. What you can do, is take your car and park in the beach parking lot (that is inside the park). With kids, this might be the way to do it if you have a site up in the canyon.This is a nice sand beach, a rocky at low tide (a good thing), bathrooms and outside shower near the beach. Lifeguard towers as well.We spent the day playing at the beach and watching the locals and campers surf. If you are not a local surfer, I would check in with one of the lifeguards to find out what the local surf ""rules"" are and if theres anything unusual about the spot. I have found the LA County Lifeguards to be very professional and friendly. One of our friends was a paddle boarder and there is an area that they can be in. The two days that we were at the beach, there was not a lot of swimming, mostly kids playing along the water line.At low tide, there are some great tidal pools and that was when all the kids went to see starfish and crabs, etc. As mentioned in other reviews, you might want to have watershoes for the tidal pools and don't pick up the sea life and respect the pools.Bring a beach umbrella, sand toys for the kids and enjoy the beach.Bottom line for both the beach and campsite.I would comeback to both. And if you live in southern California, this is a great place to spend the day or a couple of nights.Be sure to check out the website for the park: http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=616",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jack_Cara
40,Beautiful!,All the beaches in Malibu were beautiful and each different from the other. California was a great place to visit with my little dog as most areas are pet friendly. Loved our stay here and enjoyed all the beaches and landscape!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadelineS784
40,Visit at low tide,"A very rocky beach but interesting sea life at low tide. Due to the rocks and configuration of the landscape there are tidal pools that are fun to explore especially, young children. It would be good to wear some type of water shoe to protect from the sharp rocks. There is a cave and various rocks that provide nice splashing from the waves on a windy day. You can park on the east side of PCH and walk under the highway via a tunnel.They give you 20 minutes free to check the place out. There are better sand beaches in the area, but this has a combination of ingredients that make it attractive. Camping is also available.Leo Carrillo was the sidekick to the Cisco Kid...Poncho, back in the day. He was instrumental in getting San Simeon donated to the state as a park. Oh Cisco! Oh Poncho!...If you know what this is from you are 60+ or watch old TV shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998JamesH998
50,Gorgeous beach!,"This beach is beautiful. I suggest you take a day to explore. There is a cave, the bluffs, and the endless beauty of the shoreline. Great tide pool exploring on low tide days, but please do not pick up any of the sea life & please teach your kids to respect them. Go up onto the bluffs for a breathtaking look of the ocean. There is also a camping area. Parking fee, for day use or park along PCH.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dee2465
40,"Explore the sea creatures, sand and surf!","Nice sand, however the rocks you must walk over to get to the ocean seemed annoying at first. Then realized that sea creatures lived in between and on the rocks. There were tide pools with starfish and sea anemones all around. You could also find many shells especially when tide is low.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acarlso
40,Wonderful hidden gem for camping,Love to be able to ride a bike around and go under the PCH highway via the tunnel to be right on the beach. The campgrounds can really vary to being in direct sun to heavy tree canopy. It used to be much better system to book a campstie and now everyone has to book it on the same day at the start of the year. Showers are hot - bring your quarters and restrooms are pretty clean but in the summer can be overused in between cleaning. Noise can travel as in any campground but this one being so close to the beach is speacial. there is also a waterfall to hike to at the back of the campground. Follow the road all the way to the back past the boy scouts area and follow the trail. You will wind past a dry or wet creek and cross a creekbed of rocks. The waterfall is at the end- not all that far and worth the time spent. You can see little fish and baby frogs too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swimdiva
40,Classic,This is a lovely spot. Have been going there for dozens of years. Nice serene place. No too crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryD879
40,Paradise Malibu,"Went many times over the last 50 years. Beautiful setting. Not exactly secluded campsites, but young kids think they're camping, and it was great last time for a family reunion. Wonderful combination of chaparral around camp and beach time across the road...don't worry, there's an underpass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraE974
40,Popular campground and beach with caves to explore!,"We stayed for two nights and had site # 84 which was close to the campground store and a little bit away from the bathrooms and showers. The site was next to the creek which was dry.We didn't rate it a ""5"" due to the noise from the campers next to us that stayed up very late and were talking loudly by their campfire. Since it was just my son and I we were hoping to sleep by midnight at least!The beach was very nice. While walking along it we saw some dolphins swimming along! There were a lot of rocks in the water...my son ended up with a few scratches and bruises from riding his boogie board. (another reason why we didn't rate it ""5""). But a plus was that there was very little seaweed.We had to ask around in order to locate the caves! We did find them on the left side of life guard tower that is up high on a hill. There is a set of stairs going down to the beach right near the caves too. We were able to explore them a bit at low tide!There is a great visitor education center in the parking lot for the beach that has great information on the wildlife and additional interesting information on the park and beach. It's set up in a manner that is especially great for kids.The campground is very popular. We had to go on a wait list for reservations over 6 months in advance and fortunately we were notified a spot opened up and we took it immediately!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/muchfuntotravel

50,Starfish and sea enenomes galore!,"We picked a beautiful afternoon to stop at this lovely park. You can park along the westside of PCH road and walk in for free. Or pay $12 for parking. We chose free. When the tide is higher, you can find more sea life closer to shore. This day the tied was low. We were able to find some cool starfish and sea enenomes all around. Just be respectful and dont step on them! Some portions may be a bit rocky/treacherous but kids will love it. Some caves are available (with low tide). Also had a pleasant surprise when my boyfriend proposed to me here on Jan 16, 2013..So we will definitely will be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/820JenniferL
10,ranger on a power trip.,"Last weekend we gathered with friends to celebrate my husband’s birthday. A group of avid campers, we are no stranger to Leo Carrillo and their camping facilities. We’re also no stranger to using positive camp practices such as leave no trace, pack in pack out, etc...For those in the LA area it’s a great beachside spot not too far from home. We reserved 2 spots for the weekend, which, after the price jump the state parks recently implemented, cost us $200. $45 dollars a night, plus $12 for each additional car is far from affordable, but we do what we can to support the parks, so rather than go party in Vegas or stay in a hotel in Palm Springs or up north, we thought it worth it. And it was....until Sunday morning. Sunday, at 7:30 in the morning, my husband (a licensed medical marijuana patient) rose early (before any of the 7 other campers at our site) and medicated just up the hill from where the rest of us were sleeping. Moments later a ranger came by the site, most likely saw his PRESCRIPTION bottle of medicine, and insisted that every single one of us wake up, exit our tents (most of us were half-dressed as we had just been pulled from our slumber) and sit like children at the picnic table. She removed the knife we used for my husband’s birthday cake (as if we were going to stab her?) and also the hatchet we used for firewood before she began her lecture to a group of sleepy faced 30 year olds. “When I drove by I smelled marijuana. I’m only going to say this once. Who all here has marijuana on them? Don’t lie to me. I will find it.” At this point my husband offers up his license, as does one other person in the group who has a license. She then proceeded to search ALL of our tents, even asking questions like “Why do you have a lighter in here? What were you doing with a lighter?” (uhhh, we are CAMPING, I’d be worried if nobody had a lighter). We even asked the ranger she called in for “back up” what the protocol is for situations like these and he didn’t have an answer...long story short, she found nothing incriminating (despite the obvious disappointment on her face) and left with a lecture about how our campsite being left just as we found it or else. Frustrating to say the least because we take pains to ensure the site is always in great shape. After she left, most of the group just packed up and left. For all of the money that we paid we sure felt that we weren’t welcome there. I understand the law and following protocol, but I feel that this ranger greatly overstepped her bounds during her absurd power trip. With state parks on the budget chopping block every single year, you’d think that the patrons that they do have would at least be treated with respect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/626katied
50,"Beautiful, Just How I Picture Malibu","Took a drive up PCH just to get to Leo Carrillo State Beach. I'm so glad we did. There were large rocks and waves crashing up on the rocks. We took a walk up the west end of the beach to a very rocky area, and found many mussells, crabs, and starfish. This was the first time I've seen these animals in the wild. Went around to the east end of the beach, and found many tide pools. They were so awesome! Many anemones and crabs just moving around in their own little world. I would definitely recommend visiting if you are interested in sealife and tide pools. I also wandered out into the ocean. It's very rocky near the shore, but once you get in a few feet, the rocks are gone. The waves were rough. I had a blast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pilotgirl21

40,"Fun, Interesting and Clean","Went here yesterday, 9.7.12. It was late afternoon stayed from around 4:30 to 7pm. Like others have said here, do not pay the rip off $12 to park. You can usually find a spot on PCH. The guard at the parking gate was cool and she suggested we do that when she saw the look on our face when she told us the fee. lolOn that, please tell me how the state park commission figures the various state park fees. Just up the road from here, the fee at Pt. Mugu by the beach is $8.Huh?The beach is nice, no dogs this time, thank God. Free peeing annoying dogs are always a turn-off at the beach, thank you very much. lolOkay. So there were several guys out doing surf parasailing, plus traditional surfers. This beach has a great view and is scenic. (I know. Like there's bad beaches.......)Lots of shells and clean water, no tar. Of course you can explore the area and see where the various famous films were shot here. This is the most filmed beach in the world for movies. Some aspiring next Kate Upton was there in her bikini having her photo shoot by a pro photographer.I noticed that a guy and his girl were having some Coronas so I bought one from him and showed them the car key bottle opener trick and they were grateful. I was surprised it wasn't crowded for a Friday afternoon late in the day. By the time we left, though, many squealing families were showing up, I think they were from the Carrillo camp site.For Malibu, we usually go to Surfrider, Zuma, or Mugu, but I would recommend this and go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryMon
40,Great Campground - Rocky Beach,"We arrived here on a Wednesday afternoon after driving up from San Diego. The campground was AWESOME - make sure you reserve a spot that is on the outside of the loop to avoid having your campsite back up to another campsite. We had number 88 and our site backed up to the dried up riverbed. There is a LOT of dirt - no grass and no ground cover - but big sites with fire pits and a grate to cook our steaks on. Also, there are nice picnic tables. The store at the campground is seriously amazing, we referred to it as the ""local 7-11"" only without the Slurpees. You could get just about anything there, and I'm not exaggerating, just about anything. They sell wood for fires at $7.00/bundle.The bathrooms were relatively clean, and there was running water at faucets close to the campsites.The beach was a bit of a let down. We are not hard core surfers, and my 9 year old has only just begun surfing so needless to say, the rocks were extremely distressing. I tried to go out for a surf but got dragged across a couple rocks on my first ride in and gave up. There was no relaxing on the beach or swimming because of the rocks, but we went back in the morning the next day and looked at all the hermit crabs.This would have been five stars had the beach been sandy - otherwise a really awesome experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyH191

40,Roomy Camping spots/close to beach,"Very nice campground. We stayed at Carpinteria SB the night before and this was a treat to have so much to relax. The dog had much more room to roam around on leash too. Private big lots in a little valley close to the beach, and hiking. Great camp store with cool t-shirts and everything you need for food, camping, etc. If we would've known we wouldn't have backtracked to find a grocery store in Malibu. Short walk to beach under bridge. Beach had nice dramatic rocks, but they were pretty strict on dogs. Only the north beach allowed dogs and they had to be kept leashed all times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HannahskyB
50,good dog beach,"The doggie section of Leo Carrillo beach is north of station 3. There's parking right at the beach, and you walk down a few wooden steps. The steps are steep, so if you have a little dog you'll have to carry her. My basset/doxie made it up and down in a few leaps. The sand is clean and there are lots of dogs playing in the water and on the sand. The parking is steep at $12 for the day, but the only other doggie beach in the area is in Long Beach. This was Annie Oakley's first beach trip, and as you can see she's not a water dog.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NikkiH890
40,"Beach camping, dogs allowed :)","This is a great place to go for a couple nights. The camp sites are across the street from the beach but it's only a 5 minute walk or so. There is also some good trails that go up into the surrounding hills. There are full amenities, showers and bathrooms and a water spickit at most sites. You can park one car free and any additional cars are $12 per night each. I didn't get a chance to check it out but apparently there is store with anything you forgot to bring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seizetheday954

We spent a relaxing Easter Sunday picnicking and exploring at Leo Carrillo state beach. We climbed the rocks, explored the cave and searched for marine life in the tide pools among the rocks. We found sea urchin, star fish, mussels, and loads of crabs. Clean beach, clear water, soft sand. Water wasn't too rough, but enough waves/surf to attract surfers. Entrance fee is $12 which is worthwhile to support a state run facility. Basic, functional bathroom facilities. Daily fee allows you to come and go for the entire day. Bring food since closest sandwich place is about 10 minutes away. The drive along Route 1 is beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suz_newyorkcity

You should bring ""beach"" shoes, b/c the rocks are sharp but very fun to climb, and the cave on the other side of the tidepools is really neat (again, only safe if the tide is very low!).

50,"Beautiful Beach views, Great Camping and Varied beach landscapes","As a California native, I grew up camping here. The campground has beautiful Sycamores, Native plants and green hills,with a stream running aside some of the camp spots.The spots are well marked and most have campfire pits with grills and water faucets. There are showers, bathrooms and the typical quaint camp store. During the summer, they have camp fire programs for families and lots of hiking in the surrounding hills.(Ok NOTE* by hiking I dont mean pack for ten days, I'm the hike in a good pair of boots and wear a cute pink hat kinda girl) The wildlife is everywhere, and its not uncommon for some California quail to run through your campground. You have to make reservations early through the ca.gov. parks and recreation site.The North beach, it's a must see. Hundreds of commercials and many movies have been filmed on this strip of beach towards the rocks and cliffs.In April, they ever have an Earth Day Whale Fest with educational info about Whales, native plants,Chumash Indian culture, food and fun. You enter the park and pay a day fee.(around $12.00 dollars) you can park in the front lot near the campgrounds and walk to the front beach and watch surfers or climb the many sandstone rocks and small cliffs.Yes the kids will drive you crazy chasing them (the small ones) but we need excercise anyways..right? Then if you want a change of scenery you drive under an artist inspired, mural covered bridge, and over to the North beach side, you can explore and hike the whole strip of trails along the sea cliffs, walk down the wood staircase and explore the very cool sea cave that connects to a private tiny beach with sandstone cliffs and water soaked tide pools. There is so much to see a camera is a must. Scale of 1-10 must see beach? 9+",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Camfoodie
50,"Great beach, great tidepools","Great spot for the day. The adjacent camp grounds have several nice hiking trails that go back into the Santa Monica mountains. The beach is wide and pretty. Parking is designed so that you can park and walk about 10 feet to the beach so, if you forget something in the car, it's an easy walk back. The main beach area also allows LEASHED dogs, too. The tidepool area is my favorite, especially during low tide. Wear beach shoes and walk along the rocks to peek into the little pools and see crabs, anemonies, and other sea creatures.

However it's adjacent to the site directly behind it, blending right into ours. Stay away from these type of campsites. Our first night we listened to bongo drums and partying from 2 different nearby campsites till midnight. Our 2nd day we thought we were on an episode of Punked. A huge, loud family with 5 tents and a loose Rottweiler dog descended on our adjacent site. Their fire ring 20 feet from us and our tent. Partying, eating, and belching, over an hour past quiet time, like the pig family from Angry Birds. The camp host in spot #17 came and shut the family up, then we listened to over an hour of snickering after that. Our own backyard is quieter than this place.The showers and bathrooms were very good for a campground, and their beach was very nice, but there's just nothing you can do about people.We couldn't get out of there fast enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Narbonne_Gaucho

20,Sooooo over-rated,"Camped at Leo Carrillo for 3 nights in Aug. While the trees are nice, this campground is nothing to go wild over. The sites are very close together. The perimeter road is narrow which can make it tricky to park and RV or trailer. (Nothing quite like trying to back up a trailer into a tight spot while trying not to hit the cars parked in the site across the road while traffic backs up..) The sites on the outer loop – especially the south side – looked awful. No shade, tiny spots, up a steep bank, those people looked miserable.For some reason, fire rings and picnic tables wander at this campground. No picnic table at your site? Drive ¼ mile down the loop and you’ll see a site that has 3.The bathrooms are all located on the center road. Which means if you’re on the outer loop, you will either have to walk the entire loop to get to the bathroom or cut through someone else’s site. The bathrooms were very dirty. I have never seen so much graffiti at a campground before. Every single toilet seat and door was carved into with tagging.What’s good about the campground? There is a store at the campground, which is a nice convenience . The campground is a great place to ride bikes.So the campground is pretty much a bust. How about the beach? Easy walk from the campground to the beach, that’s about the best I can say. The beach is rocky which makes getting out into the water difficult because you have to navigate the rocks. Good for surfing or watching other people surf. Not good if you have kids that want to play in the water.Sunset Magazine rates this campground one of the best in CA. They’re wrong.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdcamper
30,Camping with younger kids,"Last several camping trips were at national parks. This being a state park it seems they have less of a budget for maintaining and up keeping the grounds. Bathrooms were cleaned once a day...they are unisex which is gross sharing with men who pee wherever and sometimes in the toilet. Nice hot showers were available, bring dollars since the machine uses tokens only.We had problems with squirrels and yellow jackets, keep your food and drinks covered and car windows shut (there was a squirrel in our car who ate half a loaf of bread). It gets very windy mid day. I never saw rangers patrolling the area, as there were several loud occupants in close by camps after hours. The beaCh is about a 10 minute walk, beautiful views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/disneymama619
40,Urban Camping,If you are a hard core camping person you will probably not like it here. To me it did not feel like a true camping trip in the mountains however my first experience here was great and I will be back.The site is set in the Malibu Canyon near the beach. Depending on the site depends on the size of the site and shade. The sites are close together and you and your neighbors will be close and you may be bothered by noise either at night or very early in the morning by crying kids at 7 am like we were.Like I said to me it did not seem like real camping. There is a beach store that offers everything you may have forgotten right on the campgrounds. You can get a fresh brewed cup of coffee in the AM and a nice cold ice cream in the PM all the while getting Wi-Fi. The bathrooms were not to clean (we were there post July 4) and the showers are a nice bonus (.50 per three minutes) and the store itself has very reasonable prices.All in all a nice place to get away from the city without leaving the modern conveniences you may be used to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FREDLOW1
30,"Beautiful Beach, Loud Campers","My family spent the last two weekends camping at Leo Carrillo and generally had a terrifc time during the day. The beach is great -- we are local to the area, and enjoyed tide pooling and long walks on the beach. The hiking trails are excellent, even for younger kids. The camp store has everything you need and friendly staff. Wood is a bargain at $6. Hot showers are a few tokens and water pressure is so strong that adults will love them. My kiddos could not even stand in the flow due to the force. Yes, we tried several. The downside is that on both trips we had super loud neighbors who enjoyed music all day, during dinner time, and then even during quiet hours turned their music to low but kept their conversation at ""outdoor"" voices well past midnight. We could hear several campers all through the night having party time. If the ranger or host monitors the areas, we never benefitted.Specific camp site location can REALLYy influence your stay. We had a terrific time in #1, lousy in #93. Unfortunately you can't pick a specific site during high season so it is virtually luck-of-the-draw if you get a large site, small site, sight with trees, site that backs up or is next to the next campers. We have reservations next month and I think our solution will be ear plugs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuGirl1982
40,"Kids loved it, too crowded for my pleasure","The kids all agreed that this was their favorite place of our trip. They loved climbing on the rocks and they loved the little cave. The tide was in so not too much to say about the tide pools. Very crowded and it costs $12. I thought Ventura had better beaches, IMHO.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/banksters41
40,Parents & Kids agree: this is a great place to camp!,"We have been camping at Leo Carrillo for years. It is convienently close to everything while feeling tucked away. A couple good hiking trails, great fishing & extrodinary beach. Love the little camp store where kids can get treats but check to see if it is open, sometimes closed ""off season"".Due to state budget cuts, not sure if they are having ranger run campfire talks anymore, many campgrounds have to cut this great program.Make sure to take a trip to Neptunes Net for killer clam chowder, fresh seafood (hamburgers too) drinks & a view of the surfers in action. This place is a big biker shack so parking can be tough. Great food!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktspiv4
50,Great Place to take the Family!,"Our trip to Leo Carrillo took place July 19th-23rd. It was our first time staying at that campground. We loved it! We met people that have been coming with their families for years. It's definitely someplace I'd like to continue to bring my kids. There was so much for them to do. We brought their bikes and they rode all over the campground and state beach. We had the most perfect weather too! It was sunny and warm every day. Every night we saw 3 or 4 resident deer that would come down off the mountain right about dusk, everyone in the vicinity would stop and watch them. It was great! The campgrounds are very clean and in the evening it is very quiet. No loud parties at least while we were visiting. It was very peaceful! The campground offers hot showers for a fee, 50 cents for 3.5 minutes. It was warm enough though that a cold shower (for free) was just fine for us. We really had a great time! I've heard some of the state parks are closing due to the budget and I sure hope this is not one of them. It looks pretty profitable to me. All the sites are full! If you want to visit in the summer book 6 months in advance. It's worth planning ahead!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casunlover1
50,A winning combination. Just make sure you book in advance - waaaaay in advance,"Our trip to Leo Carrillo State Park and Beach took place in late May. After being tipped off that it is difficult to reserve sites on weekends, we glanced at the reservation website (reserveamerica.com) and confirmed this to be true. Since we were flexible with our dates, we decided to go during the week instead and had no trouble reserving a spot; however, those wishing to visit on weekends are strongly advised to book months in advance - by May the weekend spots were already booked through summer!The campground was easy to find and located right off PCH. We were pleased to find several open spots despite many campers being there. Most of the sites were nicely spaced apart for privacy and had plenty of space. We were lucky and were able to secure a huge spot at the rear of the campground which was basically isolated from the other spots (no sites to the immediate right or left). Each site had its own picnic table and fire pit. There were also water taps located nearby. The bathrooms and showers were clean and centrally located.The beach adjoining the campground was about a 5-10 minute walk (depending on where your site is). There is also a parking lot next to the beach if you choose to drive. We hit the beach around 5:30pm or so hoping to catch some evening glass. We were sad to see almost no swell in the water. Also, the shoreline was quite jagged with rocks, both along the beach and protruding up from the water several yards out. We ended up driving up PCH a few miles and surfing a spot with better conditions, but not the legendary peeling points we had heard stories about. Still, the weather was sunny, beaches uncrowded, and there were plenty of places to explore along the coast.The only noises we heard in the evening were cars passing by on the nearby Mullholland Highway and some chatter from campers in the ""group camping"" area, both of which subsided by 9:00pm or so, allowing us a peaceful slumber to the sound of crickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HenryII
40,Great time,"It is a nice place to camp with the family. They have a nice little store with somewhat overpriced items (Bacon @ $7.00), but if you want it that bad go for it. There are scheduled daily hikes and tide pools. A cool cave you walk through to get to the other side of the beach. The camp host sells firewood for cheap. Overall, the campground is clean and peaceful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MountainMommie
50,We Love Leo Carrillo,"We always love Loe Carrillo every time we go. It is hard to get reservations, but when you do it is great, we go all year long, it never gets too cold or too hot! The beach is fantastic for kids and the campground is clean and the people are friendly. We review all campgrounds at www.boa-magazine.com The Best Outdoor Activities!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariahdawn
50,A Nice Getaway Beach Campground,"Leo Carrillo is a great camping location that offers lots of fun activities: surfing, hiking, tidepools, biking, etc. Somewhat removed from the metropolitan areas of LA, it is quiet and nestled in a classic California ravine with oak and sycamore providing shade.Unlike other beach campgounds in Southern California, Leo Carrillo does NOT have traintracks nearby nor a noisy freeway or airport (these noise problems are prevalent at nearly all other beach campgrounds I know of from Santa Barbara south to San Diego).It is a popular place and can get crowded, so plan ahead through ReserveAmerica.com, especially during summer. Camping is dry, no hookups, but campsites have plenty of room and the grounds are shared by tents, trailers, and small RV's to 35 feet. Clean restrooms and hot showers at .50 cents for five minutes.Every time I've been here with my family (wife, small son & daughter), the kids have not been able to do all the activities they want to, since there are so many fun things for active people to do. They always want to come back for more. Definitely our favorite campground!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Qhuna
50,Leo Carrillo was Great!,"We just got back from Leo Carrillo over the weekend. We, my girlfriend and her daughter along with 2 other families shared one large campsite. We had a blast! The beach was great, the weather was awesome we could'nt of asked for more. The worst part of this is that its too hard to book another trip this summer because it's so booked. Bathrooms are clean and showers work well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cosmopolitan22957
50,Great for kids,"We visited this beach w/2 small children, and everyone had a great time. It's a gorgeous, clean beach, that offers a lot of activities like surfing, snorkeling, camping, etc. My children loved the tidepool, water was warmer there and they could explore the many seashells, hermit crabs, small fish, etc. that live there. It was wonderful and educational for them. We brought a kite too. We'll be back soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Journey15300
