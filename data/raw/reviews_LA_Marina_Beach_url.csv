50,Beautiful Morning Walk,We walked from The Ritz to this beach early one morning and it was lovely. We met another dog and had a play.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missymlo
50,Nice Beach,"Marina del Rey is a beautiful beach. I have been there three times. Marina del Rey has many things that you can enjoy. The beach is a clean place and you can enjoy walking around. I remember many things about this beach. For example, I was walking around the place and felt very relaxed. I looked at many people playing some sports other people riding bicycles. I recommend this nice place because it is very relaxing and you can walk alone or with your spouse, family and friends. The environment is safe and you can breathe fresh air.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ec2055
50,Lovely beach,"Loved it here, the beach is absolutely massive and kept very clean. Dogs are allowed and I always saw the owners pick up after them. Be prepared for a long walk to get to the sea as it's so big.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ali622
50,Semi-secluded,This is my favorite beach although somewhat biased as I used to live on the peninsula. The beach is to the left as you get to the Washington Ave pier. Most people go right towards Venice. It is much quieter although not isolated. There are a couple of volleyball courts. Parking is limited so it’s less crowded swells are smaller due to the marina channel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davideddoc
50,One of my favorite local places of nature to escape to!,"It's wide open, expansive and hardly anyone on there. People pay a ton of money to travel to this kind of beach and its right HERE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/274LynnR
50,Beautiful,"Just the right Beach if you have young kids, very clean, safe and the water beautiful...Very Nice ..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hucarr

50,Nice clean beach,"This is a nice clean beach with not many people. It was nice to walk around it on the path, and look at the different boats, and condos",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nanski
40,Quiet beach,"Nice beach in Marina Del Rey. Not the sweeping ocean view type of place. But it’s a great place to sit by the beach, go to a restaurant, or rent a boat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pupkinpie2
40,Lovely beach and walking area,"First, do not confuse Marina Beach with Mother's Beach (which is a total dump). The Marina Beach is lovely. There is a jetty you can walk out on, there is an area to swim and the walks near there are very pretty. It is not breathtaking, like some of our other beaches, but it is very nice.It is safe and you can bike, walk or drive there. Parking can be a problem but there are spaces for a fee. Drive to the end of Ocean Ave in Venice, turn North and it is at the end of that street, Have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
50,Our beach,Two minutes from home this has been our beach year round for the last seven years.Partially protected by the MdR breakwater and partially open to the Santa Monica Bay with views all the way to Malibu and beyond.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenkS2925WQ
40,Good for less crowds,This beach is away from the mainstream beaches like Santa Monica the place is clean and ticks the box but not as much fun as some of the others.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/827martinob
50,"Fabulous, relaxing vacation",Marina Beach is a quiet family oriented beach located behind Jamaica Bay Inn. Families always out picnicking on weekends. Very safe area and great way to enjoy the beauty of Marina del Rey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wyandote5
40,Clean Beach that's not crowded,There were not a lot of people on the beach. But it was fairly clean. There were a lot of people working early in the morning around the area making sure trash was picked up and security and lifeguards patrolling. a lot of surfers. The one thing that wasn't so nice was the number of homeless scattered about. There are a lot of little shops and restaurants down this strip of beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/usmboyzzz
30,Sort of a private beach for smaller crowds... But it won't steal your breath away,"I honestly don't want to be mean with my comment, and I am really trying to be polite, so I won't compare any of the beaches of LA to the beaches we have here in Sydney (Australia)... which aren't the best we have in Australia, FYI.This beach, relatively a stroll away from Venice beach, is a secluded area, primarily used for the Marina (as its name implies) has a few places to grab something to eat, as well as benches, car park, etc. The water is ok, pretty calmed so it is really good for families with kids and what have you, but it is not a tourist attraction.I had a bit of a swim here, packed my stuff and moved on. Did it basically just to tick the box of places I wanted to get to on my last few hours in LA.I was not comfortable either as there was a big crowd having a sort of party and they were blasting music all around.In any case, traveling is expanding your experiences, even if some of these are not remarkable. This one was not the most memory forming experience but at least it was not negative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodrigoelp
40,Nice clean small beach,"So nicely cleaned,sand in perfect condition.carpets to walk on.picnic corners nicely prepared.the beach itself narrow and the ""lake"" is small,but nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jehudam2017

50,Great for kids!,"Perfect for kids, with a park attached. Lifeguard on duty. Access to bathrooms and picnic tables. Parking is $10 bucks in lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mimimank
30,Good beach for families,"Marina beach is really for kids and families, it's a small beach that draws local residents. For adults or couples Venice Beach is the ideal beach,you can walk to Venice in 10-15 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q6545TMwilliamn
40,More like a lagoon,Nice place to hang out before this is not a beach. There is no ocean but really a lagoon off the harbor. Very gradual slope into the water which means the tide goes out pretty far but also comes in quite a ways. Keep an eye on the water if you plan on staying there several hours and the tide is on its way in. Excellent small kids area to splash and play in the water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JOHealy
50,Lovely stretch of soft sand,Great vibes and lots of fab bars along this part of the beach. Would definitely recommend a trip here. Great atmosphere on and around beach area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieRobBushey
20,Small beach to accommodate too many people,"Beach located at the end of the marina furthest distance from the sea, but with a significant tide.There are boating/paddle boards for hire and a good bar/coffee shop by the beach, and a children's play area.There are refurbishments taking place from the Fall of 2017 to summer of 2018 which are noisy and disruptive",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisdL5610NP
30,Remodeling is slow,Checked out Marina Beach and it appears they are making very slow progress with the bathrooms and the BBQ AREA. With that said they moved 3 volleyball courts away from the construction so all three are useable. The children's play area is still good and a couple of families had birthday parties going on. The temporary bathrooms are clean and nice. Worth a visit but on weekends arrive early for parking and to get a table if you plan on a group party.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnawE8182XR
40,Under Used Beach,This beach does not have many parking lots near so it gets less use than the more popular Venice Beaches. If you are in for a long walk then this is a nice beach with a jetty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MITCHELN
40,A nice sight to wake up to,"My family recently rented a house at Marina Del Rey while I attended the AFM, and the Marina Del Rey beach is such a nice play to take walks. I prefer this beach over Venice and Santa Monica because it is quieter with much less bums.Every night I slept with the windows open so I could hear the calming sound of waves crashing. This is a fantastic beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonathanHeatt
40,Great beach and view of marina and ocean,"Really enjoyed the beach and great to see the boats come in and out of marina, planes flying near and not as crowded as some of the beaches to the south. Great for families and relaxation time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beaubrant
50,Pretty beach,Very placid water. Safe for kids and paddle boards. A nice place. No place to drive a car on...unlike Pismo...we watched a beautiful new Camero made a wrong turn and go in to the hubcaps. People are helpful and he was out in an hour!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/383bp
10,Beware the Sting Rays!!!!,"We hired paddle boards here (mum and 2 kids age 6 and 10) and when we went towards the water, the lady said to shuffle our feet in the water. When I looked quizzically at her she explained that there are a few small Sting Rays in the shallows .... a few?!?!? There were about 40 underneath my 10 year olds paddle board so he couldn't get off it until I had come to scare them away!. There are no signs up warning people of the dangers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H0lidayL0ver1979
50,Cold water. Great beach,As always the pacific water is cold but who cares. Beach was well groomed and well guarded. Life guards present. Shells in abundance. Water clear! Just loved it way more than venice beach craziness.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W2913LTlisas
40,Quiet/Isolated,"This is a lovely man-made beach. The further you walk from what is known as the Venice Pier, the more isolated the beach. It is quite beautiful. Aside from some planes leaving LAX in the distance, you can see the sailboats, etc. as the come out from the marina. This is not a place for people who want to be near goods and services. If so, stay near the pier or walk into older Venice Beach proper, which is crowded, noisy, but has tons of shops and restaurants. The best of the are is the Santa Moncica Pier, but again packed with tourists and things to do. If you want a nice, quite beach, then park in the lot and find yourself a private spot in an oasis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorRetired
50,Ms.,"It's a lovely beach near restaurants yet not touristy. It feels familiar, friendly. Love it. It's a great place to party or just chill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793lcs
40,"Surfing, swimming and people watching","M y husband and I were staying in the Marina Del Rey area of Los Angeles. We have visited other areas of Los Angeles, and thought ii would be fun to experience this area. We both love the beach and even though it was a bit chili to sit on the beach, there were some people who braved the water and sunbathed. We enjoyed watching all of the surfers in their wet suits and the waves were accommodating their surfing. This was a week day and so we were amazed that so many people appeared to have time to surf and sunbathe if they were nottourists. I guess you would say there were lots of ""dudes"" there. There is a long pier that you can walk on and view the beach and there are all kinds of people walking and sitting on or near the beach which constituted good people watching. It is basically clean. If you walk further along the beach you run into Venice Beach which is also interesting. We never tire of the beach so walked there every day as we were fortunate enough to have good weather. California is known for its beaches and this does not disappoint.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneW587

30,It's ok,"Eh, it's ok. Oh wait, I grew up in Hawaii.But if you *weren't* raised someplace like that, then it's a terrific beach!I agree with some of the other reviews - the off leash dog problem (at times), and the cold water (but I'm a cold water wimp).But it's a good location, and you get a decent beach experience while still being able to escape to ""civilization"" pretty quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jinzoningen
30,It's nice but beware of the dogs,"It's a nice beach. But dog owners insist on breaking the law and taking their dogs to the beach. And worst, many of them are NOT on a leash. So be careful if you have small children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S9566MTphilm
50,Fast powder sand and blue ocean paradise,"One of my favorite beaches in the world. Long expansive powdery sand. Very quiet. You are usually only one of a few people on the beach at any time.

30,"Also called Mohter's beach. Great during the week, very crazy on weekends.","This is a good beach to learn to paddle board. There are no waves so it's great for kids to swim too. On the weekend, however, the crowds can be overwhelming. There are many outdoor barbeques and they are all spewing smoke. It is quite peaceful during the week. You can always walk up off the beach and grab a bite at the Cheesecake Factory or the Beachside restaurant at the Jamaica Bay Inn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineK267
50,Soporific,"Great beach. Water can be cold. Do beware for larger fish, like sharks! Best to stay in the shallows or be with a group of surfers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/905iana
40,Beautiful on a night with full moon,We enjoyed the scenery as the sun was setting and had a full moon.

The homeless people are wondering about all day.Basic unisex toilets along the beach front but be aware that many of the toilets do not lock and the homeless people use the washing facilities to keep clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nippys
50,Great Beach spot,"Just near by the Venice beach, Marina Del Rey less crowdy mostly because of parking issues - no public parking around, only for the locals who live in the area.

50,Fantastic waves to play in.,"The beach is very large with lots of restaurants etc at the front so a good place to spend the day. A reasonable amount of parking if you need to drive. What made it for us was the waves, anything up to 6 feet and its shallow so relatively safe to play in them. Not for smaller kids but good swimmers 8 years old and up will love it.

30,Potential for Greatness?,"During our visit, we walked the entire length of Marina del Rey Beach several times from Venice Pier at Washington Avenue to the marina rock wall. It appears the beach is lined with private residences. This area is not as crowded as Venice Beach just north of the pier and provides a lot of privacy and distance between bathers. Lifeguard stands dot the beach and patrol vehicles pass by often. Avoided the public restroom next to the pier as it was pretty disgusting, lacked toilet paper, garage cans overflowing with diapers and beer cans, and looked like someone had vomited. Most of the beach was clean, white sand from the residence to where the tide came in. The tide left behind a significant amount of seaweed, small pieces of trash (bottle caps, cigarette butts, small pieces of styrofoam cups that the wind often blows away), and many tar balls which one reviewer thought was dirt. Tar balls form from oil spills. We didn't realize what they were until the difficult to remove tar was on our shoes, feet, and socks; afterward, we were very careful to step around them. The city has a beautiful beach that needs a little attention.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U9420GRpatricias

40,You won't believe you are in LA,"When people think of Marina del Rey, they think of boats and many don't even know there is a beach. I happen to live on Marina del Rey Beach and I'm so happy to have found this enclave of peace so close to the hustle and bustle of the west side.On most days, even with perfect weather, it is not crowded, especially the further you get from the pier. The sand itself is wonderfully groomed, the trash is regularly collected, it is safer than further north and is patrolled regularly by law enforcement. To me the beach is a five, but then again, I have a parking space and access to a bathroom!For visitors however, I have to give it a four. There are desperately few parking spaces other than at the pier (which fills up early on nice days and the parking rate changes based on demand). There are no showers or toilet facilities out on the peninsula which runs from the pier to the channel (where boats enter the marina) but the walk is fantastic. For obvious reasons, there are a lot of boats to be seen out on the water, plus there are several well utilized sand volleyball courts where it's entertaining to watch the competition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwalker43

Immediately upon leaving the dock, I had entered into a whole new world.

On Monday morning (at least) there is a beach Basic Training class where a dozen or more fitness trainers swing sledge hammers, run with a parachute, jump, swing ropes, etc. They really break a sweat. I could see that while having my cup of coffee on the 4th floor balcony of the Jamaica Bay Inn. Night time is peaceful and very pretty with the lights shimmering over the bay.

This was my first time at a cinema with lounge chairs that recline and a waiter/waitress bringing us our order of appetizers, dinner, desserts and drinks. This was the best time I had at the movies in a long time. The area was pretty and very enjoying. It was a little busy because it was July 4th holiday, but it was minimum. We will be visiting again real soon. The best part was no one under 21 is allowed and that is because alcohol is served and they card everyone. And I do mean everyone. There was an elderly couple in front of us and they were even carded. They were complaining, but you have to look at it as one of the rules for AMC Cinema Suites. This is cool for all adults, which means for mature adults only. One more thing they are a bit pricey, but it is worth it I think. Love the Cinema Suites in Marina Del Ray.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beautiful315
50,"Beautiful beach, harbor","Enjoyed a gorgeous sunset here and could tell that the beach was popular with families and couples. It was a wonderful experience watching children in the rolling waves, the pelicans, a few sea lions and the steady flow of walkers on the breakwater. Very nice place to sit and enjoy on a balmy evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BonnieS980
50,Stand Up PaddleBoarding,"We decided last minute to try SUP. Called Wade and luckily he was available the next morning. We had an on-shore lesson on proper paddling form, and once he felt we were ready - into the water we went. He continued to coach us as we glided around the marina and we felt very safe under his watchful eye. Wade also respects the rules of the marina and its many boaters, which I think is a plus. SUP is relaxing or a workout... whatever you're in the mood for! If you are visiting the area, you MUST call Wade and spend 2 lovely hours on the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flissyflissy
40,Good outing,"We walked across the marina and came across a lot of people walking dogs and taking a stroll with family and kids (all very friendly and courteous to each other), but what i really liked is that there's a lot off activities going on from exercise to paddle boarding to play gyms for kids, its definitely great to take the family out on a calm relaxing walk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vulcanlore

40,Great beach & off the beaten path!,"I LOVE the beaches in Marina Del Rey, Ca since there is no boardwalk there! Unlike other beaches in the L.A. Area, such as Venice or Santa Monica, the lack of boardwalk provides a gorgeous, wide, seems like private stretch of sand. It's pretty & quiet!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/puffpromotions

50,Excellent Service,"It was my first time at Marina Del Ray Ramada, and it was a great comfortable experience. Ramada never fails to maintains its excellent standard in customer service and overall hotel services. The options at breakfast was also very satisfying and pleasant. Very well presented. I definitely recommend Ramada marina Del Ray to my friends and family since the rate is very reasonable with the services provided. Also it is very close to most malls and beaches. Thanks again to the staffs at Ramada Marina Del Ray.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samitaDv
50,LOVE!,"This place is was beautiful. It was relaxing. It also had all the things you want when going away.

Go here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittaniG_12
30,Typical California beach,"Don't go looking for crowds of young girls in bikinis. Normally this area is pretty quiet and deserted except for the weekends and holidays in the summer period. If you want a quiet walk along the ocean and the possibility of seeing dolphins and sea birds, this is the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,Congested!,"I like Marina Del Rey but it is crowded in the summer and parking and traffic can be a challenge. That said, there is great shopping, nice restaurants, and a good Mother's Beach for children. FYI - I usually do not drive but ride my bike from Santa Monica on the bike path and found it to be easier and faster than driving down Ocean or Lincoln in the summer.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahB627
40,Decent beach area nearest Playa del rey (not inside MDR basin),"I've been to this beach before with my teen kids as it is convenient to El Segundo, Westchester and Playa del Rey areas without having to go farther north to Venice or South to Manhattan or Hermosa beaches. However, it's not the ""Mother's"" beach - that beach is at the end of one of the basins off Admiralty Way where they launch kayaks and small sail boats, and there is no waves at all. The Marina del Rey beach pictured is slightly south of the Sea Wall that makes up the marina's channel. There is limited parking near the beachfront area by the small public park that's in Playa del rey, or between the townhomes and condo buildings facing the ocean. There is usually an ice-cream truck that parks nearest the pedestrian walkway on the South side of the channel where it meets a small parking lot used by fisherman/others next to the sea wall. This beach has small waves (a distance from the channel itself) good for body and wake boards. There are usually shells to collect, and there's a few sand volleyball nets/courts. It's also within walking distance to local burger joints and there are a few lifeguard stands.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelmom_fun

30,"Tired, small and waveless","Not much to say. This is in a sheltered area, there are no waves and the beach is small and crowded.

But there are never any good waves there....look, when you get down to the end of washington, my advice is head north ok? this beach is south.

40,Much cleaner and less crowded than Venice Beach,"A very beautiful strip of beach that is much cleaner (less drugs, less drug addicts and homeless people) than Venice Beach.

30,Inland Cove in Marina del Rey for Kids,"This little basin beach is connected to the harbor in Marina del Rey so it is not an ocean facing beach. Looks around 8-10 acres or so, and seems to be popular for small children and their parents. Lifeguard is usually there, and there are some cafes nearby. There is a children's playground area, some volleyball nets, some beach wheelchairs for disabled. There are two large parking lots close to the beach which run $5-$7 per car per day - there is no parking by the hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoBe
50,Marina Beach Best place in LA to acclimate yourself to the sport of Stand Up Paddle Boarding.,"The calm flat water of Mother's Beach, Marina Del Rey is the best place in the Los Angeles area to learn the sport of Stand Up Paddle Boarding and kayaking, We go to Pro SUP SHOP it is located in the Jamaica Bay Inn parking lot right on the enclosed waveless beach for hassle-free stand up paddleboard and kayak rentals.

50,Old school family beach,"Perfect for family parties, lots of grills and seating, beach volleyball courts provide great displays of physique and athleticism, parking is easy if you get there early, price goes up on the weekend, marina setting equals no waves for little kids to get hurt, wonderful addition of wheelchair-accessible track from the concrete to near the water's edge. Watch out for bicyclists and skateboarders who do NOT observe the rules of the wide sidewalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrannyPottyMouth
30,"I wish I had a better title for this other than: ""Meh""","Going to keep this one short, this area is the proper Marina, it has nothing special. If you wanted to ever plot the best places and the worst, this one will most definitely be spank bang in the middle.I guess if you want to take your kids to swim in a relative safe place this would be good enough... Wouldn't recommend it to a tourist looking for something fun to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodrigoelp

30,"Great for children, people with mobility issues","This is a nice, small, and accessible beach. The protected waters of the Marina make this a nice spot for small children and those too anxious to venture into the ocean. There are a number of rentals (e.g., kayak, SUP) at this beach, so if you’re looking for something to do and don’t have your own gear, this isn’t a bad place to go. Though the water was murky compared to what you’ll find a few blocks away at Venice. There are also a lot of picnic tables and a number of paths designed specifically to cater to those with mobility challenges.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eightwednesday

30,Beach within Marina,"This is not really a beach by southern California terms. It is a sandy area for swimming, paddle boarding and kayaking within Marina Del Rey. There are no waves, however the tide is continually drifting in and out. Great place to learn to paddle board or kayak. You can paddle past boats in their slips.Not sure how clean the water is in there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/203JayB

40,Paddle board fun!,Rented from Paddle Method.We had a great time! The gentleman at paddle method was professional and helpful. Our 12 year old had a great time. We took the whole family. I would not recommend this activity for a family with small children. Plenty of stingrays near shore-,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jbalsz
40,Great Family Beach,"Going on a Sunday in mid-summer had me concerned that it would be too crowded or that we wouldn't find any parking. Both were no problem because the beach is very big and there was more than ample parking ($15 as is with any state beach).It is so much more relaxing to bring little kids to this beach vs. the ocean because there are no waves and the water starts out very shallow and only very very gradually gets deep.I was somewhat concerned about the negative water quality levels commented on but looking at a water quality site, at least for now, the water has a good grade.Check out the very cool playground area--especially the very unique ""group"" swing. You're kids will definitely be asking for more.Why 4 stars and not 5? The women's bathroom was pretty trashy ( as are most beach bathrooms ) with floors being wet with paper towels on them. I understand it's a beach and people go in wet but it looked like sanitation people had not been in there for a awhile.And second there is no food concession stand...kind of surprising for as many people as there are not to have one. The beach is supposed to go through an improvement project soon and maybe they'll add one then. A helpful hint is that there is a small market just next door to the parking lot where you can buy most any food or drink.In summary you will probably have a very pleasant visit if you do decide to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esemmoc
40,No waves and great for kids,This place is truly unique. The water is calm and the sand is soft. The playground will also help keep kids busy. Fun place to spend the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricktable
40,"A ""beach"" meant for young families","Located at the very end of a man-made marina, this is a no surf ""beach"". The tides make the water level rise and fall, but at no time is the guarded and roped and buoyed section so deep as to make a parent concerned their children are in danger. There are lifeguards during operating hours.There's plenty of sand to spread out on, as well as many BBQ grills for public use. Parking is close and inexpensive.There are plenty of food locations in the immediate vicinity, but these are more sit-down restaurants than walk-up stands. That may be a negative to some. There's an adjacent farmer's market on Saturday and free yoga classes on Sunday.You can also take kayak and paddle board lessons, as well as rent equipment, if you're already experienced, though I doubt the experienced would find much challenge at this location. Maybe it would be a good location for someone with little experience looking to hone their skill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blackie411
40,Fun,"I love it here! There are no big waves, so it's perfect for small children. There are soccer nets, volleyball nets, grills and tables, and a playground for kids. We rented a paddle board for $25/1 hr and the rental place it's right on the beach. It's the perfect place to learn paddle boarding. The place also rents kayaks. There are lifeguards there as well. Public restrooms are also available, but I didn't use them. There is parking all around, but you have to paid. We went on a Wednesday so not a lot of people were around. It's a great spot to enjoy the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rahymapadron
40,Great for smaller kids and calm kayaking/paddleboarding,"We stayed at the Jamaica Bay Inn, right no the beach w/ our boys (8, 11, 13 yrs old). The water is a little warmer here since it is shallow, there is a lifegaurd and the sand is very nice. There is a very good park that my kids played on. Volleyball nets are set up, and there are shelters w/ picnic tables and grills available. Not sure if you need a permit for them, but we saw a lot of birthday parties set up throughout the weekend. You can rent paddleboards for $25/hr right on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosalies283

20,Used to be a great place to hang,"My family lives nearby. We used to go over to Mother's and get a bite to eat from the trucks and just hang out. Now, even with all the new construction of apartments surrounding it, people still crowd there in the heat. However, it is just not the same laid-back place. The quaint vibe it had is gone.The construction is noisy and dirty. New apartments that are about five stories high will envelope it. Marina del Rey is becoming more popular as a place to live. It wants to the next Santa Monica. There is good and bad to this. Lots of positives. This is not one of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McOskie
40,Popular Family Picnic Spot,"This beach is very accessible so it's often crowded with partying families and friends who set up canopies, tents and cabanas on the sand. Competition is high for the covered patios with large tables and grills. The water is very shallow here -- perfect for little ones, except it's right on the marina, with plenty of toxic runoff likely flowing from the thousands of boats nearby. So care is warranted. Fantastic playground for little kids on the beach, beachside restaurants at Jamaica Bay and Cheesecake Factory, several parking lots, good place to stroll around the marina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManhattanAdwoman
30,Stay out of the water,"Set in a beautiful spot in the marina , and close to restaurants and plenty of parking...look or walk but avoid going in the water especially with children. It is deceptive. Looks nice but consistently gets the worst ratings for clean water.(F).The REAL beach is a 5 minute walk (right at the Venice3 Pier) ...GO THERE instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsJ6146QU

30,A little run down,"I used to frequent this place as a kid. Now I look at it and cringe. Parking is actually decent. There are a bunch of covered picnic tables with BBQs, so that s nice, but it's definitely dingy. I would not let my kid in that water - it's a busy marina with lots of boats (and I assume lots of water pollution). It's good because it's shallow water, no waves - so safer for kids than a regular beach. I just think it could use some work with cleanup and renovation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thesarahb

40,Great beach for local family with small kids,"I'll go right off the bat and say that this probably isn't a place if you're visiting out of town. There are tons of beaches short distance way that are much more famous such as Venice (known for weird people and street shows), Santa Monica (3rd street promenade and pier with rides), Manhattan (Beach volley ball), Hermosa, and Redondo to name a few.This is just a cute beach on a cove where kids can play safely. All the famous beach that were names above have one thing in common. Once you go in the water, within 15 feet, you go from feet deep in water to drowning. It gets steep fast. Mother's Beach has very gentle slope and roped area with no waves that's perfect for your little ones. It also has a playground, palm trees providing shades, and structured BBQ area. Go either really early or later in day (after lunch crowd) to grab tables. There are restaurants block away on Washinton Blvd where you can grab food, market right around the corner and Cheesecake Factory.Being in the marina, I don't know how clean the water is but Venice and Santa Monica isn't really known for clean water either. Restroom wasn't great either, but neither are restrooms in Venice and Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigBoyA77

30,Beautiful Area,"Mothers Beach is a great place to rent paddle Boards and Kayaks. However, being in the heart of the marina means the water quality can get a little nasty. You are in the middle of a marina with lots of boats that use gas/oil and have onboard bathrooms. It is illegal to dump grey water in the harbor but... It happens. We were there at low tide and there was a mixture of mud,silt and sand you had to get through walking into the water. Don't get any in your mouth! The quality of the water changes month by month depending on weather conditions and some may enjoy a great time when the tide is higher and currents are favorable. There is a playground for small children and generally a good vibe. Just around the corner are beaches (outside the marina harbor) that are cleaner but have bigger waves, so for a BBQ- Mothers Beach is awesome - but if you are into swimming go to Venice Pier or Just south of the marina break-wall for clean water fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110buzzf

40,"Great spot, avoid during weekends","We spent the week at the Marriott overlooking Mother's Beach. It was great during weekdays- water was cold (!!) but shallow and calm. During the weekend, however, it was transformed to party central. We may be out of towner's but sitting on an 'open hot box'(...) surrounded by boomboxes and footballs thrown in the air was not inviting... Further, there are benches off to the side with tables for a family meal- these were all taken up by overzealous party planners who had decked out 5 at a time (though there are signs restricting this) and left various belongings on each table to mark their territory. If you seek shade, there was literally no where to sit. So, in short, avoid during the weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/701elliee

Definitely not an ocean front beach but water nonetheless and just across from several hotels. See the map for distances. It's probably closer than you think and likely walking distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjalbertson
30,Sleepy little beach,"The water is smooth and glassy in the morning, which makes it good for SUP, rowing or kayaking. The overall consensus is that the water is very dirty. This is a waveless beach and is not a destination for bodysurfers. If you want to swim, this isn't the spot for that. A clean pool or a different beach would be better. If you want to relax away from the crowds to the South in Manhattan Beach or to the North in Venice, than this beach would work. The businesses in the area have consistently provided excellent customer service, including Phinn's Rowing and Tony P's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeaJenniTravel
30,Perfect for Young kids but not very clean water,"The beach itself is great for the little kids as it is flat and has shallow water and has a decent amount of parking so you aren't lugging beach chairs and pales and shovels to far from the car. My only real complaint and why I only rated it 3 stars is the beach is kind of dirty....not the sand or with trash but just because the water doesn't recycle and replenish easily so it's kind of scummy and green, not like the ocean. Even digging in the wet sand yielded not the cleanest of water. Despite that, my kids still enjoyed the day and they had bathrooms and food for sale and even a playground on the beach. Oh and there was always a lifeguard closely watching the kids in the water too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarisaS979

20,Disgustingly dirty,"We did not spend much time here. We were kayaking (starting from the other side of the Marina) and landed on Mother's Beach for a break. The water is REALLY dirty from all the gunk and oil in the Marina, and the sand stained with black ripples from the oil. Garbage floating around and strewn all over the beach. I am not squeamish, and am hardly a neat freak or germaphobe, but I could hardly stand to walk barefoot in the sand. It would be inconceivable to swim in such filthy water. I hear that there are stingrays that frequent the area (a plus in my book), but the water was so murky that there was no chance of seeing anything-- another reason to be careful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claratea

30,Great for young children - but this isn't your typical so cal beach,"There is a playground with shaded tables if you get there early enough, the little ones will love it and the parents love not being terrified if your child runs into the water - there are no waves. A friendly lifeguard reminded us to ""play"" within the buoys - and the kids ran into the water and ran back out again. This beach is just behind Cheesecake Factory which is nice if you want to pop in for lunch. There are a lot of picnic tables just before the parking lot - again great for people who have parties or big groups - just get there early to reserve.The only reason that I give this just an ""average"" rating is because parents will notice the murky smell and you can't help but wonder why the wet sand isn't clean. We thought maybe it's residue from the local marina boats? Or maybe the water is stagnant? Either way, enjoy a calm couple hours playing on the play structure and in the water then make sure you get a good rinse off in the shower.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineess

50,A nice stop in Marina del Rey,"I live in the Marina and spend a couple days a week there on average. Mostly I am part of a boot camp that I love which is run by the Marina Athletic Club. Craig, the owner really knows his stuff. Look him up while your there. Plus there are places to eat; Cheese Cake Factory and Beach Side Grill at the Jamaica Bay Inn. Both are very good and the views are wonderful. In the summer, take the water taxi for $1 to a number of points in the Marina. Well worth it. Family's with children frequent Mother's Beach (easy and safe place to swim) as well as dog owners, paddle borders and kayakers. There is a Farmers Market on Thursday mornings that's quite good followed by a variety of food trucks the same night. Lot's of pick nick tables to enjoy your meals or have a party which I've noticed occurring quite often, especially on the weekends.Hope you enjoy it too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackie310
50,Great Family Outing,"Mother's Beach is a great option for the entire family! Little ones can enjoy the shallow waters in the beach, have their birthday parties at the shaded areas that include barbecue grills and hooks for hamacas. There are kayaks, paddle board and mini boats for rental. A water bus can take you to other locations for $1.00. We saw many people of all ages water board standing and keeping their balance, it looked like a lot of fun and a great excercise! Bring your own food or go to one of the great restaurants around it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leyvilla3
40,great introduction to beach,Mother's Beach was a nice way to introduce my little one to beach (it was his first time). It was easy walk there with the stroller from our hotel in Marina del Rey. Other folks with kids were very nice and even shared their sand toys. Had nice lunch after at the Cheesecake Factory deck above.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crikenny
50,Great Beach for little ones,Loved the great playground and very shallow water. Great for little kids and toddlers and parents!We actually saw a group doing yoga on surfboards which looked like lots of fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorithehappycamper
50,Quiet and nice,Quiet and nice beach that is relaxing. Great restaurants all around. Has volleyball nets and a park for kids to play. Nice and quiet. If you want a party scene go to another beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bwbw12345
40,A great family beach.,"This was a great beach for the family, nothing spectacular, but most assuredly good for the keiki (little ones).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyKalihiwai
50,Great family outing.,"This was our secret beach when our now adult kids were young. Good parking, good restrooms, lots of sand, shallow water and no waves. Two hotels and the Cheesecake Factory overlook the beach but do not encroach and the children's playground is a welcome addition. This is a yacht basin beach so there is lots to see: boats, beginning sailors, paddlers on canoes and boards but no waves or surf",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barb90292
50,Great for families,Very safe gently shelving with hardly any current. Also has a good childrens play area and public bbq spots.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GraemeLancashire
50,Pretty place,"It was deserted out of season but beautiful views, clean beach and extensive family BBQ facilities, plus a children's playground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Englishladytraveller
30,Not a good place to swim best to visit midweek,"The beach (cove) is very crowed with families bbqing on the weekend, drinking, smoking etc. but midweek it's very quiet here. You don't want to swim in the water. Go to Malibu if you want to swim.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelYogi2
50,Quaint beach,"Small beach area, very clean, can people watch, watch people walking their dogs or playing volleyball.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyH978
30,"Clean, but I wouldn't sweem","We looked at the beach a couple of times, but were too afraid to swim in the water. The beach looked clean and taken care of, but because it's at the very end of the Marina, there is no flowing water. And since it is surrounded by numerous boats with people living on them, we had a suspicion that the water quality may not be the same as at the open ocean beaches. It seems to be a good place for the kayaks, small boats and such.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kalistrat
50,beach,"Wonderful, clean not crowded, great location, had so much fun!,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marsunset
30,close to hotels and marina but resident homeless too,"Convenience would be the best thing here and some water sports. Homeless live at covered picnic table area due to sun protection and free BBQs, water, shower, toilet/water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimNewtownSquare
50,Small but perfectly formed,"A beautiful family friendly beach, very sociably and great for people watching. The wall of static BBQs look great, and will definitely try those out on my next visit.This beach is a nice alternative to the larger Venice Beach, more relaxed. Lots of water sports to take advantage on too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chezza_xx
40,Nice beach,"Water is calm, great for children because it is not very deep. Although I did see adults swimming at the farthest edge of the roped area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rabbi0403
50,Very Nice beach of the marina,Perfect place for walking early in the morning. Very nice and very clean beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samfrom
40,Only was there for a morning,"Wish I spent more time there, I would have signed up for the rowing lessons or the board sailing lessons. Very pretty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/112Lee
50,Perfect for kids,Short walk from our hotel. Great play area for kids and good eateries! Family friendly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/622sarahd
50,Hidden beach gem.,Great little hidden beach in the Marina. Loved watching the little kids learning to surf and kayak as a group. Now that is what growing up in California should be like at 6 yrs old. Great littlefamily location away from the hustle and bustle but close enoughto get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/warhorse82
