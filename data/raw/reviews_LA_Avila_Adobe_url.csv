Avila Adobe is a 1970’s rebuilt replica of an 1820 home that was destroyed by an earthquake in 1971. There is a lot of interesting information on early Los Angeles and California history. The walk through took less than a half hour and showed what life was like in the 1820-40 time period. The attraction is free and worth a pass through if you are on Olvera Street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFtravelbugs
40,smallish early adobe house on Olvera street - free - good respite,"Worth a stop if you want to experience Olvera street and all its colorful noise - ditto the park across the way, often host to ethnic festivals, etc. There are other additional free museum-ettes scattered around (Fire, Italian, Chinese, Sepulveda), so you can spend an hour, two, maybe three strolling, eating, viewing. House itself arranged into 5-6 rooms - docent in front of house may or may not give you info depending on whether she's engaged in conversation with fellow park worker. Public bathroom is terrrible, and seems to be the only one in immediate vicinity. Parking on local lots is $15 (weekends) but if you will walk a block or three the meters were free on a Sunday at least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW

40,California lifestyle of the 1840s,"Avila Adobe has the distinction of being the oldest existing house in all of Los Angeles. Located on Olvera Street, it was built in 1818 by a prominent ranchero Don Francisco Jose Avila, who was alcalde or mayor of LA in 1810.Avila married Maria del Rosario Verdugo and when she died in 1822, she left him with three children to be cared for. Avila then married Maria Encarnacion Sepulveda who was only fifteen at the time. Following Avila’s death in 1832, his second wife Dona Encarnacion and her two daughters continued to live in this house.After Encarnacion passed on, the house went to her daughters and their husbands. The Avilas continued to stay here until 1868 when Francisca Avila and her husband Theodore Rimpau moved to Anaheim, California.Starting 1868 until 1920, the adobe was variously used as a rented residence, restaurant, rooming house and frequently left vacant as well.When the building deteriorated and was condemned by the City Health Department in 1928, it caught the attention of the redoubtable Christine Sterling who started a public campaign to save the adobe. In fact, Ms. Sterling who lived in the house until 1963, used to personally welcome tourists and groups of visiting school children to the adobe.Avila Adobe is now open to the public as a museum and furnished to reflect the California lifestyle of the 1840s.Right at the entrance of the adobe is the life size model of a magnificent brown stallion - did not see anyone go by without taking a selfie there!One can note the thick walls of the adobe, the cross ventilation offered by exterior doors on either side of the house, the braziers used instead of fireplaces and the floorboards laid over packed earth.Special highlights of the adobe are the Family Room, the Office, the Kitchen, the Master Bedroom, the Parlour and the Children’s Room. The courtyard is a central feature of the adobe where you can see the model of a carreta or two-wheeled cart.There are some very well presented display panels at the adobe - about the Californios and their lifestyle, about the distinctive features of adobe architecture, about the history of Avila Adobe. They make for very informative and interesting reading.Admission to the adobe is free and it is open on all days of the week between 9am and 4pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
50,An oasis in DTLA,"I visited Avila Adobe on my recent visit to DTLA and was floored by this amazing historic landmark. It was such a peaceful place, surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the city. I loved learning about life in California during the 1800s and I loved just soaking up the sun in the beautiful courtyard, thinking about all that has happened in the city between then and now. The Adobe is richly furnished and the interpreters are extremely knowledgeable. I highly recommend a visit here to anyone who loves history but also for anyone who would like to take a little time away from the noise and stress of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ebarczak
20,Avila Adobe,"When i went last year for a spanish field trip there was a lady on drugs talking to a bush in the middle of this place, tbh i was pretty sketched out after that.

50,Easy to Miss,"While tourists are roaming up and down Olvera Street looking to shop or eat, it would be easy to miss this significant historic site. First, you enter through a narrow space between buildings, looks like a service access. Go ahead and enter. It opens to a courtyard with cactus, trellis covered with grape vines, a pomegranate tree, a carreta, more, and photo ops. In the back corner is an exhibit building on the history of water to the Pueblo of Los Angeles with emphasis on the Zanja Madre, the mother ditch that carried water from the Los Angeles River to the Pueblo. You enter this oldest remaining residence in Los Angeles at the back/courtyard side to tour the three or four or five rooms. The building is adobe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,Historical Gem,Glad I visited. Almost missed it. Entrance off street is tucked in between 2 buildings. Normally I don't watch videos at these sites but the one produced here was very good. Gave me a snapshot of California history...and the important thing is that it was inclusive history - it shared the positive and negative aspects. Great to see such care for the info in the presentation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKMELove2Travel
50,Historic oldest standing house in Los Angeles,"This is a real hidden gem that can be easily lost in Olvera Street that is part of the El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Monument. Best of all, it is FREE to visit. The Avila Adobe was constructed in 1811 and constructed with sun-baked adobe bricks that are 2.5 to 3 feet thick. The house is in the third location of the original Spanish settlement of El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de Los Ángeles sobre el Río Porciúncula; the first two locations were destroyed by flooding of the Río Porciúncula (Los Angeles River). The adobe has exhibits that showed how the Avila family lived and the furniture, although not original, are typical of the time for the more affluent Spanish settlers in Southern California. Very nice displays and well worth the visit among the touristy shops along Olvera Street. It is too easy to miss and not well enough publicized. That's too bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,"An informative oasis of calm, taking you back 200 years",The guide to the house was very knowledgeable and provided a real feel for life in this house from 200 years ago.

Everything looks genuinely antique here from the furniture to the clothes. And I take the time to read mostly everything here.

We loved it all, especially the fact you made sure we could watch the video of the area together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveAlyth
50,Look out for its special treats,"Maybe Olvera Street is not that ""historic,"" but the Avila Adobe is. They have some items here which represent the culture and which you don't see anywhere else. Have you ever wondered why there are no fireplaces in adobes like this? Because they used braziers for heating, which you will see a couple of, in the main rooms. Want to see the kind of ""manton de Manila,"" or Chinese shawl, that the ladies danced the fandango in and even threw on the floor to dance on top of? There is one in the main room. They have made an attempt to exhibit the 1830s, while most adobes' furniture is from the 1890s or later. Then sit in the courtyard, and cool off, you can feel why they put the adobe on this bluff as the breeze comes up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbgal

50,My favorite part of Olvera,"This is the oldest standing house in LA. It is a classic adobe structure built during the Mexican period of Los Angeles before the US acquired California. It was used by the US Army during occupation. The Avila family was a prominent family during the Mexican period which can be seen in the house. The group providing oversight has worked to refurbish it with works of the period.It was very interesting to read how certain parts of the furnishings would have come from Mexico such as the dining room, study and master bedroom. Other rooms such as the kids would have been made locally.You can also see how the house was built for the weather of Southern California.

They permit only about 5-7 people to enter at one time because overcrowding may harm the fragile woodwork. The house is pretty much as it may have been, with a siting room, a kitchen (with wooden utensils), a prayer room, a bedroom and the children's room. A old fashioned donkey cart, remnants of stables for horses and a waterwell stationed outside the house serves as a favorite spot for tourist photography.

All in all its great I loved it and anyone who goes will too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Destination35600
