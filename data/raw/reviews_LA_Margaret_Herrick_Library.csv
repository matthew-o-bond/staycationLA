50,A very special place...if you love movies and want to research film history,"I have wanted to visit this library for years. Though the library for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was established in the 1920s, I was two years away from moving out of the area. This beautiful building, which was formerly a water treatment plant, is a stunning reuse of a resource becoming scarce in Los Angeles--that being architectural gems developers are eager to bulldoze in favor of charging the highest price per square foot they can. My best tip is before you go, read the rules that are on the website carefully. The scripts and books do not circulate...you have to review them there, and there are no cameras, pens, etc., or food allowed. You can bring a notebook and a pencil and they have lockers for everything else. I did not have time to go into the photograph archives but the lobby has a wonderful display of photographs of movie stars in their Hollywood habitat. It was great to read the scripts from American Graffiti, Sabrina, and other award-winning movies; the first draft script from AG, for instance, was a lot grittier than how the movie eventually turned out. Not all drafts are available, but to read seeing how the writing process evolved from first draft ideas to what you see on the screen is an implied lesson in ""killing your darlings."" The facility is neat, clean, and does have restrooms. There is security everywhere and they maintain respectful decorum. This is not a place for children unless they can be quiet for long lengths of time doing a quiet activity, whatever the library allows, but the lobby photos might be interesting for teens as well as reading a script from Star Wars, if they have it. The list of the scripts is on the website. I really enjoyed my visit here...libraries are great, free places to visit full of lots of treasures to view. If you are in L.A. for an extended period of time and just want some quiet downtime doing something (free) you can't do anywhere else, I recommend visiting this library.",Sabrina N
50,It's Hollywood History Nirvana,"I had waited so long to visit here having read and heard so much about this library and it's contents. You cannot call yourself an admirer of the silver screen and it's history without making a pilgrimage to this site. I cannot even begin to describe what you'll see because when I was their it's like the expression "" I died and went to heaven"". If you research, browse admire, wonder it's all there with a very willing staff to assist and make sure you put time aside because their isn't enough time in a day to see the collections, special collections, everything that is there. Hollywood is in this room so be sure to spend time here you'll be glad you did",wallyreidjr
30,For Film Buffs,"If you have ever wondered about the film industry this is the library to go to. I wouldn't recommend it if you are a tourist. The building is very nice architecturally. Upon entering you must sign in and you can't take anything with you. In the lobby, there are some photos of some of the old movie stars and filmmakers. Upstairs is where is actual library is. It appears to be a fine collection relating to the film industry. I happened to be with someone who is working on their doctorate and was there for research. Unless you are really into reading material related to Hollywood or doing a research paper, I would give this place a miss as a must see.",WorldDreamer23
