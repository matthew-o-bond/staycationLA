50,Howard Rose Garden,Just visited the Banning Museum to experience it beautiful 100 year old blooming Wisteria and garden and wasn't disappointed. If you love gardening you will enjoy the lovely Howard Rose Garden. The garden has both modern and antique roses popular the in Victorian times. Wish I could have submitted some photos from it. As they say a picture is worth a thousands words. The museum is closed for now because of the virus crisis. But you need to but it on your bucket list to visit in the near future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad27219511719
50,"A southern mansion in Wilmington, CA","This house is a must see in tandem with the Drum Barracks. The home of one of the founders of Southern California, with fingers in nearly every business, Banning built this house which his family called home until 1967. Park like grounds are all that is left of the original acreage, which included some of the land donated for the Drum Barracks. The house is furnished with many original Banning pieces,opulent and lived in. A real find! A 60 minute tour includes the barn which is set up as his stage coach office.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/531paulinek
40,Seeing a little more of LA County,"Phineas Banning came to San Pedro from the east coast in 1851 and thirteen years later he built his Greek Revival residence. It is interesting that during his time Phineas could stand on his porch and see six miles in front of him to the harbor. He is known as ""Father of Los Angeles Harbor,"" and bringing to railroad to Los Angeles. The house is filled with Victorian style furniture much from the Banning family. We took an interesting tour through the house which give a lot of insight to what living was like in that time. There is also a large barn with several stagecoaches and other forms of horse drawn transportation. This is a nice way to spend a couple hours visiting. Guided tour are Tuesday - Thursday 12:30 p.m., 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. also Saturday and Sunday 12:30 p.m., 1:30 p.m., 2:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. I was not allowed to take pictures inside the house but I could take pictures in the barn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NormKeith
50,A fascinating Slice of SoCal History,"The Banning House is an interesting slice of SoCal history. The house and facilities are well preserved and maintained and show great pride of ownership. The house itself is Greek Revival and from an architectural point of view rather plain but the history of the house if fascinating. It all sits in a park like setting. Our docent, Karen led us on a two hour time travel tour of the house and the Banning family. Did you know that Phineas Banning was the ""Father of Los Angeles Harbor""? Karen made our tour extra special with her keen knowledge, charm and eloquence. We would highly recommend the Banning House Docent Tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K2075BPmichaelr
50,Christmas open house,"My husband, our 3 year daughter and I went to the Christmas open house at the Banning musuem two years in a row. The whole property gets really decked out for the holidays. The beautiful house is decorated on the inside and outside, free tours are offered. There was a Santa Claus greeting families/taking pictures, an arts and craft station, cider/cookies station... beautiful property, great event for families with children. It's an annual event that takes place early December each year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/souseyeh
50,Cash-only donation,"The Banning Museum is a beautiful home. Guests pay a $5 donation at the visitors center. They only accept cash, but it really is a donation. I didn't have cash on me and they let me in anyway. The staff are very friendly. The Visitor Center is small but shows an informative film. The hour-long guided tour includes many rooms in the house, the old barn which houses various carriages, and the transportation gallery which is a museum in the basement detailing the expansion of Los Angeles through railroad and ocean shipping. The docent who led my tour frequently got her facts wrong but she was very friendly and enthusiastic so her confusion didn't really detract from the tour.I carried an infant and also had an almost-2-year-old. The staff doted on the kids and made me feel welcome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jscof
50,Banning House,"A beautiful house! The visitor center showed a film on the history of the family. Then I had an hour long guided tour which included the house, stable, and school room. The docents were great. Put it on your list of places to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mtnglen2gw
50,Great Early California History!,"We visited the Banning mansion/museum. You need to pay a small fee before you are given a your. The small house where you get your tickets, is a great start to familiarize yourself with the home and history. Our tour guide gave us a lot of info. There is a second floor and you need to be able to walk up the stairs. There is a ton of history. This is more then just a historical home. It is a museum, the lower part of the house has lots of artifacts, pictures and the great history about this era in Los Angeles. If you are Hispanic you will be interested to read all of the hispanic names that started all. Perhaps you are part of history and don't know it.This is great place to stop if you are in the Long Beach, Carson or San Pedro area. You can make it part of trip to other attractions. Check their website for tour info.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lxjuarez
50,1864 residence of father of San Pedro deep water port,"P T Banning was the father of the deep water port at San Pedro. This is his family residence. Docent tours of the interior feature furnishings original to the house and family history. Photos outside are permitted, but not inside. A reproduction of a Banning stagecoach and interactive transportation displays add interest. Admission to the grounds is free; tours have a fee. Street parking is available for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerrillC_12
50,private tour - I was the only visitor that day,"OK, it's out of the way - but really where else can you get a full hour plus of undivided attention from the helpful docent? Interesting to see what is essentially an east coast almost plantation style greek revival transplanted to CA. In some ways the presentation is not 'professional' (i.e. every object archived with full history, or even original to the house or family), but it's a great period piece, accessibility is good in the rooms and you see a fair amount of the second floor. Moreover it's free, but really - give the $5 suggested donation and call it a bargain. The isn't something you normally find in LA, and worth the drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
40,Los Angeles History Tour,"This house is a great example of the diverse, and often hidden, historical gems in Los Angeles. This house is in Wilmington near the port. It is a beautiful house that has be decorated for the era and even has some of the original family's furniture. The docents are very helpful. The house is in the middle of a large park. The only problem is that you can only access the house and the transportation museum on hourly tours. We waited 40 min for the house tour and then had to rush through the transportation exhibit. It would have been better if we could have seen it while waiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LNLew
40,Very enjoyable,"I enjoyed my tour today. Turned out to be just me and the docent. Beautiful old house, excellent example of Victorian design. If you are interested in LA/Southern California history you need to stop by and take the tour. Friendly staff. The tour takes about 1 1/2 hours. $5 donation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsT7320UP
50,Great tour,"Step back in time, recommend going around the Xmas holidays when the house is decorated in the Victorian area. Docents are very good, learned a lot about the port of LA. Overall it was a great history lesson. House is fully furnished as it would have been when occupied by the family. Take time to stroll around the grounds . This is a free attraction, but donations of $5 per person are requested. Free parking. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ncjc2013
50,Far exceeded my expectations; any visitor would find this interesting,"I have been living in SoCal for 30+ years, yet I learned about the Banning Residence Museum from a book I bought at AAA the day before I visited. I had a free Sunday afternoon so I decided to check out the park and museum. What a great time I had! The tour was fun, the home, barn and “school house” were interesting, and I would recommend this to both California natives and any tourist wanting to learn about a portion of American history you probably hadn’t studied in school. Banning was a force unto himself in transportation development and in making L.A. a west coast industry center. The home dates from 1863 and is one of the oldest in the area.Some tips for your consideration:(1) Admission is listed as “free” but the staff made a donation sound fairly mandatory to me. Five bucks; no worries.(2) Park on M Street, which parallels Pacific Coast Highway one block to the south, or on North Banning Boulevard. The closer you are to the park, the nicer the neighborhood.(3) Visits to the interior are by tour only so check the times on the website or call ahead.(4) If it’s a hot day don’t think there is much relief in the home; there’s no A/C in there.(5) Our tour of the home itself took about 50 minutes. We visited a dozen rooms, and along the way our docent said “I’ll take you over to [ ___ ] if you have extra time.” Say “YES” to everything! Trust me.(6) The stagecoach barn is not to be missed. Everyone said “whoa” (no pun intended) when our docent opened the door. There is an amazing collection of coaches, wagons and tools (blacksmith and wheelwright), and a row of stables as well.(7) See the “school house.” The staff is not actually sure that the tiny building was used for educating kids, but the interior is done up to resemble a little kids' school room. Quaint.(8) Have the docent take you around to the lower floor entrance where there is a fine exhibit showing the history of how the Port of Los Angeles was created. Including all of the above, I spent almost 90 minutes on the property.(9) Photography is not allowed (even without flash) anywhere inside the buildings, but it’s worth strolling the grounds to get some pics of the home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimL239
50,A Far-seeing Entrepreneur,"A most beautiful experience! The house is a Neo-Grecian design, 2 story, white with a gorgeous rose garden attached. General Banning had many interests towards the progress of California in the mid-1800's that affect us today, especially with the shipping channel at Long Beach. A worthy investment of a few dollars and a little time for the docent tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellep844
50,Phineas Banning is the man,"This museum is great! I had a great tour. The docent who guided my tour not only knew her stuff, she know how to tell a great story. Like the one of Phineas Banning, a kid from Delaware who left school at 14, traveled west, worked the docks, and built the port of LA in a swamp (!). LA is more than Beverly Hills, Rodeo Drive and Sunset Blvd. Take the time to visit the little gems in greater LA and find out what this place really is about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeM718
50,Another Overlooked Gem of a Museum,"The Banning Museum is easy to overlook in a city full of attractions, yet often, the overlooked museums are among the best as far as value and experience. A City of Los Angeles managed facility, The Banning Museum is located in Wilmington just down the road from the Drum Barracks Civil War Museum. Time your visit right and spend part of your day at these two museums. Currently, the Banning Museum offers guided tours at select times Tuesday-Thursday and Saturday and Sunday.Phineas Banning is one of the fathers of modern Los Angeles. It was his vision (and greed) that lead to a stagecoach line into the city and finally the dredging of San Pedro Harbor to create a vast site for ships to dock and unload. In the mid 1860's Banning had his Greek Revival Mansion built on a vast estate. Visitors can tour two floors on this fine building and enjoy authentic Banning memorabilia and other pieces from the period. The guided tour takes visitors from room to room and to the outside stables. Banning was from Delaware so his home was an homage to the sensibilities of the East Coast. The Banning Museum is a refreshing and fascinating respite from the crowded and routine attractions that dot Los Angeles. Residents and visitors alike should not miss this true gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackbear
