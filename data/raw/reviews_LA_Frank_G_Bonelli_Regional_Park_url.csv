40,Great Oak Trees,We were driving along Old Route 66 in San Dimas and saw the sign for a park. It was time to stop with our 1 year old and let him have a swing. We had just come from Mt. Baldy seeing the snow. The park is very nice this time of year. It has many old oak trees and some nice kids areas including that swing. In the summer it seems that a family cookout is possible with many grills that can be reserved.,Mitchel N
40,A nice place to walk or bike,"I prefer to walk on the east side of the lake (more natural). You can walk all the way around the lake on a trail, not recommended if it is over 80 degrees out, because there is not a lot of shade. But otherwise a good walk and pretty level. I wouldnt walk the isolated trails alone. My dog loves it but there are sometimes off-leash dogs so be careful and don't bring an aggressive dog on the walking pathc (please). There are lots of trails for mountain bike riding. Also paved roads for road bicycles. Very close and convenient. I prefer the park in winter, early in the morning, or weekdays, when Raging Waters with its traffic and noise, is closed.The park gets VERY busy on holidays and summer weekends. And the paved trails and roads are not crowded with people.They also rent layaks, paddleboards and bicycles in summertime.",Wanderer764993
50,East Shore RV Park,"This is a wonderful campground on the east side of Frank G Bonelli Park.On the west Raging Waters. With plenty of picnic,playgrounds,and hiking and bicycling trails.",Liesl B
40,Great Lakeside Picnics and Hikes,"I love to visit the lake and hike. I‚Äôve seen so many amazing creatures on my walks. The picnic areas are nice and play areas for the children are always in use. You can hike all the way around the lake and even out to Brackett Airport. There is a boat launch, a swim area, and multiple areas to picnic. I would recommend you wear insect repellent because there are mosquitos. The bike/hike trails are well defined and there are maps available.",susanjB8213RE

50,A Very Good Local Park & Reservoir,"Even though this park was not far from residence, I just recently discovered how nice it is. The park opens at sunrise and closes after dark at 9 pm. The entrance fee was very reasonable, and seniors are half priced during weekdays. It has ample picnic areas, hiking trails and very clean restrooms. The best part for me is the Puddingstone Reservoir. The lake offers boating and lots area for shore fishing. So far, I have tried bass fishing there 3 times but still have not catch anything. I saw other fishermen caught small blue gills. I still enjoyed my trips very much because of the ambience of the park. I will come back and try other offerings of the park, such as hiking and boating.",Francis P

50,Great place for dog walking!,"I'm always surprised by this hidden gem. It's peaceful, well-maintained, with a variety of activities going on. There's bike trails, hiking, fishing, playgrounds (several), room for soccer and frisbee and croquet. Lots of tables, barbeques, bird watching, boating. Annual pass available.",Usgrad2020
50,Super Park,"A huge beautiful park for kids, pets, walkers, runners, gatherings, reunions, picnics and whatever. No alcoholic beverages are permitted on the property altho many people bring coolers full of it. We have had many family gatherings here and always had a good time. No fee's to park or use the facilities. My only concern is that there are usually a few 'odd' ones that wander the grounds and I wouldn't recommend letting your children out of your visual site, or let them go to the restrooms alone. Farther up the road and past the park a bit, there are hiking trails that are very interesting. Just be sure to wear shoes that cover your feet (no sandals) and long pants because there are snakes and nasty looking spiders. We recommend this location.",Ninee
50,Taking a walk with our dogs,"Beautiful Park the Reservoir was picture perfect, sad thing is that it's you can't eat the fish üêü. Signs posted. But to just go boating üõ∂ is still fun take hikes is has a lot still going on. I hope they find someway to clean it up. We will be back just because.",desending

50,So much to do here,"Parking is free during certain months (non-peak). But most of the time, we park at the lot right next to the freeway entrance and make our way down on foot.It's great to lay a blanket on the green grass and just picnic with the family. You can watch people jetskiing or boating. Sometimes we take our bikes and just ride around for fun.Bonelli Park also hosts so many 5k/10k/ marathons, as it's such a huge place that people rent out parts of it all year round.",pomeranianlovah

Should check it out, don't have to drive 3hours",Ryan A
40,Very good birding site,We always visit the Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park for birdwatching. It does not disappoint as there will always be birds to be seen around the lake. The park is well managed with good trails but the birds can already be seen on the grounds and on the edge of the lake. Nice park and easy birding.,Cynthia K
40,puddingstone,"I love the name of this reservoir. It conjures up smooth rocks and lapping waves. It is a wonderful park and recreation area near Kellogg Hill. In our family the development of Bonnelli Park was integrally connected to the Via Verde project my father managed, so we saw it under construction. Still a favorite place.",Mike K
50,great place for the family/groups,"Came here by chance because I had a couple of hours to kill before dinner. Brought our 20 month old daughter here, while originally looking for a park to go to. My daughter loved all the different playgrounds and was eager to go feed the ducks. Admission was free for us because we came on a weekday non holiday, otherwise it is $10 per car. We were surprised with how large the park was and look forward to spending weekends especially in the summer going to the lake beach and coming back when she is older to stay at the RV section and go camping.",Christine W
