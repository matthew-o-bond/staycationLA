40,Unbelievable,I went to hear the Santa Monica Symphony and my first time to this Temple. What a building: so awsome and you feel like you are back hundreds of years. Wonderful architecture. The symphony playing inside was just a grand music experience.It is the oldest Synagogue in Los Angeles and has lots of history,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73helenew
