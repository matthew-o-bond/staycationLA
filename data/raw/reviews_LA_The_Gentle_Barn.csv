50,It is shocking that anyone would write a bad review for any reason for such an amazing and unique place!,"The people at the Gentle Barn are absolutely amazing and they are an example for the rest of the world of how to treat animals.I would take my kids to the Gentle Barn at any age and on any day, and when we had to stand in line, I would explain to them that we are NOT at a zoo where animals have been put there against their will and live miserable lives, but on the contrary, we're privileged to be at a sanctuary, where horribly abused animals or animals on their way to slaughter were saved and have had their dignity restored.I am also always honored to pay the ""hefty fee"" knowing that this money is wisely used to care for the existing animal residents but also to rescue many more. I always make my kids aware that there are so few places like this on this planet, even though there needs to be one for every farmed and abused animal and that we are so lucky to be able to set foot in such a haven. It's actually their favorite place. Any kid who is made to be the witness of what goes on at the Gentle Barn becomes such a better human being in the process! I really believe it changes them for the much better by making them more conscious and exposed to true kindness to the most dejected.Thank you to everyone at the Gentle Barn, including donors, who make this animal haven possible and who allow the public the privilege to spend time in this unique and beautiful place.",Anna
10,Not a place for children,"After standing in a long line and paying a fairly hefty compulsory entry donation, we were ushered into a small crowded place to wait for another good 30 minuets. Then we had to listen to the rules and sponsors talk before we were even let in to walk around. After nearly two hours of standing still waiting the kids were a bit unimpressed. All there is once you get in is a small number of farm animals to give a pat. This is probably a great place if you are a hard core vegan and want to rub shoulders with likeminded. I would not recommend it to anyone else.",Alice B
50,Amazing and Moving,This was one of the greatest experiences I have ever had. They do good work here and the animals are awesome. Where else can you get a kiss from a llama named King?,sinbear22
50,Fabulous Gentle Thanksgiving! ‚ù§üíö,"Went there for their Thanksgiving to celebrate living. I love having been a long time supporter snd so very thrilled to finally visit with them. To visit with & meet many Friends both Animal & Human. The evening, atmosphere & meal were spectacular but just one thing had hoped the 'drum ceremony had been of an authentic Indigenous nature. Love being Vegan & so honored being a part of this great Sanctuary as we are full of love & the love of educating & caring for Animals, People & our Earth. Being Vegan together is the only way to heal our Earth, stop global warming, stop mass killings of Ocean & land wildlife, domestic Animals, too!! It was such a priviledge meeting Ellie & to share in that common goal to love, heal & continue developing the most delicious, healthiest, most humane lifestyles, ever!! Thank you GB, Ellie, & all the Volunteers. God Bless, love & hugs!! ‚ù§‚ù§üòÜ",KarenVBrown
40,"Busy Sunday, crowded.","I enjoyed visiting The Gentle Barn, hugging a turkey or grooming a cow is not something I get to do very often. The animals all have had abuse or neglect from previous owners or were used as performers and hearing from the staff and volunteers about their previous lives was interesting. It is amazing how very gentle the animals are considering what some of them have been through. We went on a Sunday and it was quite crowded, kind of disappointed because we couldn't really hear the talk by one of the owners because there were not seats left. I will go on a weekday next time! We brought our grandson with us and he really enjoyed seeing all the farm animals too.",krisred2363
30,Fee to enter,"We heard so much about this place from the Ellen Show. We stopped by, filled out volunteer applications, and explored the grounds. The mission of the Gentle Barn is admirable. Note there is an admission fee. We were never contacted about volunteering opportunities",GSI
50,Wonderful for animal lovers,"Excellent facility, staffed by caring volunteers, A unique experience.Many rescued animals, given a second chance for a happy life. Very educational.",HappySurfer
40,Humbling!,This place is a great place to visit with kids. It's like a petting zoo with heart. The animals are rescued from either farmers which can't take care of them anymore or other smaller organizations. The staff are friendly and the majority are there volunteering their own time. Because they care about the animals. Each animal has a story and you can really think and reflect on them. They have all sorts of farm animals. It's a neat place to go with your partner or significant other.,julioaguilar225
50,Best.Birthday.Ever,"My daughter and I traveled to The Gentle Barn for my 55th birthday on July 1, 2018. It was amazing! After you get through the line, you go in and listen to Ellie, the founder of The Gentle Barn (or one of her staff) explain it's inception and what it's all about. Then you can walk around and visit all the animals. We got to hold chickens, sit with goats, pet Ferdinand the Bull, and sit in the stall with the big pig! We also went into the stall and saw the humungous cows. When you go through the horse stalls each individual volunteer knows the history and the story of each horse; they are truly bonded with their horse. The relationship each volunteer has with the animals is truly touching.I should also mention that I wore a ""Happy Birthday"" tiara and every single person who worked at the Gentle Barn wished me a happy birthday.They do serve lunch and drinks; we couldn't eat there because there Fieldroast burgers and hotdogs are not gluten free and we have to eat gluten free.They also have a cute little gift store where we bought T-shirts, key chains, and coffee mugs.If you ever get a chance to go to the Gentle Barn I highly recommend it. They also have one in Missouri and Tennessee. Check their website for days and times they are open since they are limited times.",Kris H
50,The Gentle Barn,Anybody who is interested in being kind to animals and living a plant based life should go here. And if you are still consuming animals please go here and see first hand that animals have feelings and emotions just like us humans. What a wonderful place.,Bellarainbow
50,Everyone has a story to tell,"This is a very special place to visit. Every animal has their own volunteer or staff member to tell the story of the animal's rescue. They ask for $10 donation for kids and $20 for adults for admission into the barn. Theres a place to get water and snacks and a little barn to buy souvenirs. It's not that far from I5 (about 20 minutes or so East) You can bring your own snacks etc but everything has to be plant based. It was a hot day so most of the animals were in stalls or barns which was nice and convenient. The staff are very informative, friendly, and helpful. It took less than an hour and a half to see the animals and mingle with them. It probably would've taken longer if they were let out to their pastures. If u are in the Santa Clarita area I would definitely recommend visiting!!!",Heather A
50,Loooooove this place and so do my kids,"What a wonderful experience here. My kids loved just being near such amazing animals. The staff is friendly and the place really takes care of their newly lucky animals. Many have very sad stories, but the ending is wonderful. Kudos, and SUPPORT them. I whole heartedly recommend the Gentle Barn.",sportspup
50,Have Tissues Ready,"The Gentle Barn in Santa Clarita completely surpassed my expectations. As a vegan, I figured I would enjoy it... but once I got there it really took my breath away. They often call me Ice Princess back home, and perhaps it was the extreme heat of Santa Clarita, but it was so moving to hear the stories of the animals, from Big Ben to Patience. The way the hosts tell the story is superb. There is also a wide variety of animals present- cows, goats, sheep, donkey, horses, chickens, pigs, and more. I also enjoyed the small shop so I could get a treat to take back home.",Laurel E
50,Fun times with some cool animals,"I visited to Gentle Barn with my daughter and her class on a school field trip and everyone loved it. Not only did the students learn about their different rescued animals and how to care for them, but they also were able to interact by petting and feeding them. The Gentle Barn staff were mostly pretty nice and were patient and clearly communicated with the students. Overall, it was a great trip that left a lasting impression on everyone who attended.",DrewmanG
50,So much fun,Went here with my kiddos last weekend and we had a blast. We were able to brush and hugs cows. It was incredibly educational and a moving day. We will be back for sure!,Jennifer W
50,Have you hugged a cow today,"This is there motto I took photos with my other camera so I don't have photos. It is well worth the visit. To my knowledge you need reservations. We went with a Girl Scout group. They are a rescue group and ask that if you are bringing lunch to please bring a plant based lunch. They sell vegan hotdogs there also. It can get very warm so bring a hat,water,and closed toe shoes. My daughter was on crutches and the staff is very accommodating.",waller1234
50,OMGOSH the cutest!,"LOVED this place! Took a tour on a Sunday, it consisted of a short talk by one of the volunteers about the Gentle Barn and how it came to be. We then were free to go roam around the farm and visit the animals. You even get to brush and hug the cows, hug the pigs, feed the donkeys & horses! Each animal had a volunteer with him/her to answer questions, read the animals body language to gauge how it was feeling and to monitor people‚Äôs interactions with the animal. I thought this was awesome, not only to talk about each animal, but for the safety and comfort for the all.You really feel a connection after hearing their stories. Most of them came from abusive / neglected situations and it‚Äôs heartbreaking, but also comforting to know they are now safe forever. There‚Äôs a cute little gift store on the premises ( I bought the cutest stuffed cow and GB Chico bag), and food stand/picnic area. The vegan sausages they had were amazing ‚Äì all kinds of fun toppings to put on them too.I would highly recommend this place, it‚Äôs great for kids to learn how to respect and love the animals too!",pisalisa
50,For animal lovers,Visited here for the first time. They are organized & professional. Well run sanctuary for 150 animals. Visitors can interact with the animals. Many volunteers on site to monitor. Staff makes brief presentation - very informative. Great for kids & adults.,CAK
50,Terrific,"An animal rescue with pigs, cows, horses, sheep, goats, turkeys, chickens, and even a peacock and an emu. So many of these animals had sad beginnings but are getting happy ends. They're treated like one treats a beloved pet -- if you're lucky, you might even catch an animal's birthday party (complete with singing and ""cake""!). Vegan snacks and hot dogs available, too. Surely great for kids, or the kid at heart who loves animals.",kjibdug9845
50,Wonderful for young children!,My grandson was three at the time and absolutely loved it! They get to feed carrots to the horses and comb the cows with brushes. It's also a lesson in charity as they take in animals that need a home who may be crippled or old.,Catherine P
50,Pet a Cow,Only open on the weekends. Lots of animals you can get up close and personal with. These are rescued animals that are taken very good care of. The children love being here and the animals love it too. I know the Ellen show gives donations to this cause!,Janmaweber
50,Therapy Farm,"Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area. Cost of tour is donation based. Everyone that works this farm is a volunteer. Our friend's son is studying to be a vet & has volunteered here all through high school. These animals have been rescued from various situations. Their stories will tug at your heart strings. And while your there you'll receive a bit of therapy yourself. Great for adults, kids & elderly.",espiri2
50,Must visit for animal lovers,"My wife is a fan of the Gentle Barn on social media so I decided to surprise here with a VIP tour on her birthday. What a great visit it turned out to be. We went in June and it was HOT. Be sure to bring plenty of water if you visit in the summer. The animals didn't seem to mind too much though, and they were why we were there. The cows are so sweet and gentle. The horses and donkeys can be a bit demanding for their carrots, but the sheep goats and pigs were all very friendly.The staff obviously has a great passion for caring for the animals, and helped really make the visit educational as well.",Brian B
40,Expected more,"The place is divided in 3 zones for visitors. Cows, horses and the barn with goats, chickens, pigs etc. Basically it is enough 10 mins to feed horses another 10 to brush cows and you have to follow special introduction and entrance to the barn where another 20 mins is enough.",AlexanderKorablev
40,wonderful place to get up and close to the farm animals,"This was a fun experience seeing the cows, horses and other animals at the Gentle Barn. These are great people who take care of these animals...lots of fun with the kids!",Tracyandjjtravels
50,Restores Some Faith In Humanity,"More than an attraction, it made me leave wanting to be a better person. Beautifully run, done for the best reasons and a wonderful presentation by the owner and founder, it's something that deserves patronage and awareness. Easy to get to, friendly and concerned staff. This is NOT a petting zoo. Not sure little kids should be allowed as I know they want kids to understand at a young age, but the lesser monitored kids frighten the animals. Pay attention to the knowledgable staff as each animal has a story. I can't say enough about this place and what they are doing. Please support them.",BHS85
50,"Face your ""food""","What an amazing place to connect with the animals. My hope is that when people pet Buttercup or any of the other sweet animals, they'll think twice when they make food choices. Great job on this beautiful place!",Vicki W
50,Great local theater,"For those who enjoy live theater, it's right here in Santa Clarita. For less than the cost of a movie ticket you can not only support our local talent, but see terrific musicals and plays right here on Main Street. No need to travel to LA. The enthusiasm and energy will blow you away. I've been a season subscriber for about ten years, and have loved every minute.",Harriet B
50,BEST FIELD TRIP EVER!!!!!!!!,"My first grade students loved it! Brushing and hugging the cows was a big hit. Feeding carrots to the horses was very exciting. They loved petting turkeys, pigs, goats, and sheep. Being able to look into the eyes of an animal they've never seen really made an emotional connection. I loved hearing the kids ask an animal "" Can I pet you?"" and then seeing them respect if the animal walked away. The staff was warm and kind. I really appreciated the way they openly addressed each issue the rescued animals had in kid- friendly and honest answers. A trip of a lifetime! Well worth the drive and donation.",formerlocal
50,A magical place!,"We are huge lover of animals especially abused ones! This is our second trip from Ohio to The Gentle Barn and it won't be our last! What Ellie & Jay and their staff and volunteers do for these animals will make your heart smile! ( logo ogle their website, see the back stories of each animal and see how lucky they are to have found love and their forever home!)",Steve B
50,Enlightening Family Visit.,A great place to visit and learn. They treat the animals with the respect they deserve and are readily available to share each animals story. Many of those stories can make you really think about things we tend not to have on our mind every day but really should.,EAPiscool
50,An amazing place and must see for any animal lover,"""It's hard to have a bad day after you've hugged a cow"". My mood always improves after visiting the Gentle Barn. Hugging cows, petting goats, feeding horses and giving pigs tummy rubs is my kind of day. If you want to meet some amazing animals (and pretty great humans too) I would recommend a visit. Oh and they have some pretty tasty veggie dogs too.",Nicole D
40,A nice getaway from the city and a great message,"We drove here from LA one Sunday morning in July. This was an interesting visit. As an animal lover, I appreciate TGB's mission and feel that they accomplish it well. They have rescued so many animals, exposed us to them and then gently suggested we might want to consider a ""plant based"" diet. It is a subtle and not overbearing message. After spending time with all these animals you might normally eat for dinner, how could you think otherwise?As others have mentioned, it can get really warm here and it also has the tendency to get you dirty, even inadvertently. Most everywhere you walk is dirt ground and there is animal poop everywhere, but it is their home we are walking through! Old sneakers and clothes you don't care about getting dirty would be a great suggestion.The volunteers are wonderful. They know every animal's back story and are willing to tell you that and how that animal likes to be approached (rub behind the ears, pat on the back, etc.) or if they don't want to be approached at all. They are well trained to deal with the public.Parents need to look after their children though. Too many kids were tormenting the animals, despite the warnings and gentle suggestions not to. One kid got bit by the peacock, but having witnessed the whole encounter, I thought he deserved it, no sympathy for the kid. I wouldn't take little kids here if I couldn't control them and ensure that they would be respectful to the animals.This is a wonderful concept and it seems well run. We'll return the next time we're in the area to check up on our Gentle Barn friends!",amybatt
50,Wonderful,"This is a wonderful place you get up close to farm animals.....brush the cows, feed treats to the horses, sit with the turkeys, pet the pigs and sheep. It is open on Sudays or by appointment. Great place to bring the family and even enjoy a vegan lunch. Cost is around $10.00. Quite a few people volunteer here on a regular basis...I loved volunteering here when we lived nearby!",Cherie P
50,Wonderful place,"Wonderful place to take the family. They are only open to the public on Sundays. You can brush the cows, sit with the turkeys, pet the pigs, feed horses...it is truly a remarkable place with a great mission. It is $10 per person donation. They actually do a little presentation where they explain the origins of the gentle barn before you go into the main section. There are a lot of volunteers and they will make sure all the animals have enough space and don't feel bombarded by visitors.While we absolutely love this place, just a note of caution we took our 7 month old in a baby carrier because we were meeting friends. They asked us for $30 at the gate ($10 for the three of us), I asked nicely if I really needed to pay for my 7 month old and they gave me a snarky response of ""why wouldn't you"". While I don't mind the donation part, I didn't appreciate the attitude. So just as a warning, you will be asked to pay for each person going in.",lj1234
50,A great place for all ages with a great purpose,"General overview:Cost $10Wait time to enter: approx. 20 min.Open: Sundays onlyOverall time to visit: 1 - 2 hoursParking: dirtAccess: Easy to find / freeway access close bySmall port-a-potty bathrooms and hand wash stationSmall gift shop, very limited food and drink avail. for purchase.Can be very hot in summerI had the pleasure of visiting the Gentle Barn a couple weeks ago and was SO glad that I did. I highly recommend this place for any age animal lover.Cost to enter is $10, I gladly donated a little more. I believe all the staff working that day were volunteers so I didn't mind the 5 - 10 minute wait to pay to enter even though there was only one group of 3 ahead of me.The young girl who took my money and stamped my hand was nice and friendly and I'm sure she doesn't do this all day every day so be patient and courteous. They have a shade cover over the area so you're not waiting in the sun. After I paid I had to wait another 10 minutes or so before they gave us a brief explanation of where we could go and when so overall about 20 min wait. This is the only thing I think they could improve upon. You can see the donkeys and cows from where they have you wait, you just can't pet them or anything. To prevent people from overcrowding one area they divide it between the lower and upper barn areas. They stamp your hand and the color of your stamp corresponds with what time you can enter the upper area. So they let you into the lower area first, then inform you to go to the upper area (very short walk but steep steps, maybe 20? and loose dirt with potholes) about 5 minutes before it's time where they have everyone gather together on the hillside under EZ-ups, with backless low benches (almost all the seats were taken when I was there, I could see it getting overfilled and having to stand or being difficult for elderly people) while the owner gave a quick 5-10 min. speech about the Gentle Barn, how to interact with the animals and how easy a vegan diet can be. FYI - They do not allow meat products on the property out of respect for the animals. This seems to be the Gentle Barns biggest message, respect animals as they have feelings too. If you're looking or a farm, go elsewhere. All the animals here are rescued from horrid situations and will live the rest of their lives here loved and treated as a family member and not as a commodity or luxury.I had about 40 minutes to explore the lower area before it was my time to go to the upper. In the lower area they had 3 donkeys, a half dozen or so horses and 3 or 4 full grown cows. They allow you to go into the stall with the cows to pet, hug and brush them. The cows are very gentle but if you have young ones make sure to watch them closely and to keep them away from the cows back legs as they may kick. Everyone immediately ran to the cow area so I wandered off to see the donkeys who were very friendly. They are in a large arena / corral so if they don't come to the fence you're out of luck as far as petting them.They sell carrots and apples for you to feed to the different animals which will lure them over, not sure of the cost but I think it was around $2. The horses are in smaller stalls in a covered, open walled barn so they are easier to access. The cows are all in a big stall/ corral together but one of the less friendly cows was in her own smaller pen within the area and couldn't be petted. All the other cows are super friendly and I could tell everyone really enjoyed petting and brushing them. (No one offered me a brush but they were most likely all being used by kids and it was pretty obvious I didn't care about getting my hands dirty.) Speaking of dirt, this is not the place to if you want your kid to stay spotless or are worried about germs, etc. For those who have never had the chance to pet a horse or cow, even though they may look shiny and soft your hands will get VERY dirty once you pet them and there is a oil-like residue that clings the dirt to your hands. It's part of the experience and they have hand wash stations, it doesn't bother me but might surprise some.After listening to the owner's speech, which I highly enjoyed and think most others did too as she did a good job of engaging the children without it being too childish for childless adults such as myself, we were allowed access to the upper barn where they house pigs, sheep, goats (Nubian's and others I can't name but no pygmy's) chickens, turkeys, an emu and llamas (which were not available to pet). Again, watch your children as I saw several take off running (unacceptable) only to immediately fall down because the ground is uneven and perfect to trip on. I had on my motorcycle boots and almost twisted my ankle a few times myself. There is also a small pond / watering area for the animals that I saw kids trying to go into. If you don't want to watch your children or they are not well behaved DO NOT bring them here. The volunteers job is to make life nice for the animals not to worry about irresponsible kids and you sign a waiver when you go in saying if you get hurt it's on you, not them.All the volunteers were very nice, some more knowledgeable than others. I had a great conversation about the goats with a young girl who was there volunteering on her 10th birthday - she was more helpful and friendly than most people I deal with who get paid to do a job, and when she wasn't sure about the answer she gave me to one of the questions I asked she went and got the correct information for me without me doing a thing! Man, I was impressed. Obviously this place is a good influence on children as this one had more manners and intelligence than all the kids I've had contact with this month.As I was leaving I noticed two port-a-potty restrooms and a hand wash station, I didn't use them. I peeked into the gift shop which had some coffee mugs, t-shirts, photos and other small items. I didn't notice prices as I wanted a shot glass but they didn't have any. There is a little food cart that sells limited items, I think I saw chips, water and juice. They cook veggie hot dogs (I saw beer bratwurst on a sign and didn't know it was veggie or I might have tried one as they smelt great.) There are several picnic tables and you can bring snacks/lunch as long as there's no meat. I also saw them selling some type of squeeze tube peanut butter type stuff but I think you were supposed to take it home to eat it. The eating area is shaded and nice, in the lower area between the horse barn and the cow pen. I noticed no ""farm"" smell that might make eating there unappetizing. The volunteers were very good about keeping everything clean and tidy and picking up after the animals immediately if they defecated.Beware, it gets very hot here in summer.A terrific place, highly recommend to all ages over 2yrs.",CaptainKimball
50,What an experience!,It was my birthday present from my husband to visit The Gentle Barn after a couple years of reading about it online. We were fortunate to meet the founder and her husband as well as very friendly staff. The work that is done there is truly a miracle on so many levels. go and visit and make a donation!,cks3
50,great place to connect with animals,"I brought my kids here a few years ago to see the horses, cows and other farm animals and fell I love with the place myself. They work very hard to keep the place clean and welcoming. The animals are healthy, well loved and taken care of. I know this because after that first visit I signed up as a volunteer and started helping out several mornings a week. It has been amazing to witness rescued animals go from being malnourished, neglected and shy to the incredibly healthy, social and happy animals they are today.I have seen kids faces light up when they learn how to feed carrots to the horses , or brush a cow, but adults enjoy the outing as much as the kids!",Kristy B
50,Wonderful experience!,"If you are in the area, you should visit The Gentle Barn. The owners and volunteer staff have done a wonderful job in taking care of the rescued animals - cows, pigs, horses, llamas, turkeys, chickens, donkeys. You get to hug a cow, feed the horses, pet the turkey. Listening to how the animals were rescued and what they have endured to get to their healing state was nice to hear. It is only open to the public on Sundays. Picnic tables are available if you decide to bring food in. The $10 donation per person was well worth it.",skamikirn
40,"Nice short outing, builds compassion.","I like the work they do to save abused animals and then have foster and troubled youth come spend time relating. A healing experience for abused and neglected children. As a tour it's fine and I like supporting the organization, however I felt the staff really pushes the vegan agenda. Also know that on a really hot day, it is really hot there!",Laura R
50,Great Experience,"If you are an animal lover, and/or vegan / vegetarian this is a must do if you are anywhere within driving distance to get to a The Gentle Barn. Hug a cow, horse or even a 600 pound pig. There are sometimes special events there do check out their website or a Facebook page in advance. There weren't any special activities when I visited , and it was still a wonderful learning experience.",NativeNewYorker1212
50,wonderful!,The Barn is a wonderful place. I have just finished Ellie's book and it was so inspirational. I wish every animal had a Gentle Barn to live in. I live on the east coast but I am going back to visit very soon.,Cindy W
50,Outdoor Fun,Great place to escape and feel like you far away from Home! Depending on the time of the year activity are great.,Henri B
40,"Sweet animals and great way to rehabilitate them, but some should cut the phony sentimentality","It was really rewarding to feel like you are contributing to the well being of a saved animal, and so many of them were so nice. However, some of the staff were kind of pretentious and suggested that if you were to eat meat, that it is inhumane. Some farms treat their livestock with respect and should be acknowledged by those in the animal rights movement.But, mostly everyone here was very nice and pretty knowledgeable. It was interesting to hear about some of their stories and the daily animal politics that happens on the farm.They suggest a donation at the door, but the guy with the clipboard was somewhat intimidating. They also sell refreshments and vegan food. I would come again but would stay away from some of the negative volunteers that are there.",Jesse S
30,Nice place needs more hands on things to do.,Nice place took to long to get in .The man collecting donations was busy visiting with other regulars while we waited in100 degree heat for over 10 minutes . There were only 4 peoe ahed of us.the rest of the Staff was very friendly. They need more things to do . There are only 3 areas to visit and the upper area you can only visit after the owner speaks so if you arrive at 1005 am you cannot go to the upper part u till after 11 am Presentation . So we had to wait 25 minutes to see the upper part. They do very good work there for the animals. Just need more hands on. Maybe feeding the goats milk would be fun.,Katherinerrop
50,Connect with your inner bean!,"A very special place that everyone can enjoy. It's an accessible, welcoming and loving place where the rescue is not just animals living there, but for all the urban dwellers who visit.",glutton4food
50,Great chance to support a great cause.,"The Gentle Barn gives visitors a chance to view many different types of farm animals while contributing to a great cause. The animals have all been rescued and are now well cared for by dedicated volunteers. Just know, if you intend to read the signs with the history of the various residents, bring plenty of tissues.",HappyHiker20
40,EVERYONE NEEDS A LITTLE FARM TIME!,"The Gentle Barn is located north of the busy city of Los Angeles and is a real change of place for city dwellers who rarely, if ever, have contact with farm animals. The Gentle Barn is real treat for any child or adult who craves a change from the big city.The Gentle Barn takes in abused and neglected farm animals that have no hope for a future. The Gentle Barn becomes their home and their future as their bodies and souls are rehabilitated.The facility was smaller than I expected but in a pleasant and peaceful location. There were 3 cows in one part and several horses and a donkey in the stable area.Bags of carrots are sold for $2 each allowing visitors to interact with eager horses looking for a treat. The lower area has a port o'potties. a small gift shop and a small snack kiosk that sells vegan treats and water and juices (no sodas since they are promoting healthy living).At the assigned time, visitors can access the upper barn with smaller animals. Our group today enjoyed a brief but informative lecture by the founder. She was living her dream but rehabilitating and giving lives to farm animals with no hope. Visitors were encouraged to hug and touch the animals but to also respect the animals who want their space.We were told that the Gentle Barn has 170 animals but my guess is about 60 were available to visitors. Think of the upper barn area as a very large petting zoo with pigs, goats, lamas, turkeys, and chickens. Except for the lamas, here is collection of typical farm areas.The Gentle Barn encourages a plant based diet and kindness to our animals friends. It is open Sundays from 10-2 and there is a donation of $10 per person. It should be noted that people with mobility problems might find the climb to the upper barn and lecture area a bit difficult and requiring extra time a care.The Gentle Barn is lovely idea in a beautiful setting. Although it is easily accessible near the freeway, it is a bit of a distance from Los Angeles and probably not a ""must see"" for out of town tourists. The joy of The Gentle Barn is for locals who need some farm time and a change to experience the simple pleasures of life.",Jackbear
50,"Sometimes, You Just Need to Cuddle a Pig!","The Gentle Barn is one of my favorite Los Angeles area discoveries in 2012. It is an organization that takes in abused and neglected farm animals and gives them a place to live out their life that is filled with love and respect.The barn is open to the public on Sundays 10-2pm for a suggested ten dollar donation. It's worth every penny and then some. The barn is broken into three areas, one for cows, one for horses and a third, a little walk a hill, has the rest of the animals including chickens, llamas and goats.The volunteers are the best. They are welcoming and happy to answer questions about the animals or tell you the best way to interact with them. Some of the animals only like to be touched a certain way or not at all and there is a huge level of respect that the volunteers help maintain when interacting with the animals. Most of the animals are eager for gentle pettings and interacting. I had Bella the goat follow me around on our Sunday visit, she kept nudging me for more pets.One of the residents is a huge standout, Biscuit, the 1000 pound pig! He's enormous and happy to be hugged and cuddled. We also fell in love with Caesar, a gorgeous grey horse and Buttercup. the sweetest cow.Make sure to spend two dollars for carrots to feed the horses and have some yummy vegan treats. We had a vegan gingerbread cupcake that was delicious!Please check out my blog for an extended review and loads of pictures.",Karen H
50,A little bit of heaven for city kids,"Every animal in here has a sad, sad story, but the Weiners reversed their plight and gave them a new chance on life. Kids can touch, carress and hug the poor creatures and many children have probably seen a real live chicken for the first time. What a wonderful experience for all.Thank you",Josef L
50,Happy Hippies,Beautiful people helping beautiful animals. Perfect for kids who live in the city and have little contact with farm animals.,bradgatepark
50,Amazing place,"Gentle Barn is a very very special place. They are doing amazing work rescuing and loving farm animals. Living in ""the city"" most of my life - this was the first opportunity I've had to be up close and personal to a cow, turkey, llama, goat, sheep and pig! I was completely in awe at many of the stories behind each animal and have a profound respect for the work they are doing to make a true difference in this world, by saving and loving one animal at a time. And to offer this to the public on Sunday's is a special way to share their blessings. Highly recommend for 2-102 years old!",melissa r
40,These Are Good People Doing Good Things For Abused Animals,"I do NOT like smelling animals. I am a city girl, and the smell of manure is not something I would ever seek out. That being said, we were invited to a birthday party at The Gentle Barn earlier this month, and my son really wanted to go.I'm glad he insisted, because we had a wonderful time. Yes it was stinky, but the staff was so kind and patient with the kids (mostly under 5 years old) and made the party a great experience for everyone.The kids got to brush and hug the cows, play with the chickens and pigs (but not the llamas - they don't really spit at people, but they are shy), and feed carrots to the horses. All the kids had a great time.When we came home, I went on the website to learn more about the animals. Every animal at The Gentle Barn had been abused or abandoned by its previous owner, and rescued by the good people at The Gentle Barn. The stories were heartbreaking, and I want to sponsor one of the animals so that it will be able to live a happy life at The Gentle Barn!",BostonSummerGirl
50,Great place to take the family,"The gentle barn is a rescue barn for abused or negelected animals. It is fully hands on so when you go there, you can pet the horses, interact with the cows and pigs and more. There is food available for purchase for both you to eat and to feed to the animals. The petting zoo is a great place to just let your children interact with the animals.",unathan1
