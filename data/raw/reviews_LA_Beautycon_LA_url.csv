40,Fun if you go VIP Route,"My first BeautyCon. Had the VIP ticket, so I had a shorter line to get in as well as a lounge and private restroom. Huge! Wear comfy shoes and be ready to take a lot of selfies! Have an Instagram account or you won’t be able to get free products from the booths! Be ready to wait in long lines. If you buy a higher end ticket, you can get in two hours earlier and beat some of lines. Went for two days and still didn’t get a chance to visit every booth. Food was crazy expensive-$15 for chicken strip...I had a great time, but this event is for the hard core beauty lover. Not a good place for kids or babies in strollers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryleonilda
