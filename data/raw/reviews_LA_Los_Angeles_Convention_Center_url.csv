40,Location and Upgrades,Attend conventions in LA on an annual basis and the building is definitely central to LA with many things around. Could use an upgrade as it seems old but the staff is very helpful and the conventions are well organized.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IzzyZ12345
50,Well organised dream space...,"I came along to the LA Convention Center not for my usual habit of following the global democratic movement around the world; but for the annual LA Auto Show which can trace its history back to 1907. The LACC first opened its doors to the public in 1971 and in the mind of most people its the place where we got to hear the greats like Bill Clinton speak for humanity. It’s also admittedly a great place to host a car show. What is even more great is to see the number of production and concept vehicles moving away from the use of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels not only result in an archaic product but they are communist additives and a form of private taxation which deny me the right to have a vehicle which is supremely space-age, fusion energy, powering itself. I love the Ford Mustang. I always have. I rented a Mustang in Los Angeles because to me it is the only way to see California. I love everything about the shape of the Mustang, the driving position, the ease with which it drives. I was saddened to see that the new hybrid Mustang looks more like a mini version of the Porsche Cayenne. For some reason it seems Ford don’t want to see the Mustang survive in a zero carbon world. Moving forward: the LA Motor Show is going to become a more beautiful and exciting event to attend. See it for yourself: it’s worth every dime of the $15 entry fee. An inspiring event in an inspiring space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jassimalkanani
50,Great Auto Show,"Was here on a Friday for the 2019 car show. The Center is a great place for this. It is large enough so that you don't work into each other (as with smaller auto shows) and yet still doable in one day that you can see everything. Also nice that there are several great restaurants nearby that you can take a break from the show, sit down and have a great meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Panglosian

40,AlienCon LA 2019,2019 venue for AlienCon LA. Nice large rooms-we didn’t miss any lectures due to lack of space which made the event even more awesome. Rooms were a bit cold. Large space for vendors. Food was awe full and overpriced. Very convenient to public transportation. Was perfect for this event.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicenurse1
40,Great location for a convention,"I was here with about 10,000 other people for the government finance officers association convention. The convention center location was very convenient to several hotels and many restaurants. The Staple Center and the Microsoft Theater were next-door in the LA area and everything was within easy walking distance.Inside the convention center there was lots of natural lighting and easy to navigate for the most part. This convention center was pretty standard to add a convention centers that I have been to in previous years however this center did not feel crowded even though there were several thousand people in attendance.There is a good cafeteria area with a good selection of food and seating in addition to several vending machines throughout the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdvtrTrvlr
10,Not a good Convention Center: disappointing!,"This is NOT a good Convention Center, as Convention Centers go. Poorly designed, not super clean, but, most importantly, it is nickel and dime type of place, they charge for everything, including basic human rights fur free Internet and free clean water. First time I see Internet charge $12.95 for basic Internet service. Bottled water:$5.50, check bag for a day $10. Pure racket: ridiculous! The staff is not quite friendly and nice.

30,Mobile World Congress Americas,"Attended the MWCA in September, it was a little frustrating that we had to walk through metal detectors but that has become the thing of today! The center is clean and quite nice! I definitely got my exercise. The one thing I didn't like was trying to walk through the food area where there were lots of people and there was a blocked walkway either way you tried to walk. The food in the café needs some improvement. It was difficult to find any real healthy or non fried foods. I suggest some more options that are not fried. Other than that it is your normal convention center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sun-in-Alaska
30,Sprawling!,"You'd expect that Los Angels would have a big convention center but I can't say a lot of great things about the overall design. Something of a ""U"" shape straddling Pico Blvd., large conferences that occupy the entire facility will involve a lot of walking in between the two main halls, which are separated by a long concourse area. The 10-15 minutes between conference sessions won't leave much time to either grab a cup of coffee or relieve yourself from one. Otherwise, it's a good facility. The food concessions are better than average and a vending machine at the south end of the concourse features fresh fresh sandwiches from an adjacent deli. (Very useful when you're on the run between sessions.)One other note, the employees of the companies that provide the hall's support services (the folks that are there to give directions, check bags, etc.) are all extraordinarily competent and friendly. I'm talking best in the nation and I'm from Portland, Oregon where people pride themselves in these things. This is a place where you can get hopelessly lost, but you can always expect to get pointed in the right direction by someone with a smile and a kind word or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricgportland
50,Modern Convention Center for Many Types of Shows,"We recently attended the Mobile World Congress - Americas in the Los Angeles, CA Convention Center. Its a modern, vast, and nice convention center that can host from small to very very large. It has many different venue opportunities. While in the modern upscale part of downtown Los Angeles, CA it abuts Watts and the area around USC. There is an eclectic mix of things to do, places to eat and good and re-developing areas. In just a few blocks, you can go from ultra modern to historic. Its an interesting mix. I found the Convention Center a good place for meetings, though expensive for lodging in nearby hotels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rbstrategist2018

I could not believe that they, the convention center officials, could allow such a disorganized mess. This year, 2018, they fixed the mess and I was pleased with how they pulled off the event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YLtraveler
40,Huge capacity for conventions; beware locked doors,"We attended a 5,300 person convention on the hottest days of July. The interior is vast and partly connected by walkways, although all meeting rooms were large with good acoustics. Tip for attendees: for our event every door facing north or west was locked, with no signs to help pedestrians. The unlocked (south) entrances were an extra 4-tenths of a mile from any of the north side of the Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arcee_CO

40,Great Place for Conventions,"I've been attending convention at the LACC every year since 2011. Some times up to 3 conventions a year from Anime Expo to Siggraph.The convention center design is really made out to handle large crowds, but it is up to each event organizer on how lines, entrance and exit points are implemented during an event.Also, each event organizer can dedicate extra eating and sit down locations by adding table and chairs, something that decreases to allocate more space for vendors each year with event's attendance increasing.When done right, entering and exiting the convention center can be done in an efficient and timely manner.The convention center does lack outside shading for lines. This has become a problem during inclement weather as lines can take a while as security procedures change every year.All in all, the LACC can provide enough air conditioning for the entire structure on the hottest of days in Los Angeles. It also has staging areas for food trucks to provide food alternatives to attendees in addition to the two cafeterias located inside the convention center.I hope the expansion proposal gets approved as this venue could really use the extra space and corridors to connect it to the L.A. Live location off of Olympic and Figueroa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juve_GLC
40,Big and wear comfortable shoes,"There is a south hall and west hall at the center. It's a huge place, especially getting from one side to the other. I suggest that you wear comfortable shoes as it can be quite a work out walking around inside. The signs are clear .But what I found interesting is rooms starting with a 3, 4 or 5 (south side) are all on the same level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OregonTraveler9999

30,Great collection of cars but very little INFORMATION,"We parked across the street at a $10 lot which later in the morning became $15. Saw a wonderful variety of vintage and classic cars, etc., and luckily I went with someone who was knowledgeable about cars, which I recommend you do, if you are not knowledgeable yourself. Very few cars had information on a plaque in front of them, and hardly any had an owner or sponsor nearby. It would have been great to read about the cars' specs, and any interesting history. I can't understande why an owner who has put so much work and money into making a car look beautiful, would not at least type a page of information and have it showing at the front of the car. We wandered around admiring the cars, but for me, a lot was missing -. INFORMATION. These cars were works of art. Not just the specs so an uninformed viewer would know more about it, but the history of the car's origin, anything interesting about the owners, would have really added to the experience. .Therefore, only 3 stars from me. Food was $10 for an individual pizza, and for a coffee and scone $6.50. The price you pay for not eating beforehand, but not too bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V3855POhelena
50,Not A Bad Seat In the House,"My son in I are in LA for NBA All Star weekend and went to 2 event at the convention center. We had general admission tickets and wasn't really sure what to expect with the seating. We were pleasantly surprised that there wasn't a bad seat in the house. We sat in the upper bleachers and had a great view. The one piece of feedback I can give is that the bleachers weren't wide enough. If you sat with you butt on the bleacher, then your knees were in the person's back in front of you. If you sat back, then the person behind you had their knees in your back. It was odd. But overall, I'd see any event in this space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KendraDawnRN

40,Rupaul's Drag Con,I visited this venue for a convention for one my favourite television shows back in 2017. Upon arrival the exterior and interior was very clean. The toilets were kept in good condition considering how busy it was.The only issue we had was the knowledge of the staff that worked there as they were unable to advise where the queue would be as we had paid extra for a queue jump. Good selection of food available (Need more seating areas when it is busy). I will be returning to this venue as it was a positive experience. P.S (Wear good shoes/trainers as there is a lot of walking to do),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlevans15
50,Surprisingly good place to see a show,"I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this complex. Parking is on site and plentiful, the light gets inside the building easily so you can just use a kit lens, it was never too hot or too cold, and a lot of the rooms are carpeted for on your feet all day comfort. It isn't perfect, its way too close to the L.A. ghetto for my taste and the food sold inside, while good, was way overpriced. Still, all together, if you're going here it will be a nice time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darioprime
30,Excellent events- very high priced parking.,"I went to the LA Art Show this time. Super excellent event. Definitely recommend to go whenever they have an event. The parking is very expensive. Almost as much as the event. Not an attraction. Wished the LA Art Show would pick another convention center, like how about Pasadena Convention Center with plenty of low cost and free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PilotMichael
40,Very Very Large,"I attended my first ever car show and L.A. Car show here and it was definitely a treat. I would highly recommend wearing comfy walking shoes as the convention centre itself is huge and they spread out the car exhibits. Would also highly suggest you remember where you parked as you can go in one way, leave another, and be completely turned around, so make mental markers of your streets and buildings around you if you are not a local or familiar with the area. There are also a lot of restaurants in the area and very short walking distance, so if you are heading there for an event there are a variety of food options very close by. And if you are fine with a short walk and want to save on parking I would suggest you simply find a lot in the area for cheaper parking, which there are many.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BexyTravels

Parking prices are insane and there is not enough handicapped parking, I actually wonder how they get away with that. Now, moving on.The Center is clean, safe, there is security where you need it, the place is super pretty and the grounds are great. Get there early and just walk around for a bit. It really is nice.The staff knows everything, where am I going? They know. They will take you to the room if you look really confused.They have some nice food areas, and you can grab a meal right there.When you need a break from the crowd or the event, you can step outside and have some peace and quiet.I was very much impressed with the staff.

50,Awe inspiring,The actual convention rooms themselves were not necessarily anything to marvel at. Nice size I suppose.

10,Incompetent Events Crew,"If you're producing any kind of event at the LA Convention Center, be prepared to get help from management on absolutely EVERYTHING.Crew could not run FOH sound properly, every other wireless mic had a dead battery, thus guests were pantomiming half the time. The time to give a mic a fresh battery is BEFORE the guests get on stage.Crew could not turn on proper lights until ASKED repeatedly.Crew could not run video switcher, and did not bother running it properly when ASKED repeatedly.Crew did not set up camera risers properly, thus camera risers felt like and worked like a kiddie bounce house...even normal breathing made the cameras shake...A LOT.The ONLY thing they got right was setting up the chairs, and I think they might have had to consult a manual for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ntsc1984

There was only one woman cutting the roast beef and she was so incredibly slow. The line was piling up and it was taking forever. I, thankfully, was toward the front of the ""rush"" but it still took forever me to me to get my plate. At times there were two cashiers and still this one woman cutting the meat.

Well organized with good signage and carpeted floors and stress mats for our aching feet, we were appreciative of the organization and the planning that went into this venue.The only two downsides to this place was the food selection was limited and expensive at the vending; indeed, it was cold by the time we reached the counter from the long service lines...secondly, after we broke down our displays, we discovered someone ""took/stolen"" the remotes for our display, so we highly recommend that you DO NOT leave your equipment unattended at anytime...The best part of this convention, the ease of transportation from our downtown hotel to the LA Convention site, A shared ride on Uber/Lyft only costs $2.99!

30,"Wow this place is big, bring your walking shoes","Attended a conference his and really liked the convention areas but some of the rooms are located a good 10-15 minute walk away. But the place is clean and well lit, but the layout is very very long corridors. Wish they had free wifi also",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tfizzle
40,A multi-purpose exhibit center,"We visited this place while the LA Car Show is ongoing. The place has displays of luxury cars as well as common cars, Maserati, Porsche, Toyota, Hyundai...a lot more... The reception and security people were courteous. The temperature inside was comfortable. Parking is not a problem. This place is also a short walking distance to STAPLES Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanRocqueRaltique
50,L.A. Car Show was fantastic,"Got a chance to explore most of the buildings of this sprawling, mega center. All are connected and do not involve having to leave the friendly confines. Parked across the street for $10 at surface lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyB_Htown
30,L A Auto Show,Been able to visit the LA AUTO Show many times in recent years. The displays from different Auto Makers are breath taking and really bring out the local car lovers. They have a way of motivating you to think about purchasing the latest model. Wonderful chance to touch and get a feel for the next best technology. The food and drink prices are getting higher each year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertrR7802SS
30,Large venue... lacking beverages,"I had to leave my conference early one day due to dehydration. The restaurant and coffee shop was closed, the water/pop machine would not take anything but cards (which I didn't have) and the water fountains were just a trickle. There isn't even anywhere close to buy anything. Other than that the facility is clean, lots of rooms, a little confusing at times but doesn't take much work to figure out where things are. Really.. during a conference... please put water in rooms!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarileesTravels
50,Exceptional Guest Services,"I recently attended the convention center for a marketing event. Unfortunately, I lost my wallet while in Los Angeles and found out only when I returned home to NYC that my wallet was at the convention.Fortunately for me, the manager Sean from guest services located my wallet and shipped it back to me. I was very happy with the service and convenience provided by Sean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristinaW2385

40,Clean huge area,"Parking is $20 which isn't bad. We went for LA's comic con. It drew 90,000 people so I can't really complain about the long cafeteria lines upstairs. They also had food trucks outside. Many bathrooms which is a plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAMARALAPIP
40,"Nice, big, and clean venue!","My friends and I attended Wonder-Con 2016 here and had a blast! Not quite as nice as the Anaheim Convention Centre, but it's still a well maintained, spacious building in a decent area close to public transit. We took the Metro each day from Hollywood and it took about a half hour. It's also at a good good location close to different restaurants and shopping. All in all, I would happily attend another event here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/supermanatee

30,Good to see this area improving,"Time was the LACC was in a scary part of LA. It's good to see the continuing positive development of this area with LA Live now well established and construction moving forward.As a convention center the LACC is somewhat sprawling but it seems to work. Parking is okay. Food options are , as usual in these places, limited but not awful. Access is now good with public transportation now viable.This facility seems to be underutilized. It seemed mostly empty when I was there for a convention which seemed to be the only event happening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0591TimS
50,Great for Gift Shows,Have been to the L.A. Convention Center several times in the past for Gift Shows held during the year.There is a lovely entrance and much to see around the outside areas.

50,Great convention site,In town for the National Association of Letter Carriers National Convention. I was so pleased with the professionalism and service provided by the guest services manager....Sean Najarro.I lost my iPhone in one of the clean restrooms of the convention hall. As you can imagine I was more than beside myself. The manner in which the convention center coordinated lost and found along with the personal way Mr. Najarro dealt with my unfortunate situation made me very happy. He personally brought my iPhone to one of my classes within hours of losing it.The convention hall was a 10 out 10 in all services from cleanliness to security which made my week of attended this event a pleasant and enjoyable experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indio911
40,"Attended Carpenters Rally, great meeting place!","We attended the Carpenters contract rally here and I was pleasantly surprised at how well run the convention center is. Signs easily directed you to your meeting place and attendants were very helpful. Restrooms were kept very clean and the large hall we were in was of adequate size for the event. One tip before going would be to make sure you know which hall your event is in as there are a few. Overall, great place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
40,Spacious and clean. Great for the Beauty con,"Location was conveniently close to the tram station. Spacious. Had to do a long line, but the staff was able to accommodate it within air conditioned area. Security check was quick and effective allowing the long line to vanish quickly. Inside it was spacious and clean. With enough space for out 2yo to have a nap. Good variety of food and drinks with reasonable prices. Looking forward for the next convention to attend at this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P2284CVjosep

40,Amazing place for an Anime Expo,"I have never been to a convention that attracts over 100,000 like minded/Amime people. This convention center almost got it right, it is close to the Metro and had the foresight to have many food trucks in the parking lot out front to feed that many people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZ85603

30,Just okay - nothing special,"The L.A. Convention Center is showing its age. It smells musty and old (some rooms worse than others).While the lighting in the exterior hallways is nice, with lots of windows and glass ceilings, the lighting in all the meeting rooms is quite low, resulting in a depressing ambiance - not something desirable for a professional conference. I don't know if this is something they can adjust for your meetings, or not.The food provided during my conference was okay - nothing special, but nothing awful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcarr
50,Rupal Drag Con 2016,The Rupal Drag Con was awesome. It was our first time going to a drag convention. We only went for 1 day but next year we are definitely going for the entire weekend. There is so much to see that you really do need 2 days to see everything and to get to meet all the queens. The opening night show was fantastic. It is adult show and not for kids. The convention on Saturday and Sunday is family friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bttrflycoons
10,Terrible for an event like WonderCon,"My family visited here for WonderCon 2016. This place was massive, and spread out. It could not accommodate the shear size of WonderCon. Check in was horrible, we were made to feel like cattle from the ushers/security staff in blue shirts. Have crowd up in space to the line to go to the checkin volunteers. They had no answers when asked a question, and had attitude and were rude in their comments.Then we had to walk a quarter of a mile away to get to the exhibition hall.There is a lack of any seating in the place, people who wanted to stop relax a minute had to sit along the wall on the floor.The food prices were horrible; $4 for a bottle of water, $16 for a corn dog, chips and a drink. This is a 400% to 500% markup. I've never seen an arena or convention center that has more than a 200% to 300% markup.ATMs were plentiful, but $5.95 to withdraw, plus paying your own bank or card fee, which averages $3.00 per transaction, puts it above $8 to withdraw money. That's ridiculous and price gouging. I don't care if it's a contract they have with was apparently ""The ATM Guy"" company, that's price gouging.I will never go to another event at this place again, EVER!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KneeManFamily
40,Wonder Con,Arrived in LA for a comic book convention. The building is very nice. The grounds are well maintained. It made for good pictures. The event is for 3 days. Its a great place for this kind of event.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tcard2013

30,Huge!,"Huge place! I ended up being here in LA for a trade show so naturally it would be here. The place is quite large with many halls and ample parking (to my understanding it was really expensive).I think the reception areas are way bigger than they should be, that made everything look way emptier than it truly was. Not sure what is the case for other shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luiscX4398ZK
40,Good convention venue,"Went here for a convention for work, will say they have a very good setup.

50,Excellent guest services experience.,"Few weeks ago I visited LA convention center. The overall experience was very good. After I came home, the following day I realized that I lost my expensive jacket. I looked everywhere and my last hope was to call the convention center and check with them if by any chance they are holding it in their lost and found. To be honest I had no hope to find it but decided to check. I left a message with the guest services. To my surprise I received a call from Sean Najarro to call back with more information about my last jacket. He was very professional by verifying all the details about the item I lost and after checking their lost and found area confirmed that they have my jacket. He emailed me detailed instructions as to where to go to pick it up. I am still amazed how organized that huge convention center is to find and to release the lost item. Thank you again!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarinaShakhbazyan

The next day, I got a call from the them(security office) and Sean told me they found my daughter's phone.

50,"Big, but Easy to Get Around ...","Actually it's Bigger than just Big, with multiple exhibition halls for conventions. Was at the LA Auto Show and found that navigating the various Halls was easy. Entrance ticketing was simple and then you're inside - stay on ground floor, go up or go down, there's something going on everywhere inside. Multiple food courts w main one near entrance. Easy to get there via Metro Rail, off at Pico station and 5 minute walk - simple, or you could drive & park. Well designed & modernistic facility. You'll enjoy! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,This place is crazy big!,"This Convention Center is huge and if holding a large event, like the LA Auto Show, expect to spend the entire day here. Parking is expensive at $20 but really close to the venue. They have several food and drink options at the Convention Center so you will not go hungry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockNCreekGirl
30,Large venue slightly out of date but clean,"I had to spend a few days in this center (during the afternoon) for a conference last month. I stayed at a nearby hotel, so location wise this was perfect. I was able to walk from my hotel to the Convention Center daily. The first time I went to the Convention Center - I had to struggle to figure out where the entrance was. There was no signage. I asked some strangers who finally told me. Even then, I had to walk around parking/crowd barriers to get to the staircase that leads to the entrance. The inside is big and serves its purpose - but it is outdated a good bit. I think this venue is okay for seminars and conferences but not for a formal occasion or banquet. Perhaps with significant decor...? As is definitely not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GypsySoulSC
50,Outstanding customer service,"I attended Tony Robins, UPW and inadvertently left my event book at the venue. A kind gentleman turned it in to Customer Service. When I realized I had left it behind the following day, I called lost and found. Within a couple of days my call was returned by Janae, Manager who quickly helped me with getting the book shipped to me. I emailed her the shipping shipping label, she confirmed receipt, emailed me when she shipped it out, and asked that I let her know when I received it. I now have my book and I appreciate Janae's support throughout the entire process.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/analiliazaragoza

Glad I went, one thing that was hard to understand is that the actors were asking $20 for their signature. WOW and no picture taking unless you pay. Well I was a little disappointed but keep on looking so much to see. MOVIE cars back to the future, blues brothes, and Others. So much can't write it all down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/desending

50,Beautiful facility with well-run events.,We come every year for the Adobe conference. This is the best run event I have ever been too. There is staff everywhere ready to answer questions and direct traffic. There food service is fantastic. Great food and well organized so that you never have to wait in line too long. Everything is where you expect it and easy to get too. The inside is designed nicely too I don't see that at too many convention centers. They're usually pretty plain and boring. I love coming here! Bravo to the team running the show!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaraingram

40,Easy to navigate and great service,"The Los Angeles Convention Center is an awesome place to hold business venue. I was here several times for business, but one that stands out the most was when they held ""E3!"" I was amazed how well they executed since this was THE SHOW, E3 literally, took over the whole complex from South to West to all concourse.Kudos to all the staff who works here for taking great care of everyone. Excellent service!! Woot-woot!!Parking here is easy, and depending on the location of your venue, you can park either at the South or West Hall garage. Main dinning areas are located on both halls. The West Halls however, offer a larger variety of food selections.Until then, Cheers! ~ :p",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwin_sfbay

We did have one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at, The Kawada Hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ou812b4me
40,Spacious,"We attended a large event (estimated attendance over 80,000) here and thought the facilities were more than adequate to handle the amount of people.I highly recommend parking in the main convention center lot as it is connected to the convention center itself and will save a lot of time compared to parking in adjacent open lots that might be a few bucks cheaper.As for the negatives; the food options within the convention center are pretty lacking and unfortunately there isn't much within walking distance either. Also, some carriers (e.g. T-Mobile) will pretty much not work inside the large halls but that may be a compound issue with being inside as well as being in close quarters with so many people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raymondw892
20,Terrible place for a convention,If you have a chose of where to go for a convention do not go here. The building is huge with no way finding.

40,Exciting convention center,"We spent 3 full days at the Los Angeles Convention Center and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. We were attending the Girls Volleyball Junior National Qualifier.

Did my citizenship ceremony here and I was surprised to heard that that building could hold 3800 people guest excluded. Good parking lot, the view is amazing and the environment is clean. More so the security system is very tight and the workers are very happy to help. Goodluck",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Queencrez
30,Inefficient check-in process,"I was here for the IHRSA conference. The check-in process was really bad, it took over half an hour and pre-registration didn't seem to speed things along at all. I don't know if this is different for different events, but I was surprised at how slowly the lines moved. Once that was done the venue was pretty standard; it's not a huge place but nice enough. Parking at the facility is pretty good once you find it. As with most convention centers, there's decent food there but it's outrageously expensive. If you can come and go without paying twice, I'd definitely leave for lunch and then come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EEpotter

40,Comfortable and Convenient,"Some convention centers are so big and so badly laid out that it is impossible to find your way around easily.

30,"Coma,coma,coma,cama-comicon, it's so fun!","I have been here three times throughout the years, and was able to bring my 10 year old this year (hold your horses, yes, I get the cray cray)....he's a huge Stan Lee fan and I warned him about what he might see....Listen, you see far more on billboards in France (does France have billboards?), and aside from his initial surprise about the size of some of the women's accoutrements (ahem), he was blown away by the crowd. The costumes, the insanity. It wasn't as nuts as San Diego's gets, but it was crowded and there were tons of people there in RARE FORM. We took over 200 pictures and he talked/questioned each and every artist who would give him the time of day (we were there til close, if that gives you any idea). Not really my cup of tea, but I had a blast watching him and watching the crowd. The Convention Center is very nice, but I have so say that I wish it was a bit more ""organized"" and properly labeled for events like these. It's easy to get lost, it's easy to return to where you were, and it's exhausting to search for the one thing you really want to see and not be able to find it. Overall though, it was fun!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBWillsy
30,Auto show,"This is a great space for the exhibitors since there is plenty of space. For those attending, not so much. Parking is incredibly confusing and overpriced or your park faaaar away.

Getting to meet artists and actors that I've long admired was fun and they genuinely seemed to enjoy it too. Parking was not bad this year which was a pleasant surprise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/48leed
30,Right Hand Left Hand,Went there for a show as an exhibitor and they closed the parking so we had no visitors to our show! They apologized but that does not fix the financial loss. There is so much going on in the area with the Staples Center that it is a mess there all the time and traffic when those events let out is terrible. The close the street off frequently too so getting about is a real pain. Avoid having events at the center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snowwhiteMilan
30,SWE Conference Great...food...bad,"I was recently at the LA convention Center for the SWE Conference. The conference was great, but the food at the Center was extremely slow.

It would have been way easier with box lunches for everyone; just grab and go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tippy1971
30,Worked Nicely,"The convention center worked well for the National SWE conference this past week but I do have to say, the fact that we had ""Food Cards"" was the worst thing possible. The lines in the cafeteria were so long people left to eat instead and the food was horrendous. If they work looking to make money off of the Society, they succeeded as barely anyone ate there nor used all of their moeny on the food card.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fernwehcmb
50,Plan extra time for your visit,"We went here for the Rock N Roll Half Marathon Health and Wellness Expo. The convention center is well marked and can easily house several events.Plan extra time if parking, as both the garage and convention center may require quite a bit of walking, depending on your destination. If you do park, check the closing time for that day, and walk around the area to check out all of the area's restaurants and destinations. We paid for parking and ended up walking around the area and check out the surrounding parts while having the car parked in one convenient place at a $15 flat-fee rate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LV_Lee

40,LA Times Travel Show,"We came here on a Saturday morning for the Los Angeles Times Travel show and found parking across the street for $10.00 instead of $15.00 at the convention center.There were multiple events happening simultaneously such as the LA Jewelry and Art show and a dental expo. The complex is huge so bring comfortable shoes to walk the convention floor especially if it is an all day event. The facility is clean and they keep the bathrooms well maintained.There is a food court including a Starbucks. However, we brought our own lunch inside since I read earlier reviews that food at the convention center can be expensive. Instead of purchasing lunch, we spent our money for a relaxing dinner somewhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliLAgirl

30,"Large, but clean","I was recently at the California Gift Show for the bi-annual display of wholesale gift items for the trade. As usual, it only took up a portion of the South Hall and below it, Kentia Hall.It was difficult to get parking directly adjacent to the halls themselves. There is a huge parking structure across the street and part of the complex itself. There is a lot of walking to get to the entrance of the convention center from that parking location. Parking was under $15 for the day for this event, and registered buyers were reimbursed by the private company that runs the Gift Show.Food availability by the convention center was sparse and quite expensive. They would modify a few selections, but charged the entire price. For example, if I got just the meat patty of the hamburger combination , they insisted on fully charging me for the fries and hamburger sandwich. I could not pay for just the patty, nor a sandwich without fries. $10 no matter what.The bathrooms were clean and supplies did not run out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dance4fun2

50,Beautiful convention center!,"I came to the convention center for the Idea World Fitness Convention 2013. I had read some reviews that had me concerned that the parking was going to be difficult and upwards of $20/25 a day, that the staff weren't going to be friendly, and that food was going to be nothing but long lines for limited unhealthy items, such as hot dogs. We stayed at a hotel in Pasadena, and on day one took the subways to get to the convention. Navigating the metro system wasn't as easy as we'd hoped, and we were shocked to see plenty of parking close by for just $10 a day. For the remaining days, we drove in, no problem. The convention staff were very friendly. The place is huge and beautiful...and they had plenty of healthy options for food, at least for our conference. I was pleasantly impressed with everything about it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheric1
50,Great Expo/Con Venue,"Easy to get to, (parking $$$ way too much) and many times the entrance fees are also $$$ too much, but always an awesome venue with a whole lot of stuff!! Such a large area, and always well organized, clean, and nicely done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnF148

In Downtown of LA next to the Staples center, near the espn bar, and a bunch of other eateries (including one by Wolfgang Puck) Nice location and the area is not too busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElleQ_31
50,Choice Hotels Annual Convention,"This was an excellent venue for the Choice Hotels Annual Convention! The space is HUGE and very accommodating to such a large group of people. The meeting rooms were great. It was a lot of walking, but that's expected for such a large convention!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerrickN207
30,"OK, little small, catered food was dull","I attended the Adobe Conference in May of 2013. The convention center is dated, small, and not very well organized. The food was bland, flavorless and gross. If you attend the Seminar, the make sure to take advantage of the grab and go snack in the morning and the breaks during the morning/afternoon. Convention Center has very large foyers, but the rooms and halls are really tiny. Bathrooms are sparce, not that clean. Location is good, close to LA Live.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hershey_dog_idaho

50,Art Show @ Los Angeles Convention Center,"Downtown LA and particularly LA Live is a great place to spend a weekend. There is entertainment for any taste: music concerts, sport events and various expos.The LA Convention Center is a huge and beautiful architectural wonder used for exhibits. It is a nice and clean facility with very well organized events. This time I attended The Art Show there and it is unlike many other art shows that are strictly for contemporary works. At The Art Show you will find works of most any artist: Shagall, Van Gogh, Renoir, Monet, Dali, Picasso, Miro, Rockwell, fine prints, pop art, contemporary works presented by galleries from all around the world. Bring a friend and you can easily spend the whole day observing great art, talking with gallery presenters and even have your picture taken with the artists themselves. There are food and wine vendors with sit-down areas for you to rest and reflect. It is very inspirational and I highly recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tatianng
40,huge. great place for expos,this past sunday was my first time at the convention center. The place is huge. I attended a womens expo. There were so many vendors and performances going on inside. I am excited for next year. great location literally right off the freeway and tons of parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toshinacrockett
50,Huge and beautiful!!,This is one great piece of architecture right there. we came to attend the O! you convention because were such huuuuugeee Oprah fans. We attend all the time!!! Lines were freakishly loooong and we weren't bored because we were too excited to see our blessed Oprah Winfrey!!

40,Nice Venue,"As always, it's home to the Electronic Entertainment Expo each year. It's been some years since I've been there until my trip this month. Still a lot of room despite E3 itself shrinking a bit. The last time I came, in 2003, there were three halls set up, but this year only two. Has to do with convention itself I imagine. Lots of room and works well for E3, even with the large crowd that attends this event. Seems area has been improved since I've last been, which is always a nice bonus.Getting to convention center is still easy. Catch Metro Blue line to Pico, or the recently added Expo Line, and you'll be within walking distance of the convention center.More curious about what they're going to do with West Hall, since it's currently said that they plan on tearing it down to build a football stadium. If so, that could greatly affect the conventions that come to this convention center. At least E3 specifically, since it so heavily relies on all that space. I'm hoping they resolve that issue soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MukuSix
50,Great Venue,"Our International Training Event had 20K + attendees, and things ran very smoothly and organized. The sound was awesome from any part of the hall. The major dislike in my opinion was that 1 hour at the Starbucks line was not enough to actually get to order a cup of coffee. After 1 hour we had to abandon the line as our even was about to kick off. I estimated that there were at least 150 people still ahead of us by then. They should definitely have more stands.Another observation though it didn' happen to me personally, I hear people complaing about toilet paper had run out in men's bathroom.The parking facility were great and easy to access the halls from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bayaeric

20,"Area is nicely touristy, but cops still have ""Rodney King"" mindset...","The area's investors are really trying to rebuild the area and you can see the progress, but if the ""Officer UNfriendlys"" on patrol won't respect and regard the people patronizing the area as partners in the much-needed regentrification, then it will only postpone the economic crash and burn*. Way too much police harassment for the sake of padding municipal budgets!*Visit the ""Old Downtown Los Angeles"" district along Broadway near 5th to see what developers are fighting to avoid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Atty_Reginald_C
10,"Cowardly A_ _hole Cop in L.A. ignores drug dealers, speeders, gives $200 JAYWALKING ticket!!!","NO SIGNS stating it was illegal were visible, and it was clearly a touristy area, but the police (one was Jackson, #33397) chose to focus on a lone, well-dressed female crossing from a convention center to a hotel... HIGHLY suspicious of MOTIVES and NOT concerned with the fact that she (a doctor) was visiting from thousands of miles away. They also kept her license, only to return to the hotel later that night to ""return it.""Rewarded her visit to L.A. with a pedestrian citation requiring that she fly back to L.A. and make hotel accommodations to appear (possibly more than once if for safety school), or pay the rip-off TICKET and ""BAIL"" amount of nearly $200!!!Thinking of placing a convention or business meeting in Los Angeles? SERIOUSLY re-think that choice!!The police in L.A. will harass your colleagues and clients and will NOT help make you and your gathering at all a pleasant one!""SERVE and PROTECT!?!"" NOT!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mort_19101

40,Serve's its purpose,The LA convention center serves its purpose. Till recently it was bad because it stood on its own in a bad neighborhood. Now with LA Live and the renovated South Park neighborhood. The LA convention Center has become a great place to go to a convention or the LA Auto Show.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmarquez99
30,HUGH,"Huge space for multiple things to go on at once. It's a good place if you have to be at a conference because you can go to LA Live for lunch or after. Other than that, why would you need to be there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/positivenrg247
40,Huge Venue,Attended the Anime Expo there and the place was humongous. I was there for four days and still don't think I got through every nook and cranny of the place. Connects to a small strip mall with bars and restaurants and at night reminds you of New York or Tokyo due to the lights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaeRaeSama
40,Has many good events,"I went to Girltopia, Green Festival and Blog World Expo at the Convention Center, parked farther away and saved $6 or more.It's only 20 minutes or so from Westside so I'd go back if there's an event that I like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fitnesswla
10,Don't have your convention here.,"Unfortunately, an event I attend every year is stuck on this venue. There is nothing convenient about using the LA Convention Center, not access, not parking, no hotels anywhere near the place. It is surrounded by the scariest barrio looking neighborhoods. No good food service onsite or near.Also, WARNING they hold citizenship events here where thousands of immigrants swarm the facility- that is fine but you don't want your event here at the same time. You don't want your event here no matter what!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sprtplt11
