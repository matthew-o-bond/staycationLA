30,"Great Insta scenery, but not much to do","While the place is colorful and looks vibrant, there is not much (if anything) to see or do here. We got here before noon and the place was barely awakened. There are not many coffee shops or places to hand out and just chill. You can only go up and down the pier, eventually, hang out with the sunbathing seals, It was the only moving part of our visit. Although it is a good scenery for photos. While there, you can take a walk to Marina Bay, it is not too far and it's a pleasant walk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peseva
30,Fisherman's Village,Our uber driver dropped us off at Fisherman's village by accident. We thought that was where we needed to be for the New Years Eve events. There were only a few places open because of the holiday. There are a few restaurants along the pier and a few specialty shops. It was quiet and peaceful along the harbor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharmainD_12
40,Loved this area,While waiting to start the whale watching tour we walked around this area.Super chill spot with cute buildings. Nice to atroll around do a drink and a bite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/007jenniferg
10,Move on - nothing to see here,"We had assumed that this would be very like Shoreline Village in Long Beach - twee but pleasant for a stroll and a coffee and checking out the tacky tourist shops. Unfortunately when we went there it was desolate, nothing open, no people, empty carparks. I can only assume that it's pretty much closed down. There are obviously one or two companies operating out of here and one had some nice old charter boats; other than this - nada.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllanJGJ
10,SAD AND WORN OUT,"This used to be such a lovely place to stroll or shop along the water in the Marina del Rey. Not anymore. Many of the shops are completely gone (evidently they had no business) and the ones that were open were truly dumpy and sad. The buildings need to be renovated and updated. The parking lot is another disaster. The spots are WAY too small for all cars except very, very small cars like a MiniCooper. When parking you really have to be careful, because trying to get back into your car is nearly impossible when another car parks next to yours. My husband had to back out so that I could get in and I know that the car that was on my right, banged into my door when he/ she got out! This place is a mess! Try the other side of the Marina, if you want clean and lovely. You will only leave this spot wondering why you came!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judysinger
30,Not much there,We had eaten at El Torito and was just walking around the area so we went to see what shops were in the village. There's hardly anything there and everything was closed at 8 pm on a Friday night. It was totally dead. The only people around were those eating at the restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibaol
40,Always a great stop to eat at Sapori in Fisherman’s Village,"Many restaurants, bay cruises, fishing opportunities, and shopping fun.Plentiful parking, easy area to go biking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2beans2000
40,Very cute,"This is such a cute area! We rented some rickety cruiser bikes and rode along the path at Playa Del Rey, and then came back and listened to an awesome live outdoors Reggae band. People were dancing and it was a great time !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missleonyc
50,"We loved our stop here, we saw Seals","We had a late flight on the evening so I looked for somewhere to go before the airport and Marina Del Ray seemed like the perfect place.We are so glad we stopped by, there was a mini music festival one when we arrived so the vile was really cool, we sat down with an ice cream and then decided to walk along the harbour.This was a real highlight for us because we must have stood for at least an hour watching the seals play around in the water and hang around all the fisherman,, it was amazing to see and such a highlight of our LA visit.If every we come back to LA, we have agreed that we would rather stay around here. It's a great place, we love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheNatster75
40,So Cute !,"We took a dinner cruise from here and arrived here early and walked around . It was around 6 on a Saturday and most places were closing . There were a couple of shops open and a restaurant or two . Very small place , we walked it in 10 minutes but there were cute places for pics and nice views .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culinayart1
30,Blast from the past.,Used to spend time at Fisherman's Village in the 70's and 80's. Still charming. A few restaurants and gift stores. Changed a lot but you are still on the harbor which is beautiful and bustling with activity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigf97
50,Small,I went on a weekday and it wasn’t busy which makes it very enjoyable. The parking lot wasn’t full and easy to find parking. The public restroom wasn’t new but very clean. There was a handful companies that offers water sport rentals. I went there for paddle board and kayak. The whole experience of this little cozy place makes it really FUN. There is a little lighthouse and stores where you can get food ice cream and souvenirs stores.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappySsuss
30,Real Basic Tourist Stop,"This is probably the only tourist restaurant strip on the Marina. It's not operating at full capacity and, to be honest, isn't a very attractive stop. There are some operating restaurants and maybe a specialty shop or two. One fairly trendy restaurant is on the west end. But I do think it makes an O.K. pit stop for cyclists trying to make make part of the coastal bike run crossing the channel at El Segundo. You can walk here following basically the same pathways as the cyclists; but it's pretty boring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoom_Gotti
30,Disappointed,"Perhaps it was the time of the year, last day of February, but when me and my group of 28 people arrived here as a suggested stop, places we need to go type of thing, only about 20% of the place was even open. Would not suggest making this a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geraldr683
40,Year-round sunshine and a laid-back California vibe,"Marina del Rey is an upmarket, extremely popular seaside community. The marina is well located, just 6 miles north of LA International Airport and approximately 4 miles south of Santa Monica. Venice Beach and Santa Monica Pier are within easy reach from here.After starting out as an estuary used by fishermen and duck hunters, with the formal dedication of the Marina del Rey harbor in 1965, it achieved the distinction of becoming North America’s largest man-made, small-craft harbour.Marina del Rey provides innumerable opportunities for scenic photographs. If you are a shutterbug, this is paradise. And amongst many extremely beautiful locations vying for attention, one of the best is Fisherman’s Village – it has the quintessential Mediterranean ambience. A stroll down the board walk here is almost therapeutic.The marina today is home to some 5,000 boats, apart from which it is well known for water recreation activities such as paddle boarding, kayaking, sport fishing, whale watching, yacht charters and so on.Bicycling is also very popular here – you can rent a bicycle and starting from Venice Boardwalk at Washington Boulevard ride all the way to Santa Monica or even upto Pacific Palisades.Other activities include parasailing, hang gliding. If you just want to relax on the sands, you could do that too – on Marina Beach (called Mother’s Beach by the locals) or at Marina Peninsula Beach just south of Venice Pier. Burton W Chace Park and Admiralty Park are other popular family-friendly spots.Wintertime is best for whale watching – and if you catch a whale watching cruise from Marina del Rey that increases your odds of seeing them – those humongous grey whales that can be up to fifty feet long! Apart from grey whales, if you’re lucky, you might be able to spot the less common blue whales, humpbacks and orcas.Water recreation aside, Marina del Rey is also an absolutely amazing culinary hotspot – award winning restaurants with waterfront views, celebrated fine dining, cozy local food joints with harbor views, year-round outdoor dining, dinner cruises. If you are a foodie you definitely need to come here.Marina del Rey has over 50 restaurants offering a dazzling variety of cuisines and food to suit different price points. The marina also has six top of the line waterfront hotels that offer magnificent views of the harbor.Offered on all days of the week between 12pm-9pm, a visitor-friendly pick-up facility offered from eight prominent designated points at Marina del Rey is The Free Ride. If you text them 15 minutes ahead of the time when you want to be picked up, these five-passenger electric shuttles will pick you up and drop you off at any of the eight points that are part of their route.If you are a first-time visitor to Marina del Rey, it makes great sense to start your explorations from the Marina del Rey Visitors Center – they have some really helpful people there who will equip you with a useful map and a Marina Pass that lists out all the deals and discounts on offer in the area.The people who stay here are proud of the fact that apart from being a social, environmental and economic success, Marina del Rey is a work in progress, continuously evolving, serving as a dynamic model for other marinas worldwide.To say that Marina del Rey is astoundingly beautiful would be a woeful understatement. For tourists, this is a perfect getaway right in the heart of Los Angeles – a waterfront haven with year-round sunshine and a laid-back California vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
50,Surprise free concert and dancing at Fisherman's,"My husband and I were biking the Marvin Braude beach trail, going through Marina del Rey, and decided to stop at Fisherman's Village to get something to eat. Many good choices with tables in the sun, but best of all was the free concert by the Susie Hansen Latin band. They were fabulous and apparently draw a crowd of regulars to come dance. What could be better? Oh, to live in CA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beav
50,Weekend Music,"Great place to enjoy free entertainment and dancing on the weekend. Each weekend you can enjoy music ranging from R&B, Jazz, country and even Reggae. Parking is cheap and it’s a great way to mingle and get in some exercise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/617deej
50,Friday night dinner is wonderful at Fisherman’s Village,"Whenever we stay in Marina del Rey, we enjoy dinner at Sapori in Fisherman’s Village. The restaurant is an excellent Italian restaurant where you can find wonderful dishes for everyone’s tastes.The beautiful lights of cruise boats light up the night along the wharf and make for a lovely evening’s walk before and/or after dinner.Fisherman’s Village is an easy short drive from the many hotels on Admiralty Drive.There is plenty of parking; you get a ticket which can be validated by the restaurant for a discounted amount.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2beans2000
50,very scenic,"loved this village, its looks very old fashioned, reminded me off something from jaws the movie with the different coloured houses as your leaving on a boat. Weather was nice on our trip so is worth a visit to just relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoltonBev
50,"Lots to see, eats, shopping","Love walking along the boardwalk by the boats and seeing the sea lions and storks fishing, eating and playing. Had a great lunch outdoors. We had to leave, but would have loved to have been able to stay for the band that was setting up. We have also had dinner inside the Italian restaurant there that was excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaVinca
30,Not so much to see.,"Was lot of fog at the morning time, we didn't see any sea lions. Most restaurants was close at the time in november morning at 11am.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoniN147
40,Step into another world - This is an oasis,"We stopped off here at Marina Del Rey Fisherman's village on the way to LAX to fly home at the end of our Route 66 adventure.What a lovely place, an oasis in the big city, and the style of the buildings made you forget that you were indeed in LA.The Fisherman's Village is definitely worth a visit. There are restaurants, fishing, both Marina side and trips out of the Marina, paragliding, and there are party type boats moored here.The architecture is beautifully done.Watched the sea lions trying to get a meal from the fishermen and the pelicans and cormorants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddlerpants
30,Needs some TLC,This village used to be special. Now it needs to be brought back to life. The restaurants and shops are on life support and badly need remodeling.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMOgal
40,Cute for a stroll,Love walking along by the water here. You can usually spot seals. Parking is expensive though and has been cash only before!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMP77
50,Quaint,"I wasn’t here very long, but I did throughly enjoy this quaint little village. There are little shops and diners all over the area. It’s definitely worth a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveUFLoveFLA
50,Super cute area,"This is such a super cute area to stop for a bite to eat or some ice cream while you walk along the marina. The views of the marina are beautiful, and the slight breeze off the water is worth the time outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisiyag2017
30,Great selection of waterfront restaurants,"We enjoyed a beautiful evening at Sapori, Italian Restaurant and found that it was located in Fisherman's Village... what a nice grouping of restaurants and other places to go walking and strolling with family and friends.A summer stroll along the waterfront is really nice after a filling meal!Gentle breezes blow of the bay, a sweater is helpful.Be sure to have your parking validated and then your first two hours are free... plenty of time to enjoy dinner with free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2beans2000
50,The water bus is brilliant!,"We love visiting Fisherman's Village and this year we found that they run a water bus around the harbour for just $1 per person per trip. It's a great way to see the harbour and our 7 year old grand daughter loved it. Then afterwards, you have to try one of Daniel's ice creams which are amazing. Parking for up to two hours is free if you get your ticket validated by one of the stores. If you want to hire a bicycle, then is a great cycle hire place also run by Daniel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stotty24
20,Not much there,"I thought this might be a quaint (albeit fake) little area of shops and restaurants, but there is truly not much there, despite the fact that several of the cruise boats / ferries moor here. I did eat in a pleasant enough Italian restaurant on the water before boarding a boat shuttle back to where I was staying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/renozephyr
30,Tourist stop,"Tour buses come here all the time...there were two double-deckers parked when we happened by on our bicycles, even before the place had really opened much for business. We used the food court area as a resting place on our bike ride. At a previous visit, we had enjoyed the savory crepes for lunch while listening to a live band, but 10am was too early for that. I think the draw is that this is located very near to where you would rent a boat, kayak, or take a boat cruise (we rented a boat nearby one time). Otherwise, I'd say don't make a special trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cello12345
20,Empty,Not what I thought a couple of restaurants looked nice. We were doing a lunch cruise. Most shops not open. Looked abandoned. Also groups of homeless hanging around drinking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glpl
40,Nice stop on our HOHO tour !,Fisherman's Village was a transfer point between 2 lines on our City Sightseeing HOHO bus tour ! It is a nice grouping of restaurants and small shops along the marina and it offers some great views of the ships and the marina itself !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belleretraite

10,So lame!,"Not even up to a level as a tourist spot. Two restaurants and one gift shop that has 1980 postcards still left over. Oceanside, Dana point anywhere has a better fishing village/harbour area. Uggg",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N0madic1
50,A Sweet lil FIsherman's Village with Summer Boat Rides,"A wonderful, simple, old fashioned mariner's village that is not as big as Long Beach, but has much fewer crowds. Great drinks/eats at Whiskey Red's, gorgeous sunset views, stunning vistas and views of boats, and even boat rides/water taxis most of the year. Fun spot for 4th of July! (but get ready for the crowds!). Better idea to visit: May/June/July/August on off holiday weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354dorothys
40,Highly Recommended View of Harbor,When people come from out of town and want to see something in West Los Angeles one of the 'stops' has to be Fisherman's Village. It is one of the most scenic views of water and boats anywhere. You don't even have to stroll through the shops. A stormy winter day is just fine for this drive around and sightseeing. If you have a mind to do some fishing Dock 52 is just minutes away and you can get a half or full day boat most days of the year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MITCHELN
30,Nice place to see the marina,We booked a boat and we were early so had time to walk around Fishermans Village. Very cozy place to visit. Lots of parking which was nice and a great view of the water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lillianbaker24
30,A charming spot in Marina Del Rey,A very charming spot on Marina. A nice collection of restaurants and a small market. A wonderful place to have dinner outsidesthe reataurants seeing the sun set.

10,Pit(iful) Stop,"Marina Del Rey is beautiful, but this location is a struggle place if there ever was one. Unfriendly restaurant owners and a terrible public bathroom make for a terrible stop on a whirlwind tour. Fisherman's Village was my least favorite stop on my tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leaving_Samsara
50,"great choice of restaurants, live music and free parking if you dine","great place to spend a couple of hours and enjoy a great lunch. We dined overlooking the busy marina watching canoes, yachts and a variety of other boats whilst taking in the great sounds of a local band. Great place to enjoy a leisurely Sunday lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rustygrecian
20,CUTE BUT IN NEED!,"I'm giving this only 2 stars because although the setting is very pretty and they validate your parking for the first 2 hours, this place lacks stores, cafes, etc. There's one or two bigger restaurants there, and a place where you can buy coffee, but other than that, there's no little stores or much to do. We did enjoy a latin jazz band that was playing some really nice music. This place has a lot of potential, it just needs more venue added to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GermaicanSpiceGirl
50,Road Trip,This was a lovely place and very close to some great beaches. Also close to LA. It was a good base to take trips into Los Angeles but to also escape from the business of Downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/732JackieM
40,A Very Nice Village!,"I always enjoy stopping by here on my way up the pacific coast highway. Recently a friend and I visited this village, and had a wonderful time perusing the shops. Unfortunately on this visit there were only a few shops open (many shop spaces were vacant). I hope this area becomes the vibrant scene that it once was. However it is still an interesting place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apatejr
20,Poor little village,"This place is terribly ran down, not much to look at or do. The boats are nice. You can pick up a dinner cruise or sunset cruise. The restroom were so unsanitary I almost got sick. One out of four stalls were decent to use. This village needs a facelift and it might be ok. It smells old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debs476
40,Killed an hour,Apart from the views of the Superyachts on one side of the harbour it really didn't add too much else but if your looking for pleasant surroundings with some bars and cafes and watching the world go by then this could do you just fine.We saw a $150m Superyacht close up and that doesn't happen every day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andhewittscores

50,Quaint stop with food,Small area on the hop on hop off bus tour and a nice quiet place to stop for food. Not crowded and just a pleasant calming atmosphere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ELexington
30,Ms.,"Not good. Horrible food except for the over-priced Sapori. El Torito is screaming loud. There's no place for a handi-capped person with a service dog to dine. There's little to no atmosphere because it's not inviting. Ine of the employees from Whiskey Red's actually told me how bad the food is at his own restaurant. From afar Fisherman's Village looks charming. Up close it's anything but.The parking for handi-capped is wrong. We got a parking ticket because we didn't park hwad in. If we had, we wouldn't have the had access to the passenger side to let mt Mom out. The crepe place, nit really a restaurant -- it's just a window, was terrible. It was cold, nit authentic or appealing at all. I'll plan to go anywhere other than Fisherman's Village to eat or shop or just sit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793lcs
50,Fun Stop,"We typically like to cover a lot of ground when visiting a new location. One of the best ways we found of doing that is take tours with a Hop-On Hop-Off.With so much to do in LA Hop-On Hop-Off let us see the various sectors of the city without the hassle of driving all over ourselves, plus the bonus of a narration about what we were driving pass.That's how we came to discovery the quaint Fisherman's Village -- it was a stop of on one of their routes.Neat unique little shops, restaurants with Marina del Rey as a backdrop.Worth going out of your way to find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HCrowder
20,Needs a total rework,"We live only a mile or so away from Fisherman's village and have gone there a couple of times.It's location is ideal ( on the marina) , but the restaurants are only passable and there are too many empty storefronts. We always seem to eat at a Mexican restaurant there, which is perfectly fine for the basics: chips, salsa tacos, enchiladas, rice and beans. The Marguaritas look nice but ( and this is my suspicion only) I don't think there is a "" nickles worth"" of tequila in them.The boardwalk should be chock-A-block with charming stores and eating venues but it isn't. Frankly, it looks like the whole place is dying. Maybe a developer is acquiring the real estate for a re-build.It needs it. There is no point going there. It is not the appealing quaint waterfront fishing village the name implies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theodoremorehouse
30,Picturesque place,"Very picturesque place, quaint fishing houses with some nice restaurants around the water front.Great views but the little shops were either shut or empty which was a shame.Nice place to stroll around and stop for a drink or meal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854DP
20,Very run down attraction with no interesting stores,"This place originally was a bustling area of stores and restaurants...now many of the stores are gone with only a few tacky gift shops remaining. There are two or three big restaurants there (El Torito is one of them). There are also two fast food places with offerings that leave much to be desired. The entire area seems quite run down...the sidewalks are in bad need of repair, storefronts need painting and repair. There are a few charter boat tours available...one can parasail. There is plenty of parking...the price is $1 for 20 minutes, however, one can get it validated and get two hours free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob

40,Fisherman's wharf Monterey,"The wharf offers visitors good food with many choices. There are stores that have tourists items for everyone in the family. Boat rides are available every hour till 5, you can even see the sea lions as they bask in the sun. Restaurants will hand out samples of the clam chowder on weekends and daily during the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/946christyd
40,Plan to go hungry and bring home some goodies for later,I have been going there since the fifties and then I moved to Georgia. I finally went back in March and had a blast. Basically nothing has changed except a new French store and restaurant has been added to the old section. I pretty much stayed in the old section because I have all of the stores in the new section in GA. When I went to the old section it was difficult as usual to decide where to eat. It's all so good and I just wanted to take some of everything home. Dupars has the best pies and the crepes are wonderful. I did decide to eat at the French restaurant where I ordered a plate of cheese samplings with some other things added.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonrG2793OF
30,A Nice Walk,"We enjoyed a nice walk around the Fisherman's Village, but it was perhaps a bit too early for many of the shops to be open. There wasn't a lot to see, but the area is scenic and it was a nice way to start the day. Not sure there is a reason to return, but glad we did it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robkR5221MU
50,Relaxing,"A fun place to hangout and relax. There are several good restaurants here, good for breakfast, brunch, lunch, happy hour and dinner. Relaxing atmosphere in the sun out on the patio seating. Some cool bands on the weekends is always fun for music lovers. Parking is fairly easy in the lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/698jasonm
50,Beautiful place!!,"Beautiful place at Marina del Rey, Ca.You can walk around in a very relaxing way and enjoy the channel and beach view and of course restaurants and cantinas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raulpeimbert1
20,Sad and Depressing,Living close by I could easily walk to Fisherman's Village bit it's just too run down and depressing. What's even more baffling is that it's a stop on some local tours and you can see numbers of tourists getting off big motor coaches from time to time. I have no idea what they do to occupy their time because the shopping is really limited and the restaurants are mediocre at best. The view of the marina is the only exceptional part of the Village and you can get that from visiting Burton Chase park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DougG1130
50,LA's Best Kept Secret,"Fisherman's Village has been around for 50 years and yet many people do not know it exists. It is a tiny new-england style village with colorful buildings and a combination of shops, restaurants and small businesses along the waterfront in Marina Del Rey. Although there are signs in the parking lot to bring ""cash"" the adorable souvenir and gift shop, INdy Plush and the italian restaurant Sapori, will validate for 2 hours for free. The views are amazing. You can see boats, sea lions, blue herons, pelicans, and snowy egrets just feet or inches away. Sometimes dolphins and even small whales venture inside. You can spend an entire day here. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Rent bikes and boats. Learn to sail, take shuttles to nearby Playa Vista for free. Then shop at Indy Plush, Jaden Moon, MOMO and LuLella for locally made handcrafted souvenirs you will not be able to get anywhere else. We purchased shark plush toys at Indy Plush that give back to a non-profit that protects sea life. On sundays there is live music. A must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulgO8572OX

10,Out of the Way.,"It took forever to get here. Don't walk. You have to drive or be dropped off. We made the mistake of walking. Once we got there, EVERYTHING was closed. What is the point? It is a bunch of crappy old shops. Full of trashy stuff. It was definitely a downer. Wish we didn't waste the time walking there. Skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryantnyc
40,Cute little place,"We strolled around here one afternoon on a beautiful day. I liked seeing all of the boats and spotting some sea lions in the water. I didn't stop at any of the shops, but it looked like you can pick out some touristy souvenirs if you wanted some, and the restaurants with marina views look nice. If you buy anything (I got a smoothie from one of the cafes), they validate parking, so there's really no hassle in parking. It's a good place to come for an hour or so... there's not much to do past that unless you're eating at a restaurant or going out on one of the boats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaH515
40,Enjoyable,Took the in-laws to visit and they enjoyed shops and restaurants along with the boats in the marina.

Quiet and peaceful and wonderful afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J679XGthomasp
50,Great place to spend a day,"European styled houses with great view of marina. Plenty of things to do like water activities, whale watching tours, biking. There is a free parking 10 mins walking distance from the village",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KartikJain13q
40,A fun place on the water to take the family for lunch or snacks,"Take a walk by the boats, or a boat tour if you'd like. There're restaurants for adults and families alike...plus shops geared just for the kids with salt water toffee and cotton candy:)For adults there are outdoor patios with fire pits, and indoor patios with great views, for a more adult outing involving alcohol and food. An easy place to spend a few hours in the afternoon or evening....it's best when it's sunny...not too hard to manage in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robynm124
30,This use to be a great shopping area,This spot is very picturesque. In the summer the weekend concerts are fun and attract a good crowd. The problem is the shops are no longer drawing customers so the businesses that remain are T-shirt and souvenirs shops. Fisherman's village has been here since the 60's and it is in need of an update. It's too bad because it is located right on the channel and the view is wonderful. You can go there for a boat ride and there are a few restaurants. The best one there is Sapori.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineK267
40,Worth a visit,"Really wasn't sure what to make of this after all the mixed reviews but it really is worth a stroll. The sea-lions made it for us, so cute! But its lovely with all the seaside coloured buildings and being from the UK we liked the fact that they weren't pristine. Our beach buildings tend to be a bit weather-beaten and that makes it more appealing, if they're too pristine it can look a bit 'Disney'! So give it a go and parking is free even if all you buy is a cookie at the stall by the lighthouse!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wilma1001
30,Not much here,There's very little to see or do at Fisherman's Village but it is a pleasant enough walk and we had a lovely meal at Whiskey Red while watching the yachts sail out in the early evening followed by a beautiful sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gindog
40,Lovely for a stroll,"This place is very quaint and perfect for a leisurely walk on a weekend morning. You will often see different birds and seals here, sometimes dolphins too! There are lots of cafes to choose from plus boat trips and kayak hire'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMP77
50,Very pretty and colourful - look out for the sea lions just basking in the sun!!,"Very pretty place to visit. Only a small area of colourful buildings fronting onto the water. Good cafes there along with souvenir and icecream places too. There are live bands there, and you can catch boats there to go fishing or to travel around the Marina. There are bike paths all around the area, which we used often to travel around as we didn't have a car to use there at the time. There are families of sea lions and other wildlife in the area. Very pretty place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolineo888
40,Peaceful,Lovely little stop to eat ice cream and listen to the water. Stopped here for a short rest and the atmosphere is so charming and inviting!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/352kelss
30,Sunday Brunch,Average standard of fare - a large selection but quality not there. Outside seating very pleasant. Inside decor a little dated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jill62sill
30,Old and Tired Harbourside Village,This place has been in the Marina for years and it shows. Most of the buildings show their age and the whole place needs to be razed and rebuilt. The shops have the usual tourist T shirts and souvenirs. There are harbor cruises and a few paddle boat and jet ski rentals too. A couple of restaurants and snack shops also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidgR9887UD
50,Kayaking Fun!,We decided to rent a kayak here. The staff was more than cordial. The kayak was in good repair and the life jackets were free with the $15 1 hour rental. I had never been in a kayak so I was relieved to see that there was no surf. There was a bit of a a current as we crossed to the other side but it was a fun challenge for this novice. All in all it was a lovely experience and I would go back in a heartbeat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joys973
20,Nothing really there !,We did a whale watching trip and walked to fisherman village after - we sat and had a nice crepe but thought the area was poor - which was a shame - not worth individual effort of going otherwise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annacJ2514PY
50,Such a cool vibe,We arrived while there was live music plain gon a sunday afternoon. It was amazing to watch lovely people enjoying the sounds and dancing along to the band. All ages enjoying themselves and not caring who's watching. Had such an easy-going atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daz1975
10,Nothing to see there...,I was expecting to discover a nice village and enjoy a nice walk but there is unfortunately nothing to see there. Even the only ice cream shop is terrible and I wouldn't recommend to get anything from there. The village looks old and is so small. The boat trip to get there is nice though...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sophieetjulien
20,One of the Best Waterfront Location in MDR...It Needs a Complete Makeover,"I have watched Fisherman's Village in Marina del Rey decline over the years, the retail shops sell cheap imported items, the restaurants continue to be sub-par to the surrounding area restaurants with one exception... Sapori Italian Restaurant. The facilities are old, not well maintained and not a memory you would want to leave Marina del Rey with. If it were not for the charter boats, sail/power boat rentals and para-sail boat activities... the place would be a ghost town.I see tour bus loads of people visit and hope they don't conclude that this is what Marina del Rey is all about. The surrounding area is vibrant with many shops, hotels and restaurants to choose from. The marina del rey basin is the worlds largest man-made yachting harbor with thousands of boats and all kinds of water sports to choose from.The waterfront surrounding Marina del Rey is owned by Los Angeles County and it is rumored that one of the most renowned and successful retail developers is currently negotiating to acquire The Fisherman's Village area and has plans to redevelop it in a big way... keep your fingers crossed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnluft
20,Disappointing,"We were staying at a hotel nearby, so we decided to visit this area. It is definitely in need of some renovation. There weren't very many shops to visit and only a few restaurants that seemed average. Sadly, we did not stay here very long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherylbm29
50,What a great vibe,Go for the afternoon live music and out door dancing.What a fabulous vibe of genuine comradery .It seems that people from all walks of life come to dance and celebrate together.For us it was a moving afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/470davids
20,Unappealing area,"We visited here to eat at Whiskey Reds. The area had little to endear itself, felt very tacky and a good distance outside the main waterfront area of MdR.I certainly would not return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTravelsAgain
10,Terrible ending of a birthday celebration,"We celebrated a birthday party at Whisky Reds in the Fisherman's Village Marina del Rey. When we left the restaurant, the birthday girl had a parking citation on her window. It sure ruined the spirit of the celebration. We couldn't figure out the cause. It turns out that she backed into the parking space and that a distance away there was a parking sign with multiple lines of small print copy, one of which said that back-in parking was not permitted. We saw many other cars that had backed in with parking citations. Lots of angry people. The notice of illegal parking in small print, buried in a general information sign is not reasonable notice to properly alert anyone of the rule. The visitors are your guests and this is a horrific way to treat them. When was backing into a space the basis of a parking citation? If there is a true basis to prohibit back-in parking, then there is a responsibility to post such notice that drivers can reasonably be alerted. I repeat that this was not reasonable notice and reflects terribly on the management and ownership of the Village. You owe your guests more than that. The appropriate action would be to reimburse any of your guests that received a citation, reconsider whether backing into a parking space should be prohibited, post well-positioned with the restriction prominently displayed, and possibly to have No Back-In Parking painted on each parking space. You should be ashamed of yourself for allowing this terrible practice to continue without taking some action to protect your guests. I hope that you have a sense of integrity and consideration of your guests to act on this review....sp",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sep5937
20,Disappointment - Tee Shirts and sea horses,Disappointment. Failed to reach expectations. Low end tourist stores with plastic sea horses and tee shirts. Not worth your time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/801alw
30,Expected more,"Parking is expensive, get your ticket validated when you eat there or go into thestores. We were there at 11:15 am on a Friday and it was dead as a door nail.Did some souvenir shopping and walked around. Was fun to look at the boats.If you want to take a boat trip, this is the place to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SWBW0608

40,Great Spot,Lots of great little shops and restaurants right on the ocean. You can watch the comings and going of the various boats of all shapes and sizes in the harbour heading into/out of the marina. We enjoyed live music with people dancing and enjoying the day.Certainly a great stop to relax and enjoy when in Marina Del Rey.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMcFadyen
50,"""NICE VIEW""",A great place to enjoy the scenic view of the ocean and the expensive high rise condo's and apartments. Great place to enjoy different water sports and cruises in the harbor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GUCCI415
10,This faux fisherman's village is avoidable and should be avoided.,"Looks kinda cool from a distance...Looks are deceiving. It appears nice but it is dead...even with music on Sunday's.This faux fisherman's village is avoidable and should be avoided.It gives MDR a bad name. Inside are several shops with t-shirt, trinkets, bad art and candy. many of the spaces are depressingly vacant.It's bookended by a couple of has-been/never-were restaurants with barely average food (albeit good views of the main channel).Redevelopment plans have been outlined and presented for decades-literally!Tear it down soon and try again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
40,"So relaxing, great people, quaint lil shops","This was my first trip to California. Here on business, I needed to get away and see something other than boardrooms and the city. I'm glad I took this detour.Marina del Rey is like a happy little peace of the tropics. The pace is 360 to the hustle and bustle of Hollywood. The people I spoke to told stories of visiting once and never returning home. It's easy to see why, especially if coming from a big city.It's so relaxing and carefree here, no rush for anything. Sit on the dock and watch the birds and sea lions. If you're lucky, even spot a dolphin.Many curious little shops to explore. The touristy gift shops are filled with items that can be purchased cheaper elsewhere, but the unique shops with art and hand made things are whimsical and worth a look. I stopped into a little soap shop as the scents wafted out to me on the boardwalk. All natural soaps, smelling so delicious you'd want to eat them.Saturdays live bands play in the open air and make it feel more like you're in the Caribbean than California.I felt the temptation to stay and wake up to it every day as other converts had.Lucky thing I had to get back to business and home to my family.Definitely a place to check out if you need to escape the city and feel the energy of kindred joyful spirits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QARoadie

20,A ghost town,Maybe we were just unlucky as it wasn't the nicest of days weather wise but the place was deserted and most of the shops shut even though it was only late afternoon. It's such a shame as the place looked like it was once a busy and could be again. A great location but just needs some thought and investment (and perhaps be open!).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DAVIDandNICKIBELL
50,Great Restaurants and Live Music,"Things change, but not El Torito! Margaritas are great and so is the food. Overlooks the main channel with sailboats and motor yachts coming and going. Such a pleasant place to relax. On weekends, near the Light House, there is always Free music, usually jazz or blues, complete with a dance area if you wan’t to move around. Catch the water taxi in the summer and cross over to the other side of the marina for different cuisine or stop at the park for a concert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyW108
50,Sunday afternoon live music:-),"The live music on Sunday afternoons is such a treat! I especially love the jazz band ""2as1. The sax player is excellent!

30,Old Wharf,"Great place to walk early in the morning, rent a boat, watch sea lions, take a harbor tour or go parasailing. So many restaurant and retail spots closed or abandoned though. It's sad that the place is in such decline.

It isn't the most popping place most of the time however on weekends when a band is playing it transforms the place.What I love about it (when the band is playing that is) there are a lot more people that hang around and dance. If you're bored and looking for something to do, come down around lunch to hear the band that's playing and grab a drink/ice cream.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BradRevell
50,"Great place to walk around, take a cruise, leave your car","We did all three, catching the hop on/ off bus so we didn't have to fight traffic one more time.

40,Great place for a visit,"We have just returned from a 2 hour visit to Fisherman's Village and would say it was very good indeed. We hired two bikes from Daniel, which were good value and we had the most terrific cycle ride south along the beach-side cycle track in wonderful sunshine, despite it being January. On our return we were ready for some fantastic ice creams and we wandered along the pathway admiring the boats. We'd be happy to come back any day.

10,Very sad it is such a dump,"Over the years Fisherman's Village has fallen apart. There is not one restaurant I would recommend and I have been to all, even the outdoor eatery. I have lived here in LA all my life and have seen the Village go from a great place to visit, have a good meal and just walk around and look at the lovely boats. The boats are still there and if you want to just walk around a Marina, then this is for you. But if you want good food or are a tourist, don't bother. There are so many other things to do in the City and in the Marina. I will update if the County ever fixes this mess, but I am not holding my breath.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
30,Not What it Could / Should Be ...,"Fisherman's Village has location, location, location, but it direly needs to be refurbished and have better quality outlets installed.

The place is a dump and needs to be shuttered and completely redeveloped. The restaurants, such as they are, offer no open air seating along the water...are they insane? The only bright spot in the bleakness is the little Thai place with a few table under a tree shaded area in the middle, but I am reaching for something positive to say.

Our favorite was the Thai restaurant with excellent red curry and tasty chicken satay. The people are friendly and it 's a great place to take a walk along the water. Eclectic variet of visitors. We heard a variety of accents and one weekend day the place was inundated with tour busses, vans and cars full of Buddhists in the ceremonial finery visiting the Center for Enlightenment Retreat Facility. There is a fee for parking, but the restaurants and shops will validate and It does get super busy most weekends. The 4th of July was crazy!

The Marina del Rey Sportsfishing site mentions Dock Fishing on their site. It seems like a pretty basic service to provide. I got up early and drove over to do some morning fishing, but when I got there, the guy was rude and said they needed 24 hour notice to provide a pole rental for dock fishing.

I ended up at the marina but only stopped for the bus break of about 20 minutes. There wasn't anything to really do or see here as the location was tired & worn down. I had a quick walk around, got a cold drink, went to the toilet then took a couple of photos & jumped back on the bus. Still do the green route but get off on Pacific Avenue before the bus takes a left to go out to the marina (Admiralty Way I think).

20,Years Past Its Heyday,"Fisherman's Village is in a lovely setting and it has the look of a New England ocean side town. Sadly, Fisherman's Village is need of some attention and marketing. I remember when it was in its heyday in the 1980's--a popular place to visit and shop and dine. Now it is anchored by an El Torito restaurant which seems popular on a Sunday. There is a very small foot court and a very tiny shops selling souvenirs and rows and rows of empty retail and business space.I have fond memories of the place and although, the buildings are lovely and colorful, the magic is long gone. I took a whale watching tour that boarded from Dock 52 down the street. It was looking forward to reliving the past and was sad to see that Fisherman's Village has lost its excitement. But no one can deny it is not in a lovely location with a beautiful view of the marina.A prime location in a beautiful area. What happened here? Sadly, if you are visiting Los Angeles, you can skip Fisherman's Village except for a quick stop for some photos. It seems like the key attractiuon here might be boating and water activities that are located in the area. It's definitely not a dining or shopping hub.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackbear
50,Quaint,"Needs some sprucing up, structurs are old, not enough places to eat, but beautiful location. Great place to board a boat of any size from kayaking to power boats and fishing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/461DianeB
20,WHY DON'T YOU FIX IT UP,"BEST SETTING ON THE COAST OF SO CALIFORNIA. BEAUTIFUL. Such a lovely place to go walk, see boats, channel, etc. There are 3 restaurants and a couple of small kiosks. Dingy, it is uninviting, it is missing appeal from a resident to a tourist. That place could be so lovely. Some shops, repairs need to be made, a new cafe perhaps, there is 1 souvenir shop even that needs sprucing up. There is a home made candle shop that looks like something in a person's basement, why? I am sure tourist would like to shop and for locals a great getaway spot. Clean it up, spruce it up, there is nothing but possiblties there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73helenew
50,Fisherman's Village: The most magical place in Los Angeles.,"I first visited Fisherman's Village as a boy. It was full of shops and restaurants. Alot going on. I was happy to return and take my two young sons ages 6 and 8. Although the tenants have changed, the place is still magical. There is no better place to experience LA than here: The ocean, boats, jetskiers, parasailing, cyclists, roller bladers, Luxury yachts, airplaines in the distance, mountains on the east and ocean on the west, both sea and sky full of life. The buildlings are pure Americana: colorful, easy to walk in and out, full of interesting businesses and shops. Three of the shops sell only items made in the US. One store, Indy Plush, sells items made right inside the shop. After shopping had lunch at Sapori. Excellent Italian food with a beautiful ocean Marina view and friendly servers. And the owner has the perfect Italian accent, so that you know the food is authentic. We also rented bikes and you can take the bikepath either up to Venice Beach or south to Manhattan Beach. What a great place!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulgO8572OX
30,Bicycle Rental Destination,"My husband and I stayed in Marina Del Ray and knew we wanted to rent bikes to travel up to Santa Monica and south along the awesome Coastal Trails. The bike shop was reasonably priced, friendly and knowledgeable about the trails. They validated our parking, and we had time to have a drink and do some shopping. Great views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cycle55

40,happening,cool place -rented a boat with my son and had a ball. we toured the marina and went out in the ocean to Santa Monica pier. nothing to dislike,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackB308
40,Great view of the marina!,"Fisherman's Village is like a little oasis in the city. It is not as busy as it was 20 or so years ago. Back then, it was bustling with shops and restaurants. Today, there are a few restaurants and shops. The best entertainment there is the live bands on the weekends. They perform year round, and they range from country, R&B, to Latin. You can also catch a boat and cruise around the marina, or rent a bike and ride north to Santa Monica, or go south to Redondo Beach on the bike path. Parking is validated for 2 hours. Fisherman's Village is just a relaxing place to get away if you feel like escaping the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olivias914
30,Brunch at Fisherman's Village,Great selection and wonderful views. It has a real family feel and children are welcome. It is very dated and old fashioned but I think that is part of its charm. Brunch is a bit pricey but selection is good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Feefeet
50,Dance lovers,"Stop by Fisherman's Village any Saturday or Sunday for great free music. The cost of parking is minimal and if you buy a coffee or ice cream or a nice lunch at the restaurants they validate for 2 free hours. The music is awesome varies from great R&B Bands to Country, Bosa Nova, etc. Each Sat and Sunday the free music runs from 1 to 4. Summer 2 - 5. There is a regular crowd of people many young and old. Everyone just has fun dancing together, no need to bring a partner, many single older ladies so common older men get on over there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P565OUlaural
40,Small Area - Lots to do,Park in the nearby Dock 52 area which is free. Take a walk down to this very small marina which includes a few shops and restaurants. Rent a pedal bike and ride over to Venice Beach/Santa Monica Pier on the bike trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nattysimps
20,Fisherman's Village has seen better days!,"My husband and I stopped by the Fisherman's Village last week while in Marina Del Rey. Unfortunately, this tourist area is pretty worn and showing its age. There were only a few shops and restaurants and they didn't look appealing. The best thing in the village are the bike rentals and the ice cream shop. The view was also very good. I wouldn't recommend making a special trip to visit this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcalianno
40,Weekend concerts,"Fisherman's Village offers a variety of restaurant, shop and boat rental options in a lovely waterside setting. It is fun to simply sit on one of the benches and watch the fishing boats come in and watch the sea lions. The free weekend concerts are a nice plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debralynnet
30,A confusing place,"This place was somebody's brainstorm for a trouts attraction - probably 50 years ago. As far as I can tell, it never really caught on. On the jetty though, so you can see the boats come in and out of the marina!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnc_19
20,Very Disappointing,"Went here today, and were very disappointed in what was actually there...almost nothing. Lots of boats, but only a handful of tiny shops that were full of used items, for the most part, and very few restaurants. One shop, however, did ask if they could validate our parking, which was very nice...thank you Pammy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tag-about
40,Nice little stop along the way,We decided to stop in to see this nice little marina. We loved to see the boats and enjoy walking on the river walk. They have lots of little shops here to while away some time. Also have some very nice boats here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenapardue1234

40,"Nice, not too many tourists place","It is a pleasure to just stroll by, breathing fresh air and listening to sea birds. At night and specially when there are concerts, you can see many ""water taxis"" crossing this bay. Marina del Rey Fisherman Village is a place to go to have a quiet time or a nice dinner almost at every hour. The sunset view is beautiful as is the lights at night. At daylight, there are some stores and stores to book a fishing trip or a leisure one. Just be aware of the sun and heat and wear a hat as you may not notice it too much because of the breeze.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuluVoice
40,Quaint,"This is a very quaint shopping area with good views and restaurants. Enjoyable for a nice walk. However, if you need a taxi they were not in abundance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kitnsaly00
10,"Band Playing today, Saturday August 23rd","This was a very amateur band and hope you do not book them again; 90% of the bands are good; we live next door so hear many bands during the year.Need to put volume limits of all bands; some are very loud and only a few feet from the dancers;Chairs are now blocking most of the areas and need your security to place the chairs in a much better setup.Thanks,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I3839ISpeterm
30,Good for lunch and a stroll,This is a good place to stop for a leisurely walk and some window shopping. You can rent boats or paddle boards here as well. There is often live music being played outdoors as well. This isn't a super destination by any means but if you have 2 or 3 hours it is worth a stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JSD_West
40,Getting Better,"Great band playing. Nice place to rent bikes, get ice cream. Shops are scarce & parking is EXPENSIVE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnTheresa4
50,Fisherman's Village is my weekend treat!,"My favorite weekends include a bike ride with my furry friend in the basket....riding up the coast from Manhattan Beach, through El Segundo and Playa del Rey and on to Marina del Rey straight to Fisherman's Village. I love it here on the weekends! Bands play on Saturday and Sunday afternoons starting at 2 pm. Watching people dance is a blast... Or get up there and shake your booty yourself! There are several easy and affordable choices of food, including a great Italian restaurant, as well as Thai, ice cream, sandwiches, burgers and even breakfast! I still want to try Red's restaurant at the far end of the parking lot. It looks very intriguing. Be sure to check out the different boutiques including handmade soaps and patches at Momo, the craft gallery, the dresses and jewelry at Ethiopian fashions, and the souvenir shops. People gather to watch the music, everyone is in a good mood, it's such a fun atmosphere. You can also rent a bicycle, watch boats sail in and out of the Marina, watch for seals playing in the water, visit with a pelican or two, take a boat tour, or just enjoy the warm Southern California sunshine. It's the perfect stopping point for me to get lunch before heading back down the coast. I love this spot!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyM265
50,Take the water bus!,"The best value for your vacation dollar is found at Fishermans Village in Marina del Rey and it is called 'the Water Bus'. For the price of $1 per person you can tour the most beautiful Marina in the world. We took our 2 year old grandson who had quite the meltdown when the Captain blew the horn as we left the dock. But thanks to the wit, charm and simple kindness of Captain Dave, he was able to dry his tears and ended up having a wonderful trip. The weather is beautiful, the marina is stunning and the atmosphere is fun. Do it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mumerida
40,Dinner and drinks,"Fisherman's Village is a waterfront strip with restaurants and a few shops. A cool place to relax, have dinner, drinks and enjoy the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pauljalessi
10,Fisherman's village and no fish?,"We assumed we could find some good fish here but instead we found very few shops, poor food options. We even asked a shop owner about fish restaurants, they laughed and said ""Nope, there's a lot wrong with this place."" Don't waste your time here. Unless you want dock space, boat service, or kayak rentals there is little to redeem this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N8er8er
30,Not as good as 35 years ago.,"It had really changed since I lived there 35 years ago. They used to have a super fish market with cooked food to go. Now, there are just a few restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/feenst128
40,"Little old and quaint, but a pleasant spot to stroll","The Fisherman's Village is an older collection of brightly-painted shops that makes you think of SoCal from a bygone era. While it may be a little kitschy, I had a very pleasant stroll to and through the ""village"", and saw a variety of birds and seals along the marina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahElizabethSch
40,Pleasant place to visit,"This is a nice little area of Marina del Rey that hasn't been spoilt by over-development but the Los Angeles County is threatening to pull it down and build large buildings to house boats in storage etc. so better go there before that comes to pass! It's pleasant to walk by the water and they have canoes, kayaks etc to rent and you can also go para-gliding. There are several restaurants there too but I wouldn't recommed the El Torito but the others are ok. There are small shops there too for browsing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joan1914
50,Fun Place,"Every weekend there is music to dance to in the afternoons. I like the gift shop there. I always get a tee shirt and a hat. My husband always gets ice cream at Dan's and my children get food at the Food stand that was used in arrested development as the Banana stand. We always eat at Sapori. This time we ate outside. It is very good. The village is not that big, but it is a nice place for a stroll, where you can watch pelicans resting and seals swimming. While my family walks around I dance to the music on weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/112Lee
30,"Commercially under-developed, not too crowded place for a stroll","As you wander along the marina here, what will strike you is the lack of commercial and retail development for this location. Yes, there are restaurants and a few shops for tourists, to be sure, but this area feels like the poorer cousin to places like Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco or Fisherman's Village in San Diego. It's also considerably smaller, to the point that it's kind of quaint, in a ""days gone by, now what do we do with it"" kind of way. We come here for the boat rentals, and perhaps a nice stroll ending with ice cream or a refreshing drink at one of the restaurants. The area has a lot of potential, but somehow it just hasn't caught on.You won't need a lot of time to see what there is to see here, and I wouldn't drive hours to get here, unless you're determined to rent a boat and head out to the ocean.One of the best times ever is a dinner outside a cafe on July 4th, when fireworks launch over the water. (Check to see whether they will have that event when you want to go - it's sometimes cancelled) You have to book in advance of course, and don't expect to be blown away by the food - but the seating outside is the best in town when the fireworks start. Fabulous.If you have plenty of time on your hands, and have seen everything else there is to see in the LA area, or want to enjoy a calm bike ride along the water, or rent a boat, then come here. If you haven't seen Malibu or Venice Beach or even Manhattan Beach yet, go there first. Make sure you get your parking validated. Parking is not cheap. See separate review for Marina Del Rey Boat Rental.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tourpilot
30,Needs Attention,"We visited Fisherman's Village to go para sailing. The shops are nice and there are a couple of decent restaurants, but it seems as though there used to be more to it. There were some empty stores and things could be brightened up a bit. We did enjoy ourselves, just not much to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joette55
40,Picturesque area of LA,"We had the pleasure of swinging by the Fisherman's Village for a short stop. What a sight! So peaceful and quiet. We saw seniors taking a stroll, and parents showing their young ones the different birds in the harbour. There were individuals having lunch on the restaurant patios, without a doubt enjoying the sun and the view.We took a leisurely stroll up and down the marina, snapping pictures of the birds lazing in the sun, the local boats, etc...We would have loved to have time for a drink or two. Next time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lemons_lavender

50,Fishermans village is the pearl of Los Angeles,"I recently read an LA times article about Fishermans Village. I decided to revisit. What a wonderful surprise.Unlike most tourist destinations in LA Fishermans Village felt safe, uncrowded, and genuine. There were families strolling casually. No one was cutting any one off. The views of the ocean and marina are world class stunning. There are four unique stores if things only made in Los Angeles. And at least three good restaurants. Worth the trip....specially around sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulgO8572OX
50,Hidden LA treasure that is worth a visit,"This quaint ""village"" is a must see if you want to have a relaxing time with a great ocean view. The center is coming back alive with new stores seeming to pop up weekly along with lots of boating, kayaking, dining, and fishing opportunities. On the weekends there is great “street” entertainment consisting of live music and dancing. Favorite things to do are watching the boats, seeing fisherman unload their catch and shopping, including an interesting store called IndyPlush. Mix between a toy store and edgy cutting design plush products for both adults and kids. Get lucky and you will see a film crew working with stars of film and TV.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaicoMan
30,adorable stuffed toys at Indy Plush,"Went to Fisherman's village to enjoy a warm sunny day near the water on Mar 9. Mostly restaurants but there are a few nic nac shops still. Came across an adorable little toy/stuffed animal store named ""Indy Plush"". Made in the USA and made out of all recycled products ( the felt is made out of recycled water bottles, awesome). The store is adorable and the website and FB page have all the different animals. Proceeds from some of the funds from the endangered series go to help thoseanimals. The abdominal snowman is too cute! Whales, seahorses, turtles, tigers, etc... check it out they are adorable! Village wise Sunday must be salsa music day. Quite a group gathered to hear Susie Hansen Latin Band. Evidentially has a good ""local LA"" following. People hanging out in the sun or dancing to the music. Shops are mostly vacant but it still was a cute place to enjoy some sun and watch the boats going in and out of the marina. Parasailing can be done from here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kernelclr
40,On Friday night you can dance the night away,"Friday night there is live music and dancing lots of fun also free parking if validated by a merchant. We enjoyed a sunny stroll among the shops and the waterfront trail it was very relaxing and refreshing. Check out the shops and take in all the boats big and small in the harbour. If you are able to rent, a bike and bring it there the bike trail is wonderful to ride along very well maintained and scenic. There are some restaurants to choose from or bring a picnic and enjoy the outdoors!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4theluvofgolf

40,another good attraction,"Marina del ray is a small place in Los Angeles , but quite Big for the amount of Fishing Boats and yatches you see here . there are thousands of them in every shape and size you can imagine.

40,Who knew this place existed?,"If not for the small size of ""Fisherman's Village,"" I would give it 5 stars.This is a quaint and adorable little area adjacent to the marina which includes many places to eat (burger stands to expensive restaurants-El Torito and Shanghai Reds ). There are also some businesses where you can rent equipment if you wish to partake in aquatic activities such as paddle boarding, sailing, and jet skiing. I went parasailing twice leaving from here, and absolutely loved the experiences. It may get a little crowded in the afternoon on the weekends, but overall this is a great place for a romantic date or just to relax and escape from the middle of the city.is ok because is quiet if you want to run away from the city ,not the greatest but is peaceful and I love that ...hate the crowds .Parking: some business validate an hour or 2 for the lot, which charges $1 per 20 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/butcherusa
20,"Sorry, its almost an a ghost-town","The whole experience at Fisherman's Village consists of buying an ice-cream and walking around with nothing much to look at beside the boats on the channel. The majority of the shops are boarded up. Free concerts Saturday afternoons in summer can be pretty good but they're small-scale affairs. Otherwise at Fisherman's Village there's a generic Mexican restaurant that's OK and there's a couple other dining options- read the reviews of the classiest, Shanghai Red's, before you go. There are many other options for dining with views of the water in the Marina area, look around the corner, down Admiralty Way. If you want to see some boats close-up, drive or bike around the Marina and buy a soda and hang out at the Fuel Dock at the end of Bora-Bora Way. The entire Marina is a heaven for safe, casual bicycling!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BainBear
40,good food and things to do,I really like Mexican food and El Torito is my favorite place to eat Mexican food. The Blues cruise was fabulous if you like Blues and the buffet roast beef dinner was very good. It is a nice place to walk around and watch the various birds flying around trying to get fish. There is live music here on the weekends which is very relaxing and groovy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nihonjin777

30,Great sailing/boating,"We've been to the Village numerous times throughout the years. It's a great place to rent bikes, sailboats, and power boats. There are also party boats that sail from there, but we've never taken part. All in all, it could be so much more than it is. I agree with another review that said ""needs a makeover"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roadtripper111

30,Good for a llittle stroll or sunset watching,"There is really not a whole lot to the fisherman's village. There are a few souvenir shops, restaurants, and small eateries. It's good for a little stroll as you can overlook the marina. I would recommend going a little before sunset so you can watch the sky change.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
20,Very disappointed it needs a makeover,This could be a great place with the quirky shop/restaurant spaces in their vibrant colors BUT most are empty and they all need a lick of paint.

30,Tired and in need of work,Fisherman's Village has been open for decades.....and it shows. Much of the shops are empty. Those that are still there cater mostly to tourists. There are a couple of decent places to eat and the best part is watching the boats and the occasional sea lion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67

30,Pity about the state of this 'Village',"The Fishermans Village sounds like it should be somewhere interesting in the Marina Del Rey area, but it is unfortunately past its best. Many of the shops and restaurants are permanently closed and those that are open are not very attractive. We walked through the quayside and left after sitting on a public bench watching the boats and pelicans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wickens

30,So-So,"Just another touristy place. We walked in from our hotel on Bali Way expecting to see an interesting sight - What we did see was a giant parking lot and a strip of restaurants and bars and local talent (guitar, singer, band) doing a subpar rendition of rock classics. There are no places to sit down (unless you sit at one of the restaurant's outdoor benches sitting right on the sidewalk).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shutterbug35
30,Nice to visit if you are in the area,"I stayed at the nearby Ritz-Carlton and made use of the $1 water taxi to get to Fisherman's Village. More than anything it was just an excuse to get out of the hotel for a few hours, and I certainly don't recommend travelling from far just to visit.There are some shops and restaurants, and on a pleasant day it is nice to just walk around, have an ice-cream and take some photos. I stayed for no more than 30 minutes before getting the ferry back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philch1
50,Center of the Jamaca Universe,"This is where you go by walking or by water taxi - this is where you begin your tours, rent you water boards, boads and such and where you can do your shopping and other activities locally. it is across from the park where the concerts are in the evenings and sort of your central hub of activities if you will. For the short trip this is where begins and ends for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spa-Mainia
20,Not the gem of the marina,"Not the gem of the marinaEasy to get to and has plenty of parking.Several restaurants are available some of which I have eaten at, only for lunch or an early dinner. None of them impressed me.This is not an impressive place and it is not on my 'must visit' places of Marina Del Rey.It is usually a destination I sometimes choose to ride my bike to for a nice lunch at a dock side restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdculpepper
30,OK for Photos and a Margarita,"Fisherman’s Village has seen better days, but its exterior is still very charming and makes for great pictures. The restaurants are just OK, and Happy Hour at El Torito is available, although it’s not my cup of tea (or tequila) – not very good Mexican food and the ambiance during Happy Hour is loud and raucous with TVs and patrons at blast level.The shops are kind of sad because so few people patronize them and there are numerous vacancies. Perhaps if the County would offer better rent incentives, this could be a lively little enclave of nice boutiques.You can take the fast boat to Catalina from here, and the summer WaterBus is only $1 one-way. The latter is a nice way to take a tour of the marina and one of the stops is at Fisherman’s Village (my only complaint is that the WaterBus is contracted out to Hornblower Events and there is no narration on the WaterBus at all – they might at least have a pre-recorded tape to highlight what we’re seeing as the WaterBus works its way through the marina. But that seems typically Hornblower – I’ve taken their cocktail sunset tours and there’s never a word of narration either, just drinking).So if you want to go to Fisherman’s Village for some pictures, perhaps a margarita and the free outdoor live music in summer, then it’s a nice destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentTraveller034
50,walking distant from hotel,"Shops were interesting, could ride around on a bike, people were friendly, weather was fantastic and close to hotel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marsunset
50,Lovely spot,Buildings. Walking along the water.. seeing all the pelicans.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emayer56
40,Nice place to visit,"We made the mistake of driving to Santa Monica on Memorial day. It was packed so we drove back and went to fisherman's village instead. On the weekend they have wonderful bands playing and people dancing to the music. We visited the little restaurant the they used for the Banana stand in Arrested Development the TV show. We got Ice Cream in the little mall. We watched Seals and boats in the Marina. Very nice and relaxing day. I bought hats at the store. We went back again later in the week and ate at Sapora, the Italian restaurant. It was very nice. There is a small fee for parking but it is not much and the stores validate to give you a discount. It is a nice place to spend some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/112Lee
30,good margaritas,like the atmosphere - but a basketball game was going on and we were blasted by the TV and asked several times to have the volume adjusted and they never did............good happy hour and good margaritas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheDixie
30,Interested but over-rated ?,An interesting row of buildings the best of which was the Mexican Restaurant. It served good food at reasonable prices and with excellent service.The other eating places appeared ordinary or over-priced; there was nothing else to see or do - in June,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldWideKiwi
10,No reason to go unless you are a fisherman,This is a run down and sad part of the marina. It is amazing to me that they still charge for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freab
20,Not worth the stop,"Not much to see here. A few small trinket shops and a few restaurants. Very dirty area. Seems like no one cares about the appearance of the boardwalk, the docks or the buildings. We were very disappointed. The brochures made it seem a lot more appealing than it really is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbersdown
50,great way to spend the day,went to fishermans village over the memorial day weekend with my wife. We were staying in the area so on the last day out we went to check it out. Had lunch at the Mexican restaurant which was nice the service was another thing but i'll do a review on that place later. After lunch we went an walked along the marina looking at all the sights. They had a jazz band setting up ready to play as we were about to leave. but the best part were the Sea lions that were at the docks. That was pretty cool we took a few pictures while we were there I enclosed one that we took while there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DARCALINO480
50,Beautiful,Had dinner at the Mexican Restaurant the walked along the Pier to get photos of three seals sleeping on the dock,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefsmomGlenMorris
20,Don't bother to drive there,"Not much going on there, we got food poisoning at one of the nicer restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeP379
40,Loved the birds and Sea Lions,"There are benches to sit and take in the scenery, boats, birds and sea lions. The small shops are cute but somewhat overpriced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rolandtz
20,Dying faux village,Pelican and sea lions are almost the only locals left in this ghost village. Great views of the Marina.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NW_Raven
30,Really boring,There is nothing to do here unless your gonna eat some Italian food or go to El Toritos. It used to be real nice here with a nice fish and chips restaurant but thats all gone. You can go and walk along this path they have by the boats or get on a little hornblower cruise. Just real boring. Its kinda sad cause I used to go there all the time as a kid.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaRepo
10,Bulldozer material,I have been going here since I was a little kid. it has totally lost everything worth the drive down the street to get there. Shanghi reds and El Torito are decent but the rest of the shops (not many are open most have closed) lack any charm or interest.This place needs some major urban renewal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bts_going
50,Mimosa's - Food - Views and Jazz!,"I love Fisherman's village - and I am surprised that some other people don't like it very much. But I'm from England, so perhaps I'm easier to please!I love the live Jazz at the week-ends, and watching seniors getting up and dancing.Shanghai Red's is a great place to eat, and the views are terrific.Perhaps some art galleries, and shops selling more than touristy tat would be welcome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlannahC_12
20,Run down and needs a face lift,"Shabby area with old restaurants. The entire area needs a little work. Nothing special for visitors from out of town. Go to Manhattan Beach instead, where there are nicer restaurants and better views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iSkylark
40,Relaxing atmosphere and a great restaurant.,"There are several things to do here if you know what to look for. Some nice places to eat. (Parking is reasonable.) Sapori restaurant is superb! There are boat trips that launch from the area, boat rentals, and now para sailing. In the summer you can take a water taxi for $1 around the entire Marina or, hop off and on at will. Sundays they have live music, (free) where locals gather to dance, eat ice cream or get on bikes and head south on the strand. It's a shame there isn't more offered here because it has a really nice vibe. However, I think it is absolutely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackie310
40,Great themed sight,"A few great restaurants and shops, but overall there isn't much to do, sadly. It's definitely a nice looking place, very nostalgic and retro.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blakecla
20,Does not merit even a detour,"There are better spots to get a good view of the marina. It is puzzling to see tour buses stop there. It sports a most bogus light house, has no interesting shops. I am drawn there because I love the restaurant El Torito which is part of the compoex.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foredeckchick
