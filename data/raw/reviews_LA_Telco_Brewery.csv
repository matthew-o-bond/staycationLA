50,Great beer and a friendly crowd,"What a delightful find. The beer here is truly delicious. Clean brews from a diverse menu, served in thoughtful glassware that enhances the experience. Serving temperature was on point. And the staff we encountered were knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.I had some trepidation as we walked up to the brewery as a first-timer, because it was packed with people, and we wanted to avoid a wait. They managed to accommodate us right away. Not only that, but their regulars were a friendly bunch.A bit of warning, though: If you go with friends...they have quite a few board and other games. If your friends trend competitive, like mine, all good chatting may go out the window in the middle of Chinese Checkers.I was sorry that I missed the fact that they had a game room until after we left the brewery....but it’s ok, we’ll be back.",christina_onthe_road
