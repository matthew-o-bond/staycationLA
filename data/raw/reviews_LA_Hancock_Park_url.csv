50,TIMING IS EVERYTHING,"The park itself is beautiful nestled between the LACMA and Tar Pits. On our day they had a free Latin Music concert on and it was a blast. The place was filled with families, dogs, lawn chairs, great music and everyone up dancing to the tunes. Outstanding! Even if there is not an event on it is a great place to relax and enjoy the green space after a museum visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho
50,Stunning,"I've lived in Los Angeles for 15 years, and there are times that I simply need to go to Hancock Park--a beautiful old-money residential neighborhood. LA can get so congested, and stressful, and this neighborhood offers needed relief.The streets are wide, and tree-lined, and generally empty. Go with your loved one, or by yourself, and marvel at the beautiful architecture, and enjoy the serenity.After your stroll, walk on over to Larchmont Blvd and grab a bite or get something to drink. And there's a great view of the Hollywood sign from the Blvd.For me, this is as good as Los Angeles gets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonathanV817
40,Nice Old Money Area of LA ...,"Hancock Park area is primarily made up of large old time Money homes of LA, before the Westside eclipsed it eventually. Drive the streets and enjoy seeing huge homes and yards, set back nicely. New generations are moving in so its gradually changing. Some scattered nice restaurants in the area. Best for a sightseeing drive through while on the way to other venues. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Very attractive area of LA,"Beautiful and very distinctive homes in this area. You can tell it is one of the old school established areas of LA because it has beautiful wide tree lined streets and very stylish homes, without being flashy. The neighborhood sits in between Melrose Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard and has been home to numerous notable residents. After driving around here it was really surprising to find such a quiet affluent neighborhood sitting so closely to the much more trashy Hollywood Boulevard and Sunset Strip. The amazingly good Pizzeria Mozza is located here. There is also a series of very attractive power box/traffic light control boxes painted with nice artwork in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
