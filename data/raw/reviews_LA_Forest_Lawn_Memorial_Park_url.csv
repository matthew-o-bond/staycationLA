I have never seen such a beautiful piece of mosaic art in my life, depicting Revolutionary War scenes along with the birth of our nation. It was awe inspiring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizB754
50,A memorable experience,"I visited this site mostly to see the huge painting ""The Crucifixion"" by the Polish artist Jan Styka. Being originally from Poland myself, I felt obliged to do so. The painting beats all expectations with its size (only slightly shorter than the fuselage of the 747), artistry, and the story behind it. I am somewhat surprised it is not much advertised and a bit hard to get to, one needs to be there on the hour for a 30 min presentation. The cemetery itself is of course impeccable but the history book I bought at the gift shop made me realize all the aspects of its development and efforts that went into decorating it with copies of artistic masterpieces from around the world, or, as it is in the case of Styka's work, with the enormous original picture. Time well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArturB290

I gained access with a friend who's uncle was in there. The mausoleum was filled with the most beautiful stained glass and statuary you could imagine - such a shame the public is NOT allowed to see it.

We had just finished having lunch at Tam O'Shanter and I impulsively responded to remembrance of this special place and dragged my wife to see what is probably one of the more impressive cemeteries in the world.Just the landscape of rolling lawns and beautiful landscaping in every way you look is enough to put one in a very mellow LA state of mind. Then the awesome chapels, mausoleums and statuary completely overawe.Very few places in Los Angeles where the noise and the rush fade away. This is one of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChinaLake1
50,Walking tour,One of the odd things my father use to do was take me for walks in cemeteries. He use to love to look at the headstones and the landscape. Forest Lawn doesn’t have many headstones but it has the most beautiful landscaping I have ever seen. But the most amazing feature is the chapel which features the only place in the world wherever statue done by Michelangelo is reproduced. An amazing place to visit...but I don’t want to do a long- term stay if you know what I mean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeS2259
50,Easter Island meets Glendale at Forest Lawn / the Gallery / Exhibit,"This really blew my mind! So we decide to check out the Art Exhibit held in the gallery at Forest Lawn... As I am enjoying the show I turn the corner and standing over me was a real Moai statue from Easter Island .Easter Island is home to 887 monolithic carvings, called moai statues. The moai were built by the Rapa Nui, who were native to the island, somewhere between the years 1400-1650. The largest of the moai weigh up to 86 tons and can be as much as 30 feet tall, although the average size is about half that big, according to Easter Island Travel. I asked if they thought it was a good idea for him to be here since technically they are not allowed off the island. Bad karma ?? They said he was found some where else by a fisherman I think and that he was allowed out. I don't clearly remember but I was really taken back by this awesome alien being. The gallery gift shop was great and really inexpensive with a very creative and eclectic chose of gifts for kids and adults. I found some cool pop up cards and chose Salvador Dalí and Andy Warhol and I have never seen them anywhere else. You must check this out if you are not going to Easter Island any time soon. I am still amazed he has a Glendale address.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstevenss

40,Three family members here!,"We just buried my mother between my dad and brother. They are on the side of the hill. We had her transported from the Bay Area to this location. My sister and I were the only ones at the site, but the facility had the grounds ready with a shaded canopy for us and chairs when we arrived. We didn't ask for these but they were presented for us in a respectful display. The Park person stayed nearby at the top in case there was anything we needed while we conducted our small ceremony. The grounds people came shortly afterwards and lowered her into the ground and proceeded to instantly make the grounds presentable where we could pay our last respects all in a short amount of time. We left knowing that everything was completely taken care of and we had a sense of finality. It took a few weeks to get the tablet engraved and placed but they sent us a picture to let us see that all was well. The experience was as good as it could be under the circumstances and the grounds are beautiful to drive around and see.

50,A fabulous art museum,"Forest Lawn Memorial Park is a fabulous art museum. Allow a minimum of 4 hours to visit. Eaton designed the memorial park in 1908 with the idea that it would be a beautiful uplifting experience. He succeeded. It begins at the entrance. The gate is the largest wrought iron gate in the world and opens and closes with the touch of the finger. Just inside, by the pond is ‘The Little Mermaid’ (think Amsterdam. The Mausoleum has exact reproductions of Michelangelo’s greatest sculptures. It’s like touring Italy in one stop. The building, itself is a recreation of a church in Genoa. Easy to find is the tomb of Elizabeth Taylor. She is resting below the giant angel as you walk down the hall. Around the corner is Walt Disney. Hundreds of celebrities are buried here. If you are into that kind of a tour, you have to do your homework on the internet. Also, in the same building is the magnificent stained glass window of Rembrandt’s ‘Last Supper’. Ask them to play the audio tour. Fascinating. Continue on to the Museum. It has a fabulous permanent collection (Examples are Russell and Remington sculptures) and changing exhibits. Then, continue on to see Michelangelo’s ‘David’ and don’t miss all the sculptures in the gardens surrounding it. Last stop is Freedom Court. Marvelous sculptures of founding fathers. Go to the Freedom Mausoleum and enjoy the stained glass depictions of American history. There is more if you have the time. Just doing these stops will easily fill hours. You can get more information and map at the visitor stand just inside the entrance gate. There is obviously no cost for the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850annettem
50,"The most amazing, peaceful cemetry.","I have come on holiday from UK, hoping to locate my great grandparents' graves. We found my great grandfathers. We walked to the upper end of the park; all uphill in the heat and a couple of very lovely maintenance men helped us find the grave. It was an emotional moment for me to discover that my kin was buried under the soil. We put a bouquet of flowers on the grave, which had no tablet.The maintenance men showed us where Walt Disney's family were at rest. Also the Freedom hall was open to visitors. This is a beautiful park of 300 acres with the mountains surrounding it, owned by Forest Lawns. On entry we were given maps and the grave was identified.There is a lovely flower shop and besides purchasing flowers you can buy water, which we required as we had a long walk.

40,Worth a Visit.,"Having been introduced to Forest Lawn courtesy of a song of the same name by John Denver (off his An Evening with John Denver live album), you can imagine the mental picture I had of the place growing up as a child in the midwest.Finally, nearly 40 years later I had the time to actually visit the place.I half expected to see ""hidden weights and springs tip their hats to the mourners filing past..."" as I moved along the pathways. Nonesuch, but man, there were some incredible art pieces present. Many of them Christian and sections of the cemetery themed to accommodate the people buried there.I didn't spot a single open space for another new grave in all the rolling landscape, but I admit I didn't get out of the car to walk the grounds.I think it might be fascinating to do so with a map and visit the various notables who call this their final resting place (for their earthly bodies, anyway).Beautifully manicured, bright and cheery, this cemetery is unlike any cemetery you have ever seen.Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TieTheKnotVideos

We did not have a plan or an agenda to visit famous graves but we were surprisingly pleased with the beauty and serenity offered here. Much history with some beautiful monuments and murals.

40,"Beautiful park, but very private","Forest Lawn in Glendale was once the most popular attraction in the area, and that's exactly what the owner had planned when he purchased and revamped this cemetery. It's definitely worth driving around and strolling through the places you can.But while it's the resting place of hundreds of stars, don't expect to see a lot of them.It's ironic to me that Hubert Eaton--the man who brought the place to life--wanted people to visit and experience the grounds, yet it's not as ""for the living"" as he put it. If you go to Forest Lawn to see the graves of stars, don't expect security or others to help you find them. Books like Mark Masek's ""Hollywood Remains to Be Seen"" will help you locate the outdoor graves. Keep in mind that the graves are hard to find. There are thousands of them, and the flat lawn markers are also set lower than grass level. You practically have to stand on top of the graves to see who they are.The Great Mausoleum is a different story. There are limited areas where visitors can go, unless you are the family member of someone interred inside. Some of the guards on duty are very strict and may follow you around.There are also lots of private areas on the grounds that can only be accessed with a key. Mary Pickford and Humphrey Bogart are two such people. If you want to see Michael Jackson, he's in the Great Mausoleum under heavy security; there are even cameras. You will likely see tributes to him against the outside of the building.All this said, it's still a fabulous place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mindap2017

The park is beautiful and very peaceful and quiet so trekking up and around the grounds was a treat. I made it to the very top of the property and came upon a gallery I had no idea was there. When I opened up the front doors I was amazed to see they were featuring the art of none other than Syd Mead. (Some of you may know his concept work from Blade Runner). Incredible! What a wonderful surprise and such a lovely place to visit. And it's free! (this was back in 2011). But recently I've seen a great exhibit by Eyvind Earle, the famous Disney artist. It's still going on until Jan, I believe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bimbojones

40,"Massive, Unique, Free, Filled with Art & Movie Stars","This is the original version of what became a larger Forest Lawn chain. Founded in 1906, Forest Lawn pioneered a novel approach to the time immemorial practice of burying the dead.The new approach would not be mournful, funereal, spooky and sad but beautiful, inspiring and hopefully even uplifting. The idea was that people like yourself reader would come here not only to visit ""love ones"" but just for the pleasure of seeing beautiful and inspiring grounds. Believe it or not people even get married here, like former President Ronald Reagan and his first wife, actress Jane Wyman.Thus, Forest Lawn was among the first to dispense with upright gravestones and to introduce original and replica art work by accomplished artists. The idea was that it would become ""a great park devoid of misshapen monuments and other signs of earthly death, but filled with towering trees, sweeping lawns, splashing fountains, beautiful statuary, and. . . . memorial architecture.""As a result of this vision, the park also features the Forest Lawn Museum which not only displays its own impressive holdings (e.g. the Bouguereau collection) but also hosts exhibits of world class art (e.g., Rembrandt, Goya, Winslow Homer).The permanent collection includes an impressive stained glass collection of European pieces dating from the Middle Ages to the present. Other items include bronze sculptures, Americana, coins, replicas of the British crown jewels and one of the Easter Island statues.The park also holds replicas of famous art such as Leonardo da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"" and a life-sized reproduction of Michelangelo's ""David"" and ""Moses.""The memorial park includes three non-denominational chapels, replicas of famous European churches. As noted above, tens of thousands have been married in them, including former President Ronald Reagan and his first wife actress Jane Wyman.The park includes the Great Mausoleum modeled after the Campo Santo in Genoa.The list of famous people buried in the park is too numerous to list but includes Michael Jackson, Walt Disney, Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn, James ""Jimmy"" Stewart, Dr. Ernest Carroll Moore (Founder of UCLA), Elizabeth Taylor, Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis Jr. and many other notables from Hollywood's Golden Era and Southern California history.The park's unique take on cemeteries and death was lampooned by British writers Eveyln Waugh (The Loved One) and Jessica Mitford (The American Way of Death). Both writers saw the cemetery as reflecting, for better or worse, fundamentally American attitudes. Waugh's work is worth reading if you can tolerate darkly biting humor.The cemetery has over 250,000 interments, a number roughly equal to the size of Buffalo, New York or Irvine, California.The grounds are quite large and many find having a vehicle not only helpful but necessary especially in Summer heat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/820tommyt

50,A Museum That's Free?,"Visiting a cemetery is probably not something you do often, especially if you are doing it for entertainment... but Forest Lawn and its free museum is something you should plan to do.We visited the Eyvind Earle art exhibit that is currently (2016) being held at the museum and it was fantastic. Whenever you are in the area you should check the Forest Lawn Glendale website and see what events are being held there.Of course just driving through the grounds of the cemetery is a wonderful journey and then you can stop at the various churches on the property and view their fine architecture.Overall this is a wonderful place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/131RichardM131

50,More than just a final resting place,"My wife and I come here when we need to relax and escape the hustle and bustle of the outside world. Forest Lawn is more like a museum than a cemetery. There is a beautiful stained glass reproduction of the Last Supper that you won't find anywhere else. There is a small chapel that has been home to may weddings as well. Throughout the area you will find reproductions of famous statures, areas paying homage to American history and an incredible dedication to making sure this place honors those who are laid to rest within the walls.You can spend as little or as much time as you like and you will never be bored and might surprise your self on how many times you say WOW!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McWett

50,Incredible museum and art,We toured Forest Lawn museum and Crucifixion hall today and I have to say that I was blown away! I've traveled all over Europe and I can't believe some of the artwork in our backyard. The painting of the crucifixion is the largest painting in the Western Hemisphere and is truly amazing. The museum has statues from Easter Island and amazing statues by Remington and others. It was pretty close to what you can experience on some church tours in Europe! Really impressive!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/696timothyb
50,Wonderful Experience,A friend told me to visit this Memorial Park in Glendale and we are so happy we did! Just driving into and around the cemetery was a beautiful sight! But the highlight is a hidden gem at the top in the Museum called the Hall of the Crucifixion-Resurrection. It is an auditorium built just for the canvas painting of the Crucifixion which measures about 200 ft by 50 ft! The story of the painting in incredible which you will hear about in the auditorium before the unveiling of the painting. Also make sure you view the Last Supper in the mausoleum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F352TMandream

50,Much More Than A Cemetery,"Whenever we are in the area, we always take the time to visit this cemetery. There is so much there. It's more than just a beautiful, peaceful & well-groomed cemetery. There are several things to see while you're there. First, I would recommend the famous stained glass ""Last Supper"" in the ""Great Mausoleum"". The history of how it came to be is moving. Second, going down one flight from this window, you find ""Poet's Corridor"" where there are multiple stained glass windows to enjoy that depict poetry. Third, would be in the ""Hall of the Crucifixion & Resurrection"" where there is an exhibit of ""Light & Passion"" stained glass pieces to enjoy. There are also several beautiful windows in the main corridor. Fourth, inside the auditorium you will see an enormous painting from the 1890's that depicts the ""Crucifixion"". The story of how it came to be explains exactly what the picture represents & how each biblical character played his/her part in biblical history. It's followed by another painting depicting the ""Resurrection"". Presented well & very informative. Moving experience. Leaving the theater, you exit through the ""Museum"" where there are a lot of pieces of art. The entire cemetery is filled with statues, some are replicas of famous works of art to see. There are also a variety of events, art exhibits & ceremonies during the year. Must check their website for current information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/616KarenC

40,BEAUTIFUL PARK,"The park is a beautiful setting. If you are looking for a favorite movie star or famous person, good luck, they will not tell you where they are as the families have restricted access in that way so you would just have to look and hope you find them, when you see how large this place is you will see that is practically impossible. Beautiful statues and sculptures and memorial markers. The mausoleum is a great place to visit as there is a prominent memorial to Elizabeth Taylor in the main foyer. If your going here go for the beauty of the space, the serenity and the art. Don't go trying to find the graves of the stars because it's almost impossible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sebastian825dlb
10,Boring,"Unfortunately you can't visit the stars because family members have restricted sharing their burial site. Some have memorials but most will be ""by chance"" finds, which if you are visiting the city is a waste of valuable time.

I was even provided with a map which she highlighted for me.I was directed to the great mausoleum and even advised to ask the attendant to play the presentation for us.We parked up outside the Mausoleum instantly recognising the windows of Michael Jacksons resting place from pictures.As advised we spoke to the attendant at the entrance who agreed to play the presentation of the last supper. (Impressive stained glass)I could hardly believe I we were actually in this great building after years of reading about it. There near the entrance we were presented by the huge angel statue and crypt of Elizabeth Taylor.After the last supper presentation we discretely looked in all the different 'rooms' included here Clark Gable & Carol Lombard together with Nat King Cole and several others.We then drove to the freedom mausoleum/surrounding area visiting Walt Disney, Spencer Tracy, Errol Flynn to name a few.Above the Wee Kirk we also found the peaceful resting place of James StewartAll directions courtesy of seeing stars.com which saved us time and effort.We visited the day after Halloween just before 9am. Despite the early hour there were lots of people thoughtfully tending to loved ones graves.

Out GPS took us off of Highway 10, thru downtown and directly to the cemetery.I was disappointed that I wasn't able to find any ""famous people"" - I guess the pictures of the graves I have seen in the past were at the Forest Lawn Hollywood Cemetery. However, once I got over that (it didn't take long!), I was amazed at the sheer size of the cemetery, how well it was kept-up and how beautiful everything was. Very peaceful.My son and I did go into the mousaleum and found it incredibly beautiful. I was disappointed that there were no photos allowed inside, but understand that it is a place to honor those who are deceased, not gawk at them. Inside the mousaleum, there were amazing statues and a gigantic stained glass mural of The Last Supper. Breathtaking! I would have loved to photograph some of those. We did a bit of research on my son's phone and found out that Michael Jackson was buried somewhere in the mousaleum but we did not locate his final resting place.

50,"...wait, we're going where?...","Allow me to let you peek into my world a smidge. I'm a nice Irish-ish Catholic-ish boy from Cleveland Ohio. I only recently have began to travel in a self-directed manner. As a kid, we went on trips with the family up and down the eastern seaboard, usually in my aunt's big Ford conversion van. So attractions that were A) relatively inexpensive and B) accessible by conversion van were where we wound up. Historical sites, forts, Long Island, we hit em all. Also, cemeteries were no big mystery to me either. Older relatives over the years had gone to their final rewards, and the funerals were miniature family reunions of sorts. Good times and sad times all mixed together in one seemingly-neverending event. (For those of you not aware, Irish funerals take forever to wrap up. Hell, musicians write songs about them, presumably while they're still wrapping up.)So on a recent trip to SoCal, the weather was awesome (Cleveland in February gets a bit bleak) so we decided to take a cruise up to Forest Lawn and check it out. It is, quite literally, a park. Hills, trees, statues, sweeping views of the surrounding city, just gorgeous. Most of the cemeteries I've been through are just flat, sad plots of land that nobody really wants to return to after the funeral proceedings wrap up.But I was truly amazed at how welcoming and comforting it was up there. So we drove up top and and went strolling through some of the monuments and checked out some of the features, did some on-the-fly Googling to see who was who, and just enjoyed the afternoon.Go check it out.

Check out http://www.seeing-stars.com/ He has done the work for you. Follow his recommendations for the complete Forest Lawn experience. There is another Forest Lawn in Hollywood Hills (Griffith Park). Both are worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/den979
40,Beautiful and Expensive,"The grounds are gorgeous. When planning a funeral, make sure to pay for individual items rather than the package deal disguised as a money-saving option. You will save thousands by choosing items individually rather than paying for higher priced items that are unnecessary. As with any high ticket item purchase, buyer beware and try to leave the emotions at home. Some salespeople prey on emotions. Otherwise, it is a beautiful one-stop shop for you mortuary needs. Check out other places too, FL isn't the only place that is beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockyndixie

40,Beautiful location,"Our GPS kept leading us past this place at night. We couldn't really tell what it was but we suspected it might be a cemetery based solely on the name. We drove by another day before it was dark and realized we were correct. I was surprised at how beautiful the area was. There was a lot of attention to detail, art sculptures, paintings, and the landscaping was as close to perfect as you can get...especially considering that it's a cemetery! It is definitely in a beautiful location and would have been added to our list of places to visit if we had known more about it ahead of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick

50,Professional Service,"I recently held my mother's funeral at the red church at Forest Lawn and had around 120 family and friends in attendance. My mother had purchased a plot there 10 years prior--just steps away from that red church. From the moment I met with the employees of the Mortuary who planned and executed the funeral, I was impressed with their care, professionalism, attention to detail and everything else--especially since the family was in mourning. I was so impressed with the grounds, the view and the staff, that I purchased another plot for my father last week!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Evelina62
40,Forest Lawn Memorial Park Glendale,"We only had an hour here, but it was much more than we expected. The designer, builder, was responsible for changing cemeteries with tomb stones into lawn covered parks. and small plaques. Lots of good reproductions of Renaissance Italian art and buildings.Allow 2 or three hours to reflect and explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/390judithg

50,It's a beautiful place in mid December,"My family is all here in the Hollywood Hills, I have had a long standing tradition of visiting at Christmas and putting Poinsettias on each grave. I now have six deliveries every year. I am coming down from WA to do this now. It's so beautiful with the wreaths, and fully decorated trees placed on graves. The hills come alive with red poinsettias and red and white flowers everywhere. The grounds are beautifully kept and there are plenty of old growth pine trees everywhere. It's always peaceful and serene and I hope to be able make it every year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momstephano
50,Respectfully Enjoy the Beauty of This Parklike Setting,"Our family has many memories of Forest Lawn. It is where my parents took us to learn to drive before they would turn us loose on the streets. We would stop and feed the ducks, enjoy the Last Supper Window, The museum and Crucifiction painting presentation. Then visit our loved ones who had passed on to heaven. They have a gift and flower shop that is always a pleasure to enter it smells so delicious.I have arranged two funerals with their help. Both were handled beautifully with no regrets and no issues, I am very grateful for their help with keeping everything simple and dignified. I know that I have a place here and know that I too will have dignified ceremony that will leave my children with fond memories of me, and not of the hassle during that sorrowful time of saying their farewells.How fortunate we are that we have such a beautiful place such as Forest Lawn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msag2013

20,Where's Mom?,When my grandfather died in 1946 they bought two grave sites next to one another for him and my grandmother who passed away in 1970. When my mom died we had her cremated and her ashes buried near them. Much to my surprise a few years later the grave site was occupied by someone else. Forest Lawn refused to provide me with an answer stating my mom's ashes were never interred there. The paper work was misplaced during one of the many moves that both myself and my brother made so now we have no proof.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whmike
40,Love This Place,"I have been going to the cemetary for years. I am a cemetary enthusiast and this is one of my favorites. I visit the two baby buriel spots that are heart shaped and you could see the heart shape from a higher level. There is also the statues, the stained glass window and other attractions. This is a wonderful place to visit. The reason I took gave this a four instead of a five is because of Michael Jackson. I don't understand the hero worship of a pedofile and that sometimes people are turned away because there is a ""MJ"" happening. If it wasn't for that, this place would be a perfect 5.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ninachka1
40,Not macabre,"I've only been here to attend actual graveside services, but do not think there is anything dark or macabre about visiting. It's peaceful and quiet, beautifully maintained, and has beautiful things to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
40,Beautiful Memorial Park,"Arrived later in the day and did not get to see what we wanted to see. We wanted to see the paintings, but the last show was at 4:00 and we walked up the steps at 4:01 to watch them shut the door and not let us in. The attendant at the gate gave us directions to the paintings, the museum, and the Great Mausoleum. She directed us to the Great Mausoleum and told us we could get in if we got there by 4:30. However, when we got there, the Mausoleum attendant told us we could not get in, unless we were a relative. The grounds are beautiful and we wished we have more time to experience the beauty of the land, along with trying to find select burial sites. DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE YOU ARRIVE IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO FIND FAMOUS BURIALS! They will not tell you where people are buried. You must do the research yourself. The grounds are huge, so you need to know in advance where you need to go to find burial locations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventureexperience1
50,For peace-seekers,"It's weird to visit a cemetery, it's a cemetery. Yes, there are some interesting things to see, but if you're iffy about cemeteries, you might not like going to Forest Lawn. There is so much to see actually. Just ask for a map and explore. The stillness of the vast cemetery can be so incredibly calming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lenqs
50,Truly a unique place.,"This is a huge property. It combines the feel of a grand cathedral, majestic castle, and mountainside park (also add an art museum) rolled into one. I understand there are over 250,000 interments here including celebrities, dignitaries and the religious. This place is nothing I have ever visited or seen before. You can easily spend a whole afternoon exploring all that is available to see. If you appreciate these kinds of experiences -- art, aesthetics, & architecture -- you will not want to miss this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielCho10
30,Glendale Forest Lawn Memorial Park,"Mediocre rating due to the misinformation provided by the uninformed or uncaring staff.Be sure you have arrived at the correct Forest Lawn since there are many in Southern California. AND arrive early to see the interior exhibits because the buildings CLOSE AT 4:00 p.m. on weekdays, although the Park is open until 6:00 p.m. The information given by the staff and literature is confusing since they both indicate that the ""grounds and mausoleum are open until 6:00 p.m. daylight saving time,"" but when we arrived at the Great Mausoleum to view the La Pieta & Moses Statutes and the Last supper Window at 4:20 p.m. we were told they were closed and we were not allowed entry. We would have visited earlier had the staff at the Museum and/or Crucifixion & Resurrection Paintings had answered correctly when we asked what time the exhibits closed. We were also misinformed that the Wee Kirk o' the Heather chapel would be open, but we found it locked.But we saw the aforementioned paintings and they are really neat. And the David was surprisingly authentic ad would be a treat for children and less travelled adults (we've seen the original in Florence). The grounds are beautiful and we will return with friends in tow.We also visited the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn which is approximately 15 miles west of Glendale. There we saw the beautiful mosaics depicting the Birth of Liberty and scenes fro early American History and the bronze Abraham Lincoln. Sadly the main interior exhibits in the Hall of Liberty are closed on the weekdays. I think creator Hubert Eaton would be disappointed to know that access to his wonderful exhibits is limited during summer weekdays (especially in August when most Europeans vacation. Lastly indoor photos are strictly prohibited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bellauno
50,World's Largest Paintings of Jesus & Last Supper,"I think this is the only place where one can see the largest paintings of Jesus' crucifixion and the last supper in a well guided presentation. In addition, an exhibition of classic motor bikes and serene gardens. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanetG173
40,Relaxing and Beautiful,"We drove up on the Hill to look out over the mountains and the city, beautiful view. The stain glass window of The Last Supper is very nice to see at Forest Lawn and the Museum is nice. They also have a small gift shop. I enjoyed seeing the Song of the Angels painting and the many statues. This is a nice place to go for a quiet relaxing walk while looking at the art. There is no charge to see the Window or the beautiful reproductions. The 16' 9"" tall statue of David stands on top of the hilltop. It is an exact reproduction of Michelangelo's masterpiece. There is a motorcycle museum there also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/623teresaa
50,Peaceful and Beautiful,The Museum and the Last Supper exhibit are sites that are very unique to any cemetery. The views of the valley between Glendale and Los Angeles are worth the visit in and of themselves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doceads
40,Visiting a Friend,"We departed from Alameda Naval Supply Depot in 1964 aboard the USS Zelima AF-49. I came back in 1966, he didn't. I often wondered to Jack. I recently discovered that he was killed in Vietnam in 1966. His parents buried him here, at Forest Lawn, Glendale. His grave is just down the slope from the statue of David. Having never been here before, I was struck the sheer beauty of this cemetery. It's a very peaceful place. R.I.P. Jack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873

30,Dak at night,I went to an evening service at one of the Chapels and finding it was an adventure. A few more lights and couple signs would be a big help to the visitors driving up those hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrotherGrimms
50,Amazing and unexpected,"We went to Forest Lawn Memorial Park just to view the two large paintings-""The Crucifixion"" and ""The Resurrection"". The founder of Forest Lawn, Hubert Eaton, heard about it and shipped it to Los Angeles to restore and display. The Crucifixion is the largest painting. An entire building and auditorium was built just for it. Every hour, there is an audio/video presentation giving the history of the two paintings. There was no charge to see it and no photos allowed. There is a nice little gift shop next to it and you can purchase a much smaller copy of those paintings. There are also nice bathrooms inside the gift shop. We also stopped at Great Mausoleum and it has some very nice things to see. This is very much worth a trip to see as there is so much more. Many movie stars are buried there. Google to get more info and check out the website: http://forestlawn.com/glendale/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cinjebar
40,Really a lovely place to visit,"We have relatives buried here, but even apart from that it's worth a visit. There are large art pieces (like at many Forest Lawn Memorial Parks), but they also have a changing art exhibit in the museum, as well as on-going exhibits of many lovely bronze statues, stained glass etc. And you can't bee the views towards downtown Los Angeles and Glendale from the hill tops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlendaleJ
50,Who Would Have Thunk It? An Awesome Gem in LA,"Yup. Never thought a cemetery would be on my list of ""must see"" in LA, but this is an awe inspiring, and sobering place. World Class Art, Antiquities, the Rich, The Famous, beautiful panoramic views of the San Fernando Valley, History, peace and quiet, solitude, Forest Lawn has it all. It may not seem like your idea of a typical touristy thing to do, but it is well worth the trip to Glendale (not far from DTLA, actually). Try it, you will see what I mean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SledMan
40,Well Kept Grounds & A Lovely Museum,"While visiting the LA area with some friends who were familiar with the area, they suggested we go to Forest Lawn in Glendale. They said there are many celebrities buried there but I responded that I didn't care about seeing the graves of any of them. That's when they mentioned a small, little-known museum on the grounds.We made the trip and were delighted with how tidy the grounds were kept and beautiful the entire area was. From the back of the museum, you could look out over all of Glendale to the north, a lovely sight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/handymanron
50,Best Small Museum in Los Angeles!,"Six Stars if I could. I love small museums. This is a small museum and the quality of the art and the presentation of the art is absolutely phenomenal!!! Yes Pheenomenal!!!There are shows set for a few months and I can hardly wait for the the next one, Oh, and I want to come back to the current show LA Woman, art by 24 (? or more) women of LA. It is top quality. Then the bronzes in the next room are oh so lovely, then the replica of the Paradise Doors, then the church next door that rivals Westminster Abby! (no kidding and I have been there too!) SO if you catch my drift I am excited about this little museum. Just figure out the maze of serpentine roads and get to the top of the hill and be sure to have you camera for the panoramic views of the surrounding area! Double WOW.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleySays
50,Beautifully kept.,"Beautifully manicured and kept grounds. Saw the grave of an old friend in a prominent part of the cemetery. So peaceful and lovely. A great final resting place for my dear, old friend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Askingwhy
50,A family tradition for out of towners.,"Strange as it may seem, one of the first places our family would take out of town visitors was to a cemetery (Forest Lawn Glendale). However, they would always appreciate the beautiful artwork throughout the park and especially the huge painting of the Crucifixion and the mosaic of the Last Supper. The park is just so peaceful and beautiful you just might forget that it is also a cemetery.They used to have a beautiful pond with swans. Since they re-did that area of the park, the pond is now smaller and I don't think they have the swans anymore, but I may be mistaken. Go check it out and see for yourself - worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inajeanb

40,Lots of interesting folk are buried here,This is a beautiful place to drive through. Great picture taking. Michael Jackson and Elizabeth Taylor are among the many famous people that are buried or in one of the mausoleums. I've used the grounds and buildings as subjects for college photo assignments. Forest Lawn has several locations in the southern California area. This is one of the nicest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S25CVannes
50,Very peaceful,The paintings that they have in the auditorium are amazing with the story. I have been there for a funeral and a wedding...both were really nice and a beautiful place to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelshooter71
40,Not for star seeking,I was at Forest Lawn looking up graves of distance relatives. The small plot marks on the ground were hard the read and find. I did find my relatives.The problem with star searching is most every grave is a flat. Thousands of flats. In the nice garden at the back of the cemetery you will find a few. If you want to see stars go to WestWood Cemetery.The Forest Lawn Cemetery staff are great and very helpful but will not give up their secrets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/posson213
50,A spiritual and sacred place,"Some people may hesitate at visiting a memorial park, however, this is no ordinary cemetery. Acres of lush green lawn, an amazing collection of art and statuary, the charming little churches, and the realization that so many families'departed loved ones are buried there gives this place a sense of awe and reverence. The stained glass window of the Lord's Supper is exquisite. The Hall of the Resurrection, a magnificent structure, houses the huge painting of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection, which is so amazing it's hard to describe. Don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KizzysMom
40,A hidden treasure on the hill ...,"Definitely an unexpected place to find a small museum. Great location on top of a hill, overlooking Glendale. It was an awesome place to bring the kids on a quick getaway from the busy town. We checked out the Art of Brick exhibit & the light and color exhibit. Beside the museum displays the crucifixion and resurrection painting...and did I mention it is free?? :))",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tameia
50,Forest Lawn is not just a cemetery!,"When many people think of Forest Lawn, they don't realize that it is so much more than just a cemetery. It is a memorial park, a place to have picnics, jog, have a wedding in one of the lovely chapels, or even see great works of art throughout the park and in their museum. I have been to the Glendale location twice in the last few months and each time I leave overwhelmed with the beauty and the art. During the first visit I was able to see a Chagall exhibit. The last visit offered me the chance to see the most incredible lego sculpture exhibit that one can imagine. If you are in the Glendale, don't pass up this opportunity to see and share the great works of art and the serenity and beauty that Forest Lawn has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamasan47
40,Mom's Buried at the Hollywood Hills location,Easily accessible location; good service; growing each year; get to wave at mom and our departed friends as we travel north. Also offers several historical exhibits that are tastefull and interesting to visit if you can. Stop by the chapels too. Glendale is a nice location to visit for exhibits of a more religious nature.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlendaleGirl1
50,Odd place for a wedding?,"While many people come here to pay respects or grieve we came to a wedding located at the Church of Recessional. When we pulled up at the information booth in the parking lot, I was sure we were lost. The church is at the top of the hill and aside from the odd feeling of driving by a mile of headstones, it was a fabulous location. Beautiful, ornate old building in a great setting.I really liked it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415SteveB
50,Just like the Song,A very beautiful serene well kept cemetery. Nice and peaceful and reminds me of the song by John Denver. Ooh lay me down in Forest Lawn. I know it may sound creepy but there are BEAUTIFUL Cemetarys out there. it gives you a sense of peace and serenity to visit. You forget about life for a while and it really does give you time to be humble and reflect. I have been to Arlington many times but have always wnated to visit Forrest Lawn so I am very glad that I got a chance to visit on my recent trip to Calif. The grounds keepers need to be commended on the cleanliness and gerat care they take in keeping the appearance of this beautiful place up. I highly recomed a visit if youa re in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRAVELDEB_10

50,Finding a gem in the most unusual of places,"I'm a bit of a cemetery hound to begin with, so it is no surprise that while 'visiting' my in-laws here for the first time I was compelled to have a look around. My poor husband. The grounds are massive and beautifully kept. The views are paramount. Go ahead, get out of your car and poke around. Treasures are hidden everywhere. Peace and quiet in the midst of a large noisy city. What most amazed me was the museum. I searched it out in order to get some answers about the cemetery. My mission soon took a left turn when we walked into this free admission museum. Not what I was expecting at all. I came for answers which I didn't get, but I left with a whole lot more. At the time we went (Apr 2013) there was an exhibit featuring Marc Chagall's art. Fabulous. More discoveries included an entire massive room with bronzes featuring everything conceivable that one could sculpt. Tucked among these treasures was a selection of beautiful stained glass. We did go to the Great Mausoleum. We did ring the buzzer. We figured it could hurt right? It didn't hurt, but they didn't let us in either. That's ok, plenty of other things to do and see. If you have a couple of hours that you're looking to fill, I would put this place on the itinerary!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CLHow
40,Beautiful Grounds and Architecture,Forest Lawn is stunningly beautiful and serene. Well worth a trip if only to escape the hustle bustle of the area. There is a museum that has outstanding stained glass and statues. Before we went we assumed we could wander around looking for celebrities but they do not permit this out of respect to them and their families.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grokker
40,A very large but beautiful cemetery,"A must do for cemetery enthusiasts and for those who like to seek out famous graves. The cemetery is very big so get a map at the front gates. Management will not tell you where stars are buried so do some research before going to get an idea of who you would like to visit and what their location is. Most famous resting places are not available for public view which was a bit disappointing. For those that are in the Great Mauseleom, please note that you cannot take pictures and are only allowed limited access to the first floor. Most hallways are chained off so you can only get a distant views of certain tombs like Elizabeth Taylor and George Burns. Others like Michael Jackson and Clark Gable are resting on the lower levels and there is no public access. Others are buried out on the grounds. Some are available for viewing like Jimmy Stewart and Errol Flynn, others are locked away in gardens such as Humphrey Bogart and Sammy Davis Jr.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjsanchez

Walt disney was my favorite spot Any way i'd always wondered why so popular it is beautiful Hosts not only graves...but also weddings...gave me new perspective In mueseum...they have free audio tour over phone (so really is free site) be sure you go to Glendale location as there are several (but it seemed to be THE one) http://www.seeing-stars.com/buried2/ForestLawnHollywood1.shtml,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BTMNSP
40,It's Unlike Other Cemeteries,"This popped up on my Tripadvisor list of things near me and I couldn't help but post a review. I have several family members at Forest Lawn, including both parents who are in the Freedom Mausoleum and my grandparents, who are neighbors with Walt Disney!I've lived in Glendale my entire life and have been visiting as a young child. For most of my life, it was the only cemetery that I had ever visited. Now that I am older, had to plan a few funerals and have visited other cemeteries, I realize that Forest Lawn is sort of creepy.First, the sheer enormity of it is staggering. It's absolutely massive.It's part a respectful place for families and part tourist trap. It has a museum and gift shop. The whole property is full of pipped in music and interactive statues. It's super clean and perfect looking, almost like a master planned community for the dead. It's the Stepford of cemeteries!Now that my mom has died and I have no one forcing me to visit, I don't go. I've been a few times since my mom has passed and I always just want to leave. It's creepy and uncomfortable.I wouldn't want to be buried here either. It feels cold and impersonal. I gave it four stars, because all of the technical aspects are nice and it is quite unilke any other cemetery that you have ever visited.Read the chapter on Forest Lawn in the book L.A. Bizarro. It nails it!Please visit my blog for more reviews and musings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenH644

Worth taking a drive to see this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SilverLake2TheWorld
40,Unique Venue,"Just a great place to walk around and relax. Slightly off the usual tourist spots. The various locations on the vast property have different auras about them. The architecture is very interesting, from gorgeous to strange. Well worth a trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/junnyd2018
50,"Very Beautiful, But Not a Tourist Trap","Forest Lawn in Glendale is amazing in terms of its landscaping and the beauty of the mausoleums. It is, however, a place where tourists in search of the graves of many famous individuals could become upset if the expectation is for unrestricted access to these sites. I can understand why the families of celebrities pay top dollar for burials at Forest Lawn because security is tight. The public is allowed into many areas, such as into the Grand Mausoleum where you can see Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper window (which is unveiled every thirty minutes during business hours), but do not expect to get direct views of Michael Jackson's crypt at Holly Terrace. These areas are locked and are off limits to non-authorized guests. Some graves are very visible, such as that of Elizabeth Taylor. Still, the area is beautiful and is a worthwhile visit for tourists in the L.A. area. I recommend the Westwood Memorial Cemetery in West Los Angeles for more intimate viewing of many other stars' gravesites, such as Marilyn Monroe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brandon_Olive
40,Unique impression,"Touring a cemetery is hardly a joyous attraction, though seeing these names, many in distinct script or typeface, leaves quite the impression. Do call the help desk to find out what locations can be given out (some families withhold this) and do have a map to specifically locate the locations when given. The place is huge and it's not easy to find specific celebs without a good map (and the one provided there is not a good one). Forst Lawn is free and serene for those not taken back by the setting/situation. Thanks for noting if this review helped you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HepAdvisor
50,Have to see to believe it.,"Words can't begin to describe this place. Prepare to spend at least an entire day to wander. This was L.A.'s biggest tourist attraction before Disneyland was built. A ton of L.A. and Hollywood famous are buried here, however, you better do your homework if you want to see a specific burial place, as they will not tell you where anyone famous is. A great place to take kids to learn about art and history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobboLA818
40,Hard to Remember It's a Cemetery,"Forest Lawn has done a wonderful job of creating a peaceful, serene place with works of art that soothe the soul.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JSW842
40,Oddly appealing,"I went to a friend's funeral here in January, and I had forgotten how FL is a whole world unto itself. There's an art gallery and all kinds of interesting buildings, plus lovely views. Someday I'll go under cheerier circumstances.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATripp

50,"After you visit the cemetery, stop at the little museum on the hill...","It is one of THE best hidden secrets in the museum world and it's free. There is also a chapel next door where every hour there is a 15 minute show of a famous painting, complete with lighting, a narrator and it all takes place in a HUGE empty theater.It blows my mind that besides the fact that there are over 30,000 folks interred there, both famous and infamous, there is so much beautiful art, inside and out. The grounds are incredibly well cared for the place is spotless.This is an all day visit for sure and make sure your camera is charged and ready to go. Bring good walking shoes and as always, in good cemeteries and masoleums, there are clean and accessible restrooms.There are a ton of famous celebrities here (Michael Jackson for one but you can't even get close to that guy) but it is really the art and architecture that you are visiting for. It truly boggles the mind how much money people will spend on their last resting place. Once you enter the different masoleums and see the different area covered in marble, intricate paintings, gold leaf and more, you will leave shaking your head.Be respectful, don't bring your kids but be prepared for the day to fly by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CBTL2019
40,Burial icon,Impressive park like cemetery. To see the site of the final resting place of so many celebrities was a promising experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paladin749
50,Don't miss Walt Disney,"Beautiful serene place. If you go up to the top of the mountain, to the masoleum that honors veterans, just to the left you'll see a little gate. Walt Disney's shrine is in there behind the bushes. Errol Flynn is buried just beyond that, inside the walled area. Some areas are off limits to tourists, so please ask if you are unsure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MountainTraveler096
50,Unique place to bring your friends...SERIOUSLY!!,"I know it sounds creepy to got to a cemetary for an outing, but you should go to Forest Lawn. There is so much to see! First of all, the view from the top of the hill is one of the best in the city. Next, there is so much art to view, from a replica of the statue of David, to a famous stained glass of the last supper; there is just too much to see in one day. If you have any favorite old movie stars, chances are, some of them are buried here and with a little effort, you'll be able to visit their graves. I've been several times and still haven't seen all there is to see. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinascucina

50,A hidden treasure,"This place was AWESOME! I have always wondered what the big castle looking thing off the 5 freeway was, so we went to find out. The Grand Mausoleum is beautiful. We were able to go in and watch the ""Last Supper"" session and wonder through some of the halls. We also visited the Church of the Resurrection Crucifixion to see the amazing architecture there and the paintings. The grounds are beautiful and we loved walking around all the cute little churches. It was a peaceful place full of beauty. It is a wonderful Sunday afternoon acitivity!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HammersPrincess
50,Love it,Gorgeous Cemetery. Stopped to see the stained glass window and Elizabeth Taylors crypt. We also stopped by the doorway to Michael Jackson. This cemetery is very well kept and just gorgeous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolB856
50,Forest Lawn Memorial-Park: A beautiful respite from daily problems...,"Forest Lawn Memorial-Park & Mortuary in Glendale, CA is perhaps the most famous of all funeral care establishments, anywhere! Forest Lawn is synonymous with the highest of integrity, dignity, and professionalism. America is fortunate to have Forest Lawn in Glendale because some of the finest art and sculpture--some actual reproductions of Michelangelo--of the finest Italian art and other art found anywhere. Most of the art is original and in keeping with the founder Dr. Hubert Eaton's vision, as expressed in his 'The Builder's Creed,' engraved on a wall just outside of the Great Mausoleum. One can always find a most peaceful setting and even a somewhat joyous feeling throughout the entire Forest Lawn compound! I have visited there many times and each time I find some art I had never seen on previous visits. Take a day and visit this remarkable place.And also one must see the huge oil painting relating to 'Pentecost' and the large 'Last Supper' stained glass window. Simply remarkable and worth your time!Charles A. FisherJoplin, Missourie-mail: Charles@CharlesFisher.net",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Professional59
40,Beautiful,"Here's the truth about Forest Lawn: it's basically a cemetery. Yes, there are some interesting things to see, but if you're iffy about cemeteries, you might not like going to Forest Lawn. That being said, it's probably one of the most beautiful places in Glendale with acres of rolling green hills (even nicer before they started remodeling the pond area that had the ducks and such). It's definitely something that's a bit off the regular tourism track, but if for whatever reason it's piqued your interest, I'd say stop by. Some famous people are buried there also, but information will definitely not give you the info about them (have to google the info).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hreshtag1
