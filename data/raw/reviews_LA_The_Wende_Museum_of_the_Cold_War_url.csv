30,Wish they had more of their collection displayed; more of a gallery with traveling art,"The Wende Museum is a Cold War art museum, historical archive, and educational institution in Culver City. I stopped by with my husband and my brother during a visit to LA this past week. We arrived around 11/12 on a Saturday, and it wasn't busy. Admission to the museum is free. When we visited (and through April 5, 2020), the museum was hosting an exhibition: ""The Medea Insurrection: Radical Women Artists Behind the Iron Curtain."" The exhibit was the bulk of what was available to see in the museum (the museum is essentially one large room and the exhibition took up almost all the space). The art in the exhibition was okay. I was much more interested in what they had displayed in the hallways with books on either side of the gallery space: spy equipment used in the USSR, consumer products form the USSR, sculptures/busts of historic figures, and more. I found myself wishing that the museum just displayed items from their permanent collection, rather than displaying art exhibits in the majority of the space. But it's more a gallery for temporary exhibits with a few teases of what's in their permanent collection displayed. Worth a visit if you're in Culver City, if you're VERY interested in the Cold War, or if there's an exhibit you're interested in, but probably not worth going out of your way for otherwise. I'd love to go back if they're ever displaying more artifacts from their permanent collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisrachelletx
50,Well Worth My Time to Visit,"I’d been curious about this museum since seeing the pieces of the Berlin Wall they own that are staged on Wilshire Blvd across from LA County Museum of Art. Wende permanent space is awesome, contemporary and clean. The location was originally built in 1949 as a National Armory. They have a beautifully planed sculpture garden. While there, I enjoyed the temporary exhibit, works by women from behind the wall. I especially spent a lot of time with a long video of photos with subtitles taken by Tina Bara during the mid 80s which chronicles her life with friends. This was fascinating for me because I, at the same age did a lot of world traveling. Lots of free parking makes this a very easy place to visit. Free admission too. Check their website to make sure they are open on the day you want to visit. It isn’t open every day of the week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
50,Worth coming to Culver City to visit The Wende,The most unique and surprising museum in Culver City. The exhibits portray themes related to topics that you'd not see elsewhere. The Cold War display is interesting as are the posters. The changing exhibits are topical and best understood with a docent.Great and easy parking. Lots of information online.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheEcoMom
30,"Permanent collection great, but temporary one not good","I hope that the museum adds temporary exhibits that are similar to the permanent one so it is worthwhile. The Womens/Modern Art exhibit was just horrible, and we breezed through it fairly quickly. We tried to get something out of it, but alas, no. We drove all the way from Orange County, and felt like it was a lot of time and gas wasted. The permanent exhibit was small but really great. THAT is what people want to see!!!! And a plaque mentioned that the museum has a lot of Cold War video, yet shows none...? This museum has so much potential, but has really missed the mark. I assumed that the negative reviews on Tripadvisor were just negative people, but they were accurate. I know that the museum is free, but even so, it just isn't worth a 45 minutes each way drive to see the little bit of interesting items. Until they change the temporary exhibits to ones that are more like the permanent collection.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonG420
30,one needs to supply one's own context,"Really a 3.5, don't let the '3' keep you away. Interesting variety of cold war objects, but displayed without much context. I can, since I was a polysci major back in the day (and remember Russia in the mid-80's, not a fun place even when they tried to show the good face), but I feel the average person might wander through, look at the communication equipment and wander back out again. Clips played on monitors were interesting, I could (did) soend a fair amount of time with them. Physcially large space, but it kind of dwarfs the collection - unless you read Russian - I sense one could make good use of the reference works. Free and free parking too, so take a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
50,Unique and free with parking!,"I am sure that the word unique pops up many times in reviews of this museum but that does not mean it is not true - just a cliché. Not many museums devote themselves to this somewhat dark and drab period but this one tries (I think successfully) to illuminate it. The building (previously an armory) is nice and light with a pretty, quiet, little garden and though the 'permanent collection' of documents may seem a little dreary to non academics but there are still enough quaint pieces to amuse - so one is not all that dependent on the current exhibit. It is free, has easy free parking so that though it is not the Getty it is worth an hour or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricom777
50,Fascinating Museum in a totally unexpected location,"This started out as a museum with a huge collection of artifacts from the former East Germany under Russian rule. Nobody in Germany seemed to want all of this stuff, and the founder said he'd find a home for it in the USA. So here is all of this stuff you'd expect to see at a museum in Germany right here in Culver City, California. It's small, so the exhibits are always rotating and changing, but always fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reel3d
50,Great historical perspective,"This is a special themed museum you won’t find anywhere else in Southern California. The creator housed his collection in the warehouse area of Culver City until he could secure a permanent home. It has wonderful rotating exhibits and the staff is knowledgeable. For those interested in the Cold War period, this is the place to come.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/113crystala
50,Unique and wonderful gem in Culver City,Excellent composite history of GDR and Cold War. Impressive display of communist and Eastern Block artifacts — display items rotate. I highly recommend the Tito/Africa exhibit as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adam1926
50,Worth a visit!,"We live in San Diego and spend a few weekends each year in Los Angeles. We visited on our most recent trip and highly recommend it. My husband and college-aged son are well-read and have always loved history, especially military history. I lack the interest and educational background in history but found the exhibits very interesting. It was worth checking out and we'll definitely visit again since the exhibits change.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandybeaches858
50,Great history museum,Tremendous ccollection. Free. Really neat. Highly recommended for lovers of history and the cold war.not crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/421vinceb
30,It Depends,"This is a difficult museum to review (or recommend) because what you will experience seems to depend wholly on what temporary exhibitions happen to be there when you visit. To the extent that the museum has any permanent collection, you will see only a few random glass cases filled with objects that have little description and no real context.When I was there, I saw a very interesting exhibit of poster-style art from the end of the Soviet Union and start of the Russian Federation. There was also a small exhibit from a North Korean artist (cold war??) and a small sampling of contemporary art by Shepard Fairey, who did the Obama poster (what that has to do with the cold war is also a mystery). The staff is great and I enjoyed the tour.Bottom line: It was worth the hour I spent and I suggest you find out what the exhibits are to see if they would interest you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelDreamin
50,Cold War,"It was a worthwhile local visit to see a comprehensive collection of Cold War art.Although it's a view into past, maybe it's also offers a glimpse into the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMOgal
40,Don't let the name fool you. Unique,What a surprise of a museum. The name might give the impression of dreary dank and dark...NOT SO. This wonderful space is a changeable gallery with so much to offer.We timed our visit so we could take a docent tour. Lucky us that we had the full attention of our very bright guide. Her knowledge of each item in the exhibit complete and very interesting.We're looking forward to the next exhibit and the docent tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheEcoMom
50,An expertly curated celebration of art's power to question authority,"The Wende Museum may be in a spot that's a bit hard to find. Tucked away in an unassuming former armory in Veteran's Memorial Park, from a distance it may look like a bank but on the inside it's one of LA's best free museums.Be sure to schedule your trip around their tours. Usually they do a few over the course of weekend afternoons. The curator here is young and incredibly passionate about post-Soviet artwork and the enthusiasm for the work here is contagious. If you can't schedule around a tour, just be sure to have the Soundcloud app installed on your phone and listen to their guided tour.The work in the museum is extraordinary and it speaks for itself. It explores ideas of propaganda, control and anxieties in authoritarian regimes. The work is timeless but it's incredibly profound within our current political climate. In addition to Post-Soviet works, they have contemporary pieces too. Currently they have a dozen or so works from street artist Shepard Fairey and a side exhibition as well as works from Sun Mu, a North Korean refugee who makes political works in the style of the propaganda he worked on there.The collection rotates every few months so be sure to come back a several times a year. They have a beautiful garden in the back so you can easily spend a comfortable few hours here. This makes it a surprisingly good date but honestly there's something here for everyone. The lesson of using art to challenge authority is one I feel a lot can really treasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coldermilk
50,Historically relevant exhibitions in a great space,"This small, niche museum in Culver City has a comprehensive, thought- provoking collection of Cold War art and artifacts, plus a world class research archive, a piece of the Berlin Wall out front, restful gardens and good parking. ""Crumbling Empire: the power of Dissident Voices"", currently on until June, 2019, displays powerful graphic art (posters) of the Soviet Era, brilliantly rendered political commentary, alongside Shepard Fairey's work. Oppression and liberation themes tie past to present. The Sun Mu (North Korean defector) exhibit likewise displays a journey from propaganda to artistic freedom.For those of us who can easily become overwhelmed at sheer volume of material in larger museums, the scale of the Wende hits the sweet spot. A great museum, we will definitely return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/windingroad2019
50,Life Behind the Iron Curtain,This is an excellent museum about the cold war with some interesting artifacts. It is plenty of parking and is located in Culver City.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilbert2015
50,Fascinating! Makes you wonder...,"I've wondered for a long time how anyone can be sure their government and media are accurately portraying situations. Surely, every government and media system promotes their own version of the truth. Would be interesting to see exhibits comparing how the same events are reported across different countries. Excellent museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lupita1868

50,Amazing Museum - Haven't Seen Anything Like It.,"I love the open space of this museum. I recently visited the latest exhibits featuring Sun Mu's artwork, Nicole Weingart's L.A. Air Raid Sirens photographs and Shepard Fairey's artwork. The staff is very friendly and it is wonderful to have a Cold War museum available to Angelenos and all visitors.I absolutely loved the photos of the Air Raid Sirens by Nicole Weingart featured in the East German guard post - VERY COOL and unique. The pictures show an L.A. era long forgotten, which was a scary reality during the Cold War. Not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoloDLos
50,North Korean Exhibit,"The two exhibits about dissident art was amazing. In particular having Sun Mu, a North Korean artist, was illuminating because he captures the social and political realities of the human condition there. The movie, I Am Sun Mu, helps frame how DPRK is the front line of the Cold War today. If you have any interest in North Korean art or human rights you should go see this beautiful, thoughtfully curated exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionacR9271KI

They have an extensive library.We have enjoyed several receptions and exhibit openings. Have not yet enjoyed the music night there, but hope to soon.

50,A Definite Gem!,"We visited this small, but wonderful museum with two teens and several adults and all loved it! It is beautifully designed and curated. Exhibits included a section called Red Shoes: Love, Politics, and Dance During the Cold War. It featured pictures, newspaper articles, a film, and letters. There was also an extensive Russian language library where you could handle the books, an exhibit on the psychological aspects of the Cold War, toys and household items from the Cold War era, pieces of the Berlin Wall, and beautiful artwork including an entire wall of windows painted to look like a theater curtain from a building in Russia. There is a small gift shop with books, t-shirts, postcards, and artwork for sale. There were also small items such as pins and ornaments. My favorite part of the museum was the outdoor area. It was beautifully landscaped with lots of small seating areas. There was a guard house and a Soviet-era car outside as well as a water feature. We spent a little over an hour here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T196SXstephaniem

40,Worth your time,"A free and informative look at our recent history. The Cold War is rarely covered in school in the US. This is a gem of a find near downtown Culver City. Would be a great family outing and prompt much discussion. There is a little bit for everyone, from your typical posters and propaganda to fine art and decorative wares. Will bring my parents when they visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/googlyeyed

50,Gem in the middle of Culver City!,"The Wende Museum was such a surprise and not what I expected at all! Justin, and the rest of the museum staff were so welcoming and informative of all the pieces the museum holds. All the Cold War memorabilia was organized in different collections, but interesting and distinctive collections such as an area dedication to the psychological and mental affect the Cold War had on citizens, which personally was my favorite part of the museum. Our museum tour guide was extremely knowledgeable about every single artifact, video, or painting at the Wende, it was such a pleasure listening to him. You do not need to know anything about the Cold War to visit and enjoy the Wende, and another huge plus is that it is free to the public! If you’re a fan of history in any way, I highly recommend visiting this gem in the middle of Culver City, you will not be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashzendedel

I will definitely tell my friends and family about this place and come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/863franki
50,A Culver City Gem,"My trip to the Wende was nothing short of incredible!I was fortunate enough to be able to go on this museum tour with a group of interested and engaged students, but what made my experience that much more memorable was the insight that our tour guide Joes was able to give on the pieces on display. What is especially cool is that what was on display was only a fraction of what the museum has in its collection. If I'm ever in the Culver City area again, I know exactly where to go.Hands down one of my favorite museum experiences!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EDAAB
50,Extensive Archive & Great Museum,"Perhaps the best part about the Wende Museum is that it hardly seems like a museum. Located in a nondescript building that once functioned as a U.S. National Guard Armory during the Cold War, it blends into its surroundings in a quiet suburb of Culver City.Inside the Wende, it is immediately apparent that the museum is in fact an archive for Cold War memorabilia, rather than an elaborate, educational experience. In my opinion, this setup is for the better--as a Cold War aficionado, I enjoyed that rather than peddling a specific narrative about the history of the Cold War, the Wende Museum simply contained topical exhibits, each displaying various items ranging from paintings to letters, and busts to crockery. As Joes, our wonderful guide, described, the objective of the museum was to provoke thought about the Cold War and its effects on the daily lives of people, rather than to provide a prescriptive history of its events. Looking at photographs of rocket-like playground structures in Minnesota (built to commemorate the space race), reading about mind-control hysteria and experiments in the 60s and 70s, and studying posters instructing people about how to react in the event of a nuclear attack were sobering and provided a new insight into the pervasiveness of the Cold War in societies around the world.The Youth Exhibition was particularly illuminating, as it highlighted how the Cold War affected the lives of youth in the US and tbe Soviet Union. It was jarring to discover how similar the two societies were in many ways--from girl scout uniforms to board games depicting nuclear annihilation--especially given the overarching depiction in the West of the Eastern Bloc as a backwards, illiberal society. Despite the lack of a central narrative, the Wende Museum tells a story; one that I feel is increasingly relevant to understanding our multipolar world.I went to the Wende Museum as part of a UCLA Fiat Lux class, and owe my gratitude to Professor Teofilo Ruiz from UCLA, Chief Curator Joes Segal, and Founder (and UCLA alumnus) Dr. Justinian Jampol for facilitating our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanmayzing
50,A Great Museum to Learn and Enjoy,"It is a beautiful place, there’s even a garden, to learn more about similarities rather than differences between both sides during the Cold War. This is a great museum that presents exhibits that weave together American and Soviet narratives. I felt very welcomed and the curatorial staff provided us with great knowledge about the objects on display. I highly recommend tours for high school groups, especially students studying world or US history. I have left the museum more interested in the Cold War era and its cultural products.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vic_tonasc
50,UCLA TRIP!,I had the most amazing time at The Wende Museum of the Cold War. I learned so much and found myself to be so interested. The garden was breath-taking and I also saw some amazing artwork. The museum is also free and they have a gift shop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleykermani
50,The Wende Museum: More Than Cold War History,"At first glance it may seem like the Wende Museum is for a niche group of history buffs to enjoy, but the quality and scope of the collection is quite mind-blowing. The museum acts as an archive to the Cold War, but topics range from concept art and ballet dancing to brainwashing and spy equipment. I was told exhibits are constantly rotated, with only about 30% of the collection able to be shown at a time. The current exhibit’s collection of brainwashing and mind control artifacts was eye opening for the various interpretations by the public and different governments. As a former US National Guard Armory built during the beginning of the Cold War, the museum building itself only heightens the experience. I highly recommend taking a stop at the Wende Museum in Culver City, if for nothing more than to see some of the unusual objects on display at this one of a kind location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dfmartyn
50,UCLA Tour,"The Wende Museum is a great place to learn about the Cold War through many different artifacts. The museum holds artifacts from every aspect of the war, and from many different countries. It has various exhibits that portray how the museum influenced people of all ages. For example, they have an exhibit that focuses on children of the Cold War, and the type of games they used to play with. I was also told that they often change their exhibits, because they cannot display all of their artifacts at once. It is worth visiting this museum more than once if you are really fascinated by the Cold War.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A709MFjacquelineb
50,Weekend at the Wende: a gem of Cold War history,"The entire concept of the museum and the museum itself is quite amazing. Seeing the history of life in the Eastern Bloc through the pieces collected by the founder during his travels is truly a different museum experience. The place is small, but it is full of stories and artefacts; the guided tour by Joes Segal brought to life many of the pieces and allowed a glimpse of the ramifications of everything from ballet to children's board games. The exhibits rotate, and I am definitely interested in coming back to see what new aspects of the Cold War the Wende displays!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srahman213
50,The Wenderful Museum,"The museum is staffed by amazing, friendly people who are there at every step to offer guidance, assistance, or clarification to any questions that you may have. The displays themselves are wonderful as well; some are funny, others are beautiful, and some are chilling. The Wende portrays the Cold War in a perspective unlike anything one has ever seen before, and it offers insight into the daily lives of ordinary human beings on both sides of the conflict.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenStone1998
50,A Wonderful Tour of the Wende through UCLA Course,"Beautiful and compelling museum! The Wende depicts an extremely unbiased portrait of the cold war, and how both the Soviet Union and the United States perpetuated the conflict. As well as artistic responses to the cold war, the museum contains a plethora of primary sources from the forties to the nineties. A film reel projects almost comical propaganda from both the East and the West, and the walls are stacked almost floor to ceiling with books from the USSR. No single source can contain the pervasiveness of the nuclear war frenzy and fear. However, when I left the Wende, I understood for the first time how inevitable nuclear destruction seemed during the cold war, and how unbelievably lucky we are to have avoided it. The museum was fascinating and chilling and I can’t wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phil-lankel
50,A trip to the Wende through UCLA Fiat Lux,"The Wende is a must-see for anyone interested in the history of Eastern Europe and the USSR. Easily accessible by public transit, the Wende boasts an impressive collection of artifacts and a peaceful garden with outdoor exhibits. The diversity among the enormous collection of primary sources is staggering. There are walls stacked with Soviet-era books, posters and videos of the period, and technological relics such as radios and spy equipment. The tour was hugely fascinating and our guide was very receptive to our questions. Visit here to see some very unique pieces of history right in Culver City.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightseer62588992311

50,Wende Tour through UCLA course,"Since learning about the Cold War in high school, I have been jumping at opportunities to learn more about the Soviet Union, such as taking a course of Soviet Union in Central Europe. I visited the Wende Museum through an undergraduate UCLA seminar and was excited by the diverse collection of artifacts and artwork they had for the current exhibitions. It was amazing to see how well preserved many of the things were, such as the some of the still functioning electronics. It was interesting to be able to tie many of the objects, propaganda, and artwork to what I had learned in my course. I will come again if I can!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/389samihar
50,Very Beauitfully Organized Museum,"I really love my trip here. Eventhough the Museum is small, they packed a lot of historically artifacts here.

I really like the logo of the Wende (a W on too and M on the bottom, very chic). Hope everyone come for visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture42606429721
50,Very excellent exhibits!,"The Wende Museum is an excellent source to visit for Cold War material culture. The materials that they have are quite extensive, and the staff were very kind and helpful in telling us about the exhibits. Since they have lots of different art pieces and materials, the exhibit changes every few months. Currently, there is an exhibit about ballet in the Cold War era that is very interesting in framing the differences between the Soviets and the U.S., so be sure to check that out soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/930kristim
50,Important historical museum,"My husband and I visited the Wende Museum with a friend who had been a docent there and had a part in producing the large book on life in East Germany during the Cold War. The museum is devoted to research as well as display and education. It had recently been moved to the former Armory and used most of the space for major temporary exhibits, but there were also displays of items in the museum's collection and a vast collection of books. Entry to the garden behind the museum was closed because of a special event, but the landscaping in front of the building is attractive. There is a website with information about current and future exhibitions and concerts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryTraveler2

Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Californiagirl388
50,I REALLY enjoyed this museum!,"I highly recommend this museum to anyone visiting Southern California. I grew up during the Cold War and traveled to the Soviet Union and to the Soviet block countries--Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia--in 1968 as a student. I felt like I was entering a time capsule and teleported back to those days and my Cold War experiences as a student. The displays are very informative and interesting. The videos are awesome. Be sure to visit the gardens outside the museum. The staff is VERY friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobca1947
50,Great exhibits in an amazing new space,"This is an amazing place! Great exhibits and the tour was fascinating.

40,Cold war history,This small museum is beautifully designed. It provides depth and context to the 1950 to 1980 period of western history as the United States and the Soviet union played chicken with each other and kept the entire world on edge. The programing and exhibits inform our present.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindza
50,Incredible place I never knew existed,"Had a really great trip here with a few friends the other day. The space is really nice, and definitely recommend checking out the garden.

40,Beautiful garden,"We stopped by this free museum because we needed to do something for a little while before our flight out of LAX (~18 min from the museum). It turned out to be a hidden gem. If you remember the cold war, or want to spend about a hour learning about it, this is a worthwhile stop.

50,Excellent impartial view of the Cold War,"I came here as part of the free museums day to see the American point of view of the Cold War but I was happily surprised by how unbiased the museum is.I watched the “war of nerves” and “red shoes” exhibits and attended the talk on “Women in the Cold War”, I loved everything and I believe it is an excellent place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carina_815

50,A breath of fresh air in the middle of Culver City,"I've visited the Wende Museum multiple times, and must say that I will never get enough. Instead of alter to honor Cold War America, the Wende Museum actually shines some light on how Eastern Europe and America were actually quite alike at the time, and influenced each other in many ways. A breath of fresh air in the middle of Culver City. With a humongous collection, this museum is definitely worth a visit, as you will not be disappointed. As well as for the expert, as for the person who is not yet familiar with the subject (there's always people walking around with great knowledge, willing to share). And if you're done being educated, there's a beautiful garden where you can sit down and have a drink.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/semnas
40,THE WENDE MUSEUM,"The Wende Museum of the Cold War in Culver City is a unique display of visual and material culture from the Cold War, accessible also to visitors, like me, who are not familiar with the subject. I never thought to be intrigued in such an extent by dance during the Cold War and Soviet art and visual culture. I will definitively visit the next exhibitions!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/riccard0banfi
50,Gem... not sure if it i hidden,"Culver City is full of surprises. The Wende was one for me. This museum is a collection of Cold War items and artifacts, most from the communist perspective. As a Gen X man who very much grew up on the capitalist side of that divide (My father worked in aerospace here in SoCal.) and as a history buff I found the Wende absolutely compelling. If you are into American history at all - esp. recent history - this place is a L.A. must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnWSmart
50,Wonder Museum,We have to several events. The talks are interesting and fun. There is also a beautiful out area for viewing and relaxation. Make sure to check it out when you are in the area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inglovelaura
50,Fun insight into the Cold War. A trip back in time! Easy and enjoyable!,"Very worth the trip. Fun and easy to do. It was the real deal. Missiles and power facing off against each other. The museum offers great insight to what was going on. The pictures, films, maps, descriptions of events, documents, library/books and paraphernalia are amazing. The Cuban missile crisis was frightening at the time and is covered in the exhibit. I really enjoyed the peak into what was happening on the other side.I highly recommend a great museum like no other in the US.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FellowTraveler542990
50,"Enlightening Museum, a Los Angeles treasure to tour","The Wende Museum is a window of opportunity to explore the unique era of the Cold War. Artifacts, maps and more detail the Iron Curtain and the division of Europe at a time when information about such countries was limited by the Soviet Union. This is an enlightening and fascinating collection to view. I wholeheartedly recommend a visit to this attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Educator309
50,A Uniquely Satisfying and Illuminating Museum Experience,"To begin: you won't find anything quite like it in the United States. The Iron Curtain may have fallen long ago (and perhaps replaced with a new, gauzy scrim developed in the current Putin Era), but this wonderfully unique and quirky collection--part artifact, part illustration, all fascinating--highlights and illuminates a foggy era in world history.While the collection focuses on Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, it makes the museum visitor newly aware of the global implications of this odd interregnum in world history. The building is inviting, the staff is friendly and informed (one was happy to explain differences between the Soviet and Eastern European approach to a variety of socialisms... and in fascinating detail), and the larger grounds are both comfortable and humane: a beautiful, Southern California garden in a tranquil and thoughtful setting.Did I remember to include the extraordinary library that surrounds the main collection? A wall of books and literary memorabilia?The vast and immense collections that constitute institutions like The Met, National Gallery, or Library of Congress are always stunning in their breadth, but the human scale and intimacy of experiences like this exceptional and idiosyncratic institution are moving in their own right. Don't leave Southern California without seeing The Wende.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dut2nclan
50,Civil liberties and democracy,"A young institution with a focus on Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union from 1945-1990, the Wende Museum of the Cold War is a great asset to Southern California and has much to offer to visitors as much as locals. Its unique and fascinating collections include art, design, and daily-life objects created in societies controlled by authoritarian regimes and outright dictatorships. Beyond learning about the past of a specific region during the highly polarized conflict of the two Cold War superpowers, your experience visiting this museum may most importantly lead you to ponder about the value of civil liberties and the benefits and responsibilities of living in a democracy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarAway737337
50,One of Los Angeles' most interesting museums,"The Wende Museum has the most amazing collection of Cold War artifacts. It holds an astounding variety of materials: costumes, flags, paintings, busts, memorial plates, and many more. This diversity reveals the history of the museum: from its inception, the Wende Museum has focused on the collection and preservation of archival material documenting the history of the Cold War and has since developed into one of the most important international research institutes on the subject.This rich collection allows the talented curators to put together exhibits on surprising topics that highlight the diverse aspects of life during the Cold War. The museum also organizes various events, such as film screenings, performances, and their discussion series “Art - Past - Present.”The Wende recently moved to a space that perfectly fits its collection and activities. It is a pleasure to walk around in Culver City’s historic armory and explore the cultural history of the Cold War.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irisclever
50,Outpost of socialist culture and everyday life,"Ever wondered how people lived behind the Iron Curtain?

A visit to the Wende might just prove to be the highlight of your trip to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/choitali
50,"Wonderful for tourism, events and students!","I have had the good fortune to be present at the Wende for a number of exhibit openings, community events and student-centered activities. This institution is such a pleasure as the archives are endless, and therefore anyone can satiate their curiosities here. I have found the invitation to challenge my world view to be irresistible. And of critical importance to me as a school board member, the welcome to students of all ages to use the museum as a resource for rigorous, or even playful, learning is remarkable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/589kellyk
50,A gem in Culver City,"The new Wende Museum is located in a converted armory and provides a fascinating view into the history of East Block Countries. Their programs are varied and insightful. I visited one of their exhibitions on Art and Culture in Cold War Hungary and attended one of their film showings, “Die Legende von Paul and Paula”, an interesting classic on life in Eastern Germany in the 1970s. They even had a reception before the film showing in the museum garden, making the event very classy. I highly recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isaus2018
50,Unexpected and exciting museum. Highly recommended!,"Would highly recommend! The Wende connects past and present in insightful and exciting ways. The programming is always engaging, absorbing and intelligent. Best of all, the knowledgeable, friendly team will open your eyes to bizarre trivia, wild history and new ways of thinking.

A great contribution to the neighborhood and city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/49katherinet
50,A Wonderful Museum of History + Place of Learning,"Fittingly housed in a beautifully renovated bomb shelter built in 1949, the Cold War-focused Wende Museum is a unique gem of an institution in Culver City. The interdisciplinary programming delves into the events leading up to and after the fall of the Berlin Wall in great detail, utilizing our past to better understand our present.At the time of my visit there were two featured exhibitions; one highlighting Hungary's visual culture of the era, the other exploring the often overlooked Soviet hippie movement of the 70's. Each provided perspectives not found in the average history textbook. It's absolutely worth a visit, and I am looking forward to future exhibits and events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/masa1000000
50,A jewel on the West Side. Not to be missed!,"This museum is one of a kind. It opened here in November and is FREE.The museum has a huge collection of over 100,00 items from Germany,Russia andEastern Europe representing the Cold War post WW2 until 1991. Obviously all of the items can't be shown at once so you need to go every time there is a show.The exhibitons are easy to view in a great open space and the garden is a great place fora breather. They also have talks and music nights for the locals. GO!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110rickf
50,An hotspot of the Cold War,"I had the opportunity to visit the Wende Museum in several occasions, from conferences and exhibitions openings and guided tours to artists talks and film screenings, and I will keep attending such events in the future. I think there is no other institution, including Europe, where the cultural Cold War is displayed and narrated in such a captivating and innovative way. Exhibitions change often, shedding light on always new and intriguing aspects and histories of the Cold War, based on the vast array of items from the permanent collection and archive of the museum. It is definitely worth visits on regular basis!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matteobZ4670NC
50,History isn't dead,"Not only is the Wende's collection endlessly fascinating and its new location beautifully designed, but its staff is curious, smart, and dedicated to making contemporary connections between other places and times. They ceaselessly revisit and update their holdings, begging questions of the work and inviting other artists and scholars to do the same. Especially in the world's current political climate, but in every era, this is the kind of institution that lends credence to the name: it is not a passive cache of collected objects, but a space for active inquiry of past, present, and future. A great place to visit for both locals and tourists, scholars and laymen, and a great place to get involved more deeply.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnAir790399
50,The Wende Museum in Culver City..........an informative cultural collection of the Cold War,"The Wende Museum is a wonderful addition to the cultural arts in Culver City.

The students are captivated by the amazing and eclectic collection ~ wonderfully presented by the curator, Mr. Joes Segal. This is a ""MUST SEE"" museum, anytime you are in Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathleencL5135JA
50,The past is a foreign country,"I went to see the marvelous exhibition on Soviet Hippies and ended up spending the whole afternoon looking at every piece on display from the museum's permanent collection: deliciously incongruous with the sunny and surfing atmosphere of LA, like its almost neighboring Jurassic Technology Museum, the Wende offers an experience of the past in all of its fereign-ness (David Lowenthal).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L4525YBclaudiof
50,visit to the museum should be a mandatory event for high schools today.,"I grew up in a divided Europe, and of course had visited “the other side”. Once the Iron Curtain came down and Europe re-unified, the history of this so significant cultural and political division is threatened to disappear over there. But not to worry - because the world of Cold War Eastern Europe is alive and well, and well represented in this interesting and unique Museum in Culver City.The exhibits and lectures give us valuable insight what could happen in societies where democratic norms have disappeared. This makes these exhibits uniquely valuable for our current political environment. A visit to the museum should be a mandatory event for high schools today. And if you go there voluntarily, prepare to be unsettled, but always entertained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerhardm524
50,Deeply interesting and thought provoking,"The Wende museum beautifully presents different views of the Cold War, its unique collections are dynamically managed and there seems to be something new at every (albeit intermittent) visit. The museum is probably best suited for visitors with a more adult interest in art and history, there being less to entertain younger children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Listening_Nick
50,Unique museum with glimps of life under communist rule,"I've gone a few times to various lectures, movies, and events.

50,Fascinating and unique museum,"The Wende is unique in North America and perhaps the world as a museum dedicated to the history of the Cold War. What's wonderful about it is that it explores that history not just by discussing major political events, but mostly through art, material culture, and popular culture. It thus gives visitors a very rich understanding of what life in the Eastern Bloc was like, and the museum is also good at making its programming relevant to present-day issues and concerns. I highly recommend a visit -- or repeat visits, since the museum is always free, and the exhibitions change regularly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/66ksenyag
50,Treasure trove of Cold War history tucked in the middle of Culver City,"Nestled in the heart of Culver City and appropriately homed in the re-purposed armory/bunker on Culver Boulevard, the collection within the Wende Museum offers a fresh perspective into the Cold War.The museum opens up into a high-ceilinged space bordered by corridors to the left and right. The open space is used for rotating exhibits while each hallway showcases pieces from the museum’s permanent collection. The features during my visit (2018/08/24) showcased Hungarian artists and primary accounts from the little known Soviet “khippie” movement. The staff is knowledgeable and happy to indulge any and all curiosities; many of which manifest from the tchotchkes displayed in the open storage display. Notable highlights that caught my inquisition: functioning spy equipment, a sword from Saddam’s Iraq, and pieces of the Berlin wall.If you’re an eclectic yearning to learn more about the Cold War or a casual looking for a nice way to spend an afternoon, come visit the Wende Museum; a must for tourists and locals alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulo_panaligan

50,Preserving Cold War History,"The Wende Museum focuses on an unusual but important mission: preserving history of the Cold War era. We enjoyed our recent visit and plan to return when we’re in the area. The museum has exhibitions that change periodically. When we visited these included one focusing on art and culture in Hungary during the Cold War period and another on the “hippie” movement in the Soviet Union. An extensive set of artistic works and artifacts from countries behind the Iron Curtain are on display inside. Exhibits outside include a recreation of a Cold War era border crossing. The museum’s friendly staff members are available to answer questions, but you are free to wander at will. A visit to the museum not only gives insight about an often-overlooked era but provides important confirmation for the belief that the human yearning for freedom is universal. No charge but donations gladly accepted. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bandmom-7
50,"A Meaningful, Fascinating Visit","I recently visited The Wende with a friend who was in town from Germany. It was fascinating to see the exhibitions and collection through his eyes as a German and through my own as an American; although both of us are millennials, we agreed that this museum had an incredible way of connecting the past to today's international affairs. Our tour guide had an immense passion and dedication to this place and its growing collection, and I thoroughly enjoyed hearing his ""behind the scenes"" stories about the artwork. I'm excited to return for their upcoming events and the next exhibition!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/634arielt

50,Nerdgirl Alert,"This museum is one of my favorite things about Los Angeles and one that is quintessentially LA. The Wende contextualizes the Cold War through a fresh, contemporary lens that brings the collection to life in a way that makes it accessible and relevant. Nearly every Wende exhibition leaves me feeling like the people of eastern bloc countries were not so different from me and my family - they watched TV, marked the milestones of their lives, played with toys, and even experience a remarkably similar design aesthetic to the West - something I never considered growing up - despite also enduring a lack of freedom I will hopefully never comprehend. The importance of places like the Wende - where we get outside of ourselves and understand small glimpses of other cultures - is especially poignant at this moment in time. But more importantly, this museum dusts off history, brings it alive, and lays knowledge on you in a way that is never boring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandi900
50,Incredible LA find!,"This museum is as remarkable as other unique small museums in LA like the Museum of Jurassic Technology. It's pretty crazy that this place exists, but with everything going on in the world right now politically, cold war issues are suddenly more relevant than ever. The open hours are less extensive than most major museums, but it is so worth it to plan a trip to view the collection and their special exhibitions. I almost never write online reviews, but had to share this amazing experience. Go see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conradhh

I cannot recommend this museum highly enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jonathan_jay_b

50,"A new, small museum, well worth an hour","I had a couple of hours and decided to visit this new museum that opened in November. What a treat! I am a Hungarian refugee, having come to the US in 1957. The exhibit was about the Hungarian Revolution and it’s aftermath. I got there just in time to join a docent tour. A wonderful experience. I learned a lot about Hungary for I’m 1956 to 1986. This exhibit will only be there until August 26. The nice thing about this museum is that they regularly change their exhibit. All themes are about the Cold War Era from 1949 to 1989. So, it’s a museum I will revisit. Although you can do it on your own, I recommend docent tours. They last an hour and really give context to what is on display. The signage is also excellent. I signed up for their emails and will be notified of future exhibits, speaker programs and movie screenings. A great addition to the wonderful variety of museums in LA. And it’s free! Ample parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850annettem

I will definitely go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mf13622018

Was intrigued to find Wende on the Web, and once there, I can say I am so pleased that I went! A fascinating and extremely well done museum. From the art and artifacts, to the audio and video recordings selected, to its use of the ""Open Storage"" technique as a method for exhibition, I was truly impressed. It is intimate, comprehensive, yet not overwhelming, and there are spots to it down and take a break if you choose to immerse yourself--including a lovely outdoor garden that has a couple of neat surprises!

50,Interesting view of history,"Most cities have fun and interesting museums that pay homage to various aspects of culture. ""Wende"" is a German term that signifies a turning point or turnaround. This museum is a great representation of what we have learned from the Cold War and what dangers we still face as a society.The Wende Museum is unique because it focuses on one of the most important periods of recent history: The Cold War. The building was an armory and has been gifted to the museum by Culver City. It's a flexible industrial space that features exhibits from their permanent collection as well as some collaborations with other institutions. They have a beautiful Californian garden out back which features an East German guard gate with graffiti. They are preparing to install the largest section of The Berlin Wall in North America in this garden. It's a hip and young space that attracts artists, thinkers, academics and people off the street. You're sure to meet like minded people here.When I visited, they had an exhibit on the forbidden art of Hungary and a smaller section on Soviet Hippies. Soviet hippies were the kids of the politburo brass, who had access to American magazines and music, and who indulged in the culture in secret.The gallery dedicated to their permanent collection features diplomatic gifts including a gold sword from SaddamHussein.Definitely make this a stop on your list whether you're a local or a visitor.They have a large accessible parking lot. And a well appointed small gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoShoEli
50,Great,This is a really interesting and fun museum. There is a lot to take in but the museum does a good job at making it palatable and east to understand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zxsder
50,Communism in the heart of Liberal Capitalism's propoganda powerhouse,"This is the most fantastic collection of items from behind the Iron Curtain I have ever seen outside of Eastern Germany itself. While the name references a particularly German label for the fall of the Berlin Wall and the lifting of the Curtain before colonization at the hands of Western corprations, the museum stresses life and politics throughout the Communist world of the 20th century. I came at a time of an exhibition of the Hungarian experience, but exhibits change and I can't wait for what's next (psychological manipulation in the communist era, I'm told).This location is apparently new and I couldn't be more proud of them for upgrading their venue; it's spacious, has room for community events, and just plain gorgeous. Big things are happening for them, and I'm honored to have been a part of it for a few hours. I'm told 7 segments of the Berlin Wall were purchased for showing soon, so get your cameras ready!Let's strive for Socialism in its true form and honor the victims of our painful iteration under totalitarian hijacking of the movement.Peace",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marlonn148
50,Super Interesting,"I didn't know much about the cold war, but some friends really wanted to come to the Wende. Let's just say that this place is a treasure trove of artifacts and information. We joined a group tour and were lucky enough to have one of the curators as our guide. I learned a ton and had a good time. And, it was free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/96estherp
50,Unexpected,"Finding a Cold War in Culver City and finding it worthwhile wasn't something I expected. Building is brand new, so the artifacts setup has been very well thought out, the layout of the different exhibitions is open and has a natural flow that takes you down our history.Current exhibitions are on the Ukrainian 1956 Student Revolution and its effects on art during the Cold War and Soviet Hippies.Living in LA, it's a nice way to spend some time doing something different, definitely worth a trip to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BozieuC
50,"New, Interesting Cold War Museum in Culver City","I'm a resident of LA and just discovered this hidden jewel. It's brand new.If you've got a hour or two and are looking for a very interesting take on the Cold War, check this place out. Of course there are pieces of the wall and other expected exhibits, but more interestingly there are artifacts - collected over decades - showing the culture of the people behind the wall. Lots of pieces from artists who produced art both underground and therefore not state approved/illegal and above ground. The museum is always changing by partnering with collections around the world, including The Getty, to rotate out special exhibitions. Best of all it's run by people who really care about the place, the staff was very nice and always helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tc-tripper
50,Fascinating Experience,"Fantastic selection of cold war era art...and so much more.I took a guided tour through their current exhibit about Hungary post 1956 and Soviet Hippies - I learned a ton. They also have a huge collection of Lenin busts, a few of them are on display.Don't forget to check out their lovely garden too.Will definitely come back to show my out of town friends!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timonb2014
50,WHO KNEW! - What a great find!,"The kind of cultural gem that completely delights you when you find it - and in the most unexpected place! It is a remarkable collection that reveals a world behind the iron curtain that most of us knew about but never really saw. Yes it is the stuff of spy films, but also a very real world revealed in some very sensitive exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/castrignot
50,Best Free Museum in LA,"A fantastic curation of art and artifacts from the Cold War era. Painting, drawing, sculpture, furniture, literature, and more are skillfully displayed. Biographies and histories accompany each piece, and are written very well. Staff are friendly and helpful, will visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliaaD9265GT
50,Nice Museum,"Very nicely curated and displayed museum on Soviet Era art and culture. Thoroughly enjoyed seeing the art and learning about the culture of art in Hungary, Budapest, etc. during the Cold War. Not a huge museum, but it’s free and there’s (also free) parking, so you can’t go wrong!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmsimon
50,Fantastic!,My history professor dad and I visited for Father's Day and loved it! The current exhibits are on the 1956 Revolution and Soviet Hippies- both are excellent. Museums are often overwhelming and/or redundant but not here! The space allows for an engaging and energetic experience. Beautiful garden area to relax in too. Well worth stopping by whether a local or visitor to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferJ742
40,Great museum of Russian history and the Cold War,"Great exhibits. The current special exhibit is on Russian Hippie movement.

50,Excellent museum with unique collection of Cold War era Soviet art and design,"This free museum has a very compelling collection of Soviet Bloc art and cultural artifacts. The exhibit we saw was of post-1956 Hungarian society. They also have a great permanent collection of Lenin busts, objets d'art and other communist memorabilia.Very interesting place and it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZachBest

50,Cold War anyone?,"A wonderful preserved piece of history around and about the Cold War, yes it was a misery but this as a museum was pretty outstanding, we learnt a lot more to the Cold War to that which was mentioned throughout history",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/283luker
50,Must see for anyone interested in the Cold War,"Now that the Wende has moved into its new location in the armory, I delight in brining friends to see this gem. They have no idea that the pre-eminent collection of artifacts from behind the iron curtain is located in the LA area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TZW
50,Back in the USSR! This is the Coolest New Museum in LA!,"I wandered into this new gem in Culver City today, it's just blocks from the new Culver City downtown area. The museum displays lots of memorabilia, art and ephemera from the Soviet bloc that tells the story of the Cold War, East vs West. I was surprised at all the cool Lenin statues, banners, posters and everyday items like toys and radios they had on display.The museum itself is built inside an old National Guard armory building which makes the perfect setting to view Cold War objects and art. One of the best parts is the visitor staff, they are very enthusiastic and very helpful. We were greeted by Dan who was very knowledgable and helpful during our visit. Jackie helped us in the gift shop, small but full of cool stuff you can't find elsewhere. I overheard a tour by the head curator, Jos Seigel. Sounded very interesting for those who want a deeper dive into the Eastern bloc days. One tip; be sure to wander into the back area where there's a lovely outside garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/706joela
50,Come in from the cold,"The Wende's new home at the former Armory in Culver City now has a wonderful space to display an very interesting and unusual exhibit of photographs, painting and objects all from the former Soviet Union. The bookstore and garden are also interesting and inviting. Lastly, the ease to find parking made it a pleasure to stop in and take a look. I would highly recommend going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionacR9271KI
50,The chairs are comfortable. For the naked or the clothed.,"Helpful, informative and cheery staff. A cheery and welcoming staff in a Cold War memorabilia museum says a lot!What's that number machine thing?Pleasant new paint smell.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3745HUjenniferl
50,The Wende Museum should be on everyone's list of things to do in LA!,"The artifacts displayed throughout the museum are fascinating and well thought out especially as they correlate to the space. The setting of this museum is a Cold-War era Armory which makes it the ideal location to feature an array of art, furniture, books, etc. from behind the Iron Curtain.The staff are friendly and welcoming and willing to answer questions you may have. They told us that the artifacts displayed are merely a small fraction of what they have in their possession, which intrigued me because I would LOVE to see more! They host various events throughout the year that relate to Cold War era culture. I am looking forward to attending these events! Another great feature of this museum is that it is free! (Obviously donations are important to keeping wonderful places like this alive). It is definitely great for those who are interested in history as it relates to the culture of the Cold War.This is a must-see museum in LA. I wish I had gone sooner, and know I will be going again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaitlynb115
50,New Museum is Open and VERY COOL!,"They have moved to a former 60's National Armory, which given the collection, is quite appropriate. Was not sure what to expect but this was so interesting. Photography portraits of Russians from the 1960's so neat. Sections and items relating to Communist Government surveillance of their citizens really interesting (and pretty timely) Gifts to communist dictators, some schlocky, some really nice were fascinating. The newly renovated building works well and the different sections with related cold war subject matter make for a great and very different museum visit. A very nice woman from Visitor Services told us they will be having a Soviet Hippie Culture exhibit in the Spring-If I am in LA, I have to see that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanR27
40,The Wende Museum is an Interesting visit with unusual artifacts of the Cold War era.,"The Wende Musuem is a collections-based research and education institute that preserves Cold War artifacts and history, making resources available to scholars and applying historical lessons of the past to the present. It's an interesting visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hawaiian555
40,Verrrry Interesting!,"First off, please be aware, the museum is currently closed in preparation of its move to the Armory on Culver Boulevard in Culver City, in November. That being said, we are looking forward to its reopening in new, larger quarters.They have a great collection of materials from East Germany and the former Warsaw pact countries, dedicated to the cold war period. Now, with the passing of time, these objects become like fossils, examples of a world now past. These things: plates, posters, artwork, uniforms, you name it, are interesting to those of us who lived through it, and educational for our children and grandchildren, who wouldn't be able to believe this time existed unless we can show them what it was like. Definitely worth a visit when it reopens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VNahmias
50,A blast from the past,"Given the recent problems in the Ukraine and Syria, and the recent adventures of a more militaristic Russia in both countries, we all need to watch President Putin through the dark lens of Soviet history. The Wende museum reminds you of how far we have come and what is at risk. Like travellede33,, I highly recommend that you make an appointment for a personal or group tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CulverCityA
40,Don't judge the cover...there's a RICH story stitched into this book's binding!,"Very interesting and engaging tour of the Wende Museum is a must stop for history lovers of all sorts and most especially the Cold War era. The docents, staff and volunteers loving care for, catalog and share this amazing collection of Cold War artifacts and their stories within this (albeit...odd location) ""warehouse"". There are some ""guest artist galleries"" and the real treasures are shared in a tour. Free public tours are twice only on Fridays at 11:30am and 2pm (other tours are by arrangement). We WILL visit the Wende Museum again when they inhabit their new location. We are very excited to see this slice of sheltered history revealed and shared to the Wende Museum's fullest potential!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/resourcefulgirl
50,History made visible,"The Wende Museum is not what you expect. The display space of the museum is limited. I highly recommend to make an appointment for a personal or group tour. That give you the opportunity to get into the heart of the museum. The staff is highly motivated and very, very friendly. Doing the tour you get an idea how it was at times of the cold war and how people lived in the East behind the wall in Germany.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellerde33
50,Cold War Museum in Culver City ...,"Visiting the Wende Museum is a step back into the realities if the Cold War with the presentation of its excellent and in depth collection.

40,Uniqie and worthwhile for anyone interested in Cold War era,"More of an archive than a museum, the Wende still has some very interesting pieces on display, especially art. The archive is incredible and varied with posters, statues, films, paintings, old Stasi spy equipment, uniforms, etc., etc., etc. The tours are very informative. The current location, in a sort of industrial office park, is temporary until the permanent building is constructed. For anyone who's a fan of Cold War history this place is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craig_traveler

40,Hidden Gem for those interested in Eastern Bloc/Cold War history,"The Wende Museum is a collection of objects/artifacts mostly from former East Germany but also from the other Eastern Bloc countries and the former Soviet Union. The museum is very small and open to the public without an appointment on Fridays only. The museum might not interest many, but for those who are interested in this time period and geographic region, it is very interesting. We took a tour of ""The Vault"" which holds literally thousands of everyday objects from East Germany and the Soviet Bloc. The tour was very intimate, with only four of us, so it was a nice chance to interact with the guides and to be able to stop and look at particular things (we saw a lot of paintings on this visit). The museum will move to bigger site next year, so hopefully there will be more space to display items; much of ""the vault"" is a warehouse of shelves filled with Lenin busts, books, boxes of catalogued items, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerjon
50,Hidden treasures,"The Wende Museum is a FREE Cold War museum focusing on East Germany and the Soviet Union. They have pieces of the Berlin Wall, statues, paintings...
