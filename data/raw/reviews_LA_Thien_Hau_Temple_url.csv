50,One of the most beautiful building I have ever entered,Thien Hau Temple is one of the most beautiful buildings I have ever had the pleasure to enter. I would highly recommend a visit to the temple for anyone staying in or visiting China Town LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ampll
40,Beautiful & Interesting Temple in LA's Chinatown,"Not actually a Buddhist temple, this shrine is dedicated to the ancient Tao Chinese sea goddess Mazu. It was constructed in the 1980s by a group of ethnic Chinese boat people from Vietnam as a thank you to the goddess who helped them reach the United States. If Michael the docent is there, get a tour. Without a tour you miss some of the details but it's still nice to look at all the beautiful alcoves and displays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabriellaa169
