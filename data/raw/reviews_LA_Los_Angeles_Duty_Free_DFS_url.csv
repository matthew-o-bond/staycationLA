50,JetBlue Airways- 5 STAR TREATMENT!⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"The moment my husband Vlad and I entered the airport at LAX we were greeted by JetBlue crewmembers, and it just got better from that point on. We got to the gate about 2 hours early and asked the JUST ASK DESK if we could change for an earlier flight, they said sure and immediately transferred us to the flight (there is usually a cost of about $75), but soon after we realized how long the flight was and being very hungry, we went to the gate and asked them to remove us as we wanted to relax and have something to eat, so they did. After eating we got to the gate and they gave us the option to do an upgrade to MINT ( First Class) and we accepted , the gate crew were INCREDIBLY FRIENDLY AND KNOWLEDGEABLE. They explained the entire process and once we boarded the plane we were greeted again warmly onboard with smiles that could light up an entire stadium. :)))Natalie Lynch; Laura Tidwell ;Pamela Soviero; Latchman sayrange were the Flight crew from LAX to JFK Flight # 1124 and were in absolute AWE with how we were treated. This is the new age and the beginning of a new era of first class travel!!! They came over and assisted us with our luggages in the overhead bin and offered to take them down if at anytime we needed anything after takeoff. They took our pillows and blankets and placed them on the side until we were comfortably seated.While in our seats we were offered some alcoholic beverages which was their signature drinks before takeoff. Within 10 mins after takeoff we were offered another drink and nuts. Then we were given menus to choose from various meal options. We both had 3 separate dishes each that we ate, THE CHICKEN; THE BEEF AND THE SALMON, all with olive oil dressing, bread and salad, mashed potatoes , steamed potatoes and vegetables. This was the most food I’ve ever eaten on any flight, then for dessert we had a fruit bowl and ice cream mmmmmm mmmmm GOOD!!! This was my second time in MINT and Vlad’s first. I’ve traveled to more than 380 cities in 75 countries , flown on 35 different airlines and various planes and this was by far the best customer service I’ve received thus far! Natalie was available to offer us ANYTHING we needed, every 5-7 minutes she walked by to see if we were ok. I think it was Laura who got our bags for us in the overhead bin when we needed our phone chargers, she waited patiently while we took out all the necessary things that we needed and placed the bags back in the bin. Natalie explained what to expect throughout the entire flight and we didn’t have to move a muscle. What outstanding customer service they performed!! We had several conversations with both Natalie and Laura throughout the flight and felt like we were at home in bed waiting to be tucked in. :)))The seat became lay flat beds and they massaged you while sitting or sleeping. We had our nightlight, 4 phone charger ports , phone holders , remote control holder , nice tables and side panels or food, drinks or whatever . Large bottled water at the arm rest and very large tv screens with more than 30 movie choices. :))We just booked our next flight to San Fran on JetBlue in Business in a few weeks and hope to meet Natalie, Laura and the rest of the amazing crew again!LOVED EVERY MOMENT OF THIS TRIP!!!P.s we couldn’t write a review directly for JetBlue as our previous review was still pending .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EddieZoolander
10,Absolutely shocked!,"My flight to Lax was delayed so there was only a short window between my connecting flights. Had written a list so I was ready to go. It was quiet so I was in luck.I apologised to the girl who was working at MAC that I had to be in and out. We don’t have a lot of stock was her response, I showed her my list and she was so dismissive saying I’m sure I don’t have that, I had to keep insisting for her to check most items were in stock.I had to ask if there were similar items constantly prompting her for help as she would keep walking off and not to help other people either!Someone that works in retail I get having a bad day but when you have a customer with a list of 20+ items who knows exactly what colours it’s an easy sale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sashaelza1
10,No doubt they don’t rely on returning customers,"We had a very unfortunate experience, with the shorthaired Asian woman from Chanel.She was very rude, when we pointed out, that the merchandise didn’t match the price on the shelf.The perfume was more expensive than the price written. We simply pointed it out, so other customers wouldn’t have the same issue...Instead she went on about how they were low on stock and the people in the morning didn’t put up things.She could’ve just apologized, corrected the label and moved on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/258victoriaf
50,Grab a bargain.....or Two,"Small and well stocked duty free, not a huge choice , but enough choice. Staff were friendly and happy to help . Loved the fact that the items were taken away to the airline of your choice . Duty free as it should be . Loved how the perfume and the alcohol were in separate stores .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sirah2013
