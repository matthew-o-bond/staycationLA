50,Great place to visit in L.A.,Unique structure in front of a museum. We could also go up the outside stairs with the museum and view Hollywood area.,Eddie R
30,Overrated,"It is worth a one time visit only. If your days and time are limited you can surely skip this one without feeling guilty that you are missing anything. It's nice, but that is about it. Not much to do, besides taking a few photos (probably all look the same) and read short info. Certainly don't even bother during the day, if you decide to give it a chance at least do it at night.",Ellie
40,Better at night,Cool exhibit. Free to wander through and take pictures. It only takes about 15 minutes to fully walk through. Kids stood on the lamp posts and were scolded by the security guard. Lesson learned: don't climb on the posts.,irsh21
50,One of the Hidden treasures.,"Its free, beautiful and different. Must visit when in LA. night is the best time for awesome photos, though you will rarely find an empty space. You can opt for this in the end of the whole day tour as it is open 24hrs. This way you save time, no need to plan and can just head off after your day's itinerary.",Gariyasi M
50,Beautiful!,We walked down to the Urban Light display from the Farmer's Market area. It was very safe at night. There were a ton of people taking photos. Lots of security guards were around as well making sure that everything is safe too.,boymomdfw
50,Visual treat,"Urban light in Los Angeles is a simple visual treat, well worth visiting day or night, we have driven past at night and seen it briefly, but this time we made the trip during the day, well worth it.",TeamWard
50,Day or night,It does not matter what time I am here there are people taking pictures of the the lights or themselves. Wedding take place here.The lights themselves are a collection of street lights curated by artist Christ Burden. The lights are to the front of LACMA's plaza and just of the pavement so there is no admission.,Catherine M
40,Instagram worthy,Super crowded!! I guess everyone wanted a pic with the Urban Lights too. We went after dinner so that we could get some night time pics with the Urban lights. Overly crowded. Pretty hard to get a pic without other people in your pics but after 364367 shots we managed to get a few Instagram worthy pics!,Mimi
50,All of the lights,*Inserts All of the Lights by Kanye West here* Seriously I'm not even kidding! If you're in LA I would definitely take a trip to take some iconic pictures of the Urban lights. We went during the day and we loved how our pictures turned out. It gets very crowded as well. I would highly recommend coming here just for photography purposes!,Trinh V
50,a really amazing installation made up of lights from different decades,"this installation is definitely a must-see in LA, specially in the evenings, as you get more of the experience.",Mirian N
50,Must SEE!!,"I must admit that I am not a fan of Los Angeles. It is just too darn crowded and trafficky for this small time guy. Still, we come down here a lot. Many times it is to tour out of town relatives and friends.When we go, then a visit to Urban Light at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is a MUST!! Such a Cool spot to take photos!! It is located outside the museum, and it is accessible 24 hours a day. You may have seen this public artwork in movies or on television. Seeing it in person is even better.Always a great time at Urban Light, and everyone we take here enjoys this special artwork too!!",ExpoNationals
50,Dream come true!,"Ever since I saw the Urban Light in ""No strings attached"", I've been dreaming about seeing the installation in person. I've been talking about it so much that whenever my friends visited LA, they would facetime me hahaha. So when I was planning my LA trip, the Urban Light was pretty high-up on my list of to do things.I must admit the whole installation is a lot smaller than I expected, but beautiful nonetheless. Interestingly enough, it consists of restored street lamps that actually lit Southern California is the 1920s and 1930s. How cool is that?I visited the installation once in the evening and another time during the day, and loved it both times. It does get pretty crowded though, making it virtually impossible to take any good pictures without any people in them.The installation is at the entrance to LACMA, so if you happen to come in the evening past the opening hours of the museum, don't get fooled by the guard who says they're closed as the Urban Light is open 24/7. Parking can be a bit tricky, but just drive around and you can find street parking.Hope you enjoy!",Iulia (Yu-lee-ya)
50,Iconic spot but visit during off hours,"A great place for photography. I highly recommend visiting during off hours if you want less people around. The weekends it can be very busy at this iconic spot. Don't take a tour, just park your car at one of the meters and walk over.",JessiAnn85
40,An LA must stop,"Anyone traveling to Los Angeles has to stop by this iconic LA landmark. Don't waste your time with tours. Avoid the weekends because this will be filled with locals and tourists. Best day to go is Tuesdays or Wednesdays, and after 7pm, for one, the parking at the LACMA garage is free after 7pm on Monday- Friday. Secondly, Tuesday's and Wednesdays I are not so crowded and the parking lot is nearly empty. The viewing is FREE! Do not pay for admission.",Julian
50,Amazing Lamp Display in LA,"202 Street lamps displayed as a sculpture.It looks amazing and more so when the lights come on, it’s a great photo opportunity and very popular with locals and tourists.",motorcar1
50,Instagram This,Went during the day and loved taking pictures around the light poles. Lots of other people were around.,Jessica S
50,Urban Lights,It’s pretty cool to see these assemblage old lamps to now working lights. You got to see it next time you’ll visit Los Angeles.,Dorie Robinson
50,DAY AND NIGHT - MUST DO,"I'm an LA local and I never get tired of visiting this spot. If you are visiting LA, you have to stop by. It won't take more than 15 minutes to enjoy the view and snap some quick photos. Parking isn't too bad, but UBER would work best so you don't have to worry about it.TIP: Try to visit during the day and come back at night. You will be able to capture very different photos based on the time of day that you go. Lights will be turned off during the day, but the day light will be perfect for photos. Lights get turned on at sun down and that lighting will give you an even better background to your photos.HAVE FUN!",Nancy E
50,Great piece of modern Art & Fabulous Photos,We had a heard a great deal and it was definitely great spot to do. It's old style lights from around town put together and they look amazing. Make sure to go after dark to get the full glow and pictures turn out amazing. Glad we got to do this with few days in LA!,Atul C
50,Very cool lights installation,"Great place to do some people watching and taking some cool pictures.Try to arrive just before sundown to scout some good locations, and be prepared for a crowd even late evenings. The installation is right by an intersection so be prepared for some crazy drivers and pedestrians that will get in your shots - a good exercise for your patience.",Andreas B
50,Beautiful Lights at LACMA called Urban Lights,We were at Urban Lights in late evening to see and take pictures of the beautiful Pillars of lights. These are made of cast iron. Just come here late to see the marvel.,VIPIN_GOEL_TP_Impex
50,Very fun!,"Urban Light at LACMA are one of the most photographed places in LA, and even I partook in the selfie phenomenon at the Urban light.They are a large outdoor art installation that opened around 2008 that consist of restored street lamps from the 1920s & 1930's and it was supposed to be just a temporary display but became very popular via social media (1st known selfie at Urban Light was 4 days after it opened by Diana Felszeghy on Flickr) and then Hollywood called and since then has been in movies and tv shows and commercials. So thank you Diana for posting the pic and making sure Urban Light becomes a local hot spot!I had to be part of the hype, had to check them out at night. We went around 10pm on a Saturday night and it still was kind of packed with people but you can still get a good selfie in and a good picture too!If you make your way down to LA, go check out the Urban Light",myorona73
50,Awesome!!!,We waited to go back at night time and it was so worth it. One the traffic wasn’t as bad and we got a parking spot right in front of it! The lights were just beautiful. Definitely take out the time to see it! And it’s free!,rfleming04
50,Very cool spot!,Very beautiful art display! I would Uber/Taxi here late at night to avoid the masses of tourists taking photos in here! Highly recommend coming to check this out!,Wilson L
50,LA at its best,"Enjoy a late afternoon at LA County Museum of Modern Arts and stay when it gets dark to see the amazing illumination of the Urban Light.One of my favorite places in the mid-Wilshire area to sit back, relax and truly experience modern art.Tip: for best solo shots of urban light.... come after 10pm when the crowd dies down.",Kristina K
50,Fun and amazing place to take great photos!,Best part of this attraction is that there is no entrance fee and you can come here multiple times. Best time to go here is at night and a bit late to avoid the crowd. One of my favorites when I visited LA!,Carlou G
50,Incredible,This piece of art gets better as you move and view it from different angles. There is the LACMA and a small cafe outside. We went in the evening. The parking lot closes at 11 and then it is a challenge. The lights really are incredible with all different styles and some different heights in rows. It is a scene to take pictures with and without people. Would have been fun to go into LACMA but we got there too late after the Observatory earlier. Go see la brea tar pits while you are there and have parking! Very fun area.,amber1127
50,Free & brilliant,"Really nice display. Free, no entry fee. Lovely for pictures. Would recommend going at sunset/in the evening for better photos.",Mel T
50,Gorgeous,"I took photos here for my birthday and the location was amazing! Even though there were a lot of people there, we found our own area and easily took our pictures without an issue! We parked out front and had no problems.",MsKiesha
