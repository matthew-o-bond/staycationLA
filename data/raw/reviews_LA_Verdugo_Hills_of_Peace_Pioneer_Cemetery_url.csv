40,Beautiful location,"I have never been IN to the cemetery although I walk by it frequently. And the view is awesome. I wanted to point out, however, that you cannot actually go in to the cemetery unless you make an appointment. It is entirely surrounded by fencing. I live fairly close and it is a beautiful walk on the little winding road up to and past the cemetery. The view from the road is fantastic and the circular walk is perfect exercise.If you call to make an appointment and take the “tour,” I hope they tell the story about the mudslide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F3815CYdanielc
40,"On a clear day, you can see forever","In the little town of Tujunga, there is a little known cemetery called the Hills Of Peace Pioneer Cemetery. From its hilltop location, on a clear day you can see all the way out to the ocean. Although small, it contains the remains of over 1800 people who came and settled in this foothills region of Los Angeles. From Civil War veterans to families that came to settle as ""Little Landers"" here. It became a historical monument in 2009.For a really peaceful day, a tour of the hillside monument should be included.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_DeMulle
