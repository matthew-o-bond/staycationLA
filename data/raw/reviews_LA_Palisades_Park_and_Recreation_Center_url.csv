50,There is really something for everyone in the family here!,"If you want to let your hair down, lay back and watch the people or the clouds soar by, this is the place to go. And if you really want to see an amusement park, just walk the park road to the Santa Monica Pier with all it's attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_DeMulle
50,Hidden Away in Pacific Palisades ...,"Palisades Park as I know it is hidden away in the center of Pacific Palisades and not on the periphery of the cliffs in Santa Monica ( look at the provided Map & ignore the incorrect address). Pali Park / Pali Recreation Area, as per map, is a wonderful green space of open grass for picnics, rec. center, tennis courts, children's play ground, baseball diamond and walking areas. It's a community jewel that we visit often. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed

50,"Great place to walk, jog, bike and see the view!","This is a really nice little park on the cliffs overlooking Pacific Coast Highway and Santa Monica Bay. The park itself is about two miles long, but very narrow as it sits between Ocean Avenue and the bluffs overlooking the sea. There is a walking/jogging path that winds the entire length of the park with plenty of palm trees and grassy areas to sit and relax. There are benches throughout the park and restrooms here and there. Their are also several trails that lead from the park down and over P.C.H. that go to the beach. Going south the park ends at Colorado Blvd. and the Santa Monica Pier, which is a good place to access the bike path that goes north to Sunset Blvd. and all the way south to Redondo Beach. There are at times a fair amount of homeless people that frequent the park, but for the most part they are harmless and just looking for a place to rest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg
