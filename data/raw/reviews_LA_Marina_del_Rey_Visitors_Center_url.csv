50,This is a great place to find out things to do in the Marina del Rey.,Marina del Rey Visitors Center is conveniently located on Admiralty Way. The staff is friendly and knowledgable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vaughan007
40,Very pleasant Pair of Ladies offering advice,Just popped in to ask directions. However the Ladies explained the various options that were available for typical tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rizzo999
50,Glad we stopped here,If we did not happen to stop into this place we would not have known about the deals and discounts around Marina Del Rey.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dameont2018
50,That is a cosy small place where you can get any information about one of my favorite area in LA.,Marina del Ray is a wonderful area. If you need to rel after visiting the busy energetic Downtown or sunbathing at the Venice Beach this place is totally for you. It is calm and peaceful. You can enjoy the beautiful Marina harbor or entertain your kids at the Mother’s Beach. You also can visit Chace Park or have lunch in a cosy Fishermen’s Village. All the information about this wonderful place you can get at Marina del Ray Visitors Center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightsee419201

50,very helpful,We visited Visitor information center on 4th July to help us plan evening and watch fireworks. Staff was very helpful and share lot for information for Los Angles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NavinPuri
50,Good i,"We always go to ""the i"" as the people that work there are so nice and helpful. And so she was. She pointed out the free shuttle service around Marina del Rey, gave us the beach bike map trail and some advice on dinner places. It's always good to make your first stop anywhere be 'the i' and it was certainly true here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vin0Vin0
50,Very Helpful; Quaint Building,"The Marina del Rey Visitors Center is a small mission-style building located at the marina. The staffer, perhaps a volunteer, was very friendly and helpful. There were also helpful self-service kiosks for brochures and maps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sisterbay716
30,Good knowledge of local events and locations.,"This visitor center is a bit different than others I have been to. Built in a lighthouse, it is not the most obvious building for a visitor center. Inside you will find all kinds of maps for the bike paths, local area, water taxi, ,,,,, They are also aware and informative on boat parades, local concerts, ... but when you start to get out of the marina area their knowledge tends to be not as good. You can't expect them to know everything going on in LA as LA is huge!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Upscaletravelerjw
30,Easy place to get activity news,"Just off of the marina on Admiralty Way, the visitors center is normally staffed and they can provide information on any upcoming activities and also about hotels and restaurants in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
40,"Stop in here for maps, info","I stop in here several times a year to update my local bike trails maps and info, as well as to learn about local events like fireworks, boat parades, etc.Friendly and knowledgable staff. Maps of bike paths including Marvin Braude and Ballona Wetlands. Located right on Admiralty across from Ralph's. Look for the lighthouse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saranger
30,"Too Hard to Find, but OK ...","The Marina Del Rey Visitor's Information Center should have better signage and visibility to go with this go to area. I live here & didn't know about it until recently - that's how visible it is!! Once found, the folks were very helpful. They do the best with what they have. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Helpful for Local Information: Marina Del Rey Visitor Center,"We visited the Marina del Rey Visitor Center. It is in a scenic adobe house. The staff was very helpful. They are a source for local information, lodging, and maps, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
30,Didn't get very far,A not so obvious visitors centre with not so helpful information. The staff in here were nice enough but they really couldn't help us with anything we wanted to do . I'm sure they are great for things really local to the marina itself but really had no idea about how to get to anything beyond the immediate vicinity . Loaded up on brochures and bus timetables and headed off to fend for ourselves . They were kind enough to call us a taxi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gamma_C_69
50,If you like seaside...,"Very interestin and organized exciting location. Joining activities and seasailing tours along the beautiful coast, beautiful sensations and fun garanteeded!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThornA
30,Who knew?!?,So its a little adobe house across from a shopping center and almost no one who lives around knows what it is. This place should be at Fisherman's Village or Burton Chase Park. Not there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulgO8572OX
50,Very Helpful,"Stopped here and the lady inside was so informative and helpful. Provided information on tours/activities in the area.Took her advice and parked at Dock 52 which was free, walked over to Fisherman's Village, took in the sites there and then rented a pedal bike. Joined the cycle trail and went over to Venice Beach/Santa Monica Pier.Stop in if you have any questions",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nattysimps
50,So helpful,Was assited by a great lady.. who was full of information on the area ... gave informative leafelts and maps.... nice to be able to go into a visitor centre and be helped by someone who is passionalte about the area. Wish I got her name so I could shout her name out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSMProflight
30,Good enough,"This is a very basic visitors center, hard to give these high reviews. But definitely go to for insightful information and exactly what you would expect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonn780
30,Average,"It was very bland, the lady i spoke to was quite ignorant,the phone rang and she was speaking to the caller and trying to speak to me as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenjr2016
40,A gated community for people with boats,"Boating is posh caravanning. Someone once said, ""owning a boat is the same as standing in a cold shower tearing up money"". And this is serious money, and er and water, of course, lots of it. As far as marinas go this is large-scala... typical LA, if you're going to do something then do it big. So for visitors, like me, the sights are pretty, the landscape and seascape is awesome, and watching boats come and go is strangely hypnotic. This place though isn't really designed for visitors, it's a housing estate for yachts so the amenities are all designed for the main residents. There are some small shops with tourist guff and cafes which are all nice. Looking back I now wish that I'd have made time to book a boating trip out into the LA bay. They looked great and all those tourist on board looked like they were in for a big day out. Maybe next time. Unless I win the lottery. In which case I'll move here for good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/major_rawls
40,Great source of info. Friendly staff.,I found info for the entire venice/santa monica area. Helped a ton.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/207Mike
