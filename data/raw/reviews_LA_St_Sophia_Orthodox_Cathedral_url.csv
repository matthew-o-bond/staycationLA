50,Gold and chandeliers,This is a stunningly beautiful cathedral with gold ornamentation everywhere along with quite a few crystal chandeliers. There is a large picture of Jesus within the dome and a large picture of Mary over the altar. There is parking within the cathedral area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinaNtravel
50,A little out of the way but worth it,"Park in the parking lot of the Church. The interior is breath-taking. Everything appears large - painting, stain glass - but especially the interior of the dome.The picture of Christ covering the interior of the dome is awe inspiring.Some one is there to answer any questions. A half hour well spent in a busy day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockcole
50,A good place to see for change in LA,I was lucky to get the chance to attend a wedding over there. The interior of the cathedral is so much overwhelming with the fancy golden decorations and the very well detailed sculptures and decorations all around the place.A good place to visit during your stay in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BassemHenen
50,"very beautiful, but check times for availability","At the moment, the church is open limited hours - docents 10-12 the day I was there. Had been told 10-4 and arrived after 12. Fortunately there was a docent who was in the process of leaving and she kindly let me inside and gave a very pleasant presentation. No full lights because they were closed, but the sun was out and did its job with the stained glass. You could easily pick up much of the detail. Ornate, but you can certainly appreciate the work that went into building this surprisingly new (1948?) structure. Welcoming staff at the adjacent service center and I met a nice member who shared some additional memories of the place along with some details of its recent history. Pleasant experience, but again, see it when it is fully lit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
50,"Awe inspiring design, must see","Attended a wedding at St. Sophia Orthodox Cathedral. From the outside, it is a large cathedral with a high ceiling. It is not until you enter the cathedral that you are awe struck by the intricate detail of the interior design. It rivals many of the grand cathedrals in Europe. Photographs do not do this place justice, the spectacular design that you see cannot be captured. It is truly a work of art and labor of love for the designers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ranishi

50,Beautiful Cathedral with Amazing Interior,Attended a wedding in this really beautiful stunning Cathedral. Do visit if you get a chance. The priest did an amazing job explaining marriage. Overall the interior is so lovely and worth the visit. Just 5-10minutes drive from LALive. Enjoyed the aura and hair-raising divine aura.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nikareeta
50,Stunning,Glorious. Magnificent. Pictures cannot capture the immensity of the sanctuary or the dark serene color. A must on visiting LA and so easy to get to. No Admission. Open from 10:00. I believe they are closed on Monday. Right up there with the best in Europe only smaller.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larryKitty8933
50,"My Big, Gorgeous Greek Cathedral","When we travel to Europe (or anywhere else for that matter) I am always intrigued by churches...especially their interiors. Why? I haven’t a clue. It doesn’t matter what the denomination, churches fascinate me, even when they’re not serving wine. Yet at home, I haven’t searched out many interesting places of worship in my immediate area.The Greek Orthodox community of Los Angeles dates back to the early 20th century when services were held in a warehouse.They had long wanted a cathedral, and thanks to some movie mogul brothers, it came to fruition. Greek-born Charles Skouras, a movie executive, vowed “that if God granted him success in Hollywood, he would build a Greek Orthodox cathedral in Los Angeles.” It seems as if Charles’ prayers must have been answered when he became the head of National Pictures (his brother Spyros, a former sheepherder in Greece, became the head of 20th-Century Fox while his other brother, George, headed up Universal).fter walking through a small entry room with small chandeliers......I entered the expansive church was completely dark......at least for about a minute until the big chandeliers came on. Wow!There are 17 Czechoslovakian crystal chandeliers hanging down from its elegant ceiling. They supposedly all weigh 2,000 pounds apiece, although I didn’t Czech each one. Along the side walls are 12 massive stained glass windows depicting the 12 Apostles of Christ.The soaring dome above the center of the church contains a huge likeness of Christ. Depicted clockwise around him are “The Evangelists”; Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.The dome is 30 feet in diameter (90-feet high) with an inscription taken from the New Testament: ""I Am the Light of the World. He who believes in me shall not walk in darkness but have the light of life."" It also contains 24 windows around the periphery.Gold, bronze and marble line the altar. There is a gold leaf pulpit. This cathedral must have cost more than the making of Cleopatra (the movie whose extraordinary budget cost Spyros his job).Above the altar is an enormous painting of the Virgin Mary (aka “Theotokos” in Greek) and Child, her arms outstretched. She’s hard to miss from the moment you walk in.The Bishop’s Throne is flanked by a couple of lions denoting “the responsibility and authority of the ‘Despota,’ as he governed the church. The lions “symbolize the strength of Christ and the Gospel as proclaimed by episcopal authority. A painting of a double-headed eagle, facing east and west, is located behind the backrest of the Throne. It was the emblem of the Byzantine Empire since, at one time, Byzantium was considered the center of civilization looking toward the east.”The 55 paintings surronding the Nave are inspired by scripture and holy tradition. On the wall as you enter the cathedral I saw Moses holding those tablets containing the 15 (I mean 10) commandments (I have to stop watching Mel Brooks’ movies).If you’re ever in the downtown Los Angeles area, take a few minutes out of your day and come visit this incredibly gorgeous cathedral. It’s quite remarkable, and for just a few minutes you’ll think you’ve been transported to another country.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelsWithMaiTaiTom
50,Just lovely,"Really beautiful even though normally I would find this level of gilt overwhelming. Very fine workmanship. Lots to ogle. We spent a lot longer than we originally anticipated and only left because we had gone there straight from the airport and after a long trip from the east coast and little sleep before that, we were beat. It was supposed to be a quick throwaway to start the trip with not very high expectations. It surprised us in the best way and will remain a delightful memory. When we get back to LA, I have pretty high confidence that we will find our way back there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJJC_Family
