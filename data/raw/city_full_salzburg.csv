50,“Salzburg is most accessible European city 2012”,"Salzburg has won the 2012 EU award for the best accessible, most disabled-friendly city in Europe.http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/1492&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=enSalzburg was selected because of its achievements in making the city well accessible for people with disabilities in key areas like built environment and public spaces, transport and related infrastructure, information and communication, including new technologies, public facilities and services.I totally agree, Salzburg is really well accessible for people with disabilities, especially for people with wheelchairs. In addition to the well-developed transport systemand public spaces, it should be mentioned that most locals go out of their way to lend a hand when disabled people need any help, e.g. when getting onto a bus, up to the fortress, through the Hellbrunn gardens etc."
50,“Amazing view from the castle”,"A beautiful view from the top of the castle. On the left green Daube River passing through in front of your eyes to the right, i can understand how Mozart create this amazing masterpieces."
50,“SPECTRAL SALZBURG IN SPRING !!!”,I and my husband visited Austria salzburg this spring.its one of the most amazing places to visit....everyone is super excited about salzburg beacuse its the place where the film the sound of music was shot .Must visitsSlazburg fortsound of music tourdomemira bell gardensdwarf gardensmozart birthplace.
50,“Salzburg and the Salzburg card- both equally wonderful!”,"So, Salzburg is wonderful, and I took a lot of my tips about my 2 days there from Trip Advisor, and they were all good. Perhaps the best tip was buying the Salzburg card. I chose to get it for my last day there. It took me on the bus to Undersbergbahn, the gondola up the mountain, hiking for a couple of hrs on some amazing trails and awesome views. On the way back, it covered entrance to Schloss Heilbronn and the trick fountains, then back to town for lunch (at the trip advisor recommended Afro cafe). After visits to both of the houses where mozart was born and grew up, and a quick visit to the modern art museum up the elevator, I headed to Mozartplatz for an Aperol outside in the sun and a quick trip to the salzburg museum. I then took a schifff river cruise to relax, before heading up the funicular to Hohensalzburg which I explored in my own time to end the day. Having the card let me spend as long, or as brief, a time I wanted in museums and galleries, without wondering if it was worth the Euros. Even though I could have bussed back, I took a leisurely walk back through Mirabell gardens towards my hotel, freshened up and had dinner at Zum Guten Hirten - another trip advisor reco. Great home-made food in very generous proportions at ver reasonable prices.If you add in that the card covered my bus to the airport the next morning (instead of bus fare, or a cab), my 25 Euros spent on the card covered over 100 Euros worth of activities, which were fun, without rushing. I would imagine the 2-day card is an even better deal. So, go to Salzburg, do a little planning ahead, and hope for good weather. Mine was awesome, and it made the whole thing even more special."
50,“Charming Salzburg”,"Mozart fan? This is the place to go and enjoy this beautiful city.Easy to follow the signs, transportation and see the point of interest. Don't miss the Cathedral, chocolate and musical boxes.Visit Mirabell Palace or take a City Tour Bus.A lot of stores and restaurants are closed on Sunday."
50,“My favourite City in Austria”,"What a wonderful City , I spent 2 holidays in Salzburg, 12days and 8 days.The City itself has so much to offer en it is so central to so many attractions for example The Bavarian Mountains, Ice Caves, Fantastic Lakes, The towns surrounding Salzburg like Berchtesgaden, Mondsee etc etc. You can visit Eagles Nest and Nieuschwanstein . Munich is only 2 hrs away by train as is Innsbruckwith its Swarovski factory.Dinner and concert in the Fortress and Dinner and Con cert in the oldest restaurant in Central Europe the Stiftkeller (since 803AD)I am absolutely in love with this place."
50,“Salzburg at Christmas”,"A visit in Salzburg is a must when travelling to Austria especially during Advent. A lot of hustle and bustle, the advent market and all the people create a beautiful atmosphere, ideal for Christmas. Some shops started offers and one can find goods at lower prices.I' ve there before and I will certainly go there again"
50,“Unbelievable”,Salzburg is a very beautiful city with spectacular views and rich history. We found that you can walk almost anywhere and if it’s too far the buses are easily accessible. The Salzburg card (highly recommended) gets you into a majority of the sites including the mountain lifts and public transportation. There is so much to do there make sure you give yourself plenty of time to go on a Sound of Music tour and to visit the Augustiner Brewery. Getreidegasse is an awesome street that kept us busy for several hours shopping and staring in awe at the unique wrought iron signs. Don’t forget the fortress. It offered beautiful views of the city and the mountains also. We would definitely go back to Salzburg and would love to do everything we missed along with everything we didn’t miss again.
40,“Beautiful and full of character - busy for it's smaller size..”,"After years of traveling through Europe, it's become clear how much I enjoy and appreciate Salzburg. I would even venture out and say it's one of my favorite cities on continent because of its natural and civic beauty.The city has changed a bit since my last trip a few years ago. For one, it's more crowded with tourists - or perhaps I just went at a better time before (the spring). The attractions also seem to be more simply (and expensively) priced although whether or not it's more convenience or to make money is unclear. For example, the castle now offers an all-inclusive ticket as opposed to picking what you wanted to see at the site.But in the end, Salzburg is quite captivating. The old town is beautiful, with its slender winding pathways accessible through tunnels and breezeways. Restaurants and shops galore flank both sides of the street anywhere you walk. I also find the homes/businesses that are built into the rockwork to be quite fascinating. Prices are more reasonable then I remember although that's possibly because the exchange rate with the Euro is so good right now.The top attraction in the city is, of course, its castle perched high above the town. It's all-inclusive tour is just under 8E and be sure to allow 2 hours to see the whole thing, especially swince the main part is with a guide and they only allow so many people at a time. Other popular destinations are the big double domed cathedral and the Mirabella gardens which are quite pretty. Mozart has a heavy influence in the area as this is his birthplace, and some places do everything they can to milk this fact. We also took in the marionette show, but at a length of 2 hours I'd advise anyone that cannot sit and watch puppets for that long to perhaps not attend.A couple of companies offer tours of the city or the surrounding area. Panoramic Tours has been around the longest and offers a nice variety of places to go. Gray Line has also set up shop across the street. The Sound Of Music tour is fun, although if you go with a group of duds you will find it far less amusing. If you enjoyed the movie, you'll find this tour interesting.You can also head out into the Bavarian lakes and mountains, though I recommend doing this on a sunny day. If you go and it's overcast, the beautiful colors just seem cold and gray. The salt mine tour is a bit underwhelming but mildly interesting.Salzburg is also close to a couple of main cities - Munich and Vienna are short train rides away.Overall, it appears word of Salzburg's beauty is getting out. The streets are busy, but the beauty remains well preserved. I highly recommend a visit to this gorgeous part of Austria."
50,"“Saltzburg, Austria”","I recently returned from a wonderful experience of touring the Alpine areas of Austria, Germany and Switzerland. It was a delightful tour with one of the highlights being Saltzburg, Austria.This city is delightful, quaint, and very clean. We had excellent meals at several of the restaurants and were able to sample some of the true German dishes.A highlight was the ""Bierfest"" held the sedond last Sunday of September. This was a typical Octoberfest, with vendors, food, music and puppet shows.We also experienced a Mozart Dinner Theater program which was very well done and the food was excellent.The many beautiful churches in the city were inspiring and the services were very well attended."
40,“Charming town in the alps”,"Our trip to Europe included a short two day stay in Salzburg. This quaint city (140,000 population) still retains its charm by having walkable streets and alleyways in it main shopping district at and around the river. It is a city almost untouched by WWII destruction, and thus has maintained a sense of tranquility among the alps.There is a lot to see. I shot a lot of photos at Schloss Mirabell, right in the middle of town, and about 500m from our hotel. We visited the Salt Mines which is a lovely drive through the alps (went by bus tour) and a fun tour. There is also the Sound of Music tour, but that wasn't our cup of tea. If the weather is sunny, we would recommend taking the extended tour to Hitler's Eagles Nest, it was raining and cloudy for us, but the views we can imagine would have been spectacular.I am an avid night photographer and had an opportunity to roam around one evening, by myself (female), and never once felt nervous or scared that I would be unsafe, especially with a few thousand dollars in camera equipment! The results were amazing and I would love to go back and do some more night lights of this most amazing city."
50,“Great place to visit in Austria”,"Salzburg is a beautiful city. Everyone was very friendly. We visited Mirabell Gardens, Hohenslazburg fortress, St. Peters monastery, and Mozart's home. Shopping in Salzburg is very interesting and enjoyable. Found some great deals. We also took the bus to Untersberg mountain. Take a tram to the top of the mountain. The views are spectacular."
40,“beautiful acient city...!”,"Salzburg is a wonderful and somehow magic city. It's a place worth to be visited when you're once in Austria or close to the European Alps.It's somehow magic because of the landscape around - Salzburg is surrounded by mountains, soft and during summer green hills, full with green places and spaces, small paths for doing some walking and offers (besides the main center which you can pass within one day) a lot of things to discover. ...from acient places and monuments, to somehow modern museums, beautiful old coffee-houses to enjoy wonderful coffee in an nice atmosphere - discover the local markets (at the Universitätsplatz) - if so, don't miss to try a 'Münchner Weisswurst with a Brezel' at the 'Grünmarkt (Greenmarket) on a Saturday morning. ...it's a wonderful experience especially when it's warm and sunny!and - if you're there don't miss the way to the kapuzinerberg via the imbergstiege at the linzergasse, a visit at the 'das kino'-cinema and a good heavy beer at the müllnerbräu. :-)..enjoy beautiful Salzburg just walking along the river and looking around."
40,“Sound of Music country”,"Salzburg is a lovely place to visit with lots of refences to The Sound of Music. It is so pretty and the tour bus is very good with lots of places to hop of the bus and visit, although it does not actually tell you what is at the places, so you do need to decide where you want to explore. The mountains surround the city so it is enevitable that you do get a lot of rain, so always keep something with you to protect you from the terrential downpours."
50,“teh most amazing place”,lovely pretty unique city.. must see.. and must take the sound of Music tour.. amazing
50,“Paris in the Alps / Photographers delight”,"Such a breathtakingly beautiful city - cannot wait until we go back . The buildings in the Old Town & along the river were colorful & full of character - just point & shoot, guaranteed great photo! Even if you don't visit any of the 'sights' like we did - just walking around was wonderful. Not a great place for kids - not much to do, but perfect for a romantic dinner, cup of coffee at a cafe or a little shopping. An upscale, quiet - yet bustling, extremely clean city. Everyone we encountered was kind, pleasant and helpful even with the language barrier! Can't say anything negative, because we did not have a single negative event. From the manicured gardens to the river views, it is an easy place to visit (and visit again!)"
50,"“"" The Hills Are Alive With the Sound of Music""”","Salzburg is magical in the summer with the Music Festival, food, hiking and shopping."
50,“Mozart and Mountains and Money!!”,"We just returned from a family trip to Salzburg, Austria. It was beautiful. We stayed at the Hotel Sallerhof in Groedig at the foot of the Untersberg Mountain, which was a real treat. The staff was wonderful, our room was perfect (with two separate bedrooms and a lovely balcony on which to sit and take in the mountain views), and the breakfasts were something to look forward to after a quiet night's sleep.Our first day we bought Salzburg cards and this was such a deal. With 5 people in the family, it saved us a ridiculous amount of money. We were able to go everywhere we wanted for ""free"" with the card and didn't feel obligated to stay for hours as we do when we've paid the full entrance price. It was a lifesaver with three kids who don't want to spend a long time in every museum/palace/church we happen upon.We saw the Mozart House and Birthplace, Fortress Hohensalzburg, Mirabell Gardens, Hellbrunn Palace, and more and we didn't pay once. We had free bus transportation around the city and got on the Untersberg cable car by just showing our Salzburg cards.The Untersberg cable car was a great way to start a day as we had clear views from the top. It is not for those afraid of heights! It was great for our kids to get a bird's-eye view of the entire area.We definitely recommend Salzburg for families with teens and pre-teens."
50,"“Historic Castles, Breathtaking Landscapes and Expensive Restaurants!”","This charming city deserves its reputation as one of the most beautiful places in Europe. Just two hours away from Munich by train, Salzburg deserves at least a day trip!There are lots of places that are worth a look in the Old Town, butdon't miss the Mirabell Palace and its wonderful gardens and the Salzburg Fortress (Festung Hohensalzburg), from where you have wonderful views of the whole old town and the alps.One final advice: Salzburg is an expensive place, so take care of your budget!"
50,“Town of music”,"Salzburg shows a really high level of classical music, especially in the ""Salzburger Festspiele"" - ""Festival of Music of Salzburg"" since centuries.It is always worth to visit this nice and friendly town. Based on the northern border of the eastern alps, it welcomes you with a great historical old town, a very impressive castle and with an excellent cuisine.See you next there!"
40,“Charming Salzburg”,"There is something about this town that made my heart flutter. It's the simplistic beauty and charm the bigger cities lack that captivated my heart.I started my journey in Vienna then took a train to Salzburg. The two towns could not be more different as they were like apple and orange. As I passed over the Salzach river in Salzburg, the buildings on the banks illuminated the view with a sense of modest grandiosity and unique sophistication like a prince charming who tries to seduce his princess.In every corner I turned to I found a little part of Salzburg's personality in the form of small cobbled alleys, ornated fountains, charming small shops or just simply friendly residents.When you do get the chance to ascent to the hilltop to view the town, it will reveal its frozen state in time that you wish will never be unfrozen. You would almost be able to see the scenary of the past manifesting within the maze of the town. The centuries old churches, cobbled alleys and shops....If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, this beauty has certainly entrapped my memory."
40,“Mozart city”,"I have been to salzburg for 1 month during a training. Its location makes it one of the best place in the world to live, at least for a couple of months. It is easy to Salzburg from Vienna or Munich.The cheapest way to see is to buy the ""salzburg card"" which costs around 20 euros for one day. The old city on the bank of the beautiful salzach contains the most attractions. Once u step into the old city u can pretty much see everything there. Its not a big place. Beautiful gardens, castles and mozart music etc. makes it a wonderful experience.Further, I suggest to visit the world famous ""ice caves "" near salzburg (1 hr by train). Its really a lifetime experience. Please note the caves are only open in the summers. Best to check the dates and time before leaving."
50,“The most beautiful place in Europe”,"I thought I was in a dream when I was in Salzburg, I could almost hear Mozart playing together with the church bells that rang in the cozy town, the town that is surrounded by mountains. The Alps are something that every person should see at least once in their lifetime, the mountains made me feel alive. If you love the movie Sound of Music, Salzburg is a must to visit because the film was shot there. I took a Sound of Music Tour, a very magical one, were we drove around in a bus and visited locations from the movie. A place that should be visited when you are in Salzburg is The Marabelle Garden, it is strikingly beautiful in the spring and summer months. The Austrians are known to provide good service and my experience really lived up to my expectations. If there is any place that I definitely will visit again it is Salzburg, the most beautiful place in Europe. While you are there, do not forget to buy their famous Mozart Kugeln, the chokolate is delicious!"
50,“The nicest place I seen in my life!”,"This month(july 2010)I made a visit into the Austrian Alpes.The main target was Salzburg.What i've seen in the beautiful town of the world it was more than I expected:the river across the city,the castle,Dom,the restaurants,everything is more that i'm expected to see.I think the words it's not enough to describe how the city looks and soon I'm gonna show you some pictures!"
50,“My favorite location in Austria”,"It is such a beautiful city with lots to see and do. It has castles and there are so many wonderful restaurants. We do love the bed and breakfast places, especially Haus Elisabeth, up near the A-1 autobahn on Rauschenstrasse. It is located near the camping platz.. The people are friendly as well. It's central to most destinations within Austria with wonderful train transport to every where. If we could, we would live there."
50,“Salzburg the easy way”,"My husband and I just spent 4 days in and around Salzburg (June 2010). We hired a car (prebooked with Avis) at the nice little airport, and stayed at the Blobergerhof, a lovely hotel just outside the town in a village atosphere. As parking in the city is never easy, and currently there are major works around the station end of town, this enabled us to park free on site, use the car for day trips to Berchtesgaden, down into Austria etc, and catch the bus into town. The Blobergerhof is beautifully decorated in Austrian style, and the staff are fabulous. There is also an excellent restaurant (every night except Sunday) which was very convenient as we came in on an evening flight, and were able to sit on the terrace and enjoy a wonderful meal with a view of the surrounding majestic mountains.A word of warning re the Salzburg station - it currently doesn't exist - just a very big hole in the ground. You can buy tickets in one place, and follow temporary walkways to the platforms, but that's it - no cafes, toilets, shops etc, so be prepared! Still, being Austria, the train was still on time."
50,“WE LOVE SALZBURG”,"Salzburg is one of the most beautiful cities in all of Europe. Someone once described Salzburg as a city where sights come to you, and I couldn’t agree more. We stayed at the lovely Hotel Goldener Hirsch which is in the heart of the old city section. The rooms we cozy, clean, and comfortable, and they had reindeers on everything…so quaint. We started out at Salzburg Festung or Fortress which was amazing. The views are what took my breath away, the swords and stuff my husband loved. On our way up we stopped by St. Peter’s Abby and church, this was part of the sound of music so it was fun to see. We were there when the Christmas markets we’re just opening for business, it was amazing. I bought so much at the markets that I ended up going to the post office in Salzburg and shipped some of my clothing home. We took the sound of music tour our hotel suggests, and we’re so glad we did. My brother in law was “too cool” to go with us, but regretted it after he saw our pictures and listened to all the things we learned. I HIGHLY recommend taking on of those tours!! Lastly, we ate at Saint. Peter's Archabbey Restaurant, which claims to be the old restaurant dating back to 803. The food was amazing, the décor so interesting, and beer AWSOME! It’s kind of hard to find so ask you hotel about it. You will love Salzburg, it’s a gem"
40,“Salzburg card - must have”,"If anyone is going to Salzburg, it is definitely worth buying the Salzburg Card (available from hotel reception and tourist offices). It allows one entry to all the atrractions and starts on the date and time you first use it (ie you write the date and time on the back yourself when you go to the first place) so if you buy a 24 hours card for instance, it is literally for 24 hours from the first use.We stayed at the Sheraton where the staff are excellent - very helpful and pleasant. The room was a good size, robe and slippers provided and good quality toiletries. We booked room only but was a bit shocked at the cost of breakfast (28 Euros each!) so didn't eat there. We went to Fingerlos everyday instead. Fantastic place for breakfast and always busy. They also have a great selection of cakes if you fancy popping back for afternoon tea.The Sound of Music tour for good but we wern't very lucky with the weather that day. Very overcast and dull so views of the mountains almost non-existent. Best to try and get on it when the forecast is good. The tour guide was very informative and told a few home truths about the making of the film and comparison to the true story. Might upset a dedicated SOM fan but we found it amusing.Would definitely recommend Schloss Helbrumm with the trick fountains and the zoo in the grounds. Can be done in half a day and then get the bus to Untersburg for the cable car up the mountain. Beware though - the cable car was closed for maintenance mid-April so we couldn't use it. Guide books will tell you it is open from beginning of April so maybe this was an unexpected glitch. We had lunch and a beer at the Hotel Untersburg instead. Best salad I have ever tasted.Hope all this helps."
50,“A very special location”,"My husband and I got married at the Mirabell Palace in Salzburg in April 2010, and spent a week in the city.It is a beautiful city with Salzach river winding through the middle separating the old and new town areas. The Mirabell Gardens are beautiful and were a wonderful location for our wedding with the fortress as a backdrop.The Old Town is where the majority of the sights, shops and restaurants are, but the New Town also has shops and restaurants. The Old Town area is easily accessed over the Makartsbridge (footbridge) only 5 minutes from the Mirabell Gardens.The fortress is worth a look, we walked up to it; its a steep climb but not far, and worth it to take in the views on the way. Salzburg has a lot of large squares, cultural and architectural sights. Try getting off the beaten track and exploring, walk up past the Museum der Moderne and on to the castle, or up into the hills on the other side of the river for spectacular views.We also did the Sound of Music tour (of course) which takes you to the main locations in the film, but is very cheesy with the soundtrack playing on the coach during the whole tour. We did the Bavarian Alps and Saltmines tour as well which I would highly recommend. There are a couple of booths near the Mirabell palace where you can book trips, or your hotel will usually book them too - we used Panarama tours for both our trips (discounts if you book 2 together). Buses are frequent and €2 for any one journey. Take a bus to the Helbrunn Palace to see the Trick Fountains (quite impressive) then walk through the gardens of Helbrunn up to the zoo - great for old and young alike.During our stay we had very heavy rain showers followed by bright sunshine, our wedding day was warm and sunny, but the day after was very heavy rain - it changed very quickly every few hours! Overall Salzburg is a very pretty, romantic city with lots to do for all ages - our wedding party of 24 people ranged from 10 - 85 years old, and all thoroughly enjoyed their time in this beautiful city."
50,“Salzburg - Old and New”,"Salzburg is just a fantastic place to visit. The accommodation where we stayed was cosy but comfortable and friendly. It had everything you needed including free internet. A short stroll from our hotel was a copplestone shopping area that had modern fountains and lighting. Mirrabell gardens was spectaular to see and you can get a fantastic photo of the gardens with the fortress in the background. The detail that has been put into the design and upkeep of the gardens is just impecable. I have never seen anything like it before.A short walk from the gardens across the bridge that spans the wide and fast flowing Denube River and you are transported into the Old Salzburg where you can have a horse and carriage ride, see people dressed in traditional Austrian outfits and visit the fortress. A vanacular takes you to the top of the mountain where the fortress is. There you can see breathtaking views overlooking Salzurg and the surrounding countryside, eat at the restaurant, go to the opera or listen to orchestras in one of the many rooms and halls in the fortress.From Salzurg we took a 'Hills and Lakes' tour. A bus ride takes you out of the city of Salzburg to and through small villages stopping at one where you can see the house where Mozart's mother grew up. The lakes are so clear you can see all the fish swimming around and the rocks that are on the bottom of the lake. As party of the tour we took a boat cruise along one of the big lakes (there are 4 all together) and you are able to see one of the mansions that was used in 'The Sound of Music'. If you are a keen hiking there are many walking tracks around this area through the mountains and around the lakes with camping grounds close by.I would recommend Salzburg as a top place to visit for all ages as there is something for everyone. We will definately be going back one day!"
50,“Just Great!!!”,"OK, we only went there for a day excursion, as we were staying in Vienna at the time. Picturesque!We managed to visit the Hohensalzburg Fortress, the Residenzplatz and the Getreidengasse. Everything just adorable!We are definitely planning to visit again sometime, and stay there for a few days, so that we will be able to explore Salzburg in a more detailed way.Even so, my mind is set: Visit Salzburg, it is worth it!"
50,“Archenkirk onth Arkensee”,A fantastic little town in Austria not far from Salzberg and Innsbrook. The people are really charming and the skiing was great. Would always go back there!
40,“Take your time”,"Salzburg was great. We only had a short amount of time and could have spent days here. This is a great city. We really didn't get to see much and would love to visit this city again. This review might not be too helpful, except to say you'll need more than the 2-3 hours we had to visit."
50,“Excellent Break in Salzburg”,"Salzburg is great!! Lots to see & do & if you are planning on doing a lot invest in a SalzburgerCard - it was quite expensive but gives you all travel on buses & all attraction entrances free so in the long run saves you a lot of money!Fantastic Beer halls such as the Sternbrau (lots of different beer halls in one place & several fab beer gardens) Afro Cafe (Funky little coffee house) Helbruun Schloss (trick fountains - a good laugh & nice gardens) Bräustübl Tavern in Mülln (not to far but about a 10 min bus ride from the centre) WELL worth a visit if you like your beer... 1,500 seater beer garden & 4 beer halls, you buy a stein & keep it the whole time you are there just paying to fill it up you can eat there too from little stalls, it is in an old Monestary! The Ice Caves in Werfen (train ride away) FANTASTIC ice caves - if I remember rightly they are the biggest in the world?? VERY cold once you are in there - wish i'd worn gloves & it was a hot day outside!!! Please note this is a 20 min steep walk to a cable car & then another 20 min steep walk to teh cave entrance - a lot of stairs in there also!!! The Salt mines in Werfen are good too (another train ride) you get to wear a special outfit over your clothes & go on a little train & down some slides - good fun & very interesting! Mozart's house was ok - more for real fans I think! We also got the train to the Oktoberfest in Munich for the day from here (2 hours on the train) The Oktoberfest was GREAT FUN & I can highly reccommend that!!)"
50,“One of the best cities in Europe!”,"Salzburg is a ""must-see"" city in Europe, let alone Austria!! There are many sites to see and the people there are so friendly! The food is ""traditional"" and delicious!I would definitely recommend getting the Salzburg card while you are there. You can get a day pass, multiple days, etc. It offers you discounts on attractions, and even free admissions as well! Taking a cable car to the top of the Untersburg, riding the cog-train to the top of the Fortress, taking a boat ride on the river, and touring Helbrunn Palace was just a few of the attractions that cost us nothing additional!Although it may seem a little ""hokey"", going on the ""Sound of Music Tour"" was one of the best things we did in Salzburg - and in Europe overall! For the money, you cannot get a better tour of Salzburg and the Lakes District. If you are a fan of the movie, you have got to do this! If not a fan, you are still seeing all the sites where fiming was done for the movie, which is incredible and breath-taking in itself!The quaint streets of Salzburg are lined with golden signs and unique shops. The buses and trams run promptly and are user-friendly. This ""Home of Mozart"" sings his praises and there are many a souvenier to take home.I think a trip to Salzburg is a must for anyone travelling to Europe. Be prepared to spend a couple-3 days to really take it all in!"
40,“Mozarts Hometown”,"I love this city! I've been there four times already and I keep going back. It has a vintage, 1940s feel to it. The history, the people, the streets, everything has personality. If you enjoy nature, historical sites, breath-taking views, or just want to discover somewhere fabulous, this place is definitely for you!"
50,“My favorite place in Austria”,"Salzburg, Austria is a magical place to visit. I have been many times, but I took my husband there for the first time last year. He was as much in awe of the beauty of our surroundings as I always have been. Salzburg is a small, but cosmopolitan city with great shopping and restaurants. There are also many attractions nearby worth a day trip such as taking the train to the top of Wolfgangsee, and wandering their quaint city streets. There are also numerous lakes to go swimming (if you can stand cold ,but refreshing water) or take a boat out in. Touring one of the salt mines is also a must (this is how Salzburg got it's name). Another fun activity away from the city is summer sledding called sommerrattlebahn. It's sledding down a mountain on a built course, and lots of fun with spectacular views! For mountain climbers (or those who appreciate the view from atop of a mountain) there is the Untersberg, which is the highest point in Salzburg. You can hike to the top, or take a cable car (my preferred method of travel). The views from the top are phenomenal, and on a clear day you can see to the infamous Eagles Nest. There is something for everyone in Salzburg, Austria, and I haven't even begun to touch on the amazing deserts, and hospitality of the Austrian people!"
50,“Salzburg - Fantastic Citiy and Base for Seeing Bavaria”,"We traveled late June, early July to Munich, Salzburg, and Innsbruck, just my wife and I. All three are really great, but Salzburg and its location was really special. First, we stayed at the Hotel Sacher in Salzburg, the best service we have received at a hotel anywhere in the world, and we have stayed at some nice hotels. The chocolates in the room, the staff all knew our names, the fresh flowers and candles served at the bar as we simply ordered some wine before going out for dinner - just some examples of the details that very few ever deliver. I won't cover all the obvious things in Salzburg, as they are well known and written about already. A few highlights. We did the dinner at the Stiftskeller St. Peter and paid a little extra to have the front row. We also had a different menu, for example a great beef filet was served versus the typical chicken dish. I would say the food was 4 on a 5 scale, but exceeded my expectations since it is a catered meal, not a regular restaraunt. Terrific show without the disrputions noted in other reviews, maybe we were just lucky. We also bought the city cards for Salzburg and Innsbruck and they were worth it. No gimmicks, just a bundled entry fee for all the major sites and free bus/tram transportation. From Salzburg, we took the train to Berchtesgaden and then the bus to Obersalzburg to take the final bus to Eagles Nest. While you can get to this from Munich, it is closer from Salzburg. After seeing the stunning views from Eagles Nest, we spent the day at Lake Konigsee. It was a bus ride from Obersalzburg, but the bus, train, tram system in Germany and Austria is very predictable and an economic way to travel. Konigsee has about a 24% salt content, so it is crystal clear and has stunning vertical mountains jutting up from the edges. We took an evening train back to Salzburg. I did the salt mine tour and Sound of Music tour 18 years ago, and didn't this time, but never ran out of things to do.If/when we go back to Salzburg, we will definitely stay at the Hotel Sacher. It sits right in the new town, on the banks of the river, so you have a view of old town, lit up at night of course. I hope you enjoy your trip to Salzburg."
50,“Part from a fairy tale!”,"We have just returned from Salzburg. The hotel was very nice (The Goldener Hirsch), in the heart of the shopping centre, two minutes walk from the river and very close to the Hohensalzburg!Salzburg was wonderful! Anywhere you look, you can see something interesting.Castles and fortresses are everywhere!Have you visit Schloss Anif? If you do not, do it as soon as you can. You will never forget what you will see. This and many other beautiful places...Go to Salzburg... Winter or summer... Christmas or not... Anytime of the year, Salzburg is part from a fairy tale..!"
50,“Getting to Salzburg from Munich”,"If you're in Munich for a few days, go visit Salzburg, Austria. It's absolutely wonderful. The round trip train tickets for up to 5 people will cost you €28. You'll want to get the Bayern-Ticket at the kiosk at the Hauptbahnhof. It leaves about every hour and you can leave early in the morning and come back before 9pm from Salzburg. The train ride takes 2 hours each and it's very scenic.Once in Salzburg the walk from the train station to the city takes about 15 minutes and it's pretty straight forward. If you're not sure, just follow the crowds. Most people are walking down to the city. There is a TI office at the Salzburg Hauptbahnhof where you can pick up a free map of the city. That will help you when you're walking around the city. Wear comfortable shoes. There's a lot of walking to be done in Salzburg, and if you want to see the city from the top of the hills, you'll be climbing lots of stairs!"
10,“Surprised in a bad way”,"I have visited the city of Salzburg many times before but only as a day trip and have never stayed in the city until March 2009.I went to Salzburg for a city break as a special birthday present from my family. I did not enjoy my stay at all. I stayed in the Europa hotel next to the train station. The surrounding area around the train station appeared to be an adult only area and unsafe for females to walk about day and night. I was not impressed by the lack of restaurants in Salzburg, there was hardly anywhere including in the town itself to eat on an evening and we resulted to dinning out in Burger King in the train station. I did a bit of shopping during my stay which resulted in me feeling very insulted and upset after entering a supermarket...when I got to the check-out to pay for my purcheses I was very rudely asked by the check out lady to show her the contents of the rest of my shopping bags! I assumed this was because I was English. I was very upset, insulted and EMBARRASED at this, I have never in my life had to been asked to hand over my shopping bags by a member of staff! I have been to various cities and shops and never been asked this before nor has anyone I know. If you are interested in visiting this city please beware is not very English friendly, it is very expensive and like most cities watch your handbags and pockets!"
50,“Insider / Story Teller in Salzburg - How do you know what weather will come”,"Try getting away from the ""regular-tourist-paths"". Go into the small sidestreets and allies and learn about the stories of this town.......- Residenzplaz: The fountain is made from marble coming from the Mountain Untersberg. On top is Triton. When he washes his face the weather will be good. If he washes his back, expect bad weather.In Salzburg there can be lot´s of rain. so don´t forget your raincoat.Good hotels offer umbrellas.When the wind come fron the south ( when the flags on the bridge wave in the same direction as the waterflows) there will usually be goodweather.Cecilia Herm- HOSP Herm Hospitality Consulting"
50,“Awesome city in the Alps -- Home of the music genius”,"Mozart had been known to be particularly critical of his hometown and called it provincial. Well, no more, for Salzburg has graduated to being an Austrian must-see heavyweight. For being classified as a city, Salzburg is surprisingly compact and manageable on foot, unlike Vienna. It is a headache trying to drive around so it's best to find the closest (affordable) parking and just walk.If you are a die-hard Mozart fan like me, you'd want to visit (read: pay) to go to his Geburtshaus (birth house) and the more interesting Wohnhaus (the house he lived in as a teenager). Take a walk down some side streets to the cemetary where many of the Mozart family members are buried though, sadly, not Mozart himself because he died in Vienna and no one knows where he is buried. Go inside the church (free) on the main square -- while the church is non-descript, the font in which Mozart was baptized is there.Take the furnacular up to the fortress for a gorgeous view of the city, preferably in the latter half of the afternoon. It's fun to take a tour of the fortress and learn a little about the history of Salzburg (not that interesting). And, if you aren't too particular about your music/orchestra, you can even attend a concert inside the fortress the evening.Spring for a hotel in the old town -- though not necessarily the Hotel Sacher of Vienna fame. It's easier than having to take a bus into town for sightseeing and you can get a different perspective of the town after dark, when the throngs of day tourists have left."
50,“A very beautiful part of Europe”,"I went to Salzburg on a conference. It is a really beautiful part of Europe and it was a real blessing to be able to spend time in Salzburg. The old city is amazing. I loved the trip to the Ice Cave, it was quite strenuous, but worth every huff and puff and the stiff muscles that followed. Amazing."
50,“My favourite city in europe”,"This is a marvellous city with lots to offer. Probably one of the most beautiful places I have ever been and I've been back often. In both summer and winter its amazing. The people here are among the friendliest, honest, helpful people in the world. You will never find yourself ripped off and you will be amazed at the atmosphere. Lunch at the castle, a trip on the river, just a stroll through the old town is a marvellous way to spend a day. Make a trip to the Augustine brewery in summer. Amazing food and amazing home brewed beer in a fantastic setting of an old monastery with a amssive beer garden. In the old town, just off the main street, find the balkan grill, ( a kiosk up a side street ) , and get yourself a bosna. You'll know what I mean!!"
50,“Magical Salzburg”,"This place is truely magical! It is an absolute must see. The altstadt is quaint and very negotiable. I highly recommend just wandering about the streets, as you stuble onto all of the major sites. Put it on the ""bucket list."""
20,“hohenstauffen hotel”,"We stayed at this hotel for one night but the beds were terrible and felt damp. We put this down to the fact the bathroom was in a small narrow room at the end farthest from the window and had no extraction fan, which meant the steam had nowhere to go.Apart from that the people were really nice and the breakfast very good."
50,"“I love this city, especially Old Salzburg.”","Stay in the Old City. You'll have to tote your luggage through the town after parking in a garage, but it is well worth it. Take time to go on the Sound of Music tour; it's so much fun. Visit the Salt Mine nearby too. Don't forget to order Apfel Strudel with Vanilla Sauce (yummmmm). Get the Rick Steve's book on touring Europe; he really does it right."
50,“One of my favorite places in Austria”,"Located at the northern boundary of Alps, the city was founded around 700 b.c and since then has kept great economic and cultural importance for that part of Austria. The rich baroque architecture invites everybody to walk through its narrow streets or simply sit on a bank and contemplate.The main tourist monuments are within one or two km far and are around the cathedral: The cathedral itself and all the building that sorrounded it, the Mozart square, Getreidegasse ( shop street and also we can see the Mozart´s birthplace), Hohensalzburg fortress (take the cable car if you are still tired but don´t forget to go down on foot, so you can appreciate the view), the 712 b.c. founded Nonnberg monastery and its cemetery with stunning view from the mountains, the festival theatre and many, many churches.Across the River are the Mirabel Palace, its gardens and more nice places to view.A bit far from downtown are Leopoldskron, Anif, Klessheim and Hellbrunn palaces.If one wishes to go to Salzburg I suggest to see the movie The sound of music (1965). It happens in Austria but focused in Salzburg and many shops in the city sell souveniers from the places showed in the movie. Also is possible to get a tour to visit these places."
50,“Magic Winter”,"If you are in Central Europe during the Winter months (northern hemisphere) you should make every effort to spend a few days in one of the most charming places I would choose for a European Winter experience that does not necessarily have to involve skiing.Whether you go ice skating on the ""Mozart Platz"" in the center of the city, have mulled wine, take a stroll on on of the mountains in the middle of the city, which gives you magnificent views, or want to breath some thousand years of history, baroque style, music, arts, or museums, Salzburg is probably one of the most exquisite places I have been to.If you want organized travel, there are bus trips to surrounding areas and sites available starting from the Mirabell Platz, a square in front of the Mirabell Schloss, about 5 minute bus trip from the main train station. The same Schloss Mirabell (a baroque castle with beautiful gardens, outdoor theater stage, maze of hedges, fountains, and statues depicting classical Greek mythology) also features top quality classical concerts (Salzburger Schlosskonzerte) in its Marmor Saal (marble hall), a hall with walls and floors entirely made of marble, which is used during the day time to conduct weddings in the most romantic setting.Most importantly I would like to mention that the prices, compared by international standard, are very affordable. This goes for hotels, restaurants, concerts, museum admissions, etc.A word about restaurants: Austrian gastronomy needs special mention, as besides formal restaurants for eating out, or coffee shops where one would mainly have a hot drink with one of the irresistible slices of cake, there are also Tavern-like places, where one can eat full meals, or just choose to have a glass of beer or wine, a spirit, a bowl of soup, franks, crepes, or whatever else the menu offers.The most unusual feature of these places is that one can sit there alone, with a friend, or in larger company, over a cup of coffee or a glass of beer, and enjoy the atmosphere without feeling that one has to leave within a short time.I used to go to the so called ""Müllner Bräustübl"" a large brew house where they serve great beer in big ceramic steins, and sit there over one beer for an hour or two, without being 'molested' by waiters. In smaller taverns (Gasthaus) the waitress or the waiter will approach the guests, when they see that the guest finished his/her drink, but only out of courtesy to find out if you want something else, and not in a pushy manner.Again, the pricing in all the places I have been to was very reasonable.I experienced New Year's Eve in Salzburg, which was an amazing event, with people - equipped with fireworks and champagne bottles - were packed in the city center as well as on the city mountains, from which most of the fireworks were launched. However there was a small disappointment: The fireworks started so early, and in such great numbers, that the old city was veiled in smoke by the time midnight came around. It also was extremely crowded, but due to the frosty weather this didn't feel oppressive. People in general were very friendly, happy, and disciplined that night.I would like to suggest a beautiful walk along the Untersberg, Salzburgs highest mountain in the closer vicinity to the city.It is a 15 minute drive in direction of Großgmain, with a forest road, closed to regular traffic, going along the mountain in a magic setting of snow laden trees and mountains. At the end of the valley one reaches ""Wolfsschwang"", and gets rewarded with the sight of a herd of deers that is kept in a large enclosed area there. A wooden cabin has a coin slot on one of the outside walls and when inserting 50 Eurocent, deer fodder is being ground, and falls into a bucket, which can be taken to feed the deers.Most importantly, - the tourist masses are only in the city center, and when venturing onto one of the mountains, or into some old side street, one always can find quite recluse in order to just soak in the atmosphere."
50,“Beautiful Salzburg”,"My friend and I spent a week in Salzburg in January 08. We stayed at the Goldener Hirsch Hotel, and set out on our first morning to do the walking tour that encompasses Mozartplatz, the Fortress, St Peter's, the Cathedral etc.The fortress is a must, if only for the magnificent views it gives you of the city. The only negative part of the visit to the fortress was the rude, surly waitress in the cafe. In the cafe's favour, it served the best hot chocolate we had on our trip.Eating out in Salzburg was a little difficult, as many of the restaurants only print the menus in German. Having seen some translated menus mentioning things like ""boiled veal cheeks"", I would be careful about just being brave and taking pot luck! We had great food at Yuen Chinese restaurant, and there are plenty of other options if you don't appreciate typical austrian food. Of course, the pastries and cakes are fantastic in just about all of the coffee shops.We did the Sound of Music tour with Panorama Tours, and it was excellent. Even if you aren't really a fan of the film, do the tour purely for the fabulous sightseeing you do round and about Salzburg. We also did the tour to Bavaria with Panorama as well. Both guides, Peter and Bern, were knowlegeable and friendly.Take time away from Getreidegasse to explore the other side of the Salzach river, and see Linzergasse. It's less picturesque, but prices are cheaper, and there is a great cafe called Cafe Habukkuk which lives up to it's other reviews on this site. For takeaway food, try Cafe Indigo(they have 2 sites on either side of the river)Salzburg has only one negative that I can mention, and that is that smoking is allowed in restaurants, and in many cases, not even in a designated area. Many locals seem to smoke, and I found this really off putting when out for meals, coffee etc."
50,“A little bit of everything”,"There is only one place outside my home country that I have visited more than any other place and that is Salzburg. I visited in 2003 and it was one of the best places I visited whilst on a 3 month tour of Western Europe. I returned in 2005, 2006 and 2007. One of those years is when I gave the old Oktoberfest a visit in nearby Munich. Salzburg wouldnt have those brilliant memories for me if it wasnt for the accomodation and that is the YoHo hostel located about 10 minutes from the train station and about 15 minutes from the old town. The hostel is great for meeting like minded travellers and is also a stop off destination for 'Busabout' and if you're around when the that lot are in town then expect lots of drinking and little sleep. Salzburg is famous for its salt mines, 'The Sound of Music' and Mozart but its the futher afield attractions which also makes Salzburg a good place to visit. The hostels and Tourist Information can arrange trips to Werfen where you can see the largest Ice Caves in Europe and see them with a guide using old lighting techniques of oil lamp and magnesium strip or you can catch a train to Berchtesgaden and see Adolf Hitlers Eagles Nest where amazing views of the Alps can be seen and Salzburg in the distant valleys. A trip to the Salt Mines can be done also and most hostels and hotels do daily Sound of Music Tours. There are good pubs and bars with live music down by the river and there is good food in and around the town also but if you want to stay at the YoHo then you must book early in the summer months"
20,“Mostly Mozart”,"I wouldn’t recommend going to Salzburg, unless you’re very keen on Mozart. There isn’t much there in the way of museums & art galleries, and most of what there is closes at 17:00. About the only attractions remaining open after this time are Mozarts Geburtshaus & Mozarts Wohnhaus. We wandered around Mozarts Geburtshaus one early evening, looking at exhibits such as a drawing comparing Mozart’s left ear to somebody else’s, and and a lock of what the museum thought might possibly be a lock of Mozart’s hair. I did like some of the exhibits in the Dommuseum (Cathedral Museum), and the cathedral itself was no less attractive than the average cathedral, but there wasn’t much else that was worth going to see.In particular, beware of the Barokmuseum. It’s only after you’ve paid your money (admittedly not much, I think it was five euro) that you read that they haven’t actually got any finished works of art at all: just a collection of pencil drawings and what is translated into English as ‘rough sketches’ (I think sometimes we use the word ‘esquisse’; I can’t remember the German).If you go on the river cruise, note that there are a few seats at the back of the boat which are open to the elements, whereas most of the seats are covered and you have to look out through the plastic walls of the enclosure."
40,“Traveling in Salzburg with my Dad”,"The Salzburg Card – Must Buy!Travel Agents Beware: Salzburg is a no-brainer; all you need is a 72 hour Salzburg Card. For 36 euros you get free access to most of the major attractions with free public transportation. Mark up the card for dry or wet days and enjoy. Below are the sights my father and I saw with comments. BTW: The card is only good once per sight for one user. My father is 83 and requires the use of a walker for longer distances. My handicap rating is NOT for those who require wheelchairs.Cable-Car Untersberg - A must see! The regular price is 18 euros and hence you’ve paid for half the card. The views from atop the mountain are breathtaking but a little scary if you decide to go for a hike to visit the mountain climber’s memorial. Those of you who are vertically challenged will still enjoy the views as long as you don’t stray from the guard rails.Handicap Friendly for those with walkers. The bus almost takes you right to the Cable Car.Hellbrunn – Palace and Trick Fountains – More for the kiddies. The fountains were fun but the palace itself didn’t have that much worth seeing. It’s on the way back from the Untersberg Mountain, so you might as well drop in.Not Handicap Friendly. The bus doesn’t drop you off near the Palace and hence there is far too much walking required.Hohensalzburg Fortress – Spectacular views and you get a close-up look at the famed Marionettes.Not Handicap Friendly. Cabs won’t even take you up to the funicular.Salzach Cruise – Good orientation to place yourself in the city. It’s a combination of video/live guide and music.Handicap Friendly.Miracle’s Waxmuseum – A little too touristy for me. Go for it with the card but don’t pay 12 euros.Not Handicap Friendly. There is no lift and too many steps.Mozart’s Birthplace – A must see since you are in Mozart Land but again…a little too touristy and not enough substance. A guide to ask questions of would have made the experience so much better.Not Handicap Friendly. There is no lift and too many steps.Mozart’s Residence – Lots of substance here with a very interesting self audio guide and good film.Handicap Friendly with a lift.Mönchsberglift to the Museum of Modern Art Salzburg – Only worth it on a sunny day for the view. The art exhibit was a little too modern for my liking. This site was difficult to find and curiously, there were trucks and cars blocking my father and myself from getting into the building to the lift! There was a painting of Salzburg Royalty with a Camel Head which I would recall later during my stay. Quite a few people smoke in Salzburg.Museum of Natural History – Close to the Museum of Modern Art, so you might as well drop by. More for the kids.Handicap Friendly.Panorama Museum New Residenz – Interesting exhibits comparing the past to the present of Salzburg.Handicap Friendly with a lift.Residenz Gallery – Okay on a rainy day.Handicap Friendly with a lift.Schnitzel, best free site, music and more!Favorite Restaurant: Stiftskeller St. Peter Restaurant – Best Schnitzel I’ve ever had with lots of potatoes. Beautiful ambience and good service. Go during lunch hour as the menu prices are lower.Handicap Friendly.Best Free Site: St. Rupert’s Cathedral for Sunday Mass at 10 in the morning. The Dom, as it’s called, actually boasts more art eye candy than any gallery in Salzburg. I recommend you give a small donation.Handicap Friendly.Salzburger Schloss Konzerte – The place to be if you’re into ‘baroque.’ We were treated to 2 Mozart Pieces along with Vivaldi’s Four Seasons. I was very impressed with the quality of the chamber music. The violinist, blonde and very tall, played with such passion I thought her violin might catch fire!Handicap Friendly with a lift but you have to find it yourself as they had very little theatre personnel from what I could see. On our way out, the door in the hallway we came in was closed. My dad was in a hurry and hence navigated the stairs. It was raining heavily and to my surprise there were no taxis lined up outside as is the custom at Canadian theaters. I had to scamper 2 blocks to a nearby hotel who kindly called a cab for us.Wolf-Dietrich Altstadthotel und Residenz – Best breakfast brunch I’ve had in my life. All the food was BIO and well-prepared. They also treat you to afternoon coffee and late afternoon latté. Christine, who worked reception, was very helpful and also very attractive. The room was bigger than I thought it would be with a wide screen LCD, DVD player and mini fridge.The only major problem was zero ventilation to rid yourself of unwanted washroom odors! Also, the staff and some guests smoked around the internet access area. It was supposed to be a smoke-free hotel.Handicap Friendly in Altstadthotel part of hotel (lift).Shopping, Mozart Balls, and who let the dogs out?Shops – Everybody was very friendly complimenting me on my German even though I was very rusty. You’ll quickly learn to “Gruß Gott.” It’s the local greeting meaning Greeting God. I purchased a light blue Nehru linen jacket to compliment a denim Nehru shirt that I never thought I would find a jacket for! Beer was only 75 cents (Euro) at the Spars market.Avoid the Europark, as it has nothing to capture your eye for a keepsake and the surrounding neighborhoods are a little run down.Biggest Surprise – Dogs are welcome in cafés and restaurants and I’m happy to report the canine population in Salzburg was much better behaved than their Canadian canine counterparts – Many DO NOT even require a leash.Mozart Balls – The Mozart Kugels in the blue silver wrapper tasted better but the others were delicious too.Salzburg Tourism Office – They’re very serious about tourism in Salzburg! I received a brochure and many other materials within a week via mail from Salzburg to Canada. They even mailed me a short 12 minute promo about Mozart (Mozart 2006 Salzburg - 250th Anniversary) by Curt Faudon gratis. I’ve been told it was their last copy. I viewed it from my hotel library but couldn’t find a copy for sale in Salzburg. To use a favorite word of Andre Rieu, it was Fantastisch!All in all, I had a good time but wished it hadn’t rained so much."
40,"“Alstadt Radisson; Salzburg, wonderful city!”","We went to Salzburg after four days in Prague in July 2007, a week before the music festival. We traveled by train to Linz, then Salzburg, and took a taxi cab to our hotel, the Alstadt Radisson in Old Town. The taxi ride was good, giving us an opportunity to view the city before we settled in. Our cab driver was very knowledgable and gave us information about different aspects of the buildings and history during our quick ride. (about a 5 minute ride)The hotel was beautiful and central to everything. The room was spacious and clean, with a new flat screen tv, a comfortable bed, and a huge bathroom. The furnishings were pretty and new.The hotel, which boasts classical and unique rooms, certainly was both. Breakfast every morning was delicious and left us very full. While we enjoyed our stay at the hotel, our only real issue was with the ""fully air conditioned rooms"" that they mentioned in their ads. One of the reasons we chose this particular hotel was because of its location and this particular amenity. When we arrived, they ""upgraded"" us to a room on the highest point of the hotel. It had a door and a little roof-top balcony with a table and chairs, which was really nice. However, the ""air conditioned room"" it spoke about was not a wall unit, but a portable unit that collected water and had to be emptied every three hours or so. Aside from that machinery, there was no other way to get air into the hotel room. If we tried to turn off the air conditioner, we couldn't open a window because there was only the door to the balcony to open. The thing that made this fact increasingly frustrating was that it was 100 degrees fahrenheit during our stay. (40 C) At night, the air conditioner would turn off because the little water jug was full and we'd sweat. I only mention this fact because we felt a little deceived in their advertising, because this luxury hotel was not so luxurious in this amenity.That aside, Salzburg is a wonderul city to go on vacation. It was relaxing and very laid back. At 6 pm, the shops and stores close down for the night. This surprised us a little, but was actually a nice change of pace. The city became quiet early, with the exception of a couple of restaurants and bars. We enjoyed the aforementioned rooftop balcony at these moments and drank delicious Austrian fizzy applejuice as we listend to the different sounds of the city. We went to bed at about 10 some nights because we were tired from a day of activities and had little to do at night.If you have time and the interest, take the Sound of Music Tour. While a little cheesy, they have a true appreciation for the musical and the tour affords you the opportunity to see different parts of Salzburg as well as some other towns where the film was shot, like Mondsee. You'll get to see Mirabell Gardens, St. Michael's Basillica, and other areas from the film, which are historically relevent to the city of Salzburg as well. The tour guide was great, a British woman with a dry sense of humor and immense knowledge of the film and Austrian culture. I wish I could remember her name, because she was excellent!We had a great experience in Mirabell Gardens: while walking through it for the first time at about dusk, we heard music. Sure enough, in this little green pavillion of bushes, with a little stage, there were two students playing music, one the cello, the other the french horn. People just wandered in from the garden, sat down on the nearby benches, and listened. They gave a free concert. We were assuming they were students from the music school. It was such a perfect moment.I would also recommend that you take advantage of all of the delicious bakeries in Salzburg. We enjoyed the Linzer tarts, apple struddel, and the other baked goods we found around town. For great food, go to the Sacher Hotel, home of the bakery that creates the famous Sacher Torte, some of the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten! They have a restaurant there, a little pricey, but worth the money. It was our anniversary so we had a meal there as a treat and it was delicious!The Fortress is a must, but try to see it in the morning, there are less people crowding up the different tours and buildings. There are some fantastic views and some amazing artifacts on display. If you have the physical ability, take the walk up and down from the Fortress. Again, some great views and a greater appreciation for the layout of the city.St. Peter's restaurant, the oldest in Europe, had amazing food! They do a night of Mozart, which includes dinner and live music. It was amazing! The musicians were so talented and played so well. There were even two opera singers that sang to the pieces from Don Giovanni. You can get tickets from your hotel or go right up to the restaurant and by them. The restaurant itself is near St. Peter's church and the little cemetary. The atmosphere is beautiful.If you have the opportunity, take a bike ride around the city. There are several tours you can take and they all seemed worth it. We didn't get to do it and I regret it!As to language: if you do not speak German, bring a German phrase book with you. It will be very helpful. While the 2nd language spoken in Austria is English, German is the 1st language spoken. Try to know some phrases, even though those in these heavily tourist areas may (even probably) speak English."
10,“Racism in Salzburg”,"Salzburg in the year 2007-pretty to look at perhaps, but overall a great, big, shocking, disappointment. Our experience there was one of racist incidences and rude residents. It seems the attitudes of some of its residents is anything but pretty.My mother and I are Indian. We have lived in many different continents, have travelled a huge amount and visited many countries. We, as worldwide travellers, have never experienced such a sour place as Salzburg. Having travelled since childhood, I have never experienced something as awful as this.My mother and I took the train from Vienna to Salzburg last week.When we got to our hotel:1) We booked a tour to see Salzburg's lakes and mountains (35 euros) and inquired about the 'Lakes and Mountains' tour.Our hotel booked us onto the coach and a minivan arrived to pick us up to take us to the coach. When we got to the coach, the coach driver stopped my mother and I from getting onto the coach. He first claimed the coach was full, but that, we would be taken on a 'private' tour in a minivan identical to the one which had brought us to the coach earlier. Later, however, his excuse changed- he told us this private arrangement was better for us because the coach had people from only European countriesand that as we would have a private tour, we would not have to sit through commentary in different European languages, and would only be guided in English. There was only one other group with us on the minivan- a young Arab couple from Dubai; the wife with her hair covered, were the only others to join my mother and I on this private tour. The tour description said that: we were meant to be given time in the small town of St. Gilgen to shop before being taken back to our hotel via the same route as we came on so that we could see the lakes and mountains again on our way back.Instead what happened was: our minivan driver/tour guide informed us that he had to be back at 6pm and that therefore we could have just 15 minutes to look around St. Gilgen and that he would take the motorway back to Salzburg instead of the normal (scenic route). The man from the couple from Dubai asked whether we could have a bit more time in St. Gilgen, but this was denied. Therefore, on our way back to Salzburg, we saw nothing but motorway.2) The next day, we went shopping and sightseeing in Salzburg. We went into a shop in the center close to the St. Peter's church. While searching for souvenirs, suddenly the shop owner came up to me and started shouting at me 'YOU PEOPLE will destroy everything and you will not pay for it, I know this!' I asked her to be calm and told her that she could not speak to me that way but she continued shouting. Finally, I told her very, very directly and loudly but without shouting, 'You cannot speak to me like that!' and not to be rude. As there were other customers in the shop she began to protest that she was not rude. We really were totally disgusted by her behavior- and it is shocking to see racism so openly in this day and age, particulary from people who depend on foreigners for their livelihood. We left the shop and continued to look around as we had a few hours before we needed to get to the train station to go back to Vienna. As the weather was chilly and my mother wanted to try some Austrian cakes, we looked for a cafe.3) We left the shop and went into a cafe in the square which has the yellow house which was Mozart's birthplace- right in the heart of Salzburg's tourist area. Opposite Mozart's birthplace, in the corner, there was an outdoor cafe. When we took our seats, a young couple and everyone in the bar began to stare at us openly. My mother asked the waitress if she could see some cakes. The woman looked very irritated, but brought a plate which had slices of many different types of cakes arranged on it. She held it up quite high so my mother could not really see what was on the plate. My mother asked her what each of the cakes were. My mother politely asked 'Can you please lower the plate a bit because I can't see what they are' and asked her if she could put the plate on the table. The woman flat out said no. I cannot understand why she could not, as it was only a display plate and not for serving. We finally ordered one piece of Mozart cake and two coffees, but in retrospect given the racist nature of the cafe we should have left. The whole time we were there, the couple stared at us and whispered and the people at the bar also stared at us.I have lived and worked in several European cities and I have never encountered behaviour as despicable as that in Salzburg. Racism in any form is ofcourse totally unacceptable, and it is wholly intolerable and unacceptable coming from people who are making their living from the tourism industry.Having seen much of Europe I can say this: There are many, many beautiful places to see and spend your hard-earned salaries. As for me, Salzburg is most definitely off the list."
50,“Beautiful Salzburg”,"We were three persons and it took only 18 EUR for three of us to touch and bank Salzburg from Munich by train. And once we were there we did not regret our decision. It is a cool town with a nice river, many museums, palaces, hills and of course leisurly environment. It was a warm summer day with gentle breeze accompanying us through out our journey. Best idea is to buy a day tiket of city bus and you are all set to explore this unique, splendid and idle medieval town. Most exciting part was of course the Mozart Museum with many exhibits with recorded commentary over the headphone. I was practically mesmerized to see the great composer's piano, his hand-written letter, his family history, some famous paintings of Mozart are also on display, such as “Mozart on the piano”, an unfinished painting by his brother in law Joseph Lange and all. Besides one must not miss Schloss Mirabell.This masterpiece was initially built as “Schloß Altenau” under the reign of Prince Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau in 1606. It was a present for his concubine Salome Alt and most famous for its splendid garden.His successor Prince Archbishop Markus Sittikus re-named it into “Schloss Mirabell” (‘beautiful view’). The Mirabell Castle is property of the City of Salzburg since 1866, and it is the office building for the city’s administration including the mayor of Salzburg and other offices since 1947."
50,“Unforgettable!”,"Unforgettable is what you will say about Salzburg! The mountains are magnificent and the whole town is fun to explore. When there, take time to:Eat at Saran's (mentioned in Rick Steve's book)Take the SOM Tour (one of the smaller tour bus companies)Go up to a concert at the castleTake the Eagle's Nest TourTake the tram up the mountainWait!!! I know I forgotten several of my favorites! There are too many to list. Just enjoy the beauty of the mountains."
40,“Short break in fantastic Salzburg”,"We have recently returned from Salzburg after a four day break. Our party consisted of myself, my husband, our daughter and my disabled sister in law. Salzburg is a wonderful city, it is extremely clean, the scenery is breathtaking and it is perfectly safe to wander around. We were led to believe that Austria was very expensive but we found this was not the case and that the prices were quite similar to the U.K. We stayed at the Cordial Theatre Hotel which was very nice and provided a really good buffet breakfast with lots of choice. I can reccomend a trip on the cable car up the Untersberg mountain the views are fantastic. I have never liked beer but am converted to the brews on offer in Austria absolutely delicious. We went on the Sound of Music Tour with Panorama which was booked via their ticket office adjacent to the Mirrabel Gardens. They collected us from our hotel and we had a thouroughly enjoyable day. The guide was very knowledgeable about the movie and was very entertaining and funny. I would recommend this even to people who are not particular fans of the movie as the tour is worth it just for the scenery upon the way. There are lots of shops, cafes and restaurants and four days were not enough to see and do everything so we will definately vist again next year."
50,“Abenstern Apartment : Great Stay in Salzburg”,"We have just spent 7 days fabulous days in Salzburg. The Salzburg Card is a must for private travelers. We used it for a mix of cultural and outdoor activities. Castles, Museums, Transport, Cable Cars etc. It was Spring Festival time in Salzburg with an outstanding array of musical events in the town. On our last night there were free musical performances in most of the city churches.We only had one rainy day and on that day visited the Saltmines at Bertchesgaden which have an excellent underground tour which explains the mining method with excellent audio visual displays and audio translations in a range of languages. (the guide will generally speak in German but will play a translation at the end of this talk) You can make your own way to Bertchesgaden on the RVB Bus No 8 (get a day pass) and also see the Eagles Nest and Lake Konigsee from there. (Allow 2 days for all 3). Bertchesgaden activities are not included with the Salzburg Card but you will save a lot if you travel by the RVB bus and purchase your own entry tickets rather than go on the standard tours. We did do the Sound of Music Tour with Panorama Tours and this was entertaining with credit to Susan the tour Guide. You also got to see a little of the Lakes District on this tour.We stayed in a great apartment (Abenstern) about 5 minutes cycle ride from the city center (Bikes included). Probably 15 minutes walk to the center but also close to Bus stops and supermarkets, It was in a quiet location, extremely well appointed with modern fittings & appliances and also had a high speed internet connection. Highly RecommendedWe are planning to return there for a much longer stay in 2009 and see more of the surrounding countryside, Music Festival events and use it for a base for some other European Travel."
50,“Charming and Charmed”,"Salzburg is one of those small cities everyone should visit at least once. Perfectly situated in a valley between majestic alpine peaks, it is just the right size to explore on foot without tiring oneself. The mediaeval streets are a delight as are the people. The Austrians are so courteous and friendly and take pride in trying to speak foreign languages. The shopping is of international standard, the churches are magnificent and the brooding fortress above reminds one of the area's storied past. We went in winter and were blessed with snow. My only caveat is that it is not cheap which possibly explains the absence of tourists, although that is apparently not the case during the Mozart Festival. Lastly, Salzburg Airport is an actual pleasure and reminded me of bygone days when air travel was fun."
30,"“Do oh dear it rained all week,ray not a ray of sun”","vISITED SALZBURG LAST WEEK MON TO FRI,26TH FEB TO 2NDMARCH.Stayed at the Markus Sittikus.Unfortunatly the weather was to say the least poor,and certianly dampened the stay. However we still enjoyed,the sights and sounds of Salzburg, The old town was interesting,and Im sure would have looked so much better bathed in sunshine. Our hotel was ,how you say different. A litle tired in some ways, but lots of charachter. The people were great and most helpful,the breakfast was fine ,the bar was just waiting for herculeor agatha to turn up. the bar chap brilliant ,try a Cuba Libra if you dare ,blow your socks off.Only about ten minutes walk to the old town ,over the river.As I say the weather rather dampend our visit, but thats the same anywhere.Woodie"
40,“Salzburg Christmas Markets”,"Salzburg is one of the places truly made for Christmas markets. It's stunning location and pretty streets within the old town are ideal for a weekend away. The main market at the Residenz Square and Cathedral offers plenty of stalls selling tree decorations, candles and nativity scenes. There is an ice rink close-by and a queue of horse-drawn carriages available that provide a gentle circuit of the beautiful old town.Local specialist food is widely available with a dedicated square for all things food-related close to the cathedral.There are alternative markets in the Mirabell Gardens and even outside the railway station.German cities remain the kings when it comes to the Christmas Markets, but Salzburg offers a good alternative."
50,“the top of the world”,"I came to Salzburg on short case - short time, short in money - but I found it great, beauty and educative. Unbelievable combination between the nature and the cultivated area, between the salz of life(the difficulties of nature)and the sweetness of Haven(the beauty architecture and the comfortable inner designs of the houses). It is all great science, as is being tought by Paracellsus, the great alchemist that lived in Salzburg)also it is great works of devoted people (like Mozart, who lived in Salzburg)that made Salzburg to what it is - a great educative beautiful city, where even just simple salz turns to choclate!(the Mozart choclate of salzburg)And yes, don't forget the marvelous palaces of the Sounds of Music - you will just be sure that paradise is in Earth already!!!"
50,"“Salzburg, a retreat to the past”","Never pass up an opportunity to visit Salzburg! We came via train from Passau after a cruise down the Danube and spent 2 1/2 glorious days in Salzburg in early Sep 2006. A little tired, we did not book tours but enjoyed strolling in The Old City where we stayed, investigating beautiful churches and riding the funicular up to the Fortress. This should not be missed. The views of Salzburg alone are worth the trip.There's much interesting history at the Fortress and a shop that has better quality souvenirs than what is available around The Cathedral. There is a restaurant at the top of the Fortress where you dine looking down on the spectacular views. Although we did not eat here, we checked the menu and found a number of appealing selections and average prices.On Sunday, we attended Mass at The Cathedral and were forewarned to get there at least 1/2 hr beforehand to get a seat. Various musical groups are honored to travel to The Cathedral to perform before and during the Mass. As we left, a choir was setting up for the next Mass.Also, do not miss St. Peter's cemetery as it's beautifully landscaped. This cemetery was the model for the Sound of Music film when the von Trapp family was hiding from the Nazis. Take a walk across the bridge over the Salzach River to The New City. Here, there is merchandise more reasonably priced than in The Old City.We ate at the Zum Fidelen Affen and were pleased with the meal and the prices. As you walk up the Linzergasse, the restaurant is on a street to the left and is opposite the Gablerbrau Hotel. There are benches around Mozartplatz in The Old City just to sit around and relax. About a block away is a source for delicious ice cream. For directions, just ask someone walking along the street with an ice cream cone. Or cross the bridge, sit on a bench and watch the river roll by. And, of course, there are ongoing musical presentations to enjoy at various locations. We stayed at the Weiss Taube, and this, too, was a pleasant experience."
40,“The hills are alive...with Mozart!”,"We were drawn to Salzburg to be a part of Mozart's 250th birthday celebrations. The city certainly has gone overboard this year. Mozart peeps out at you from every nook and corner - from shiny coffee cups, key chains, t-shirts, even chocolate!SALZBURG CARD AND TRANSPORTThe first thing you should do on landing is buy a Salzburg card. This card entitles you to free public transport and free entry into the top tourist attractions. For a 3 day trip, we picked up a 72 hour card for 32 euros. It was great value for money. The card allowed us to move around the city and even go upto Untersberg, the mountain, on a cable car ride. (Still some snow up there). We recovered our costs several times over.WHAT TO SEEBesides the Mozart attractions, I would recommend that you visit Untersberg and Hellbrun for its trick fountains. You will enjoy that. The card entitles you to a guided tour as well, at Hellbrun.The Galleries at the Residenz are also worth a look. Lovely chandeliers there!At your hotel desk, be sure to ask for an events calendar or you might miss out on some fantastic performances. We were lucky to catch 'Don Giovanni' staged at the Republic Cafe (they have an auditorium there, although no one, including hotel staff seemed to know about it). The performance was top-notch and was easily the highlight of our stay.The food and service at the Republic, however, was not. (See my review for the Cafe for more info)WHAT TO BUYThe Mozartkugel is the city's tribute to its famous son (although they didn't treat him very well when he was around!). The little balls of chocolate are sold everywhere for about 3.50 euros for 150 gm (9 peices). Do what we did and buy them from the supermarket. You get the same thing for 1.99 euros. What a difference. A lot of the other delicacies like sausages and meat are also cheaper at the supermarket.THE SOUND OF MUSICSalzburg is also the site for the movie and reminders abound, though the Austrians are not very fond of it as the rest of the world! Don't bother to take the tour - you could easily do the same sights on your own for no cost on the Salzburg card. The pavilion used in the song 'I am 16 going on 17' is at the Hellbrun gardens. It's just a pavilion! Not worth paying 15 euros for a tour guide to show you that!!Salzburg is a nice place to visit, but only if you like Mozart. The city thrives on his music to get tourists. Definetly worth one visit!"
50,“Wonderful Salzburg”,"I am just back from a four day trip to Salzburg a wonderful city with so much to do. It is very easy to fingd your way around. I thought I would share a few tips with anyone thinking of visiting.Firstly at the airport take the number 2 bus for €1.80 into the city . Alternatively take a taxi for roughly €15- €20. The journey is about 20-30 mins depending on traffic.Make sure you invest in the Salzburg card for €25 it covers all public transport and gains entry into the various museums, boat tours , trains busses etc. It realy is exceptional value.Please go to the Untersberg the mountain mentioned in Sound of music ) and take the cable car to the top. The view is amazing , the snow is great. You can take the number 25 bus there in 20 minutes.The Sound of music tour is worth doing €35 for four hours where they show you the different places the film was filmed. Ask at your hotel to book tickets or contact panaroma tours.We can't forget about Mozart - special celebrations this yea4 remembering 250 years of Mozart. His Geburtshaus ( place where he was born and his Wohnhaus place wher he lived are worth visiting. If I had to chose between the two I think the wohnhau has more to see. But perhaps more people visit the Geburtshaus as it is more centrally located .Look out for the Hotel Stein and take the lift up to the top to a sun terrace for a great view of the city for free.For shopping Salzburg city centre is mainly made up of souvenir shops and expensive boutiques. Take the bus to the Europark shopping centre 20 minutes bus journey . You wont be disappointed. This place is huge and very reasonable . Great selection of shops Zara , H&M , St Oliver , wonderful shoe shops. Its great. There si a wonderful chirstmas shop called Christmas in Salzburg and an easter shop called Easter in Sazburg open all year round located on Judengasse I think. They have to be seen to be believes. Its nice to buy a Christmas decoration form Salzburg for the tree.I already wrote a review of where we stayed the Hotel zum Hirschen . A fantastic hotel great value fr money . Check out the review for more details.Hope this was of help . Enjoy wondererful Salzburg."
50,“Beautiful city”,"My wife and I spent a week in Salzburg at the begining of November - beautiful autumn colours and weather.The city itself is magical and a treasure of history and atmosphere. There are many places to visit such as Mozart's Birthplace and his family home. The Toy Museum in the former city hospital is equally fascinating and it contains toys and amusements from the last 500 years. The museum also includes an exhibition of musical instruments as well as cameras - superb value for money.Salzburg Zoo lies about 4 miles outside the city near Hellbrun Palace and is a very enjoyable place to spend most of a day. We travelled there in a taxi but walked back along the river which took a very pleasant two hours. The 1000 years old Hohensalzburg Fortress overlooks the city and is also a fascinating place to spend a day.The best views of Salzburg are from Capuchin Mountain which overlooks the city. We climbed up through the woods to the observation terrace at the top which lies beside a Franciscan chapel. The woods are quite beautiful and the views of the city and the surrounding plains and mountains are breathtaking.There are also many excursions offered by local tour companies and we enjoyed a trip to the salt mine at Berchtesgaden in Germany. What an experience that was with a guided underground tour of the mine and a boat ride on an underground lake! There are many other such trips but we didn't have the time in a week.Salzburg is proud of its new Modern Art Museum which overlooks the city from Monchesburg Mountain. We spent an afternoon in the museum. We have never really grasped modern art but the visit will be a treat for those who do.The atmosphere of the city is the most memorable feature of Salzburg. To walk the same cobbles, and to visit the same shops and restaurants, as Mozart is quite heady (Mozart's favourite restaurant still operates from the same premises). Most public places such as shops, restaurants, taxis etc. play Mozart as background music. This becomes very pleasant and quite compelling after a week, even for those like us who are not classical afficionados. Many musicians can be seen around the city streets playing classical, jazz and popular music. However, most of these are not busking for money, but simply playing for the pleasure of doing so in public. It is a real treat to sit and eat superb Austrian rolls or pastries for lunch while listening to a violinist or guitarist quietly playing nearby.Salzburg is a fabulous and magical city that will be loved by most people looking for relaxation and history. A week was not enough. Salzburg is one of those cities that we were sad to leave and which we both agree that ""we must come back sometime"". You'll love it too."
50,“So much to see and do!”,"I spent 2 weeks in Salzburg last year and thought it was an unforgettable holiday! I always thought that there wasn't much to see or do in the area if you're not particularly interested in Mozart or the Sound of Music, but I was completely wrong.I just thought I'd share my experiences so that more people know about the excellent offers you can find in and around Salzburg.One thing I really enjoyed was our visit to the Hohenwerfen Ice Caves. Werfen's World of Ice Giants is the largest known ice cave in the world and it's simply breathtaking. You almost feel like you've ended up in a fairy tale! I think the caves are only open in summer and I would really recommend sturdy shoes and warm clothing, since otherwise it can be an extremely unpleasant experience!Another trip we made was to Rauris, where we did some gold panning. It was a lot of fun and my kids absolutely loved it. Unfortunately, I didn't end up with a giant lump of gold as I had hoped but it still was a mavellous experience!On a trip to nearby Maria Alm we even had the chance to see some ""Ranggeln"" which is a funny-looking traditional country sport which apparently hasits origins in disputes between shepherds and hill farmers over grazing rights.Next time I go to Salzburg I think I may get some information on huts you can book in the mountains. I heard this is a great experience as well and I'm sure my kids would love it!"
40,“Salzburg's Mozart year”,"I was just in Salzburg with a group of 15 women for the 250th birthday of Mozart. We spent 4 days exploring the city and enjoying the music. I asked many of the others what they enjoyed most and least, and thought you might like to hear their opinions. The most popular sites were the fortress, which is an amazing structure hanging over the city. Take the train up and walk down. We spent almost 4 hours there, admiring the state apartments and views. There is also an interesting military museum showing the uniforms and weapons of the Austrian military up through the modern era. The small marionette museum on the way out was interesting, especially since we had been to see the Marionettes perform the night before. Which leads me to one of the other must-sees: the famous Marionettes of Salzburg. We saw the Magic Flute, entirely performed by these amazingly artistic marionettes. Even the small children in the audience were entranced. Definitely make an effort to see them- it's well worth it and unlike anything you might see elsewhere. Another must-do is the dinner-concert at the St. Peter's Stift. This is the oldest restaurant in Europe (dating back into the early 9th century). For about 45 euros you have a string quartet and singers in 18th century dress entertain you as you eat a very nice meal (all 18th century recipes). Having listened to several concerts over the previous days, I was delighted to have this young and energetic group of musicians perform- and not on a stodgy stage- they roamed among the tables while singing their hearts out. It was certainly one of the highlights of the trip. We attended one of the masses in the Franciscan church- just be prepared to shiver through a very long service. I only went to hear the Coronation mass, but had also visited the church earlier just to admire the lovely interior. Do go see the interiors of all the churches- they are really beautiful. Also, go see the Viva Mozart exhibit- it is a multimedia display focusing on the life and times of Mozart. One of our ladies was taught the minuet by a costumed expert as the rest of us looked on- I would recommend this above the more static museums focusing on the life of Mozart. The Mozart Wohnehaus was okay-make sure to pick up the audioguide as the guards look for this as proof of payment (I left mine behind and had to explain this fact to one of them!). Most of our group agreed that Mozart's birth house was a rip off- there is very little there to see for the price and time. The best part is the facade, which you can admire for free.If you have a chance to attend concerts, try to get into the Schloss Mirabell- the marble salon was a lovely venue for our concert and the proportions of the room are what the music was designed for. You will hear Mozart at its best in a baroque salon.We also took a couple of tours- the first was about 90 minutes and was an overview of Mozart's life- a good way to begin the trip. We also took the Sound of Music tour, four hours of fun and silliness, but enjoyable nontheless. These are both through Panorama tours, which I would highly recommend. The first tour was with an American ex-pat named Stephen and the second with a British woman named Sue- both were well versed in the history of the city and brought their own perspectives to the tour. You can book the tours at your hotel and they will pick you up- nice not to have to trudge across town to make the bus. This was my third visit to Salzburg- and probably the best. I hope my experience will encourage you to visit this city, especially during Mozart's birthday year- so, what are you waiting for?"
40,“Salzburg in winter”,"We just returned from at tour of Austria and Munich this winter ( Dec '05).Salzburg is a lovely town which looks gorgeous in the winter. We toured most of the city by foot and the narrow streets and tons of tourists make this the best way to soak in the city. The highlight of our day was the fortress which stands tall at one end of the city. Take the funicular to the top and walk your way down waiting at the Nonenberg Alley for a Sound Of Music view. The tour at the fortress is worth doing and is free of charge. It takes you to the top of a tower which gives the visitor spectacular views, the Bavarian Alps on on side and the city of Salzburg on the other. The Sound of Music tour could be avoided in winter and it lacks charm without the meadows and open fields ( filled with snow now ). Shopping is fun, but way to expensive."
50,“Loved Salzburg!”,"Salzburg is a beautiful, well-kept old town-- of course, it is illegal to not keep it well-kept, and illegal to not keep every small detail true to the 17th century in this gorgeous baroque town, lost in time. The splendor and beauty wear off with time, but when one tires of the baroque, he may always tour the sights made popular by the Sound of Music! I stayed in the Schloss Leopoldskron, which was the Von Trapp family mansion in the film, and though the photos may be lovely, you will not have the chance to see the Schloss yourself-- it is closed to the public. You must be participating in a program within the Salzburg Seminar to see it all!"
40,“Plenty for the non-skier”,"Hi, Thanks for all the newsletters. The information on Salzburg was useful, but it did overdose a bit on The Sound of Music.I travelled with my husband and our 30 something son. The son is a skier. His parents were under orders not to even try. I was worried that there would not be enough to do but I was wrong.We stayed in Zell Am See, a skiing resort situated half way between Salzburg and Innsbruck. I choose it because it was on the railway line to both cities, it featured a lake with a 8 kilometre perimeter and didn't boast any connection to the Trapp family.The son reports that the skiing was excellent, connections to Kaptun, provided extra skiing options. His parents can report that the resort has a Trapp family connection (the Porche family now own the lakeside chalet where the real Trapp's holidayed). We satisfied our music needs at the local Roman Catholic Church where the boy soprano brought tears to the eyes on Christmas morning with his rendition of Silent Night.Salzburg buzzed with Mozart happenings. Tour guides dashed their groups from Church to Fort, we of course did our own thing, thanks to the inormation gathered from Tripadvisor.Do visit market square at the Dom Cathedral and heat up with gluckwein (hot spiced wine) pronounced glue vine. The hot potato stand at the entrance to the sqaure have particularly good sauces to serve with its potatos, our own particular choice was the garlic mayonaise. The music in the church was disappointing but the building itself was worth a visit. The fort did not disappoint and the railway connection back to Zell Am See was on time and clean. The view of the Alps too stunning to discribe in my words.Can I add a word about Innsbruck too. It was the more interesting railway journey; the mountains higher, the snow deeper. Innsbruck is best illustrated in every Christmas card I sent or received. The snow, the christmas trees, the cribs. There even is a exposition of cribs, called creche, at the Folklore Museum. My favourite, the one depicting the arrival of the Three Wise Men by toy railway and skiing to the baby Jesus with their gifts!"
50,“La ciudad más bonita de Austria”,"Quizá he exagerado, pero la considero más bonita que Viena y que Graz, de modo que, para mí, es la más bonita de las que he visto. Muy parecida a Graz, por su montaña en el centro y su río cruzando la ciudad, resulta más encantadora. Hay que pasear por sus calles especialmente durante el mercado de adviento, aunque haga un frío espantoso."
40,“Encantadora ciudad”,"Salzburgo es una ciudad armónica, ideal para caminarla (3 días seria el tiempo justo, a mi entender). Su casco historico es ordenado, de reconocimiento facil...en pocas horas te familiarizas y reconoces las calles. Iglesias, monumentos, la casa de Mozart, su cementerio, la fortaleza, ferias...mucho para ver. Los precios de los bares y resto son altos, pero cuando estuvimos en enero de 2014 el hotel al que fuimos nos parecio bien en su relacion precio-calidad. Las calles no son ruidosas. El unico detalle que se lo comentamos a la gente del hotel fue que vimos mucha gente ""pidiendo"" con perros, y aunque sin ser molestos nos llamo la atencion de Austria."
50,“arte e gastronomia”,punto d appoggio per visitare la bellissima salisburgo citta d arte e gastronomia impredibile il festung la più grande e migliore conservata fortezza d europa da visitare le due case di mozart e da assaggiare i buonissimi piatti della tradizione culinaria
30,“Hat uns nicht überzeugt”,"Salzburg ist eine Stadt mit musikalischer Historie (Mozartstadt). Wir wurden leider von schlechtem Wetter und hohen Eintrittspreisen für nahezu jede ""Sehenswürdigkeit"" überrascht. Die Stadt selbst ist sehr klein und konnte uns nicht für sich gewinnen. Für einen kurzen Bummel durch die Altstadt von 1-2 Stunden ist es hier sicherlich schön, für einderthalb Tage war es uns jedoch etwas zu lang, da aufgrund der Größe der Rundgang durch die Stadt in kurzer Zeit ""erledigt"" ist."
50,“Man kann nur Bilder sprechen lassen ...”,"Salzburg, ein Stadtname den jeder schon einmal gehört hat.Aber reicht das?Nein! Salzburg muss man auch gesehen und erlebt haben.Das alles auf keinen Fall, ohne die Geschichte der Stadt zu lesen un zu verstehen.488 n.C. begann der Niedergang der römischen Stadt Luvavum.Salzburg wurde im Jahr 696 als Bischofssitz neu gegründet.Wie der Name schon sagt, stand Salz im Vordergrund, Salz und Gold, denn beide wurden hier gefördert und machten die Stadt reich.Ansonsten könnte man mehr als 1.000 Seiten über Salzburg schreiben.Wir schreiben nur, diese Stadt muss man erkunden.Entlang des Flusses Salzach laufen und die Kulisse in einem der kleinen Kaffees genießen.5 Sterne geben wir Salzburg!"
50,“Toller Wochenendausflug”,"Salzburg liegt direkt an der Grenze zu Deutschland, und ist somit praktisch für ein Wochendausflug von Deutschland gelegen. Zu den Highlights zählt die an der Salzach gelegene Innenstadt mit Dom,St Peterskirche, Universitätskirche, Mozarts Geburtshaus und Mozarts Wohnhaus. Weitere Highlights ist die Festung Hohensalzburg, das Schloss Mirabell, von dessen Park man einen schönes Postkartenfotomotiv auf Salzburg hat, im Hintergrund dabei die Festung. 4 km südlich von Salzburg liegt das Schloss Hellbrunn, das aufgrund seiner Wasserspiele, bei dennen man nass wird, eher im Sommer zu bevorzugen ist. In Summe ein perfektes Wochenendausflugziel."
50,“Wunderschöne Stadt”,"Was soll man über einen Ort schreiben, wo man schon xmal auf Besuch war, sagt denn das nicht alles ? Na gut, ich versuche es. Vielleicht ist es das Flair dass einen empfängt, wenn man sich Salzburg nähert, die Hohe Salzburg die über der Stadt trohnt. Oder das Hotel Stein, mit seiner wunderbaren Terrasse. Im Winter wenn man auf die verschneite, romantische Stadt schaut. Romantisch und trotzdem super zum shoppen. Im Sommer die Festspiele, einmal muss man unbedingt den Jedermann gesehen haben und nachher die Stadt erobern. Also ich kann nur sagen, ihr müsst Salzburg gesehen haben."
50,“Luogo magico”,"Un luogo magico, fatto di ricordi del passato. Una bombonierapulita, romantica, incantevole e ben organizzata dove passare delle vacanze splendide tra arte e natura."
50,“サウンドオブミュージックのロケ地ザルツブルク”,大好きなサウンドオブミュージックのロケ地、ザルツブルクに行ってきました。ミラベル庭園、馬洗場、そしてメンヒスベルグから見た、ホーエンザルツブルク城。これは絶対おすすめです。その一つ一つから映画のシーンが思い出されます。レジデンツでは馬車に乗った新郎新婦に出会いました。そしてホーエンザルツブルク城から見た旧市街。夕日に染まってとても綺麗でした。城からの帰り道にノンベルク修道院があります。ここは主人公のマリアがいた修道院。門が開いていたので中に入ることもできました。本当に映画の世界を堪能することができる旅でした。
50,“MEHR ALS NUR MOZART”,"Der erste Gedanke an Salzburg ist bei den meisten Besuchern wohl mit dem berühmtesten Sohn der Stadt verbunden : Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Natürlich trifft man in der überschaubaren Größe dier reizenden Stadt an der Salzach Mozart auf 'Schritt und Tritt'. Aber dieses städtebauliche Idyll hat viel mehr zu bieten...und zwar zu beiden Seiten des Flusses. Imposante Barockkirchen säumen den Weg, intime innerstädtische Friedhöfe mit einem ganz und gar leicht makabren österreichischen Reiz. Denn hier ist es äußerst wichtig, dass es sich bei der Beerdigung und auf dem Friedhofsplatz/Grabstelle um eine 'schöne Leich' handelt. Kulturgeschichtlich sehr reizvoll, Friedhöfe zu besichtigen, auch in Salzburg. Natürlich darf ein obligatorischer Gang durch die Getreidegasse nicht fehlen, auch wenn sich hier die Besucherscharen nur so durchquälen. Höhepunkt einer Salzburgreise ist entweder ein Opernbesuch oder doch zumindest das Erklimmen des Wanderweges zur Festung hinauf. Im Advent besonders stimmungsvoll. Von hier oben hat man einen fantastischen Blick auf die Mozartstadt."
50,“die Mozartstadt”,"Salzburg liegt an der grünen Salzach. Die Burg Hohensalzburg tront über die Stadt hoch hinaus. In der Getreidegasse finden Sie Mozartsgeburtshaus, so wie tolle Geschäfte. Vor dem Dom finden im Sommer die Aufführungen ""Jedermann"" statt. Bekannt sind auch die Festspiele. Mirabellgarten ist einfach wunderschön und auf jeden Fall sehenswert. Es gibt schöne Wandermöglickeiten von der Burg zum Mönchsberg. Am Ende vom Mönchsberg befindet sich ein gutes Restaurant, von dort aus hat man einen wunderschönen Ausblick auf die Altstadt von Salzburg und die Umgebung."
50,“Die Opernstadt!”,"Salzburg ist im ganzen Jahr eine Reise wert! In den Sommermonaten locken die Opernfestspiele Besucher aus der ganzen Welt. Aber auch in den anderen Monaten lohnt sich ein Besuch in Salzburg. Besuchen Sie die Burg, besuchen Sie das Schloss Mirabell und (mein Tipp) trinken Sie einen Kaffee im Cafe Bazar!"
50,“wunderschöne Stadt am Fuße der Alpen”,"Die Stadt zieht jeden Besucher durch die malerische Lage am Fuße der Alpen sofort in ihren Bann. Sowohl die Berge als auch die Festung Hohensalzburg überragen die wunderschöne, historische Stadt, die durch die Salzach geteilt wird. Freundlichkeit der Menschen und das gute Essen tun das Übrige !"
50,“schicke Stadt zum Bummeln”,"Salzburg ist eine wunderschöne Stadt in Österreich mit einer tollen, sehenswerten Altstadt; schönen Läden zum Shoppen; tolle Restaurants und Bars. Unbedingt ansehen sollte man sich die Burg (Auffahrt mit Zahnradbahn) mit dem tollen Blick auf die Altstadt."
50,“Schöne Touristenstadt in Österreich”,"Salzburg ist innerhalb kürzester Zeit von Deutschland aus erreichbar und ist ein herrvoragens Ausflugsziel. Salzburg ist eine Kleinstadt, die von Bergen umgeben ist. Die Stadt bietet viele touristische Highlights. Zum Einkaufen und schlendern durch die Stadt ist die Getreidegasse bestens geeignet. Jede Menge Einkaufsmöglichkeiten sind Haus an Haus. Sehr zu empfehlen sind auch die lokalen Speisen, wie z.B. Salzburger Nockel und Kaiserschmarrn. Die Salzkammerfestspiele sind eines der Highlights in Salzburg. ein weiteres absolutes Muss ist die Besichtigung der Burg, die eine gigantische Aussicht auf die Stadt bietet. Eine sehr schöne Art die Stadt zu besichtigen ist per Kutsche... sehr romantisch."
50,“Geburtsstadt Mozarts”,"Salzburg ist eine traumhafte Stadt. Es ist recht klein und gemütlich und wenn man durch den Innenstadt läuft, ist es zudem auch noch romantisch. Die Weihnachtsmärkte im Winter sind auch sehr lebendig und schön. Vom Domplatz kann man mit der Fiaka eine kleine Rundfahrt machen, die wirklich sehr sehr schön, aber nicht ganz billig ist. Die Geburtshaus Mozarts (mittlerweile ein Museum) ist auch eine Besichtigung wert."
50,“Salzburg - weit mehr als Mozarts Geburtsstadt”,"Salzburg besticht durch seine herrliche Altstadt mit wunderschönen Gassen und Plätzen, tollen Geschäften und leckeren Restaurants. Beeindruckend ist die Festung Hohensalzburg, die hoch über Salzburg thront und durch eine Zahnradbahn (gegen Gebühr) bequem zu erreichen ist. Das Schloß Mirabell mit seiner traumhaften Gartenanlage, dem Mirabellgarten, ist zentral auf der Weststeite der Salzach gelegen. Unbedingt sollte man sich den DOM zu Salzburg ansehen - ein Meisterwerk. Eine Kutschfahrt durch die historische Altstadt oder an der Salzach entlang lohnt sich, ist allerdings nicht ganz billig. Das nahe Umland geizt nicht mit Reizen und lohnt ebenso besucht zu werden. Stilvolle oder auch hippige In-Hotels gibt es in Salzburg reihenweise, so dass für jedermann das Passende zu finden sein wird. Viel Freude beim Salzburg - Entdecken!"
30,“Salzburg der Tagesausflug z:b. von München”,"Von München aus ist Salzburg als Tagesausflug zu empfehlen. Mit dem Auto ist man ca. 1,5 Stunden unterwegs. Salzburg legt offenbar viel Wert auf das Gesicht der Stadt. So gibt es scheinbar einige strenge Regeln was die Außenreklame der Innenstadt angeht. So haben sich selbst diverse Fastfood Ketten etwas einfallen lassen um eben nicht aus der Rolle zu fallen. Empfehlenswert ist es, sich einen Parkplatz etwas weiter außerhalb zu suchen. So spart man sich etwas Geld und viel Nerven. Neben dem Geburtshaus von Mozart gibt es noch andere diverse Sehenswürdigkeiten!"
50,“Salzburg - Perle Österreichs”,"Salzburg - das ist ein Muß für jeden, der sich hier in der Grenzregion in den Urlaub begibt. Die Salzburg, hoch oben auf dem Berg, die schöne und verspielte Altstadt, die österreichische Gemütlcihkeit und nicht zuletzt auch ein Besuch in der Brauerei Stiegl. Viel Spaß"
40,“mehr als Mozart”,"Salzburg, berühmt durch W.A. Mozart und die Salzburger Festspiele hat mehr zu bieten. Ein Spaziergang durch die Getreidegasse mit ihren vielen kleinen, interesanten Geschäften verlockt zum Einkaufen sehr stark aber auch sehr schön. Denn Service und Kundenberatung wird in Salzburg groß geschrieben.Geniessen Sie einen kleinen Brauner mit den Original Mozart-Kugeln und lernen Sie so die österreichische Kaffeehauskultur von ihrer schönsten Seite kennen."
50,“途中下車で・・・・”,ミュンヘンからウィーンへの５時間以上の列車の旅の途中、休憩のために寄りました。ミラベル宮殿は外観しか観ることできませんでしたが建物だけでもきれいでした。この街は、ウィーン～ミュンヘン間の列車移動の際の中継点にするにも距離的にいいと思います。
50,“Eine Stadt mit viel Kultur”,"Wenn man sich im Süden Deutschlands aufhält oder auf der Durchreise ist, dann ist es immer Wert einen Abstecher nach Salzburg zu machen. In Salzburg kann man sehr viel Kulturbedarf nachholen und in viele Museen gehen. Es ist auch schön sich die Altstadt anzusehen, denn wie das dort alles aufgebaut und erhalten wurde, ist einfach faszinierend. Die Leute sind auch extremst nett und nicht so, wie man oft von vielen Seiten hört. Auch den Deutschen gegenüber sind sie nicht so voreingenommen was viele immer sagen. Wir fahren oft sehr gerne für einen Tagesausflug hin, da wir in München wohnen und es nicht allzu weit ist."
50,“幻想的”,ミュンヘンから日帰りで行きました。城壁があり、神秘的でした。また、行きたい都市の一つです。
50,“Salzburg die Jedermann Stadt”,So wie im Sommer auch als im Winter ist die Festspielstadt Salzburg eine besondere Reise wert !!Für verliebte Pärchen kann ich Salzburg echt gut empfehlen es sind einige schöne Hotels in Salzburg so wie das Sacher oder sehr feine SternerestaurantsIch kann Salzburg sehr sehr empfehlen und bin gerne bereit wiede mal nach Salzburg zu reisen !
50,“Die schönste Stadt Österreichs”,"Salzburg zog schon viele an. So verbrachte auch ich ein langes Wochenende (4 Nächte) in Salzburg.Die Stadt lockt mit besonderer Atmosphäre, besonders die Altstadt ist wunderschön. Tagsüber ist ein Spaziergang an der Salzach, abends der Ausblick von der Festung Hohensalzburg auf die beleuchtete Stadt sehr zu empfehlen.Salzburg ist die Stadt der klassischen Musik, Theaterfreunde kommen voll auf ihre Kosten.Die Stadt ist sowohl mit dem Zug als auch mit dem Flugzeug zu erreichen."
40,“romantische stadt”,"salzburg ist die kulturelle perle im zentrum österreichs. die stadt ist nicht nur wegen ihrer wunderschönen landschaft und der berühmten festung hohensalzburg - die jedenfalls einen besuch wert ist - bekannt, sondern vor allem wegen der im sommer stattfindenden festspiele sowie der von herbert von karajan gegründeten osterfestspiele, die theater und musikgenuss auf höchstem niveau bieten. zur weihnachtszeit empfiehlt sich jedenfalls ein besuch auf dem romantischen christkindlmarkt am domplatz, wo im sommer der ""jedermann"" aufgeführt wird. besuche von museen und mozarts geburtshaus sowie und ein rundgang durch die altstadt dürfen bei einem besuch keinesfalls fehlen."
40,“Die Altstadt lädt zum Bummeln ein”,"Wir waren für einen Tag in Salzburg unterwegs und uns hat die Stadt sehr gut gefallen. Da wir im Sommer da waren, herrschte ein buntes Treiben, Biergärten waren geöffnet und die Altstadt war wunderschön. In der Altstadt gibt es viele kleine Lädchen, die zum Shoppen einladen und man kann einiges an Geld dort lassen. Die Altstadt ist sehr geflegt und die Hausfassaden laden zum Träumen ein.Wenn man mit dem Auto unterwegs ist, sollte man am besten am Messegelände parken. Man fährt ganz normal in das Messegelände und zieht bei der Einfahrt eine Parkkarte. Dann fährt man in ein beliebiges Parkhaus oder in einen Stellplatz. Man geht zur Bushaltestelle und dort steht ein Parkautomat (wenn man Glück hat auch ein Angestellter des öffentl. Verkehrsbetriebes, der nett hilft!) mit dem man seinen Parkausweis tauschen kann in ein Tagesticket (Parkplatzgebühr und Tageskarte für die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel - gilt meine ich für 4 Erw.). Mit dieser Karte kann man sich überall hin bewegen und fährt anschliessend mit dem Bus auch wieder zum Messegelände. Total praktisch und problemlos.Noch zu erwähnen ist das Designer Outlet Salzburg. Es liegt etwas abseits von der Stadt, in der Nähe des Flughafens. Wir waren zum Sommerschlußverkauf dort und haben hier wirkliche Schnäppchen gemacht!"
40,“Auf Mozarts Spuren”,"Ein ideales Ziel für einen Wochenendurlaub. Serh romantische Gassen mit Mozart-Souvenirs, tolle Burgen und Museen laden dazu ein.Sehr schnell ist man auch in den Bergen zum Wandern oder Skifahren."
50,“Salzburg ist nicht nur eine Mozartstadt”,"Salzburg - weithin als Mozartstadt über alle Grenzen hinaus bekannt - gehört mich Sicherheit zu einer der schönsten - wenn nicht sogar die schönste - Landeshauptstädte in Österreich. Unmittelbar an Bayern angrenzend - bietet Salzburg auch eine Menge an Freizeitmöglichkeiten. Neben den zahlreichen Badeseen ist natürlich auch die Schiwelt Amade über die Landesgrenzen hinaus bekannt und bietet demgemäß eine Reihe an Sport- und Freizeitmöglichkeiten.Aber auch die Lokale und Geschäfte in Salzburg können sich sehen lassen. Und nicht zu vergessen die Salzburger Festspiele, die Salzburg als Kulturhaupstadt über alle Grenzen hinaus bekannt gemacht haben ..."
40,“Tolles Flair in einer überschaubaren Metropole”,"Die Stadt Salzburg liegt wunderschön inmitten eines atemberaubenden Bergpanoramas an der Salzach. Die zweigeteilte Stadt bietet viel Abwechselung: auf der einen Seite die historische Altstadt (zum Weltkulturerbe ernannt!) mit den schmalen, kleinen Gassen und dem Festspielhaus, und auf der anderen Seite das geschichtsträchtige Schloss Mirabell und das Banken- und Büroviertel.Das schöne an dieser Metropole ist, dass man alles wunderbar per Fuß erreichen und entdecken kann!Bei der Wahl eines zentral gelegenen Hotels inmitten der Stadt lassen sich wirklich alle Ecken der Stadt erkunden. Vor allem ist es schön, wenn man abends auch noch nach Hause laufen kann und nicht auf ein Taxi im Stadtgebiet angewiesen ist.Lediglich enttäuscht war ich von der Altstadt: hier erwartet man sich ( auch durch die Ernennung zum Weltkulturerbe) etwas mehr. Aber wenn man in den kleinen Boutiquen einkauft, erkennt man an den teilweise originalen Steinböden den historischen Wert dieser Altstadt.Ich kann Salzburg nur weiterempfehlen – egal ob für Romantikwochenenden, Shoppingtouren oder Familienausflüge!"
40,“Mozarts Geburtsstadt - sehr schön”,"Salzburg, bekannt für Schnürlregen und Mozart, geizt nicht mit seiner Geschichte: Museen, Kirchen, Rundfahrten – alles ist perfekt auf den Tourismus ausgelegt. Dementsprechend viele Touristen findet man auch in der Stadt, deshalb ist Salzburg aber leider auch recht teuer.Ein Vorteil ist, dass die wichtigsten Sehenswürdigkeiten sehr nah beieinader zu finden sind: die Festung Hohensalzburg, der Dom, die Residenz, das Schloss Mirabell oder die Getreidegasse sind alle fußläufig innerhalb weniger Minuten erreichbar, weshalb man die Stadt an einem Tag besichtigen kann. Dabei sollte ein Spaziergang entlang der Salzach auf jeden Fall miteingeplant werden. Möchte man mehr sehen oder sich mehr Zeit lassen, muss man 2 bis 3 Tage einplanen. Nur mit dem Wetter muss man Glück haben, Salzburg ist eine niederschlagsreiche Stadt.Für Flugzeug-Fans bietet die Stadt noch ein besonderes Zuckerl: Am Salzburger Flughafen befindet sich der ""Hangar 7"", welcher die Flugzeugsammlung des Engerydrinkherstellers Red Bull beherbergt. Direkt daneben ist ein hochklassiges Restaurant untergebracht.Wem Salzburg gefällt, aber die Touristenmassen meiden will, sollte unbedingt eine Besuch in Graz in Betracht ziehen. Schöne Architektur mit südlichem Flair und meist schönem Wetter laden in die Hauptstdt der Steiermark ein."
50,“Salzburg - ein Festspiel”,"'Den Tag beginnen sollte man am Markt in der Philharmonikergasse - eine kleine Stärkung am Bauernmarkt ist ein guter Ausgangspunkt.Über den Festspielplatz bietet sich ein Spaziergang zum Domplatz an.Dom und Residenz sind Fixpunkte!Die ""must see"" Besucher sollten auf die Festung, egal ob zu Fuss oder mit der Bahn.Die Stadt liegt zu Füssen und man kann sich überlegen, worauf man noch Lust hat.Als weiterer Berg bietet sich der Mönchsberg an - das Museum moderner Kunst zeigt Ausstellungen mit internatiolen Künstlern. Die Terrasse und das Restaurant (für Schlechtwettertage) verwöhnen kulinarisch.Auch das Rupertinum in der Philharmonikergasse zeigt Kunst, diverse Galerien offerieren zeitgenössische Künstler, die Cafehäuser verwöhnen die Gaumen und die Getreidegasse..... ist ein wahres Einkaufsparadies."
50,“meine Heimatstadt”,"Wer hat noch nicht von ihr gehört, der Stadt an der Salzburg, die Stadt der Festspiele, des Jedermanns, mit dieser wunderbaren Altstadt, die im Sommer mit Touristen regelrecht geflutet wird und kaum mehr Platz für Einheimische hat. Lassen Sie sich ein auf diese Stadt, ihr italienisches Flair mit der typisch Salzburger Note und lassen Sie sich nicht von der Hektik der Pauschaltouristischen anstecken, Sie werden es nicht bereuen und Seiten einer Stadt kennenlernen die Sie nie für möglich gehalten haben."
50,“Salzburg- die Mozartstadt”,Salzburg- die Mozartstadt - ist asbsolut empfhelenswert. Vor allem die festung Hohensalzburg ist beeindruckend. Am besten hinauffahren und den tollen Blick auf die Stadt genießen. Danach sollte man durch die Altstadt spazieren. So viele schöne alte Gebäude. Am Abend sollte man im Sternbräu gut zu Abend essen und als Nachtisch Salzburger Nockerln bestellen.
40,“Salzburg - Top Stadt in Österreich”,"Salzburg liegt nur unweit der deutschen Grenze nach Österreich.Gleichnaming mit dem Bundesland Salzburg. Man kennt Salzburg vor Allem seitens der Kultur und der Geschichte. Natürlich hat Salzburg, wie jede touristische Stadt ihren Kern. Bei Salzburg geht allerdings kein Weg an dem Kern vorbei! Wer Salzburgsinnenstadt/Altstadt nicht besucht hat - hat wirklich etwas versäumt - allerding sollte man speziell in der Reisezeit damit rechnen, daß viele, ja sehr viele Touristen unterwegs sind."
40,“eine schöne Stadt”,"Salzburg und Winter sind in den meinen Augen nicht trenbar! das ist so schön sehen dieser Stadt,wann ligt weisse Schnee!!! das ist Stadt von Mozart! wer mag nicht diese Musik von Mozart? ich glaube alle gern hören! und diese Festung! Festung Hohensalzburg!!!einfach ist super! das hat so toll gebaut! und bis heute steht und funkzionirt! sehr, sehr. sehr schön!!!! jeder soll ein Mal Salzburg sehen und erleben!!!!! empfehle"
40,“wunderbare stadt”,"salzburg besticht vor allem durch seine herrliche lage: eingebettet in berge, direkt an der salzach gelegen und mit der feste hohensalzburg, die mitten im zentrum über der stadt gelegen ist. zu ostern und im sommer finden in salzburg alljährlich festspiele statt, die es sich aus künstlerischer perspektive jedenfalls lohnt zu besuchen. auch die architektur der bischofsstadt ist wunderschön. stöhrend ist ein wenig das übermass an touristen und vor allem zur festspielzeit viele adabeis und vips, die sich in der stadt zeigen."
40,“Kultur und nette Menschen”,"Wegen seiner Nähe zu Deutschland eignet sich diese schöne, traditionsreiche Stadt wunderbar für einen Tagesausflug mit dem Bayernticket oder Wochenend-Ticket der Deutschen Bahn. Man bekommt in Salzburg schnell ein Gefühl für Österreich bzw. die österreichische Kultur. Tipps: Schlendern durch die Gassen, Viehaker fahren, Kaiserschmarrn essen."
40,“Salzburg sehen - und wiederkommen”,"Salzburg ist einfach eine richtig nette Stadt mit einer sehr netten historischen Altstadt. Auf der, der Salzach gegenüberliegenden Seite (dort liegt auch das Schloss Mirabell) gibt zusätzlich noch ein sehr schöne Gassen (Kapuzinergasse) mit interessanten Restaurants und angesagten Bars und Nachtclubs.Absolut empfehlenswert ist ein nachmittaglicher Cafe-Besuch auf dem Hauptplatz, auch wenn dies in jedem Fremdenführer erwähnt wird, sollte man sich dies nicht entgen lassen.Weiterhin empfehlenswert sind Ausflüge zum Mond- und Fuschlsee und villeicht wer mag auch eine Runde Golf im GC Mondsee und im GC altentann in Eugendorf (ca. 15 KM von Salzburg entfernt)."
40,“Extra-Tipps für Salzburg”,"Da ich Student in Salzburg bin, möchte ich hier meine Extra-Tipps für Besucher angeben:- Spaziergang am Mönchsberg! Das sollte gleich als erstes gemacht werden, denn man hat vom Mönchsberg aus einen tollen Überblick über die Altstadt von Salzburg. Am schnellsten kommt man über den Toskaninihof hinauf. Ca. 5 min lang Treppensteigen.- Neben den üblichen Stationen wie Getreidegasse, Domplatz, MIrabellgarten bietet sich ein Spaziergang durch die Steingasse bis zu Andi-Hofer-Weinstube an.- Ein Bier an der Salzach trinken; an der Ostuferseite gibt es nördlich der Staatsbrücke bei Sonnenschein tolle SItzgelegenheiten.- Ein Besuch im Augustiner Bräu (Müllner Bräu) in der Nähe des Landeskrankenhauses ist ein MUSS! Im Gegensatz zu den eher touristisierten Brauhäusern wie zB dem Sternbräu gibt es hier altehrwürdige, große Sääle und im Sommer einen tollen Gastgarten unter Kastanienbäumen. Außerdem ist das Bier ein Genuss.- Zu Mittag oder abends ist der Bärenwirt in der Müllner Hauptstrasse sehr zu empfehlen. Ein kleines Gasthaus mit einem urigen Gastraum und einem kleinen Gastgarten mit Salzach-Blick."
50,“Wunderschöne Altstadt!”,"Salzburg ist absolut einen Besuch wert. Wir waren letzte Woche bereits zum zweiten Mal dort und es war wieder sehr beeindruckend. Die Innenstadt ist einfach wunderschön und die vielen Cafes ein wahrer Genuss. Unbedingt auf die Burg hinaufgehen und einen Spaziergang entlang der ""Klippen"" machen - man bekommt sehr beindruckende Aussichten auf Salzburg. Mozarts Geburtshaus ist nur was für wahre Mozart-Fanatiker, ansonsten ist das Museum langweilig. Ein Besuch der Bier-Brauerei ist ebenfalls sehr empfehlenswert und kann sehr schnell mal sehr lustig werden...Alles in allem eine wirklich sehenswerte Stadt!"
50,“Klein aber fein”,"Wir waren im Februar in Salzburg. Zwar war das Wetter nicht so toll, dafür gab es aber an den Museen keine Wartezeiten. Jedenfalls sollte man sich trotzallem mindestens 3 Tage Zeit nehmen. Ich hab total unterschätzt wieviel Kultur Salzburg zu bieten hat. Das schönste an Salzburg ist natürlich die Altstadt und auf den Spuren von Mozart zu wandern. Auf keinen Fall darf man das Geburthaus von Mozart verpassen. Die Festung Hohelnsalzburg muß man ebenfalls besichtigen. Mein absoluter Geheimtipp sind die Mozartkugeln von Fürst. Sehr lecker aber leider gibt es die auch nur in Salzburg. Ansonsten sollte man sich nicht stressen lassen und gemütliche Auszeiten einplanen unter anderem in den wunderschönen Kaffeehäusern. Hier ist natürlich das Tomaselli sehr zu empfehlen."
50,“immer eine Reise wert”,"Salzburg ist immer eine Reise wert. Aber ist schwer, an nur einem Tag alles zu sehen. Alleine auf der Burg kann man schon einige Stunden verbringen, selbst wenn man mit der Bahn hoch und runter fährt. Der Ausblick, insbesondere bei gutem Wetter, ist grandios."
50,“Salzburg”,"Salzburg mit seiner berühmten historischen Altstadt kann ich nur weiterempfehlen. Es gibt unendlich viele Sehenswürdigkeiten, dafür sollte man sich am Besten mehrere Tage Zeit nehmen. Hier nur einige Sehenswürdigkeiten, wie die Festung Hohensalzburg, die Residenz, der Dom oder das Glockenspiel, einfach herrlich."
40,“Salisburgo: la città bomboniera dell' Austria”,"Lo scorso Maggio io e mio marito abbiamo deciso di concludere la nostra vacanza nel tirolo Austriaco con un paio di giorni a Salisburgo, una città vivamente consigliata da molti, e infatti le nostre aspettative non sono state deluse, nonostante l' abbiamo visitata praticamente quasi tutta con l' ombrello! Salisburgo è una città molto ben curata, dai classici scorci romantici, e piena di storia! Non perdetevi una visita alla Fortezza di Hohensalzburg, dove si gode anche un' ottima vista panoramica sulla città. Consigliamo sicuramente di andare nel cuore della città nellaGetreidegasse , piena di negozzi con le tipiche insegne in ferro battuto, dove al numero 9 potrete visitare la casa natale di Mozart."
40,“Salzburg”,Meine Freundin hatte eine Woche Ferienwohnung in der nähe von Salzburg gewonnen.Wenn wir schon in der nähe sind haben wir es nicht ausgelassen eine Tour durch Salzburg zu Fuß zu machen.Ich finde die kleine Stadt sehr schön zum Bummeln und zum Schaufenster gucken.Es gibt zwar auch die großen Textilmarken dort aber auch viele kleine Private Unternehmen in den ganzen kleinen Gassen.Ob es kleine Kaffee´s sind oder Souvenirs usw.Man kann Salzburg auch gut mit den Öffentlichen Verkehr oder auch mit dem Privatwagen erreichen. Parkhäuser gibt es genug.Aber Achtung:Parkhäuser in der City sind wie überall etwas teurer als etwas außerhalb.Ich würde Salzburg nochmal besuchen fahren aber dann mal im Winter
40,“Sehr schöne Stadt!”,"Da ich in Salzburg aufgewachsenen bin, mag ich diese Stadt sehr gerne. In der Getreidegasse kann man prima shoppen gehen, da es normale und auch teure Geschäfte gibt. Weiters gibt es sehr viele schöne Plätze, wie zb. den Mozartplatz oder auch den Residenzplatz mit dem Brunnen. Im Sommer empfiehlt sich ein Ausflug auf die Festung, denn von da hat man einen sehr schönen Ausblick über die Stadt.Als Tipp: unbedingt ein Bosna in der Getreidegasse essen!"
30,“Die Mozartstadt mit Barock ohne Ende!”,"In Salzburg treffen sich allerlei Gäst und Einheimische. Das gibt der Stadt ein ständige lebendiges Gewusel. Die typischen Dine wie Mozart und das Hotel Sacher muss man einfach gesehen haben. Die Stadt ist zwar voller Klisches, jedoch das muss man einfach dabei haben um in Salzburg einen Schönen Tag zu verbringen.Ich empfehle Salzburg für einen Tagesausflug. Nach einem Tag hat man aus meiner SIcht alles gesehen und kann auch wenn man nicht jeden Winkel betrachtet hat sehr zufrieden wieder abreisen. Um entspannen Sie sich auf jeden Fall am Ende oder in der Mitte des Tages am Flußufer - es macht wirlich Spass hier mit den Anderen Touris und Salzburgern zu chillen!"
50,“Ein wunderbares Ziel für einen Tagesausflug - und nicht so teuer wie man denkt.”,"Zugegeben, Salzburg riecht förmlich nach Schickimicki, nach den ""oberen Zehntausend"", nach echtem und Geld-Adel. Aber nichtsdestotrotz ist die Altstadt wunderschön und zumindest einen Tagesausflug wert. Der Dom und zahlreiche andere Kirchen sind beeindruckend. Flaniert man durch die zahllosen Gassen mit ihren unzähligen kleinen Läden - die im Schnitt nicht ganz so teure Artikel führen wie gedacht -, fühlt man fast schon mediterranes Flair. Ein Ausflug auf die Hohensalzburg mit Blick über die Stadt und das Umland ist ohnehin Pflicht. Und dann sind da ja noch die Festspiele von Mitte Juli bis Ende August. Selbst wer - aus welchen Gründen auch immer (Preis, Ausverkauft etc.) - keine der Opern, Konzerte und Schauspiele besucht, wird mit Vergnügen über den Platz wandeln, an der das Paradestück jeder Saison, der ""Jedermann"", aufgeführt wird. Und auch während der Spielzeit auf der breiten Straße vor dem Großen Festspielhaus die zahlreichen Nobelkarossen mit den tatsächlichen oder vermeintlichen VIPs zu beobachten, kann - zumal mit ein wenig Sarkasmus - durchaus Vergnügen bereiten."
40,“sehr schöne Stadt Salzburg”,Salzburg ist sehr zu empfehlen. Man kann prima mit dem Bus alle Sehenswürdigkeiten anfahren oder auch Zufluss. Es ist alles sehr gut ausgeschildert und sehr anschaulich gestaltet.Absolut zu empfehlen!
40,“Traumstadt.....war schon öfter da und möchte sie aber immer wieder besuchen”,"Salzburg ist einfach schön, die alte Stadt, die Hohenfestung, vor allem der Blick auf Hohenfestung vom Mirabellgarten ist zauberhaft.Der Schloss Hellbrunn ist ganz lustig, aber nur wenn es warm ist, da man ja während der Besichtigung jede Zeit nass werden könnte....Am Abend auf ein Bier gehen, wo man auch ein Überblick über die Altstadt haben kann, wäre sehr empfehlenswert"
40,“Die Stadt Mozarts”,"Die Stadt an der Salzach kann mit vielen Höhepunkten aufwarten. Dazu gehören das Geburtshaus Mozarts, die Getreidegasse, der Mirabellgarten, der Dom und natürlich die Burg Hohensalzburg, die man sich auf keinen Fall entgehen lassen sollte. Weniger gefallen haben mir die Preise in den Restaurants, die das Urlaubsbudget richtig strapazieren. Die Anreise empfehle ich per Bahn, da Parkplätze rar und teuer sind."
50,“Nicht nur zu den Festspielen ein Highlight”,"Salzburg ist zu jeder Jahreszeit eine Reise wert. So oder ähnlich könnte ein Prospekt verfasst werden, der Reisende und Gäste zum Besuch von Salzburg anregen soll. Es stimmt wirklich, und man verspürt zu jeder Jahreszeit den berühmten Mozart Flair. Nicht nur zu Festspielzeiten, auch das ganze Jahr über bietet Salzburg dem Kulturell interressierten Gast ebenso Bonbons wie auch dem Gast der einfach nur die Schönheiten der Altstadt und der Festung bestaunen möchte. Die Festung, der Dom, die verschiedenen Kirchtürme machen die Silhouette von Salzburg unverwechselbar und so ist Salzburg schon seit Jahren UNESCO Weltkulturerbe."
50,“Die Mozartstadt Salzburg”,"Salzburg ist eine wunderschöne Stadt an der Salzach und liegt rund 20 km von der deutschen Grenze bzw. Bayern entfernt. Im Herbst geht von ihr eine ganz besondere Gemütlichkeit aus, die lieblichen und herbstlichen Farben der Wälder und Berge rundum sind einfach herrlich. Salzburg ist sehr übersichtlich, denn die Sehnswürdigkeiten liegen alle dicht bei einander in der Altstadt, die durch kleine Gassen, mittelalterliche Häuser und Kirchen geprägt ist. Das Highlight ist aber vermutlich die Festung Hohensalzburg, die über der Stadt thront und von der aus man einen wirklich einzigartigen Blick in die Alpenlandschaft und auf die Stadt selbst hat. Entweder man läuft hoch oder man nutzt die Standseilbahn. Des Weiteren stammt ein berühmter Komponist aus dieser Stadt: Mozart. Wer als Tourist nicht mindestens einmal Mozart irgendwo gelesen hat, ist vermutlich nicht in Salzburg gewesen. Es werden sogar sogenannte Mozartdinners angeboten, mit Gängemenü und klassischer Musik (sehr zu empfehlen).Für einen Kurztrip über das Wochenende lohnt sich Salzburg ganz bestimmt und auch für längere Aufenthalte."
50,“Salzburg - die Mozartstadt”,"Salzburg hat eine herrliche Altstadt, die mit jedem Schritt an Mozart und klassische Musik denken lässt. Teuere Geschäfte wechslen sich mit guten Restaurants, Cafés und Eisdielen ab.Entlang der Uferpromenade kann man im Grünstreifen den Sonnenuntergang genießen.Besonders die zu beiden Seiten gelegenen Hügel (Klosterhügel und Festungshügel) sind sehr zu empfehlen.Wer nicht rauflaufen möchte, was in der Juli-Hitze schon recht anstrengend war, der kann auf die Festung mit einer Zahnradbahn fahren. Die Aussicht von beiden Hügel ist grandios.Das Outlet am Flughafen lädt zum ungestörten (und herrlich leeren) Shopping ein und die Preise lohnen sich auf jeden Fall, hier einen Zwischenstop einzulegen."
50,“schönster fleck österreichs”,"salzburg zählt zu den schönsten städten in den voralpen. hier ist für jeden was geboten. kulturell überzeugt es mit seinen museen, den festspielen und der traumhaften altstadt nicht zu vergessen mozarts geburts und wohnhaus. jede menge freizeitmöglichkeiten und ein weltklasse angebot an kulinarischen genüssen runden das angebot ab. auch shopping technisch ist alles wichtige geboten. salzburg ist immer eine reise wert.im winter laden die vielen skigebiete rundherum zum pistenspass ein"
50,“mein Favorit in Österreich”,"Salzburg ist der schönste Ort Österreichs in dem ich bisher war. Dort wird eleganz, morderne und Historisches verknüpft. Vom hochmodernen Einkaufscenter bis him zum kleinen süßen Museeum um die ecke. Daumen hoch für Salzburg"
40,“Schön aber ziemlich teuer”,Ich war nun über 3 Monate in dieser wirklich schönen Stadt.Die Menschen dort sind ungewöhnlich nett und es gibt eine Mega Auswahl an Sehenswürdigkeiten. Sehr zu empfehlen sind die vielen klassischen Konzerte ... ist ja schließlich auch die Mozartstadt ;-)
50,“映画「サウンド・オブ・ミュージック」の舞台そのまま！！”,「サウンド・オブ・ミュージック」のファンには必ず行ってほしい町です。映画に出てくるお城も修道院も教会も広場も、橋も、すべてそのまま残っているので感動ものです。町のはしっこに山があり、頂上まではエレベータで登れますが、そこからの眺めは最高で、街を一望できます。上ったところにある屋外のカフェでお茶を飲み景色を見ながらくつろいだひと時は忘れられない思い出です。マリアの通っていた修道院もそのままでした。ミラベル庭園も徒歩で行けます。トラップ家のお屋敷や、ボートに乗った湖、結婚式のあった教会は離れているので、ツアーに参加することをお勧めします。全世界からファンが集まってきて、バスの中で音楽がかかりみんなで歌いました。
50,“サウンド　オブ　ミュージックの世界です”,古い町並が残り、あちこちから教会の鐘の音が聞こえてきます。モーツァルトの生誕地でもあるため、コンサートも多数開催され、音楽を楽しむこともできます。サウンドオブミュージックの舞台ですが、今なお、その当時の面影を残し、映画のシーンと同じ場所を訪れることができます。帰国後、映画を見直すと感動もひとしおです。
30,"“Austria,Salzburg:”",世界的に有名な音楽家「モーツァルト」の出身地、ザルツブルグ。それ故、街は完全にモーツァルト一色で、モーツァルトをコンセプトとした商品やお店で街全体の生計を建てているようだ。彼が生前過ごした家をそのまま残した「モーツァルトハウス」がザルツブルグ中心部にはあるのだがその辺りは「旧市街」と呼ばれ、昔の町並みがそのままに残されている。ほとんどではなく、そのままだ。旧市街には土産物屋ばかりでなく、 H&M等の流行りのお店もあるのだが、外観を損ねないようにするためか昔の建物をそのまま使用している。そのこだわりに一見の価値あり。名物、マジパンで造られたモーツァルトチョコレートはザルツブルグお土産の超定番。きっとどこかで目にしたことがあるだろう。様々なバリエーションを出すことにより、利益を更に追求する昨今の商品事情とは相反して、モーツァルトチョコレートは昔からスタイルを全く変えずに販売を続けている。別の味を出せば販売額が上がるのは確実、しかし敢えてそうしないのは一過性の儲けに流されず、伝統を守るというスタンス。それ故長年愛されるというわけだ。それにしてもザルツブルグにはモーツァルトチョコレート専門店が多すぎる。バリエーションがなく、店によって値段の違いもないから何十年も前にここへ訪れたとしても、何十年後にここへ訪れたとしても変化なんてないのかもしれない。
50,“歩いて登ろう！ホーエンザルツブルグ城”,旧市内を見下ろす高台にホーエンザルツブルグ城（要塞だったらしい）があります。市内広場からケーブルカーで登ればたったの５分。でも料金が高いし、城の入場料金はまた別。そこで節約と健康のため歩いて登りました。ケーブルカー入り口を左に歩いていくと小さな階段がみつかります。たまたま降りてきた人に所要時間を聞いたら５分！と言われ、気楽に登りましたがそれは無理。実際ゆっくり登って１５分ほどで城の入り口へ。中からは（もちろん歩いている途中も）市内が見渡せ、気持ちがいいし中には人形劇の人形が展示してあったり、なかなか見るところやレストランもあります。ぜひ歩いて登ってみてください！
30,“ザルツブルグの移動”,ザルツブルグにはレーゲンスブルグというドイツの町からＤＢを使っていたが、この区間では国境をはさんでいるのにも関わらず、バイエルンチケットが使えた。ザルツブルグ内はバスが主な交通手段なので乗り放題パスを買っちゃったほうが安いです。モーツワルトが生まれた町で有名で、日本人もたくさんきてました。
30,“Per chi ama la musica”,"é una cittadina simpatica.....per un bel w.e. romantico....un centro storico,negozi...e lo spirito di Mozart che aleggia tra i negozi...le Palle di Mozart.. Una tappa merita L'hotel Sacher con la sua Sacher torte originale. Per dire anche io ci sono stato, anche per coloro a cui non piace la torta al cioccolato...Anche il mercato merita una visita come il cimitero monumentale con la famosa tomba del macellaio e delle sue tante moglii.....e poi un giro per la citta. Il Castello se decidete i vederlo prendete l'ascensore.....no fatela a piedi con i tacchi o scarpe scomode....ve ne pentirete."
40,“かわいい祝祭都市”,音楽祭で有名だが、ほかのシーズンでも楽しめる。都市としての規模は大きくないが、ブティクなどはウィーンよりも洗練されているくらい。モーツアルト関連の施設以外にも城や博物館など見所は多い。カフェやレストランも選択肢が多く、満足できる。ザルツカンマーグート(湖水)やサウンドオブミュージックゆかりの場所など市内からのバスツアーで気軽に足を伸ばせる。
40,“Salzburg im Winter”,"Ich war im Winter in Salzburg für ein Wochenende. Und ich muss sagen, eine wirklich schöne Stadt mit den verschneiten Dächern und Türmen. Ich glaube ich habe noch nie so viele Kirchen auf einen Haufen gesehen. Ich bin auf einen Berg gestiegen, von dort hatte man einen super Überblick über die ganze Stadt. Witzig ist, in diesem Berg befindet sich auch ein Parkhaus. Was ich auch empfehlen kann, sind die vielen Glühweinstände mit verschiedenen Glühwein-Varianten.Mozart darf natürlich auch nicht fehlen, wo am geht und steht wird mit dem Namen des berühmten Komponisten Geld verdient, das ist manchmal schon ein bisschen lästig.Landschaftlich ist diese Stadt auf alle Fälle sehenswert!"
50,“Une escapade pour les amoureux”,"Cette charmante petite ville à l'architecture riche et variée mérite largement que l'on s'y arrête au moins une journée.La vielle ville est agréable à visiter car le cartier est piétonnier.Bien sûr les inconditionnels de Mozart ne manqueront pas de visiter les 2 demeures de sa famille.L'incontournable ici reste la Getreidegasse. L'ancienne ""rue aux grains"" arbore ses innombrables enseignes en fer forgé. Prenez le temps de vous arrêter au café Tomaselli pour déguster un délicieux capuccino accompagné d'une pâtisserie (véritable institution autrichienne), et admirez les boiseries et les miroirs qui en ornent les murs. Ce café existait déjà à l'époque de Mozart.A moins que vous veniez spécialement pour le festival, essayez d'éviter la période estivale si vous voulez profiter en toute tranquilité des différents musées et autres lieux de visite.C'est un lieu idéal pour une escapade en amoureux."
