50,Don't Miss This Docent-Led Tour in the Fanciest BH Neighborhood,"Frederick Weisman's collection of modern art and sculpture is outstanding. Add to that the fact that it is located in a Mediterranean mansion in the heart of Beverly HIlls' most exclusive neighborhood (google which celebrities also lived on the same street), the docent-led tour has a limited number of guests, and the entire sprawling collection is curated such that the artwork ""talks to"", i.e., relates to each other, and you have a perfect way to spend an afternoon.",Drthmedarb
50,A visual wonderland for modern art lovers,"Beautiful home of Frederick Weisman and his second wife. SHe survives him and directs the foundation. Home is in a beautiful setting above SUnset Blvd. Limited parking means one needs reservations, but parking and visits are free. The setting and art are stunning . A do not miss experience if you live in or visit southern CA.",jazz562
50,You need to see this!,"As other note, this is a personal collection displayed in situ in a Mediterranian mansion with lovely grounds in Beverly Hills. Free! Tours are limited, book one. This gentleman (and his wife) had a discerning eye, but wasn't afraid of whimsy. They were also not shy retiring types... Everywhere you look there's something interesting, special, unexpected. Docent highly knowledgeable and engaged on an approx. 90 minute tour. No photos inside - initially that put me off, but even a small group could never get through the place if pictures were allowed. {Wonder if they ever considered a Fallingwater type - photo tour, but even then there would be so many shots to frame} Real pleasure, it would be well worth doing twice and sharing with friends.",scott r
50,Amazing Art in Beverly Hills Mansion,"This home has the most amazing contemporary and modern art collection that rivals many museums. The docent who led the tour was excellent, and I loved the art and sculptures and garden and pool. I would consider going again as there were so many pieces of wonderful art and sculptures that I am sure I missed some. I highly recommend this for art lovers and the tour is free. Advanced reservations are required and they have many rules so read the details.",Jeannie D

30,Don't Go Marie Kondo!,"So there was this rich guy who made a ton of money selling Toyotas. The Rich Guy loved modern art and started buying it with his Toyota dough. Along the way he divorces Wife # 1 and marries Wife # 2. Rich Guy and Wife # 2 continue to buy modern art but also start to commission works depicting them. Rich Guy dies and Wife # 2 turns their home into a museum and moves somewhere close. She creates a foundation in Rich Guy's memory and opens the home twice a day so that 30 people can see Rich Guy's house and grounds, his modern art collection along with the many tacky depictions of them both paid for with the aforementioned Rich Guy's Toyota dough. I am not saying don't go, by all means go. Just warning you that there are things you will see that will not bring you joy.",KerrMuggin
50,Fabulous Visit,The Frederick Weisman home was such a delight to visit!The home is filled with iconic contemporary art and expresses the Weismans’ warmth and love of art. The home is in an exclusive residential neighborhood and you must make reservations in advance. A very different experience than the Broad or LACMA but much more personal and meaningful. Our best ever.,billyraven2018
50,Outstanding!,"We were told about this Weisman Art Foundation by a friend. You must pre-book this tour. You can't just turn up on the day unannounced. As the home is located in an exclusive residential area, there are rules to be followed. We were given an allotted meeting time and were met at the front gate by our volunteer guide. Her knowledge of art was boundless. In every room of the house and in the garden, you are looking at some of the most memorable art pieces. The story of the acquisitions and the owners is remarkable and to think, this whole experience is free!!!! Definitely the best thing that we did in LA.",kayyzee
50,WOW - this was the highlight of our trip to LA,The Art Foundation was recommended to us by other tourists - it wasn't in our guide books. And we were delighted about the recommendation. The Weisman's home was beautiful in itself and the art shown there was one of the most incredible collections of modern art we had ever seen - around 20 masterpieces to each room as well as outside the house. The one hour 45 mins guided tour was excellent - the guide was extremely knowledgeable and had a lovely sense of humour. You must book in advance - we did so by email and the process was very efficient. Absolutely amazing and free as well....,Ros57
50,Spectacular art in a beautiful home,"The Weismans have opened their home for everyone to see their remarkable collection of modern art, with very piece a treasure. Their Rothko is the best I've seen; it's just luminous. Room after room is filled with beautifully displayed paintings and sculpture. While you are escorted by a knowledgable docent, she was really not needed; all the artists were immediately obvious. It's about 1.5 hours for the tour, it's free, although you have to make an online reservation, and you can't show up until 5 minutes before your tour. There are two tours/day 10:30 am and 2 pm M-F. Enjoy!",CaTraveler7777
50,AMAZING art experience,Book your tour ASAP. This is one of the most amazing tours you can get in LA and its free! allow for the 2 hours it will take to round out the whole estate and make sure you buy a collection catalog so you can remember all the great stuff inside. The tours are intimate and theres a lot of pieces to take in. so make sure you're ready for it. It is a home that is preserved perfectly for the amazing artwork that is housed inside and out. The foundation has done a great job keeping all the pieces in great condition. The lighting of the house and natural light that comes in makes for the total art living experience while going on the tour. I highly recommend that you drink enough water before and make sure you wear comfy shoes as there is plenty of walking and stairs. There is a bathroom break half way through the tour but you wont want to miss anything! There masterpieces that are tucked all over the place is absolutely divine. I hope that all the true art lovers make a day of this wonderful collection.,Monique M
50,Great art find,This is a free art event. Contact the Fred Weismann Art Foundation for a tour of this art-filled home in Beverly Hills. Wonderful art!!,thetrentongroup
50,Spectacular and Amazing!!,"Living in LA for over 30 years I thought I had hit most of the museums. Was I wrong! This place is amazing. The Foundation is located in a residential area of Homby Hills. That's because it was the home of Frederick Weisman. The home furnishings and art are as they were when the Weismans lived here. Who doesn't have a Picasso over their toilet? This is like nothing I have ever seen before. The scope of the collection is overwhelming - Rothko, Klee, Jasper Johns, Hockney, Warhol, Francis Bacon, Frank Stella, Keith Haring and so many more. The tour runs 1.5 hours, reservations required. Walking and stair climbing.",janice s
50,Amazing art collection,Fascinating to listen to the character of Frederick Weisman and his art collection. Wonderful lady who was so knowledgeable of all the art pieces. The house was beautiful and the pieces thought provoking. I might not be the number one fan of 20th century art but I thoroughly enjoyed the tour wand also all the pieces of art that was laid out. An eye opener,youke_worldwide
50,"Something Truly Spectacular to See in Holmby Hills, California","Wow! Wow! Wow! Touring this magnificent and spectacular estate was one of the three highlights of my recent trip to Los Angeles; the other two were going to The Getty Center and meeting Smokey Robinson at Craig’s! This estate was the home of the philanthropist Frederick Weisman and his second wife. Although he has unfortunately passed away, his wife runs this foundation. This estate was the last home they lived in when he was alive. It is furnished and maintained the way it was when they lived there. You will love the truly stunning architecture, furniture, and astoundingly gorgeous modern art; including paintings, sculptures, accessories, etc. You must call and arrange for a tour of the house and the grounds. It is totally worth doing. And it is free of charge. And try not to bring a car because parking is very limited and not encouraged. The best thing is to get dropped off. There are numerous awesome sculptures outside; in both the front and back of the house, including in and around the pool. The house is on 2.5 acres. There is a large house next door that is also part of this estate, which houses more art and sculptures. My tour guide, Louise, was phenomenal. This is truly a jewel in Los Angeles! Totally worth experiencing. I live in NYC and had told one of my doctors about it because he and his wife were going to visit their daughter in Los Angeles. He actually called me when they arrived home to thank me for recommending the astoundingly fabulous tour of this glorious estate! He thought it was outstanding. Located on North Carolwood Drive in the Holmby Hills. Very close to Beverly Hills.",281valerie
50,"A fabulous treat, just don’t come unannounced !","A fabulous treat, just don’t come unannounced or you will be runoff. That’s part of the charm and wonderment of the house and gallery. You must taxi or Uber to the house. After all Carolwood Drive has some of the most exclusive and expensive homes in the nation. The extreme rich are protective and do not permit the rest of us to park on their street.Wonderful, unique, and original.it is worth the trouble of seeking an invitation and abiding by the rules that come with visitation. The house and setting are fun and realizing. That millions of dollars in art were treated as decoration for the house. Whimsy is found everywhere and the freaky life size humans in the hallways and bathrooms are rather in their own way fantastic.Come with full visual attentiveness as the artwork is everywhere, not simply on the walls, check out the ceilings, floors, doors and all around the yard.My only comment is the tour seemed rushed. The ground rule was no questions until the end of the tour. Perhaps 30 more minutes could be added to allow time to fully visualize the art. Otherwise it was a fabulous treat and a hidden Los Angelos treasure.",Cavydad
50,A must see for all,This eclectic art collection is the personal collection of Frederick R. Weisman and is in his former Holmby Hills Home. Reservations mandatory..although..no charge...small groups only. I have returned 5 times and always see something I didn't see the first time around. Great sculptures in the garden. Wonderful tour guides.,linda t

50,Stunning art collection: not to be missed.,"The Weisman's were very infuriated and tasteful collectors of mid to late 20th Century art. The big names are all there, beautifully situated in a Beverly Hills mansion off Sunset Blvd. Go to the website or call to book an appointment, as that is required. As far as I know, admission is free.",Steve K
50,What an Outstanding Collection!,"The eye this couple had for art is simply amazing. The museum is in what had been a private residence. How lucky to have lived there amidst this work. The collection focuses on 20th century art works. This is stuff we love. Please note, as this was a house and is in a residential neighborhood, reservations are required. Groups will be small. You will have a chance to spend time with the things you love. Good luck choosing!",Victor N
50,Such a Surprise,"Such a surprise to find this outstanding tour in a quiet residential part of the city.Not your everyday museum, since the couple had purchased such an abundance of art, they ended up hanging it on their ceilings. A Must if this is your ""cup of tea"".",marj1344
50,The hills are alive☺,"No, not with the sound of music, but with an astounding art collection. And that in an example of architectural art, which is the former home of Frederick Rand Weisman and wife Marcia Simon, sister of art collector Norton Simon. The “house” (make that a château) was constructed in the late 1920s (just before the Great Wall Street Crash) in the Mediterranean Revival Style. This is actually in Holmby Hills, sort of Beverly Hills on steroids.☺The vibrant docent Louise escorted a small group that included friend Marianne, who introduced me to this fabulous Foundation. Weisman/Simon began collecting art in the 1940s. Two decades later, their collection was notable, and artist David Hockney portrayed the couple in the double portrait called “California Collectors,” now featured at Chicago Art Institute. That piece became one of Hockney’s most famous works. Sadly in 1979, the Weisman/Simon couple split—both their marriage and the vast art collection. Marcia donated much of her half to the newly formed LA Museum of Contemporary Art, and Frederick created the Art Foundation featuring his name in 1982. Some of the art may not appeal to specific tastes, but the value of art—like beauty—resides in the beholder’s eye.The number of visitors at one time is limited, and reservations are required. Street parking virtually doesn’t exist in the ritzy neighborhood, and cars may be towed. Friend Marianne recommends Lyft or Uber ride-share. Photos in the interior are not allowed, but since the manicured grounds and exterior architecture are examples of the Hollywood halcyon era, there are excellent photo ops.",DeanMurphy2020
50,A Hidden Treasure of Modern Art Paintings and Sculptures,"What an amazing place to visit! Our docents, Carole and Kimberly, were incredibly versed in the collection and made us feel like we were part of something truly special. Everyone in our group really enjoyed visiting the amazing mediterranean villa and experiencing the extensive modern art collection and sculpture garden in their natural setting.",jeannejsk
50,"Stunning, memorable...world class art collection meets home of the rich & famous !!","Best kept secret in the world of art collections and museums. Cannot say enough about this spectacular art collection located in a magnificent home near Bel Air/Beverly Hills.Free admission and open to the public but must make reservations in advance. Like the Barnes in the Philadelphia Main Line, parking is not allowed in the public streets, only on the short driveway inside the property which means six or eight cars at the max. A curator guides the group of 16-20 visitors twice a day, mornings and afternoons.More than 400 art pieces from the middle and late 20th century. Strong representation of US and California artists. The paintings and sculptures were displayed throughout the home while the Weismans lived there and after they moved, the collection has been kept just like it was while they lived there. Fascinating family history and wonderful example of what to do with ample wealth in supporting the arts.",mongoose1950
50,HIdden Gem of LA,Be sure to contact them in advance to book a reservation. One of the best kept art secrets in LA. Works by the best contemporary 20th century artists in the world on display in every corner of this estate. Not to be missed. Locals don't even know about it.,SoCalTravelBuff
50,A Los Angeles & International art treasure,"The stunning collection & Bel Air mansion should be considered as a must see when in the LA area if you are at all interested in seeing excellent California architecture and a world-class mkdern art collection. The drive is just off Sunset & very much worth the 2 hours docent guide tour through the home, grounds and art annex on the compound. The docents are thoroughly knowledgeable on the collection and any questions yoi have are welcomed.",maryaboujaoude
40,Truly a fascinating and unique experience!,"A fascinating insight into how art collectors live and what their priorities are. Mr Weisman was a fan of modern art and with seemingly unlimited funds he and the artistically intelligent second Mrs Weisman, travelled the world collecting pieces from name artists as well as some relatively unknown ones and they filled the house with those works. Our guide was knowledgable and witty while giving great insight into the couple's lives. The guided tour is 90 minutes and the group is small so that one can ask questions and get them answered. There is a sense of privilege about the whole experience because you get to be so close to the art in a non museum like enviornment. I heartily reccomend it to art lovers and people who just want to see how some of the 1% live.",WilliamAllen54
50,"Was not a modern art fan, BUT.....loved it","After visiting the Weisman Art Foundation, I have a newfound appreciation for modern art, partly due to its unique setting and different perspective; seeing the art displayed as someone would, to live amongst it and enjoy it, and not just to look at it. A beautiful and fabulous extensive collection, with something for everyone to delight in, and be amazed at the creativity of well-known and more obscure modern artists. The only downsides are the 1-1/2 ish hour tour is not nearly long enough to take in everything, and it's only open during workdays (in the middle of the day). The tour is free, but you need to make an appointment time to go. You can buy a beautiful book at the end of the tour, and it's a bargain at $40 for the hard cover book. One last thing, you have to be able to navigate uneven surfaces and stairs quickly (no handicapped access or elevators).",G7D180
50,Absolutely Fascinating,"Viewing famous art in art museums is a wonderful venture..... viewing famous art in a private home is an intimate experience. Frederick Weisman has left a time capsule of his wonderful art collection and life for you to explore. Tours must be prescheduled, and are docent lead, and that's part of the pure joy of exploring his collection. Our docent was knowledgable, clever, engaging, and her sheer pleasure in the Weisman collection was contagious. Highly recommend!!",Starchgirl
50,Astounding collection!,"Each amazing room of this beautiful home holds an awe-inspiring collection of great art. The most familiar names of the past century--it's like walking into a contemporary & modern art book. The grounds have incredible sculptures as well. It was an extraordinary experience & the docent gave a lively, interesting commentary w/ great historical contextual references.",KwReeves
50,Best museum in LA and nobody knows about it!,"Was here in February for the first time tho' I've been visiting LA for almost 30 years! The place is a greatest hits of American modern art! It takes over 2 hours and I brought a dubious group- my non-art obsesses husband, 15 and 17 year old girls and their 17 year old friend. In the end only the 15 year old wasn't completely wowed. My husband seemed most captivated by the value of the collection. That said HE organized going to LACMA 2 days later, a first!!",susan s

40,Beverly Hills Home Packed with Art for Us to See . . A Good Thing,"Contemporary art lovers, The Weismans, filled every inch of their beautiful Beverly Hills home with art. The pieces in the home are museum worthy and they wanted the public to enjoy them. After leaving the home, it was left intact for others to enjoy.I am not a great fan of contemporary art, yet I found the home very enjoyable.You must call for a reservation. They are one hour guided tours with a small groups, one tour at a time. No photos are allowed inside; they are allowed outside. The tour involves standing the hour and stairs. I would not recommend it for children. I do not think it would engage them, and nothing is roped off, so it could be risky. There is parking, they will let you in the gate. Oh, I forgot . . they wanted everyone to enjoy the collection - so it is free - not even asking for donation.",IreneDJ2
40,Large Collection of Modern/Contemporary Art,"This is a docent led display in a large house. The art is very modern a some of it by very famous i.e. Lichtenstein, Picasso a lot of less well known. The docent was very good she knew all the artists names, work names and a story about them and yet she kept it moving so I was never bored. There were over 400 pieces so you really experienced a lot.This is all twentieth century art so it's more modern than most museums but not quite as far out as a lot of the exhibitions at say the Hammer. We enjoyed it much more than the MOCA and the Weisman is free.If you enjoy modern this should certainly be on your list.",Matthew J
50,"Amazing Art Collection, free and private!","I am so excited that we discovered the Weisman Art Foundation. The collection of art is amazing... so many works throughout the house & grounds! The docent was so knowledgable, but honestly we felt a bit rushed because we had to keep moving through to end our tour on time. I wanted to just stop and really gaze at several pieces I was thrilled to be seeing, but we had to keep moving through. That being said, I will go back to see them again! Appointments must be arranged in advance. We arrived at the specific time and parked inside the gates of the Beverly Hills home. Our group was maybe 8-10 people. No charge, but we did tip our docent and purchase the Weisman Art Foundation book for $40 at the end of the tour, which I still look through often to see all the art that was on display in the home.We had our kids with us, a teenager and 10-year-old. They made a special allowance for my youngest as I assured them she would enjoy it and had museum manners (i.e. they made it clear they did not want ill-behaved children ruining the experience for the group). They both really enjoyed it - my teenager loved it almost as much as I did!I feel lucky to have discovered this treasure and will return next time I'm in LA.",Nicole L
50,"Wonderful, but make reservations in advance","One couple's collection of modern and contemporary art in what was their private home. In addition to a chance to see pieces by several big names in art, you can also enjoy the Weismans' sense of humor which is abundantly clear. The house is also great. Our docent was a really wonderful man and his sense of humor added to the event. A great opportunity, but only small groups for a limited number of tours. So, be sure to write in advance.",intl_bus
50,"Love art? Schedule a free, private tour of the Weisman Art Foundation","Los Angeles is full of amazing art and museums, and even after literally 50 years of visiting --both Getty museums, the Hammer, LACMA, I had never ever heard of this museum. If you want contemporary art, you'd love the Broad, but if your tastes run modern but a little more conservative, (Botero, Warhol, Brancusi) the Weisman Foundation will blow your mind. The Weismans (Bobbie is still alive, Mr. Weisman is gone) have amazing taste-- or it least, their taste suits me.This is a small tour group-- maybe 10 or 12. Great docent on our tour.You have to be prepared for art on every surface of every room, so if that will bother you, you are hereby warned. You might need to go somewhere afterwards to chill out and settle down.",437happytraveler
50,"Fabulous, Wonderful, WOW",This is special. You have a fabulous house and modern art collection. You have to make reservations. We opted for the 2 PM tour. You have to arrive at 1:55 PM. The guide will open the gates and you park on the circular driveway. The driveway can accommodate about 6 cars. There were only 8 people on our tour. The tour guide was excellent and clearly loves the art. The collection contains works from all the major modern artists. The art is exactly were Fredrick Weisman placed it. His second wife maintains the house as it was when he died. There are large sculptures outside. Mr and Mrs Weisman liked to have portraits of themselves. Mr Weisman has several portraits done by Andy Warhol. The tour is free. There are several life sized sculptures in the house including Mr Weisman's parents.,Charles W

50,Hands down my favorite part of our first trip to Los Angeles,"The best place we visited in LA was the Frederick R Weisman Art Foundation in Beverly Hills. Although it was a little tricky to make reservations (very cloak and dagger about its location, where to park, secret password, etc.), once we had made the reservations and received confirmation, we were able to park inside the gates of a gorgeous, furnished, 1920s Beverly Hills villa, which was purchased by Weisman as a showcase for his personal collection of 20th century art. A very knowledgeable docent leads the tour of less than 10 people through Weisman's home which has not been changed since he lived there. On display are more than 400 works of art by Cezanne, Picasso, Kandinsky, Miro, de Kooning and Rothko. Everything about the half-day we spent enjoying the home's location and architecture, its art, our small group and a true education in modern art was truly a delight.",Nancy M
50,Fabulous - a must see for any art lover,"Incredible experience - you must make reservations in advance, this is a personal art collection housed in a private home and they can only accommodate 10-15 people on a tour. You tour the entire home, furnished as it was when the Weisman's lived there, with their incredible collection of modern art. The walls and flat surfaces are covered in an eclectic mix of paintings and sculpture. There are original Warhols, etc. Our docent was fabulous, had an incredible art background, was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable. You see so much in 90 minutes it is hard to process it all. You also tour the grounds, which include several Bolero sculptures. I can't wait to return!",Roberta R
50,Amazing personal collection,We toured the house and collection yesterday and throughly enjoyed the docent and the amazing collection.

50,Terrific Experience,"My wife and I took the tour last week; tour group is small and you need advance reservations. Took about 2 - 21/2 hours and included the house, gardens and Annex. Delightful docent and wonderful modern art. It was very enjoyable hearing about the house, the art, the owner, the Weisman family (his two wives are also collectors) and his in-law Norton Simon.",DeepFreeze63
50,A very unique experience and well worth it,"This home, in Bel Air, is owned by the estate of one of the biggest owner of modern art in Los Angeles. It is curated by his last wife but most of the art was purchased with his first wife, Marsha, whose family was consumed with the art scene in Los Angeles during the 60's, 70's and beyond. It should definitely be on your list, the house is lovely, the tour is informative, the yard is grand and every space is taken up with prominent artists. If you love modern arts, it is a must see and reserve early.",Ollywang
50,Fantastic Modern & Contemporary House Collection,"If you are in LA, definitely see the LACMA, the Norton Simon, and both Getty Museums. But add this house tour to your list. This is the collector's own home and it is full of interesting art, especially a lot of life-like sculptures. I cannot recall a home tour this good since the Barnes Foundation. It is free but requires a reservation like the previous Malibu Getty given the residential neighborhood.",Thaddeus P
50,A friend of Andy Warhold,"This truly is one of the great secret glories of LA. It is a stunning collection of contemporary art shown in the house where the collector lived which gives a glimpse of a life as well as of the great art. Although there are some jarring notes -- I am not sure I want to bathe in a tub under a gigantic print of my own face starring down at me, or walk by a dead looking life size figure of myself sunbathing or meet life size figures of my own now dead parents when I walk into the library -- the house itself seems quite livable. The art enhances. It must have been thrilling to read the morning paper surrounded by these beautiful things.It is also generous of Frederick Weisman's widow to make this collection available to the public. If you go, be sure to reserve well in advance and be aware that there is almost no parking and one must park in the driveway not the street -- thus it is imperative if you are a large group to arrive in the fewest possible number of cars. The instructions make a big deal of not arriving before 5 minutes before your tour, but we got there exactly on time and the tour started almost immediately -- most people had arrived earlier.An amusing exchange with the docent. There are several Warhol prints of Weisman in the house and the docent commented about his friendship with Andy Warhol. One of the tourists asked all wise eyed 'Wow, how did he get to be friends with Andy Warhol?' The reply 'well his financial adviser introduced them.' It seems to have paid off for both of them.",Janettravels44

50,Gallery of Magnificent Art,"The tour of this magnificent art gallery was such a tremendous surprise. We had driven past and looked at some of the sculptures previously, so when we were arrived for the tour we were overjoyed.Once inside and bearing witness to such a marvellous selection of artwork, we knew we were in for more surprises.If you are going to LA and love different forms of art, make sure you book into the Weisman for a tour. They are restricted in numbers and very well managed. So worthwhile.Purchasing the book, hard cover, was an advantage as we have been able to come home and have another 'viewing'.How lucky are we??? Very lucky to have experienced this example of a private art gallery.",MCRAD16

50,Hidden Gem in Los Angeles,"Who knew? Right under your nose is a spectacular collection of modern art, all free to see. The Weisman home has been converted to a museum on a reservation only basis. Tour groups are small, maybe 15 people max, 2 tours a day, and only 5 days a week. Imagine being led by a docent through a collection of Picassos, Harings, Magritte, Lichtensteins, Hockneys, and much, much more. This is the kind of collection one would think to see at a major museum in NYC or London, but no, it is sitting right here under your nose. The tour is a bit short of 2 hours, but our docent, a young lady, could not have been more informative or delightful. There is no other way to say it - I was shocked at the depth of this collection. And mind you, only a portion was displayed.I suggest you stop reading and book a reservation now. You will be thanking me eternally for spending a fascinating few hours at the Weisman home.",hcarlpast
50,Wonderful museum in Beverly Hills,What a wonderful collection of contemporary art. It was a treat to see it in this particular setting: the home of the private collector. Our docent was knowledgeable and the tour well-paced. She packed a lot into an hour and a half. I am recommending to all my museum friends who visit the LA area.,Gwynne M
50,Best Museum Ever,"Can't say enough about our visit, The docent, Dick Heiser, was knowledgeable, informative, personable and just pain nice.The art was breathtaking. It was so varied, and to tour with the art within the house setting was an unbelievable experience.I cannot recommend the tour enough for lovers of 20th century+ art. Reserve your space now. Thank you, Mrs. Heisman, for allowing us to enjoy your collection.",Maxieboy95
50,Worth the trip!,Such an amazing collection of modern art! When else do you get the chance to have a docent led tour of a private collection in Beverly Hills? Totally worth the time!,Alyse J
50,Don't miss this unique collection,An unbelievable collection of 20th and 21st century art in a remarkable setting in Beverly Hills. Make the effort and you won't regret it.,Tiz56
50,Great Tour,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this tour. We enjoy modern and contemporary art (though our knowledge of art is basic at best) and this house had a great mix of beautiful art. The tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and friendly.I would definitely return if I came back to LA.,KHL
50,Utmost importance for 20th century art,"The virtually universal 5 star rating by reviewers here tells you something. This private art collection that Frederick Weisman and his two wives put together represents an unbelievable view of the 20th century from the very first decade to the last (and into the 21st century). I believe there are something in the neighborhood of 500 works of art throughout this large, gorgeous LA estate. Reservations are essential and you can only visit on a tour. Our docent, Paula, was simply astonishingly familiar with each and every single work in the house (you do get to see everything) as well as about modern art in general. She was a very important part of the pleasure of our visit. We took some LA friends with us who had never even heard of the Weisman Foundation (we're from the Bay Area). This is right up there as a must see with LACMA, MOCA, the Getty, the Norton Simon (Weisman's brother-in-law). I can't stress enough how very important this collection is.",nurealam
50,Wonderful Works of Modern Art,"First learned about Frederick Weisman when we visited the Frank Gehry-designed Weisman Art Museum on the campus of the University of Minnesota. We toured the Holmsley Hills Weisman home on February 3, during a visit to Los Angeles. If you are a lover of modern art, this home should be tops on your list. We had to apply in advance to the Frederick Weisman Art Foundation, and we gave them three dates. They assigned us a date and time. Our tour was scheduled for 10:30 am, and we were instructed to arrive no earlier than 10:25 am. You can't walk in - you need to drive onto the property, park in a specific location, and leave everything in your car - including your purse and cellphone.Once you get in, you'll be treated to a feast of great modern art - paintings, sculpture, furniture, rugs - all placed in rooms by Mr. Weisman and his wife and remaining as they were when the Weismans lived and entertained there. Art in displayed in the bathrooms, on ceilings, on floors - everywhere you look you will see masterpieces by the most famous modern artists in the world: Picasso, Cezanne, Pollack, Lichtenstein, Segal, Moore, Stella, Warhol, Rothko...too many to list. We had a delightful docent-led tour, and bought the book (cash or check only) to savor what we witnessed. It was a very special experience.",Phillygirl1807
50,Superb,"As an art lover, I have visited hundreds of museums. This made me think about art and how it is displayed in a way I've never thought before. The quality of the collection is stunning. I can't wait to visit again. And it is free.",Magsy31
50,A must do in LA,"If you love art or just beautiful things then this is a must if your are going to LA.i have just got back from my third trip to LA and have gone every time, not only is it set in fashionable Beverly Hills but its free to get in !.A little gem.",rileyred
50,A must see,"You have to make reservation forbthis tour but it is complementary. If you want to know how the famous and rich people live on L.A, you have to visit this beautiful house which has been kept as its masters were to come and stay immmediately. In addition you have a wonderful collection of modern art, from Botero statues in the garden to paintings of the master of the house by Andy Warhol. If you do not like modern art, do'nt go but you will regret it.",nine52
50,Free tour of a wonderful gem in Beverly Hills! Amazing!,"The best attraction to visit in Beverly Hills, and it's a free guided tour, in this privately owned superb villa! You can chose either the morning or the afternoon tour, the tour is for a small group of people and it takes you through the house, the way it has been left when they used to leave there. Because of this you have the feeling of the way they used to leave and enjoy this wonderful house and its content. Pieces of art everywhere, even in every bathrooms, and in the kitchen. The tour guide, a girl, was very nice and explained every piece of art connecting it with the life of the owner. The other amazing thing is that you get to see the original furniture and decor of the house the way it was. Amazing, such an hidden gem!! Much better than visiting a museum! A must see!",ManuLLosangeles
30,"Wonderful for the abstract and contemporary art enthusiast - but, with an eyesore of outdated tacky home furnishings and decor.","I had a 2:00 pm appointment for this private intimate complimentary tour. It was the private home of the late Frederick Weisman, whom made his fortune from the food label Hunts. His widowed wife actively runs the foundation, and lives a few houses over.The Weismans were avid contemporary art collectors, and their life revolved around ART. His second wife was an art dealer. Our docent explained the history of the art, no description signs posted next to each piece, or to be read. Some outrageous colorful, gigantic, and unusual pieces - including the life like human model pieces.. throughout the house, pool area, and back grounds.There is an eclectic array of ASTRACT and CONTEMPORARY arts. Every square inch of walls, corners, home furnishings and decor, and exterior grounds was highlighted to showcase the art. Eyesore: I did not personally care for many of outdated tacky decor or or furniture in the master bedroom, family room, bedroom, and bathrooms. Mr. Weisman even commissioned Andy Warhol to do several portraits of his second wife and him. Pretty cool and interesting, which evidenced his significant influence in the art circle.No pictures allowed inside. Very strict parking rules, entry must be inside estate - through a gated driveway.",LoveSchnauzers
50,It's amazing what too much money can buy?,"Amazing private art collection....collected by Weisman basically over a 10 year period in the 80s.Some great Picassos, Lichtensteins Hockneys and Bacons. Over 400 pieces in total including some clearly self indulgent stuff! This greatly adds to the attraction as the collection was clearly stuff they liked rather than those that experts would necessarily choose.This wonderful collection is available to view absolutely FREE!",DavidHBlair
50,Amazing,"Lots of art pieces in the family house. A must in LA, the experience is so different to going to a museum. You will need to call and book, can do it the same day. Car parking available inside the premise.",Daria_Tebar
40,Stunning gardens at this museum,"We drove by this with a tour guide during our visit to Beverly Hills. He pointed out that the museum contains, Picasso, Botero, Henry Moore, Warhol, etc. We peaked inside and the place looks stunning. Can't wait to hit this with the family next time we're in the city.",James F
50,private art collection gone public,If you have the chance to visit the Weisman Foundation I would definitely take the opportunity gladly. Situated in a home it feels lilke the private collection that it is but the collection's provenance is staggeringly impressive. If you have an interest in art you will wish the collection were yours,janieB1123
50,Plan Ahead and Don't miss this!!!,"You must make reservations in advance. They are limited in numbers by the neighborhood. It is free....if it were $50, it would be worth it. Wonderful pop art collection in collector's former home in Holmby Hills. Don't miss this one, it is fabulous. Beautfiul home, beautiful and fun art work and wonderful docents.",rangodog
50,Reserve Ahead,This is an unusual collection housed in the beautiful home of the donor. You must reserve to be admitted because there is very limited parking. Only takes small groups and the entire group tours together. No place to wait except your car. It is very restrictive but worth it. No fee.,43judy
50,Do Not Miss If You Like Modern Art,"Been going to LA for a long time, but never heard of this Foundation. All I can say is fabulous! You need to make an appointment and are taken through the Foundation [which actually was Mr. Weisman's house] by a docent. His collection is huge and includes the best of the best of the moderns.I was awed and especially love to see art in a living space.Run, don't walk.",mgold040
50,he was way ahead,"Fred Weisman and his wife, Marcia, were way ahead of the art curve and as she was Norton Simon's sister and Fred, at one time, presided over the company they had to resources to do great things and they did. If you can go, don't miss the chance",doug100worth
50,Amazing find,"This place houses an extraordinary art collection in a home where the family who collected the art lived. It is displayed in that way as well, so more like an amazing home than a museum. The docents are extremely knowledgeable, though a little uptight. This is an unusual museum off the beaten path in the best neighborhood in Los Angeles with a vast collection and definitely worth a visit. The architecture of the home and the gardens are amazing as well.",tripindicular1
50,A definite if you like art collections,"Visiting the Weisman house is a unique experience in LA as so few collectors leave their art where they lived with it to be viewed by the public. You feel like a house guest wandering through the manse, too bad they don't give you a glass of champagne at the door. Every major modern artist is stuffed inside this house in a tasteful way. An LA must!",GlobalHouseguest
50,Hidden gem!,"This wonderful collection of 20th century modern artists from Picasso to Ruscha is even more enjoyable when placed in the context of literally ""living with the art"". The Weisman home and his collection are available for small tours every day. And it's free!",pw65_12
50,Fascinating way to view art.,"One of the best docents we've ever experienced, in a very unique setting...you're walking through someone's home!",Kylie D

50,Fabulous and Unknown to the general public,"The Freerick R. Weisman Art Foundation is a private home that houses a fabulous collection of modern and contemporary art by artists that you have seen or wish to see in museums. There are three original Picasso oils, Dwayne Hanson sculptures, Wharhols, and on and on. All of these pieces are shown as they were placed in a real home and in a living setting.

Believe me, you are in for a pleasant surprise!Docent led tour groups are kept small and must be arranged in advance through the foundation. It is in the heart of Brentwood/ Bel Air and has lovely gardens, a gallery annex and the home.
