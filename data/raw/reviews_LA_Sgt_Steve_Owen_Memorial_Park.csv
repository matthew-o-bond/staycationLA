50,More than just a park,"While visiting my daughter and her family, who are living in Antelope Valley this year, I joined the gym at the Y for a few weeks since my daughter uses it almost daily. It turns out that this really wonderful facility is located in a great park which I visited with my grandchildren the last time I was here. Membership at the Y is for a minimum month period. But the fees are reasonable and there is a pool as well as a fully equipped work-out room.",bfindysz
40,Fake rocks but make great climbing,"Took the kids out on a chilly but sunny winter afternoon to get some fresh air and enjoy the fleeting warmth of brief sunlight. Went to this pocket park set within a field of grass with a stand of trees. One proud old Joshua tree held reign. Nice, colorful playground equipment. The kids loved climbing all over a large boulder set down nearby. I noticed it was fiberglass and wondered why the park district didn't bring in some rock from the surrounding desert. We decided it was probably safer for young children to lose their grip and fall onto a fake surface rather than a hard, natural material. All in all, the kids enjoyed themselves.",bfindysz
40,Nice park!,We go to this park for Bark at the Park and the Poppy Festival every year. Nice location. Parking for vendors is great. Of course bathroom could use update but not too bad. Just need make sure you bring paper towels and toilet paper and sometime toilet seat cover. It is well maintained. Park is clean and areas for pets is provided.,Marissa C

50,This place is great,"Without this park, the city of Lancaster will be in hurt mode. This park is very active with softball leagues. There is a batting cage that you can practice your hitting. You can play basketball and volleyball until dawn because they have lights. The YMCA is next door. People use this park as a training ground for many sports. This includes soccer, football, softball, baseball, basketball, tennis, and volleyball. If you're a sports person like me, you will find out that this park is great",Ting Y
30,"Nice Park, Sketchy Occupants at Times","I've attended summer yoga classes in this park, gone to ""Bark in the Park"" here and walked the perimeter with a girlfriend for exercise. There have been times I've felt uncomfortable because of homeless people and a group of individuals who are mandated to do community service for legal infractions. So don't come here ask dusk and if you are here right after dawn, make sure you are not alone.",EllieRKay
30,Very busy spot,The park has few nice things. Climbing artificial rocks for smaller kids. The park is very busy.While it has a lot of trees and nice grass it could be cleaner.Parking lot is always busy.,ArtRussianMom

Outdoor tennis courts, basketball courts, volleyball courts, kids area and plenty of grass make this a great place for a family outing.",Richard R
50,"Beautiful, green park","This is one of the most beautiful, green parks in the desert area of the Antelope Valley. Offering tennis, baseball, batting cages, and lots of walking areas, it's next door to the YMCA, too. As one of the largest areas, it's used a lot to hold festivals, sports, and other venues for the city. It's a great place to spread open a blanket and have a picnic or just sit and people watch. We love to go on Mondays and watch the Y teach some kids outdoors, with the local swordplay class, then walk under the shade trees throughout the grassy area. A good location by the bus station, too.",Tonia_Crews
40,Lots of activitie you can do.,"There are Baseball fields, Tennis courts, 1 basketball court, can do picknick, area to BBQ, plaground is available for kids. They have indoor swimming pool, can have a lesson for swimming, Gym.",bethfeli
40,Big Park with many Amenities,"The park is huge and comfortable. The YMCA is there as well as batting cages and ball fields. It seems to be mostly used for special events. We went for the pet fair so I probably forget the right time of year, but the area is a nice cool, shaded respit in the desert. Also did a Thanksgiving 5K there. Parking is my big complaint as with so much going on there, lots with only one way in and out, as well as an adjacent transit center, parking can be a hassle.",Charles B

40,Lancaster Park,"Great Park with lots to offer, baseball, softball, YMCA, Yearly Poppy Festival, lots of room and easy to access from I14",inspectrdad
30,Poppy Festival,"This annual event is the big kahuna for this area. Entry fee was no more than $8 and attended by a few thousand people. The wind whipped a lot of the vendors' tents and products around, and everything was dusty, food mediocre and very little in hand-made crafts, but a lot of sweatshop crap from China and Mexico.",LRH7
