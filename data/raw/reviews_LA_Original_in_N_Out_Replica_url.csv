50,How it used to be,"This In N' Out is a replica of the original location which used to be located very close by. After it was torn down, a new In N' Out was built where this replica now stands. They are not open everyday. You cannot order burgers here, but seeing how the original In N Out looked was a treat all by itself.There was one employee manning this replica. She was very knowledgeable about the history of In-N-Out, and she was very cool. Did you know their first burger stand opened in 1948? Did you know they used to sell cigarettes? Did you know that the burgers used to cost 25 cents? So many interesting facts about this iconic burger chain.I highly recommend all In-N-Out fans to check out this replica in Baldwin Park, CA where it all started. Don't forget to bring your camera. Also, a block away there is an In-N-Out to visit where you can purchase your burger, fries, and shake! Enjoy this nostalgic trip back in time!",ExpoNationals
40,Quick stop for photos; limited hours of operation,"The first In-N-Out Burger opened on October 22, 1948, at Francisquito Avenue and Garvey Avenue in Baldwin Park, a suburb of Los Angeles. It was claimed to be the first drive-thru in California. However, it was demolished to make way for present-day Interstate 10, the San Bernardino Freeway; a freeway overpass spanning Francisquito Avenue now occupies the original location. In 2014, a replica of the original In-N-Out Burger was built immediately north of that overpass.If you visit Baldwin Park (18 miles east of L.A. via I-10), this roadside attraction is worth a quick stop for viewing and photos. However, its operating hours are limited as it is open only from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Thursday through Sunday. Additionally, keep in mind that the replica does not serve food; the nearest operating In-N-Out Burger is just on the other side of the freeway.",akisaurus
50,Where it all started!,"Great spot to visit the original In-N-Out location and then across the way, on the other side of the 10 Fwy, go and enjoy a cheeseburger at the new site!",Mel C
50,Hamburgers,"I think their hamburgers are the Best. I don't eat junk food much, but when I eat it, I like N-Out. I moved to Calif in Oct 1969. There was an N-Out at that location then. The one there is New. They are by the 10 fwy. They serve pretty quick & they are very pleasant",Trail622546
30,"Went when it was closed, but looks good outside",Make sure you go when they are open. When we went it was locked up. We went to the factory store afterward and ate at the Baldwin Park store (flagship store?).,jmseight
40,If Ya In The Area,This is pretty close to the exact spot where In-N-Out was created. It's a cool little tourist stop. There's an actual In-N-Out just down the street and the In-N-Out University. I visited to take some photos. There was no one there when I visited. I did;t even see the employee sitting inside. If you're in the area it's a cool little quick stop to make to see a little SoCal history.,Polaroids & Drinkin Stories
50,Just keep going back again and again.,"If you like a burger with the best fries (my little dog is a picky eater, and she will only eat fries from here), this is your place to go. Been eating at In-n-Out for over 50 years and just keep going back! So clean and quick service a plus!!",X6035ANtonym
50,Step back in time to October 1948,"This is a must see for all In-N-Out fans. A true replica of the original drive thru burger stand with many original kitchen items displayed inside and out right down to a replica cigarette vending machine popular in the 40's. Our tour guide Lydia was a wealth of information on the purpose and history of the items on display and the philosophy of the owners Harry and Esther Snyder when they opened the stand in 1948. Feel free to take as many photos as you like. According to Lydia they have had classic car clubs, bridal parties and engagement couples all visit the site for photo ops. There is plenty of free parking however they are only open Wednesday through Sunday 11:00 am to 2:00 pm. No food is served at the location. .",Don H
