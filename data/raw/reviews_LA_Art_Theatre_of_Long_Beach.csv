50,The best movie experience in town,"This little theater is my ""go-to"" movie house. I'm a free-lance script editor and love being able to watch films in an atmosphere that wraps me up in the experience. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable; it's nice to be able to relax with a glass of wine; and, my absolute favorite place to catch a bite, ""The Social List"", is steps away. I always check what's playing at The Art before I head out to the movies.",Jere' Whitney
50,Great place to see movies!,"My girlfriend and I wanted to try this theatre out because so many of our friends had raved about it. We weren't disappointed.The theatre first opened in 1925 showing silent films and it has retained its historical feel, while providing all the modern conveniences.The theatre is non-profit, so ticket prices are reasonable, and they show a mixture of first-run and independent films.They also show Rocky Horror Picture show each Saturday night at midnight with a live supporting cast.",Gary G
10,The air conditioning was broke. It was hot and humid. When we complained they said they told us when we came in. Liars,Make sure it's fixed before you go! They won't give refunds once you see part of the movie! The manager is a liar and can't keep her story straight. Did they know at 12 pm or 3 pm or 6 pm when I got there? I couldn't get a straight answer.,Jeannine W
50,A Treasure of a Movie Theatre,"We had a free afternoon after a volleyball tournament at the convention center and walked to the Art Theatre to see the RBG documentary. Such a wonderful community treasure: Art Deco architecture, old school theatre thatâ€™s been around since the 1920s, cold beer and popcorn, and the notorious RBG.",Dee A
50,Fantastic architecture historic building,"This is a beautiful Art Deco building in the heart of ""Fourth Street Retro Row"" long beach. Definitely worth coming to check out the exterior. Interior. And catching an indie film or whatever is currently playing.So much to do and see in the area as well. A lot of cool boutiques, wine bars, coffee, restaurants and vintage stores from cherry to temple!",TitanHermes
50,Best Place to catch a movie,Be sure to look for documentaries.usually have them on the weekends. Theater is almost never crowded,Fred M
40,Art Deco Treasure from the 1920s,"We first viewed movies at the Theatre several years ago before the renovation. We were excited to know that a key piece of history and architecture would be salvaged for an appreciative audience. Generally, indies and other ""off the beaten path"" movies are shown with rotating times. Recently, we enjoyed Whiplash that was scheduled among 3 other movies played on the same day, culminating with a midnight showing of The Rocky Horror Show.Free parking is an issue although my husband and I were fortunate enough to find a spot on 4th near the theatre on a Saturday night. Otherwise, there is a paid option across the street. The marquis is impressive and the old fashioned ticket booth in the entrance was preserved with tickets sold inside at the refreshment counter by friendly staff. They did not question when I asked for 2 senior tickets that totaled $16. Bathroom facilities are clean and sufficient with modern fixtures. Inside, there are 2 entrances to the large auditorium with an actual stage that can double for live performances. The seating is fairly comfortable but the backs are low. The sound system is fantastic given that the recent movie involved great jazz music and drumming.The other amenities that are offered include a coffee bar and a separate wine bar. Both allow for a lively social scene, particularly, later in the evening. This is a great venue for watching movies and enjoying great wine, coffee, and conversations.",sherrieseg
