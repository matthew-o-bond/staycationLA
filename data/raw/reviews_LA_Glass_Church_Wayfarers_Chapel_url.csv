50,Most charming church!,"I cannot believe I've been around this area for years and never knew about this glass church atop a hill overlooking the Pacific. Unbelievably charming, I would've gotten married here if I didn't care about being married in a Catholic church. Beautiful views!",cvtmuench
50,A GREAT PLACE.....WITH NO THEOLOGY !,This is an iconic structure on and magnificent setting.....and unfortunately it has nothing going for it.....even an atheist has more beliefs than what is preached here!,travel Guy
50,Precious,Today was a perfect day to enjoy this wonderful chapel. Though I doubt there are any bad ones. The light entering the chapel was spectacular and a spiritual experience to enjoy.,Yo Giacomo
50,Christmas Eve Service,I was looking for a church to go to for Christmas and found the chapel while searching online. We came for the Christmas Eve candle light service and it was so delightful. The service was well done. The chapel is breathtaking. I hope to come back to visit again.,Brittany Waters
50,Tranquil beauty,"Sitting in a scenic coastline and surrounded by redwoods, it is a gem. Interesting to discover that it was designed by Lloyd Wright, son of the famous Frank.Given its popularity as a wedding venue we rang ahead to ensure that it wasn’t inaccessible when we arrived.We sat within for some time appreciating the beauty and tranquillity.",permia
50,Beautiful church,"When we arrived there was a wedding going on so we were limited to seek the grounds. From what we could see, the church is very beautiful. Security guards were ensuring the wedding went off without tourist interference. If planning to go, may want to call to ensure there is not an event taking place.",Norjeff2
50,Very Pretty,"Be sure to call ahead because the chapel is closed for weddings. There was only a 30 minute window of time open to the public during our visit. The chapel is very small, but beautiful light and views. There is a small garden area, restrooms and gift shop. You can get a guide for a $1 donation. Down the street there is an interpretive center with free museum and walking paths.",JD1
50,Must see,"This was our second visit, the last being 8 years ago. I had forgotten how beautiful this spot is. The chapel is glass and with the trees all around I felt as though I were in a forest cathedral. It’s really breathtaking. The grounds are beautifully landscaped and the property faces out on the blue Pacific Ocean. Don’t miss it.",Jean U
50,Best on a sunny day!,"The glass chapel is a treasure no matter when you go but if you can go on a sunny day, it’s even more beautiful. I happened to go on an overcast Sunday and I believe there’s a different mood when the sun and blue skies arent shining through the glass. The staff at the gift shop are so friendly and helpful. When we arrived they suggested we see the chapel first as a wedding was about to start and if they hadn’t warned us, we would have missed going inside. The chapel is small but lovely to look at. Outside there are beautiful grounds with lots of flowers and a spectacular ocean view. You can expect to easily spend about 1/2 hour here taking in all the beauty. Parking is plentiful and free.",Caroline L
50,Stunning Lloyd Wright designed chapel,Attended a wedding and the venue is beautiful. The views of the ocean are spectacular and the gardens are very accessible.,UsUKFoodie
50,Will make you want to get married again!,"It is such a hidden treasure. It is nestled up on the hill w/ sweeping views of the ocean. Walking into the chapel is a truly special experience, as it is all glass, but is protected by towering trees. The chapel itself has a very familiar feel, but as you look out the glass walls, you feel religion and nature come together for a very special experience. This is a must if you are driving through Palos Verdes!",Sondra W
50,Beautiful,"Oh WOW. I'm so glad I visited this chapel when I was in California. It's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been. I felt such peace and calm there. In front Standing at the doorway of the chapel looking out, there is a short path to a bench and trees. Here you can look out over the cliff and see the rolling, sparkling ocean, the big blue sky, and the cliffs of Palos Verdes. The church itself is made of what appears to be wood and glass. It is a beautiful place to sing worship.",Purpl_Unicorns
50,Serene and Beautiful,The chapel is famous for its glass windows and you can take picture in it if a wedding is not scheduled. It is rather small and I have heard it is expensive to rent. The grounds are beautiful. You can get a great view of the ocean because it sits on a hill.There is a nice flower garden and the trees are stunning. It is the type of place where you can go and just sit and engage in quiet or no conversation. There is no admission charge so you are free to enjoy it.,Lance2002
50,Beautiful,Went on a Sunday when they were having service. I waited outside until mass was over. Everyone there was gracious and welcoming. It really is a glass house with beautiful views of the ocean. They have a gift shop and there is a small donation box which I feel is appropriate because of the many visitors who come to see the church. Parking was plentiful with a bathroom next to the gift shop.,Terry M

50,What a beautiful glass Church on the ocean,I've heard so many different complaints about people parking in their parking lot when that church isn't in use so people can save a couple dollars extra I mean the laws of the law and they ask politely for you guys not to do it and if they've become more strict but this location has been friendly enough throughout the past 5 to 10 years and they've run multiple hundreds maybe thousands of vehicles parked illegally and when I say let them they had no idea but still this location is absolutely amazing. kudos to hover operates this glass church for a very long time you've kept it up it looks amazing and it's definitely a historical monument on the ocean side and one of the most wealthy parts of California Donald Trump is right down the street with his golf course you guys are a wonderful church that has so much to stand for I went to preschool at st. Peter's preschool. back to what I was mentioning lots of childhood memories this general location is very friendly and it's only going to get better please bear with all the construction going down Portugues. It's definitely worth the wait when it comes on to oncoming and ongoing traffic when it gets congested next to that church it's definitely worth the wait?!!!!; And that's only sometimes once every other year ( constructions on the road),Peter M
50,"Gorgeous place, and serene","The first time I visited here, in the 1980s, I fell in love with the church and the view and tried to marry here - but it was booked solid for the year.Nearly 25 years later, I took some friends here who were visiting from 2000 miles away, and they looked at each other and said,”We want to get married here.” So they did - years later, after a certain court decision that made it legal for them to marry. And I got to be in their wedding.It’s the most beautiful church I’ve ever been in, so be warned: you might want to get married here, too.",TravelersHigh77

50,Showing our visitors around Palos Verdes,Breathing beauty inside the chapel as well as the amazing ocean view.My husband and I were married there on 10/18/1970. The simplicity of the chapel appealed to us both and our bouquets 💐 were the only additional flowers allowed because the all glass structure allowed the viewing of the greenery outside to be part of the colors of our bouquets.Simply elegant.,paulapilmanis
50,Peaceful reflection,"IF there is not a wedding taking place, you can go inside the chapel and experience its beauty, first-hand. If you can't get in, just enjoy the beautiful, peaceful gardens and fountain, and the scenic beauty of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Just soak it in. If you go during Christmas time or Easter, they have great services that include everyone attending. At night, during Christmas time, candles make the chapel into a reflection of peace. I've always gone here whenever and always, to calm down and remember we're all wayfarers..",Lin V
50,Glass Church,"If you haven't seen it, it's a must see. The grounds, the glass church, the ocean views are all amazing. My nephew was married there in June.

It is truly a Southern California treasure.",davidkoch2017
50,Beautiful Chapel,"This was my 2nd visit to the chapel and I wanted to share its beauty with my sister and my parents. It was a gorgeous day and we spent a lovely hour or so walking the grounds, taking photos, and just enjoying the flowers and greenery. My daughter hopes to get married there some day and I wanted my parents to see it in case they're not able to be there in person when the time comes.

40,A Beautiful Spot With A Tight Shift,"I’ve always wanted to see this place so I’m glad I got the opportunity to do so! It was built by Frank Lloyd Wright’s son, Lloyd Wright and features many of the geometric patterns that they’ve become famous for. Looking at the inside of the chapel is like being in Rivendell, the use of glass and wood blends well with the trees around it. there’s also a rose garden and some great ocean views as well. There are a lot of weddings hosted which can attract some frustrated, stressful people under pressure (witnessed one man screaming at his child in the car) and you only have a limited time during odd hours (think 1:00 or 3:00 for example) in order to look inside, but it is still a lovely place that I think people should take a little time to see for themselves.",Colby S
50,Sunrise Service,"We attended Easter sunrise service held on the lawn overlooking the ocean. The view was truly beautiful! The rose garden and gardens in general are charming and lovely... roses, bougainvillea, and bird of paradise to name a few! The chapel itself is very unique in that it is totally glass and wood and so celebrates the beautiful setting. Additionally, the walls are lined with plantings so it feels very organic. It is a peaceful setting for prayer and contemplation.",ITravl4Fun

50,Peaceful and Reflective,What a classic building by Lloyd Wright!! Amazing to sit inside the church and feel like you are outside. Nothing can touch the view - peacefulness and quietness of this gem! Go just before noon and hear the bells while looking out into the ocean.Definitely worth the stop.,BKNJS
50,Worth stopping by!,We enjoyed a stop here while driving around the South Bay. The chapel is beautiful - a nice place to sit quietly and reflect.

50,One of the most romantic spot on PCH,"On a perfect sunny day, we visited the wayfarers Chapel. The glass structure Chapel is sitting on the breathtaking background of blue sea and sky. The wedding bell was ringing. The little flower girl jumped around in her pink dress. A beautiful young couple just got engaged. We took our photo in the Chapel to celebrate our coming 15 years of anniversary. What a romantic place. 💕",tao2010
50,Gorgeous,Probably the most gorgeous chapel I've ever seen. The rose garden and the bells chiming...the beautiful cliffs and perfectly manicured yard. Absolutely magnificent.,Ryan S
50,Only sorry I wasn’t able to visit,I was told of the glass chapel by my cousin and was planning to visit after breakfast. Unfortunately my husband got called into a meeting that was not on the schedule so we had to drive past. It looked fantastic though. Very beautiful. Perfect place for a wedding.,Cherylbc
50,Amazing chapel worth the stop,"I had tried bringing my kids here several times but there always seemed to be a wedding going on. Finally, last summer we managed to stop when no one was there. This Frank Lloyd Wright chapel is absolutely amazing. It’s towering glass walls and ceiling is surrounded by pines so close to the sea can’t be beat for peace and tranquility.We didn’t make a long stop because when you have teenagers this is maybe a 20 minute jaunt to look at the chapel and walk through the grounds. But they did seem to really enjoy it as it’s an architectural experience that you won’t find anywhere else. We ended up seeing it featured in some TV show and it was also exciting for the kids to point at the television and yell, “hey we’ve been there!“",Tami C
50,Inspiring!,Wish we could have attending a service in this beautiful place! Also the view of the ocean from the church is gorgeous.,Judi-in-touch
40,Lovely tranquil retreat.,We enjoyed our visit. Great small wedding venue. However it does not compare to the chapel in Hot Springs at the Garvan Gardens. The ocean view makes the setting. It is not to be missed if you are driving the PV peninsula.,Robin M

50,Just plain beautiful,I had my son baptism here and it was one of the best thing I did for him. The church is amazing and view is is beautiful. My family was extremely happy my wife love the private ceremony and we couldn't ask for more. The Pastor did a wonderful job and we couldn't ask for more anything more. I could go on for days how great this church is but you truly have to experience for yourself or just stop by and visit.,Selvyn C
50,Reverie in the Garden or prayer in the Chapel.,"I return again and again for captivating natural beauty and spiritual solitude. The setting is tranquil and the view unbelievable, all year around. Get married here, attend a Swedenborgian service (you really should), or sit quietly in the garden on the benches, it's the best use of your time on the Peninsula. Clear days you can see all the way and all along Catalina Island. If you get cold, bring a sweater or jacket on a cool day, the Chapel is NOT heated.",sterlingtallman
40,Great Wedding Spot,"I came here for a friends wedding. It is a very pretty place to have wedding although it did get a bit warm. Although it does take a little bit to drive here, it is well worth it as the view and location are breathtaking and one of kind.",tdogg608
50,Chapel in the sky!,"This precious chapel built by Frank Lloyd Wright and his son is a gem... originally sat on a craggy isolated hill, now sits unpretentiously on the coastline amidst homes and seascape.

50,Stunning in every way!,"We visited the Glass Church as part of group exploring the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright in the LA area. This magnificent structure was built by his son, Lloyd Wright. The setting is so beautiful and peaceful. The chapel itself is a glass box that, immediately upon entering, makes you feel calm and close to nature. I sat quietly for quite a while just soaking up the sun and taking it all in (we had battled crazy traffic on the way here but all was forgotten in an instant). Entry to the grounds and chapel is free (as long as no events are scheduled) and there is a modest gift shop and vistor center. This was a lovely place and I highly recommend a visit.",jameskul

Plenty of parking when we were there. Great place to take photos of the ocean and ground around the chapel.,HappyNorwegians
50,My Wedding,"We live in England and Redondo Beach/Rancho Palos Verdes is our favourite place in the world to visit. So it made perfect sense that we should marry in that area.We visited several venues before deciding on the Wayfarers chapel but it was a no brainier as the location and setting are unrivalled.Ours was a small wedding on a budget but you would never have thought so if you didn't know. The on site staff were superb in every detail, they know suppliers to suit everyones budget and tastes and the whole planning process was made effortless because of their knowledge and understanding.I can honestly say that our wedding ceremony far exceeded our demanding high expectations. Helped by the amazing team at wayfarers chapel the stunning glass church and breathtaking views of the surrounding area and Pacific Ocean.The wedding service Video they offer is a must as it captures your service from every possible angle. After the service we went on to Trump for a small wedding reception please read my review but equally as impressed and not as expensive as one would imagine albeit midweek. We had our honeymoon at the Terranea Resort again an amazing resort please read my review. All 3 venues (Wayfarers Chapel/Trump and Terranea ) are within easy reach of each other so all the days wedding activities flowed naturally into one another.In summary anyone thinking of getting married in that area should start and finish their venue search at the Wayfarers Chapel it's breathtakingly beautiful and not as expensive as one would imagine and they do most of the planning for you which is a big plus for anyone living out of town 10 out of 10.",Gary C
50,Beautiful and Easy to Get To,"I had been wanting to attend service at this chapel since I saw photos of it on a TV show and subsequently researched it. The chapel was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and is used for both religious services and events, mostly weddings. I can see why, the service was moving, the chapel and grounds lovely and comforting. Everyone was very nice and there were cookies and coffee after the service. The chapel was easy to find, well marked and there was plenty of parking the Sunday we went.",elkgrovepvc

It has a small souvenir counter that supports the church. There is amply free parking adjacent to the church and visitors centre.The church is closed to the public for one hour at a time for wedding ceremonies.

It's where Jayne Mansfield, Dennis Hopper and Brian Wilson were married. For architectural buffs, the Glass Church was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright's son. On the downside the venue is not large enough for very large weddings, and due to its high demand, the there are many rigid rules in order to quickly process all of the many couple that want to use this beautiful chapel.",kpburgo
50,Beautiful - Stop and See,"My husband had learned about the glass church from a website with interesting spots to visit in the U.S. and by coincidence, we were staying right up the road from there at a resort. We stopped here one day in the late afternoon - we enjoyed our time viewing the beautiful church and walking through the lovely grounds. We also enjoyed our time in the guest center too which had interesting facts and information regarding the architecture and plans of the church - it also had some pretty jewelry and trinkets for sale. A definite worthwhile stop if you are in or nearby the area.",DeeGee04
50,A must see,When I was a child I used to think the most beautiful church would be one that was outdoors or built to look like it was outdoors. Well here is one that is all glass under the canopy of trees. It is made to fit so perfectly in it surroundings that you won't be able to picture anything more well thought out or performed. People flock to it and are welcomed. Do not miss this if you are in the area.,MariaitaliaupstateNY
50,My Home away from Home,"I often come here as I was baptized 40 years ago. I'm blessed to have had the opportunity to become a part of my Christian faith. It over looks the beautiful pacific Coast and a view of Catilina island. They have a great gift shop full of spiritual items. They also have a serene garden. I walked inside of the glass church as I call it and sat down to pray. The silence was so peaceful and the sound of a small waterfall made me feel so relaxed. After my prayers, I walked out to be embraced by nothing but beauty. They also have a path made from bricks that are ingraved of memories of loved ones who have passed and loving sayings of love to those who have gotten married there. You can spend hours there. It is my peaceful place as we all need one.",Jodee68
50,Stunning,This is the most beautiful chapel in one of the most beautiful spots in the world. I make sure whenever I have guests that they visit this chapel and it is just down the road from a spot to watch the whales from the cliff top.,348michelle
50,Tour guide,"Whenever we have friends or family visit we make it a point to stop at wayfarers chapel. The view is incredible, the well thought out gardens (a planting representing each state) and the design that Wright created showcases the trees in the main window.

50,A peaceful sanctuary and historical landmark,"Wayfarers is a glass chapel nestled in a grove of redwood trees on 3.5 acres of landscaped gardens, offering panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean and Catalina Island. Wayfarers is listed in the US National Register of Historic Places. Located on Palos Verdes South in Rancho Palos Verdes, California - between San Pedro and Redondo Beach. Wayfarers blends into the hillside and may be easy to miss. There is a small visitor's center and gift shop. This Southern California sanctuary made of glass, steel and terra-cotta tile is definitely worth a visit.",LagunaLizzy
50,A must see,Beautiful place for peace and quiet. The grounds are fabulous as are the views. The building was done by Lloyd Wright and worth the view. You feel so cradled by the trees overhead that can be seen through the roof. We went for the renewal service on New Year's Day and it was special. You write up your resolutions and then they are burned.Some nice things in the little store.,ddianemiller

40,Nice Place,"With two daughters who are big fans of the former Fox hit, the OC we had to stop at the Wayfarers Chapel during a recent visit to the LA area (many of the scenes were shot nearby and the chapel was the site for a wedding in one of the early seasons of the show). We found the chapel quite unique given its outdoor setting and prominent views of the Pacific Ocean. We enjoyed and suggest an afternoon visit heading into sunset.No fees. Great place for family pictures.",Milton316

50,Our Wedding,"My significant other of twenty years and I were married here in November after falling in love with the serenity and overall architecture. A 6pm wedding we were able to take in the beauty of the late afternoon sun for pictures, begin the wedding as the sun began to set and finish the event up in darkness with the chapel lit by candles. Reverand Masters did a fantastic job and our wedding planner, Diane, was amazing. Both are provided by the chapel (as is the organist) when a couple is married. If you are thinking of a destination wedding or a small (100 people or less) wedding or vow renewal, please think of this beautiful chapel.We had been visitors a few years prior and are great fans of Frank Lloyd Wright and his son Lloyd Wright (the architect of the chapel). A must see while vacationing turned in to the most wonderful place for our family to gather and fall in love just as we had.When visiting the Los Angeles or surrounding areas please make this a stop on your trip. Amazing beauty and serenity will make it worth your while.",reaneyweather

50,BEST Wedding Photos In Town,"I'm a 25 year wedding photographer veteran and I shoot at Wayfarers about six times a month and I have yet to take a bad photo up here. There are always excellent options for great light and the views never end. They run a tight ship here (all wedding are allotted exactly two hours) and they are very strict about no guest photography during the reception, which keeps the guests focused on the ceremony and not their smart phones. Can only accommodate 100 guests.",Mimi T

50,Wedding Bells,"I attended a wedding here at Wayfarers Chapel in December 2015 for a good friend of mine. It had to be one of the most GORGEOUS weddings that I have ever been to.This chapel is located in Ranchos Palos Verdes right on the cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The views are absolutely stunning and if you spend a good amount of time enjoying the view, you will be able to see whales!The nature, the beauty, the architecture of the chapel are every brides dream. The chapel had a vintage yet modern look as it was just made with wood and glass. The glass chapel allows you to enjoy the utmost gorgeous view, it allows the daylight brighten up the chapel and provides such a classy vibe. The photos taken for this wedding were just perfect. The greenery surrounding the chapel is beautiful and gives you this peaceful vibe. You have to give credit to the staff who work hard to keep the entire property is kept clean and maintained.Hoping to take another trip down to California and visiting Wayfarer Chapel sometime soon.",TravelQueenKimz

50,Breath Taking Views,Amazing history of this most beautiful piece of architecture that sits atop a bluff over looking the pacific ocean. Frank Lloyd Wright and Lloyd Wright (architectural geniuses) crafted lovingly this glass church where weddings abound. The grounds are lovely to meander through if you are looking for a peaceful and or meditative time. The church itself is all glass and surrounded by Redwood trees planted at the inception of the church. It integrates nature in keeping with the Swedenborg's religious teachings of life/nature/respect. A spectacular place to sit on a bench in many of the garden areas and just take in the moment (without cellphone in hand). Getting there requires a little know how. Just keep a look out for the sign for Wayfarer Church. It is off Palos Verde Drive just after you pass the entrance to Abalone Cove Parking.,Kristi Z

50,Great free activity with amazing views,"As we continued down the beautiful Palos Verdes drive, our second stop was the Wayfarers chapel. This church was a beautifully located on a hillside overlooking Abalone Cove. That in itself was enough to make this an amazing attraction. However as you walk into a lush isolated forest, you see a glass structure that is amazing and beautiful. It appears that you are simply sitting in an open area of this little forest. The chapel is also great when viewed from other place like the cove. However all you generally see the lush forest that has grown up around the chapel and not the chapel itself. Finally there is a restroom which was nice for us after driving. However the neatest part was the picture of the chapel from the 1950s where you could see the chapel with no trees around it. Still so unique, I highly recommend a visit. The drive alone is worth the visit.",Grover R

It's like a fairy tale setting and provided some great photos.I'm not sure if it's wheelchair accessible. I'm sure they likely have a website where one could check on this. We walked quite a few steps uphill to see the chapel. The steps are stone, hand rails provided and they are wide low steps and very easy to climb, even for seniors.",Judy C

The architecture in itself is worth seeing, and the views of the coast are lovely--but most overwhelming to me was the fact that the property has an enormous sense of peace and tranquility. You feel enveloped by nature, and it gave me a feeling of closeness to God. It would be a wonderful place to worship on a regular basis, and I can understand why many have had their weddings there.",adalbert3

50,A Window Open To The Heavens!,"The denomination responsible for this chapel stresses the inter connectedness between spirituality and god's creation. The glass Wayfarers' Chapel does this magnificently by placing the house of God 'seamlessly' amid His Creation. This is thanks to the vision of architect Lloyd Wright who designed the space (he personally picked the trees surrounding the building). The place is small, only seats a hundred people. The place gets warm on hot, sunny days. The place gets crowded, because of its beauty and the surrounding views. The place gets exclusive, due to the more than 750 weddings there every year. Be warned, no visitors are permitted inside during weddings. There have been additions, such as the tower and the Visitor Center. But overall a visit is worth it just for the sublime experience of feeling a part of God's creation, and the magnificent views! Free to all. Open 10 am to 5 pm. Check their website for details (wayfarers chapel.org). Donations requested. Enjoy!",etweeden
50,"The glass chapel, in the trees and along the pacific coast line, what more beautiful place to spend time with God!","Tia chapel is one of my favorite places! It is beautiful as not only set in the trees, but the glass makes you feel as if you are out in the trees and closer to God. I attended a Sunday morning worship service and will go back again to be a part of the morning services",llvassoc

Try to avoid the weekend wedding crush.",PVtalker
50,Our wedding could not have been better,"Beyond beautiful location and setting. The church itself is such a great experience, especially on a sunny day. Our wedding was April 2015 and it was a great time of year to visit. It gets a little warm in the church in the afternoon, but the sun shining in is beautiful.

50,Married in June,"My wife and I were married at this beautiful place in June. It's small, elegant & views that can not be beat. I would not have chosen any other place to exchange our vows.The staff was very helpful through the process and the ceremony was beautiful. If you're looking to have a large ceremony this place most likely won't work, as I think the max seating is 100. We didn't have the reception there and I'm not sure that they offer that. We ended up renting out a beach house at Redondo Beach.All of the recommended photographers and video crews that the chapel recommended were also great. All of my guest had a wonderful time and were blown away by the views and gardens. The wedding photos also look like something out of a magazine.If you're looking for a beautiful and quaint place to get married, this place would be at the top of my list.",Jason B

On a recent family get together, we stopped again. It's a great spot for pictures and to spend some peaceful time. It's just a beautiful spot and small chapel with a great view of the ocean. It is a popular place for weddings, so I'd suggest avoiding typical wedding times if you want the best experience.",azcat71
50,An elegant small chapel,"This is a neighborhood small chapel. Most of the visitors come here for non-religious reason. This chapel locates at a beautiful location over see the ocean, the cliffs, and the beautiful coastlines.Many people choose to have wedding ceremony here.

The gardens are gorgeous. There is nothing negative to say about this place",HappyTrails1984
50,Relieve the stresses of your usual day.,"This small, lovely chapel has many great features if you know what you are seeing.Of course, first and foremost, this is a house of God. Anyone who would rate this as ""Terrible"" has no sense of propriety. We are not particularly religious, but respect those who are and enjoy visiting God's house in places around the world. Besides, it is not ""Terrible"", that is someone's unrealized expectation, not this chapel. It is not Magic Mountain for goodness sake.There are many stairs but I believe that there is wheelchair access.The location is truly serene. On exiting the car and reaching the (unfortunately closed) chapel we immediately experienced a relaxing atmosphere with a gentle sea breeze blowing through the tall pine trees. If you are seeking God, it should not be difficult to find his hand at work here.We were there late in the day, after closing, so there were few people, all were Japanese tourists. With a crowd of people around, the experience might have been different. I cannot say how crowded it gets.The chapel is itself stunning in its simplicity. Wright, Jr. carried on his father's use of linear design and the structure evokes memories of some of the senior's many works. Vaulted ceilings with glass walls make the most of this location which is on a bluff overlooking open land and the ocean. Catalina will appear in the distance on a clear day.This was the final stop on our short, one day road trip to see PV, and it was a good stop.We loved our visit there and would definitely return.",LeBeauxVoyager
50,Hidden serenity,"Decided to drive to Palos Verdes to see the chapel,what a scenic drive, the road is like a mini roller coaster with bikers too. This chapel is beautiful having the ocean as a background, what a nice place to recharge the trouble mind. Definitely will come but not on Saturday since a perfect venue for wedding.",Sugaylange
30,Small and Simple,"The church was tinier than I expected in spite of it being called a chapel. When inside the views were mostly upwards and actually felt a little claustrophobic to me. I think some of the trees actually were too overgrown and took away from the visual expanse. We arrived before a scheduled wedding, so we were fortunate that we were able to go in at all.The church grounds were lovely, and to me offered more space for reflection than the chapel itself. All in all, I'm glad I went there, but I certainly would not make a special trip just to see the chapel.",VEC24

50,Amazing-Budget Travel's Top Pick Too!,"While planning a spring break trip, I had read on Budget Travel about Wayfayers. It looked beautiful online and I can tell you that the online reviews and pictures do it no justice. First, we went on Palm Sunday, which meant that there was a reenactment of the final days of Christ that was wonderful! The actors were fantastic, the scenery was beautiful, and everyone was very welcoming. The chapel and gardens are wonderful. Do visit the visitors center for some information and a potential postcard. There is no charge, but donations are accepted. If I lived closer, this would be my church home!",TravelerJenny8
50,Gorgeous Chapel!,"Wow! I can't think of a more beautiful chapel than this. The openness of the chapel poised on a bluff overlooking the Pacific is just spectacular. Do watch the calendar though because if there're weddings or baptisms as in my case, the chapel is closed to all but those guests. I'm going to spend more time next time coordinating my visit so that I can see the interior of the chapel. Oh, and there's a nice visitor center just adjacent to the parking lot.

50,So lovely and peaceful!,"Our kids and grandkids have recently moved to this area so I have been having lots of fun exploring! I had heard about the Wayfarers Chapel, and when I finally was able to go in person it did not disappoint! It is somewhat of a circuitous drive to get here, tho a most lovely one along the cliffs overlooking the bright Pacific Ocean. As you will read in other reviews, the architecture is noteworthy for a reason -- it was designed by Lloyd Wright, the son of Frank Lloyd Wright. The chapel is tiny by all measures, yet so grand in beauty and spirit. I just happened to come at noon on a Wednesday and was immediately drawn in by the large sign in the parking lot announcing Wednesday noon prayer service. I hurried up the path to the chapel, enjoying the ferns and lush growth under tall redwood trees. One could not help but be aware of the sparkling ocean spread out below, a truly breathtaking setting. The service was led by a young and pleasant pastor. There were on this day only a handful of attendees, but all participated in sharing a prayer request. One feels so strongly the presence of God in this chapel so close to nature. All the walls and the ceiling as well are constructed of glass, so guests truly feel the power of nature surrounding them. After the service I had but a few moments to further explore the property and do very much want to go back. Be sure and not miss the lovely gift shop on the uphill side of the parking lot. The staff there were very friendly and helpful. This is a very sacred space you do not want to miss!",travelgirl93463
50,Stunning Church with awesome ocean view,"This chapel (seating capacity of my estimate of +/-150) is an extremely popular site for weddings. The church is known to locals as ""The Glass Church"" for it's wood, stone, and mainly glass architecture. The grounds are a gorgeous display of grass, plants & trees, and with the ocean and Santa Catalina Island as a backdrop, brides and grooms couldn't do better for having their wedding pictures taken right there on the grounds. The church is definitely off the beaten path on the south side of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, with only Palos Verdes Drive South as the access road, but this isolation definitely adds to the charm. If you are interested in having a wedding here, contact the Church ASAP. Trust me, this is the most gorgeous and romantic spot for a wedding in Southern California.",USC_Trojan_Fan_90275

50,"Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!","My wife and I married at The Wayfarers Chapel and visited recently on our 25th anniversary.

The ocean vistas, the swaddling trees, the quietude.Don't be put off if a wedding is taking place. Stroll the grounds and enjoy the views until the ceremony is over, then witness the wonder of the chapel interior and the magic of the golden sunlight through the windows.Even if you think you have seen enough cathedrals and churches to last a lifetime, this one is worth going out of your way to visit. You'll be glad you did.There's ample parking, but some of it is on lower levels which require a bit of a climb.One quirky sidelight of your visit is the road south of the chapel -- Palos Verdes Drive South. For a mile or so, it goes up, down and sideways, a result of constant earth movement in the area. The city tries to keep up with the repairs, but occasionally you'll see a center line that looks like it was painted by a stumbling drunk. Have your camera handy.",JTMRPV
40,If you're in the neighborhood......,"The ""Glass Church"" is a fascinating structure, but very small for church. It seats maybe 100 at most. The church, the setting and grounds are well worth a visit if you're in the area, but nota sufficient attraction by itself to justify a trip to the south side of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Having said that, on a nice day it's a very scenic drive overlooking the ocean. You could include the Glass Church with a stop at the Terranea Resort and the Point Vicente Interpretive Center. There are picnic tables beside the Center.This wasn't a ""visit"". I live on the Peninsula.",roadready75
50,Wayfarers Chapel,"The secret to understanding and therefore appreciating at a higher level is to remember that this is a Swedenborgian chapel; one of the very few in the US. Several hundred years ago, this blend of orthodox Christianity and Norse paganism was created. It is the gods of the woods dressed up in Christian garb. This is why it is in the woods and covered withy trees -- a rarity in this part of SoCal. That is, it is not just beautiful, but also deeply meaningful. I doubt the wedding parties care, and the church does a good business in renting our its chapel. But to go there in an ""off"" hour and be alone in the surroundings might help you see the gods of the woods around you.",Peedropal

40,Beautiful chapel/gorgeous setting,"Lovely chapel designed by Lloyd Wright, son of the more famous Frank Lloyd Wright. One of his finest creations. Serene setting along a beautiful coastline. Worth the stop if there is not a wedding going on.",galapagoer

The stop there is well worth the effort.The Chapel and grounds are well maintained and amidst incredible coastal views and terrain.My daughter was married there years ago; all went very well.The site is well suited for many to see and enjoy the grounds and surrounding areas, as well as the views of Catalina (Island) and the channel and more.",PVJOE
10,"It's pretty, but there's better spots to see","I live fairly close and decided to visit with my BF who was in town. It's a nice spot, pretty gardens and lots of trees, but nothing really extraordinary other than a chapel made of glass panels. I think there are better spots to visit than this in my opinion.",Tracy C
50,Spectacular,"The Wayfarers Chapel on the Palos Verdes Peninsula is a beautiful spot. Great vistas of the California coastline, with lovely gardens and lawns. Surrounded by mature trees, it is like being in a forest glen. Lots of native Palos Verdes stone compliment the glass structure, and the interpretive center built much later matches the design of the chapel. This is a very popular spot for weddings so if there is a wedding in progress, your access to the chapel will be limited. Well worth the drive.",MsLBL
40,"Beautiful spot, bit of a strange reception","The chapel and the surrounding are beautiful, and include a cooling fountain on a hot day (a lot of those in LA). Could not go in as they weer having one or more weddings - that part seemed like a bit of an assembly line. But is is well worth the stop to see the redwood and glass chapel and the views.",Donquixote218
50,A chapel like none other,"Personally I've always found chapels a quicker way to connect with my spirituality vs the business of church's. on top of having a healthy respect and love for nature, this chapel has both. My husband and I were married here, really feeling connected with our environment as we not only gazed into each others eyes, but allowed our gaze to fall on the outdoors as the chapel is made of glass. Beautiful pines, birds, blue skies, what better backdrop for such a special occasion. We just recently went back for our 10 year anniversary. Nice little garden and beautiful view overlooking the bluff and water. You really shouldn't miss it.",Gigi G

50,Excellent Break from the Norm,"So we were new to California and needed to pick someone up at the Long Beach Airport. We drove down from the Central Coast, allowing ourselves enough time to check out the area before the plane arrived. We had a nice day, but the best part was this chapel. The setting is lovely and the chapel is gorgeous. The fact that we just happened up on it was even better. However, if I was headed back to Long Beach, ever, I'd be sure to put this on the itinerary.",Jane S

50,Fun to visit but hard to avoid a wedding in progress.,"They must do a dozen wedding in this place a day! But if you're a fan of Lloyd Wright architecture, this is a must see.

Everyone is welcome to join in with whatever service is happening, as there is no official congregation. This is an ideal and very popular venue for small weddings and the grounds are filled with lush gardens for perfect pictures. When a wedding is occuring, the public is asked to respect their privacy.There is a gift shop on the premises as well as public restrooms and free parking.",Violette54
40,Splendid view of the Sea!,"If you re touring southern california, this place is a must-visit. The cliff drive has several vista points lined up along. The chappel itself is on a small elevation which gives it more brownie points. The view of the ocean from here is fabulous and is a great place for photoshoot, weddings or just spend some time in the evening. The shore has many jogging tracks too. A mile drive towards east has a starbucks and a series of eat outs. Sipping coffee here looking at the ocean on a cool evening was just bliss!",bharathdude

50,There's more here than a view of the ocean,"First of all, let's call the architect by name, rather than saying that he was Frank Lloyd Wright's son. His name was Lloyd Wright.I was amazed one Christmas Eve, when I went for a candlelight service. It was chilly outside, but when I walked into the chapel, it felt warm and pleasant. I sat down in a pew near the outer wall and discovered warmth coming from the stones and the floor. Ah... radiant heat. But this was built in 1951! (It was dedicated on May 13, 1951.)I love the utter simplicity and the closeness to nature in this small sanctuary. It's open everyday and people stop in to meditate and to pray. I have done so on numerous occasions. I've brought visitors here and everyone has been enchanted with the serenity. We've all left smiling and feeling uplifted.The gardens are also lovely.",Ambersea
50,A Great Place to Take Visitors,"The trip to the Wayfarers Chapel is a bit out of the way unless you are visiting the Rancho Palos Verdes peninsula for other reasons. Relatives were visiting and I was running out of ideas, since we had visited so many tourist attractions in the week they were here. I took a chance and drove to the peninsula specifically to show them the Wayfarers Chapel which I had only seen from the outside a few times. I did know that it was often used for scenes in TV and movies, and that it was designed by the son of Frank Lloyd Wright. We were absolutely delighted at this serene and beautiful, mostly glass, structure. It is breathtaking and we snapped tons of pictures of the interior, exterior and the stunning ocean views from the front of the chapel. To add to our pleasure in visiting the Chapel, we dropped by their little gift shop where the most delightful salesperson (English accent) engaged us in pleasant conversation. We hadn’t really expected to buy anything, but to our surprise they had some very unusual items that were very reasonably priced (e.g. candle snuffer in gold or silver, several varieties of charming dinner bells with angel motif, etc.). We purchased some great items. The Wayfarers Chapel is now on my list of places to take visiting firemen.",FrequentTraveller034

40,A must-see with gorgeous views of the Pacific Ocean,"The ""glass church"" is a must-see for out-of-town guests and a high-demand location for local weddings. Gorgeous views of the Pacific Ocean, a beautifully maintained garden, and the unique glass infrastructure is surrounded by leafy trees.There was a wedding taking place when we went to visit, so we couldn't enter the church itself. But it's made of glass anyway, so you could still peep in a bit from the outside!",I-Lin L

50,Stunning,"Not only have I visited and re-visited this architectural wonder, but my husband and I got married at the Wayfarers Chapel in 2006. The visions of Frank Lloyd Wright are clearly visible in every piece of this building and it's surrounding property. Nestled in the hills not far from other touristy items, the Wayfarers Chapel provides a quiet respite away from the hustle and bustle. Take the time to just sit inside the main Chapel and watch how the light dances across the building. Nature's beauty is all the decoration this Chapel needs and it has plenty both inside and out. The grounds are pleasantly manicured and the rose garden is gorgeous when it's in bloom. As far as our wedding went - the staff had their act together. There were no hitches and we had a fantastic wedding.",Sheeba912
50,Inspiring beauty,"This architectural jewel, all glass & wood, sits overlooking the rugged coastline of Palos Verdes, and is used for religious services and weddings, but is open for tourists. The gardens, fountains, reflecting pools, endless fragrant rose bushes make for a peaceful, thought-provoking meditative walk. Surrounded by trees, the views from the hillside change with the weather.... fog-shrouded like a Japanese painting, or radiant with color on a clear day. I think attending a church service would be profoundly beautiful, with the sun coming through the all-glass Chapel. Wayfarer's Chapel is a must-see for those of any and all faiths.",sandytravelbug
50,A Place of Beauty and Clarity to Sing a Wedding,I was asked to sing a song in the wedding ceremony for a young couple who after twenty years found each other again. The Chapel is an awesome setting for the momentous and deeply personal exchange of wedding vows. The view of near trees and garden and distant ocean and clouds somehow focused attention on the here and now of their decision. And the glass enclosure (or non-enclosure) contained and clearly and warmly directed the music (and my song) to all therein.,HelloImMike
50,Beautiful View,"An absolutely beautiful chapel--the architecture is amazing. Not just for church-goers, but for those who love architecture also. It was a beautifuly clear late December day with a great view through the trees of the Pacific Ocean and Catalina Island. Take a few minutes to see the grounds. Quiet and Peaceful--enjoyed it thoroughly!",osusieq
40,"Beautiful, scenic chapel","This is one of the most beautiful chapels I have ever seen. The entire structure is encased in glass, which makes you feel as if you were still outside, even though you are inside the chapel. The landscaping is also wonderful. Large trees surround the structure, giving you a feeling that you escaped into a secret grove.Wedding ceremonies are extremely popular here because of it's beauty and isolation; couples have to make a reservation over a year in advanced.Would definitely recommend for any visitors who are interested in seeing an example of simple, pure architecture in an otherwise manufactured city (LA).",wilmargrainger
