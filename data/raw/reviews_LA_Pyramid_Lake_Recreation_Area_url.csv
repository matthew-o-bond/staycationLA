10,Go somewhere else,We went out to the lake today with my family and enjoyed it until a police in the water was being so disrespectful to everyone one not just us and honestly it ruined our day because we did nothing wrong and he did even try to act nice it was disrespectful from the beginning. You would get better service at other lakes than this on !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/953emelym
40,Great place to stay and play.,Near a huge ATV park. Great single and group sites available. Camp host has firewood available for purchase.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolr583
20,Baby leeches,The first time that my family and I went there had a great time! The water was warm but the second and third we decided that was the last one!! There was baby leeches that stuck in our foot!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angelgirl1214
30,a good stop on the way to somewhere,"this was an interesting stop, you can only really do the visitor centre as there is not much else but it is interesting and the views afforded from the centre is breathtaking. My 12 year old daughter enjoyed the visitor centre as it reminded her a little of the Miraflores Lock in the Panama Canal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Denise3012
20,nothing to do here except visitor centre,we were expecting to participate in on water activities with our tour but only had a 20 min stop. location it self is beautiful and information centre very interesting. otherwise nothing here- no refreshments not even a drinks machine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrWendyNZ
30,Looked nice but road down to lake was closed,"Visited one day in late Nov 2017. Had planned to do/see more but road down from Visitor Center was closed, possibly due to Thanksgiving? Visitor Centre was open, v good info re water management. Toilets. Ample free parking. Good view of lake from balcony. Free telescopes. Bit of a shame that I-5 runs so close beside the edge of the lake ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polymoog
30,beautiful lake,This lake is beautiful and has a friendly staff. I launched a zodiac boat here and had to go thru some quagga mussel inspection first. I met all requirements and was able to launch successfully. There is a small island in the middle of the lake near the damn. Can be windy in some coves but protected in others. There is a ton of moss making it difficult to fish the shallows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3044XHcharlesg
40,Quick dip,"We stopped in for a quick dip on our way home from a six hour trip. The water was relaxing and it was quiet. However, there was algae in the water and it was on my body when i got out. Maybe swim if you have a way to rinse off?....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler916_530
30,"Scenic lake, multiple recreation areas","The main rec area is co-located with the Visitor Center pull-off from I-5. It's worth a photo opp although the rec activities might not be staffed/open. There is at least one other recreation area further north, but we didn't have time to explore it. The Visitor Center is excellent and worth the stop. The lake is quite scenic, especially from the elevated parking area lookout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
40,"We've always driven past, but this time we stopped to check it out.","We had some time, so we stopped into the Visitor Center at Pyramid Lake about 1130 on a Monday morning. We were one of a few visitors present. The views of the surrounding mountains and close valley were spectacular. The informational plaques were in excellent condition and very informative. For instance, I did not know that the old highway 99 runs right down the middle of the lake canyon. There are some telescopes available ( no charge) so you can visually explore the hillsides. when we get a chance, we will do some day camping there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donald988
20,Ok for out in nowhere,Dirt and gravel but nice pull throughs. Only recommend a one night stay - nothing there but a great Mexican restaurant about 10 miles north,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeckyK181
40,Nice break from driving; prety water,"Driving from the Los Angeles area to Bakersfield isn't a terribly exciting drive. We weren't in a rush and so we took the turnoff for Pyramid Lake. You can camp or day camp there, but we just went for a short break from the highway. The water is pretty; it's a quiet area, and the weather was very pleasant. Stopping off here is a nice diversion from just looking at the cars in front of you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StuartGustafson
50,Love the water conservation teachings,I saw the blue water and needed to stop. This is a stunning small lake right off of the freeway. The museum is small but packed with free education.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwenbraum
50,Lunch break stop off,Driving from Anaheim to Monterey we stopped here off the highway to have a picnic lunch at the visitors centre. What a view! Nice and shady too a welcome relief from the heat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/45caroliner
40,Cool lake for a hot day,"I went to the Vaquero Beach section of Pyramid Lake with my son for some Father's Day kayaking and had a really great time. I've driven by this lake many times on my way in or out of Los Angeles and always wanted to check it out. We finally decided to visit because my 7 year old has taken a liking to sit-on-top kayaking. I did my research online and found this listed as one of the few places within about an hour of Los Angeles that rented kayaks (Castaic Lake and UCLA Marina Aquatics Center being the only others I found).It was so nice being out on the water, even though it was over 90 degrees F. We drifted along, letting the wind move us, until we hit the northern end of the arm we were on, then paddled back. After, we spent at least an hour swimming in the roped off beach area.I found the rangers to be extremely helpful. They were initially reluctant to let me put my son in a kayak by himself (they seem to still be working out the rules). I understand their concerns, as it does get windy, and I wound up having to tie the kayaks together and tow my son back to the dock when we were done. They said they used to have two person kayaks, but didn't know why they weren't available anymore.There's a about a 20 foot band of underwater grass growing just off the shore, which is pretty awful to try to paddle through. Further out it gets easier. There are also enough motor boats cruising around that we were rocked by a small wake several times.Bear in mind, our experience only covers the Vaquero Beach area, and not Emigrant Landing or the campground.Overall, a fun outing. I'm tempted to come back and try some of the trails, or go camping. The lake is quite stunning to behold.Fees are $11 for day use, $2 to swim at the beach, and $30 for a two hour boat rental. The rangers also sell ice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/o_nate_o
