50,Worth the tour,"If you are lucky enough to book a tour of the Stahl House, it is worth the time and money. This is an extremely well-organized process and not only do you see a beautiful, well-maintained home, you see a beautiful view of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJHBLLC
50,A must see,"You must visit this amazing building if you have the chance!You might think you can get similar views elsewhere, but the building itself enhances the breathtaking surroundings into something you will never forget.We had the sunset tour and most of the time was spent in silence, just trying to get every second of the magical experience into permanent memory.I can't even imagine what it must have been like to live there, if just 1,5h felt like a reset for you brain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hampstershark
40,The most famous house in America,"If you don't know what you're looking at, you might not enjoy yourself here. Was slightly disappointed the house is basically a huge advertisement for DWR, but it was cool to be able to sit on the furniture.The house is privately owned by the family, not a foundation. I wish them the best in their restorations and hope to see the whole house back to it's ""original"" state one day.. especially on a sunset tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faceofweed
50,An Icon of Midcentury Modernism!,"I just had the pleasure of visiting this iconic home yesterday and it is truly something spectacular. I can understand why this place gets sold out in months in advance as you feel like a king or queen walking on clouds when you take your shoes off and explore the property.The home was built from 1959-1960 by architect Pierre Koenig and is one of the Case Study houses (this being the 22nd in the series) built to try and create more affordable housing for the masses in the international modern style. The guide had a lot of good information to provide and even offered water bottles for everyone which was nice since I was pretty thirsty at the time.I enjoyed being able to sit in the furniture and getting some great photos of the breathtaking city views and minimalist interior spaces!Parking is very limited so keep that in mind, other than that, enjoy this LA landmark!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
10,cant get them to return a phone call or to book a group .. completely useless,"i emailed them and then called and left a message about booking a group.. heard nothing in 2 weeks.. then tried via facebook and the person had no clue what they were doing gave us dates that didnt fit and were arrogant about me not getting back to them after them ignoring me , waste of time other better places to see in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rouens
50,In Love,"I just fell in love with this house the moment I entered the door . A classic example of Midcentury modern . Breathtaking views .Our guide was so knowledgeable and welcomed us like it was his home we were encouraged to sit on the furniture and nestle in as if we had come for a visit . The Stahlâ€™s had such vision to chose this site and build their family home , still owned and used on occasions by the family and their friends . You must visit this home if you love architecture or design .Iâ€™ll be back for a night visit next time .I want to find a block and build again , donâ€™t tell my husband lol ðŸ˜‚",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coppeliatingley
50,Amazing. Sign up for the Evening/Sunset Tour if you can.,"Not usually a big fan of midcentury modern, but this house-- and this site-- is the exception. We had a truly memorable visit. It was, by far, the best house tour we have ever been part of.Tours are by local architects and Stahl family friends, who know the living history of the house. More importantly, our tour guide was both considerate and hands-off. There are a few clear and reasonable rules about what not to touch or photograph (note: only cell phone photos are allowed). Otherwise, we were free to wander as we wished, and to spend as much time as possible just taking in the house and the view. Our guide made sure that everyone had a chance to take photos uncluttered by other people in the tour. Plus, tour groups are limited in number, so that the house never feels crowded.We had high expectations for this visit, and our tour exceeded them. Sign up for the evening tour if you can; it starts in sunlight and ends in darkness, giving you the very best of both worlds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DelD
50,I will remember this tour as long as I live.,"I will remember this tour as long as I live. Andrew our tour guide was just brilliant. I loved the fact that he actively encouraged us to relax into the house and sit down to absorb it all- if we wanted to. After a good look around I did just that. It was magical to see the light fade and streak the sky pink and mauve and watch the city lights twinkle below as the sky turned dark -and to see this all in a 180 degree panorama. You are in a most modern house and yet feel totally connected to nature. Stahl house has a wonderful feel and despite its precarious at the top of the world, the house feels peaceful and safe. As I sat there it felt as if time had stopped. I could imagine being there for days - in my dreams! It is a simply beautiful house- small in terms of square feet, but a titan in terms of architectural design. It feels both lived in and stunning. Andrew was the ideal tour guide. He said â€˜ask me anything' and â€˜stop me if I go on as I am very enthusiastic about Stahl Houseâ€™. He certainly was but in a completely responsive way to the group. Andrew was very â€˜presentâ€™ and enhanced our experience, never lecturing, but instead offering jewels of insight in response to everyoneâ€™s questions. He was very quick to notice when you noticed something. When I look at gorgeous photos I took on my mobile phone I can feel how it was to be there again. Thank you Andrew, so much, for offering such a great and felt experience. And also thanks to the family too for letting us see inside. Wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateCanoe
50,Spectacular,As a fan of mid-century Architecture I had been keen to see this house for some time. It did not disappoint. The house is so photogenic and the stories from our guide Andrew were detailed and gave great colour to the visit. And the views.....wow. I can highly recommend the 6.30 tour as you see the house and the views in both daylight and night time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMKFT4
50,Architectural tour,"I was totally enthused that I finally got to visit this iconic house. Otherwise known as Case Study House 22, this residence is perched high up on a bluff in the hills above Weho. I enjoyed the experience bigtime and can recommend it to any fan of mid century modernism.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuartcs2017
50,A Must-See For Architecture Buffs!,"I learned of The Stahl House (Case Study House 22) on an MCM Facebook group I belong to. As fortune would have it, we happened to be planning a trip to Los Angeles, so I knew right away that a visit here would definitely be on our agenda!First thing... reserve early because dates sell out! Second thing, once you're booked, do yourself a favor and don't rely on Waze or Google Maps to get you there. We ended up being about 10 minutes late because the mapping apps couldn't reliably get us to the house. You get driving directions when you book your tickets, so print those out and follow them. Much easier.There are only three tours a day and when I say ""tours"" I'm being generous. There's not really a ""tour"" per se -- you just walk from room to room admiring the design and simplicity of the home against the breathtaking backdrop views of Los Angeles.Because the house is so small, they limit the number of guests who can schedule at the same time. There were four of us friends who went, and when we arrived, there were 8 others already there. (Remember I said we were late?) Yeah.Anyway, they only allow you to park in the carport / driveway and it only holds four cars, so you have to assume about 16 is the max capacity for any given time slot.Randy was our docent and he was lovely. He did a great job of briefing us outside the house about important safety info such as, ""If you step off the concrete and into gravel you might fall off the mountain"" and other helpful hints like that. My goal is always not to die on vacation, so I paid close attention.Before allowing entrance to the house, the docent also reviews the many guidelines of what you can and can't do on the property regarding photographs, etc. You have to read and sign liability waiver, a photo release form and agree to all the rules before you go in. After being there, I completely understand why there are so many rules and why no children under the age of 10 or pets are permitted as it truly is a safety issue. There are no fences preventing someone from falling off the mountain.Once everyone has signed the waivers and rules forms, you go into the pool area through the carport door, where you immediately see the iconic view of the side angle of the house and roof line. At that point, the docent has already asked everyone to wait a few minutes before approaching the house so that each person can have the opportunity to take photos of the house from that vantage point without any people in the shot. Take your pics NOW because someone will invariably just wander into your shot and then you've missed your chance. You can see in my photos what I mean.After that, you approach the house, where you are asked to remove your shoes and then you're free to go inside and wander. There are a couple areas that are blocked off as ""private"" areas where you can't go and believe me, there's no sneaking in there either because the place is so small and totally made of glass, so everyone will see you!After about 30 to 45 minutes of oohing, aaahing, milling around admiring everything and taking photos, the docent will gather the entire group in the living room and give you a full history of the property, talk about the Stahl family, how the house came to be, and answer your questions. Tidbit: The house is furnished by Design Within Reach, so if you fall in love with the looks you can buy the same furnishings.What I loved about choosing the latest tour of the day is that you get to see the house and the view in full daylight, at sunset, passing through twilight and in complete darkness. To me, that was like getting more than one tour because the house looks and feels different in each light.Daylight tours are $35 each, however for the late tour we paid $50 a head, but at some point I assume the price will go up, as all things do. The evening tour is, IMO, well worth the extra money.You have to come here with a mindset of SLOW. If you've ever been to that ginormous house in Asheville NC where it takes you 90 minutes just to see all the rooms, be advised that The Stahl House is the POLAR opposite. It's small, so you can walk every inch of the permitted areas in about 3 minutes. The point isn't the size of the home or the length of the tour, it's the history of the family and the house, the design elements that will never be able to be duplicated again because of government regulation and intervention and the sheer beauty and daring of the architecture and ideas behind it. If you're a fan of architecture, particularly midcentury modern, this is a must-see when you're in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FoodieMonica
50,Breathtaking,"I was the +1 on this adventure but tell you what... it is absolutely worth the effort in booking in advance. A privately owned house this experience is beautiful and not commercial. The guide was perfect and more of a host as you imagined living a mid century Hollywood dream.There a few rules on arriving by car or taxi, we did the latter with no issues. Whilst the afternoon tour was bliss, our guide said the early evening provides the best of both day and night with the student casting shadows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AussieAlex1985
50,Don't Miss this iconic house,"Be sure to make reservations as soon as you think you may go as this iconic house in the Hollywood Hills as it books quickly. The story of the purchase of the land as well as the history of the Stahl family is fascinating. If you have the least bit of interest in architecture, this is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C134FWmichaelk
50,Stunning!,"If you want to see an amazing view of LA this is the best secluded place to do it. You need to book well in advance but the pre planning is worth it. An uber cost $7 or 8 dollars from West Hollywood, but make sure you take the printed driving instructions with you. The road forks and you can easily miss the turn off. The tour guide was incredible knowledgeable and answered any questions. We had time to take it in ourselves and learn about the house. I did the afternoon tour and want to go back to for the evening tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annieh743
50,Stahl House should be on your LA list!,"If you love architecture, photograpy, design, and city views- this is the dreamy place for you. We visited as a private tour and it was so worth it. I could not get enough of inspecting the Stahl and I just sat there in the chair overlooking the city of Los Angeles, basking in the thought that I was ON THE GROUNDS!!!! It was also exciting to be standing where Shulman shot his famous iconic photo. If only they could rent the house out...and yes, it was easy to book tickets online. Do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kala28
50,Stunning house,"I cannot say enough about how great this visit was. Our guide was the daughter in law of the Stahl family, she was perfect - full of family anecdotes and facts about the house. The house itself was absolutely beautiful. Note cameras are no longer allowed (but cell phone photos are fine) and booking well in advance is essential.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauranada
50,Stahl House - On top of the World!,"Today was a marvelous adventure, perfectly suited to my tastes! My last Uber ride of the day was taking my rider to The Stahl House in West Hollywood. I asked about that and found out that it was a house museum from the mid-century. We started talking about architecture and she saw my interest and said that she had a spare ticket, if I wanted to come to see it. Did I ever! I told her that I would drive her home off-Uber. It was a challenging drive up to what seemed like the top of the world. The view in all directions was even better than the one from Griffith Park Observatory! This Mid-Century Modern was by Pierre Koenig, architect. There is absolutely no privacy in this house, it's all glass. It's only 2200 square feet and has been appraised at $15 million dollars! No one but the Stahl family has ever lived here. The kids used to jump off the roof into the pool! The floors and the pool have radiant heating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambersea
50,A must for architecture buffs,"If you say you're going to the Stahl House, most people will look at you quizzically. If you say ""Case Study #22,"" you may get some glimmers of recognition. If you say ""the house in the Julius Shulman photos,"" people will know. And, of course, as soon as anyone sees it, they know it.Aside from the superlatives stated elsewhere (stunning house, yes. great views, yes. knowledgeable and friendly docent, yes.), here's some other info:1) Yes, make a reservation online. The coveted late afternoon tours are booked a month to two months out.2) Only cell phone photos are allowed and you will sign a waiver saying you will only use the photos for personal use (Facebook and Instagram is okay).3) Frank Lloyd Wright's Storer House (not open to the public) is along one of the streets on the way up through the hills to the Stahl House, so that is worth a pause and a peek.4) If you are hardcore into mid-century mod and Randy is your guide, ask him for directions to the Bailey House (off of Wonderland), Case Study #21 and one the Stahls had seen, which was up for sale (for a cool $4.2 million) when we stopped by, so we just wandered around that property, too.5) I would not bring children.6) If you only care about views, save your $40 and hike Runyon Canyon Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhyllisFP

50,Awesome House,"If you are into architecture, design or photography, you definitely need to visit this house. It doesn't really have any impressive architectural history or anything but the house is very nice. It has amazing view to LA and very nice and delicate interior design. If you are in LA, you definitely have to go see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandra_Quintero

50,Stahl house,"Excellent experience. Randy, the guide was brilliant. A must see to all architecture fans. Parking was available for about 4 cars. We were at the house for about an hour or so, which was just about the right amount of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/823sebl
50,One man's dream,We spent the week doing multiple architectural tours of Hollywood and Beverly Hills. The Stahl House was the last destination on the bucket list and was beyond spectacular! We booked the evening tour to catch the sunset and it was worth it. The views are stunning as is the house. Kudos to the Stahl family for making the location accessible to the public. The docent gave a very nice summary of the history and was readily available to answer questions. We were the first to arrive and last to leave (parking is at a premium on site) and spent some additional time with docent talking structural details. It was and is a great tour. Would love to open a bottle of wine and sit on the ledge all night!We booked on line and were fortunate to get a sunset tour. This place is a bit challenging to find ( several people were having problems getting Uber to show up). The only downside to the sunset time is the return trip down the twists and turns back to Sunset Blvd. Be careful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCS_TX
50,Breathtaking!!,"I once read about `Case Study Houses in LA and thought about visiting this particular house, never could I imagine how impressed I would be. It is totally amazing, the views are incredible, and the house is simply out of this world, I would say it is a must",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristianePedreiro
50,Architecture and views that you won't soon forget,"Wonderful tour and plenty of time to browse, inspect and enjoy. Small house , huge views and simple design that will inspire you to dream of your own project! Reserve your space early. We tried to get the sunset slot and got the late afternoon time. No problem though, as the sun got lower, the light got better. We also lucked out with a pretty clear day so our views were impressive. In our group of approximately 12, there were at least 4 countries represented. Nice! On of our best outings during our week in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F4691RBgregc
50,Breathtaking beauty in house and view!,"Asolutely stunning house and panoramic view of Los Angeles.Go early evening to see the house and environs in daylight, sunset, and the nighttime twinkling city lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dance4fun2
50,Incredibly worthwhile!,"OK. I was a little skeptical that this was going to be worth $35 and the intricacies of making it happen. (You need to get tix in advance, the house is in the winding streets of the Hollywood hills so not the easiest to find and there is a 15-30 minute window when you can arrive before your tour which is not the easiest thing to orchestrate in busy LA traffic.) But all of that said, this was a highlight of our trip. The house is basically 2/3 windows and has a wrap-around view of the entire city and out to the ocean. You get to walk around the house and pool area, take pictures of anything you want, sit in the lounge and pretend you are a LA billionaire. And then, Randy or whoever your tour guide is will give you an ultra-informative background of the house, how it fits in with modern architecture, who were the people who built and lived in the house and answer just about any question you have. Very impressed and would recommend this to anyone interested in architecture or who has a sense of adventure! You couldn't even build a house like this anymore as building codes would prevent it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WiTraveller608

50,UNFORGETTABLE!,"En route from LAX to Modernism Week in Palm Springs my adult daughter and I were lucky enough to procure tickets to tour the amazing Stahl House. Lucky us!If you appreciate architecture, especially that of architects and owners ahead of their time, history in the making, make sure to visit this home. Despite being a hazy day, the vistas are stunning. Living in a glass house, on the edge, bathed in light and color and privacy, dipping into your pool whenever, this remarkable structure will remain with you forever.The foresight, the hard work, the quality of materials such as the original glass doors, and the flow and ease of living in the thoughtful spaces makes one want to stay forever. Kudos to the entire Stahl family and thanks for sharing this gem.Want your breath taken away? Make a reservation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenGr
50,Amazing Architecture Icon,"To get a chance to visit this still family owned home you must plan ahead, go to their website pay the fee and find this gem of a house that has been featured in countless magazine ads and films. It was the dream of the father of the current owners. And what a dream! The views and the architecture are fantastic. If you are a fan of mid century design it is definitely worth the effort to find it. The tour is brief but infomative. For the remainder of the time you are allowed to wander in the house and patio, take pictures, sit on the furniture or just enjoy the amazing views. The house is not large, there are no railings; this is not a place for children. Parking is extremely limited. But again, if you are intrigued by the photos then you should make the effort. It's amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skip1951
50,A unique way to spend an early evening in L.A.,"As a fan of mid-century modern design, visiting the Stahl House was a meaningful experience. As a person who loves to visit L.A., visiting the Stahl House in the Hollywood Hills was, simply put, a really cool thing to do.We chose the early evening time to visit and got to see the sun set and L.A. come alive with millions of twinkling lights. The greater than 180 degree views are amazing.Our docent was friendly, informative, and made for a relaxing visit. The other guests were respectively quiet.There are two metal chairs situated outside near the pool but at the edge of the property. Sitting on them for 10 or so minutes in the quiet, with the sun setting and the city below, made for a zen-like ethereal experience. Not something easily achieved in this city!We will definitely visit the Stahl house again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeljames101
50,A Singular Architectural Experience,"For any admirer of mid-century modernism in architecture, this is a rare opportunity. No photograph--even Julius Shulman's--can match the three-dimensional experience of the diaphanous 8' by 10' plate glass enclosures, the rational and highly articulate structure, the drama of the hilltop site, and more than anything else, the centrality of the swimming pool. The story of how Mr. Stahl conceived of using the almost unbuildable site for a house that was to be about the views and how, as an architectural client, he knew very much how to achieve that, is important. The docent did not lecture, but rather, let us occupy the spaces and then engaged us in conversation--almost like having a seminar or afternoon tea (the tour graciously provides cold, bottled water). I left feeling as if I'd had a singular architectural experience and also had been a very fortunate guest in a family home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulg910
50,"Definitely worth seeing, even if you are not an architect","Beautiful 270 degree views of the LA area, a historic 'modern' home, small tour group (12 people), and a well informed tour guide. Great place for photos (can only use camera on your smart phone).We toured the home during the late afternoon and would like to see the home at sunset/evening next time.Lots of architects from all over the world on the tour - but we are not architects and really enjoyed the tour.It's not cheap ($35/person), but the money goes to support the ongoing renovation and costs of keeping the Stahl House open to the public.

40,A modernist masterpiece,"This house is such an american and L.A. icon, that it is impressive to see it in person.The house is small, and yes there are some rooms that are off limits, but the experience of visiting the site is still really wonderful. We attended a sunset tour, so we were able to see the transformation of both the house and the city below from sunset into dark...The cost of the tours is quite high, though this is well used to preserve and upkeep the house, and the number of visitors is strictly limited per group... so you can get the nice ""archi-photos"" that you want without hoards of people in the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/canswiss
50,Overjoyed,"Absolutely worth your money! It was only 70 for 2 and our docent, Scott was brilliant and he's actually the main guide and he preserves the place alongside the children. He allowed all of us to enter the 2 off limit bedrooms and even opened the other sliding door at the most left corner of the house.Our tour was at 5:30pm and we are asked to arrive by 5:20 for the briefing outside. We were 17 and only 2 from the group lived in LA, the rest were Europeans, Australians, Asians etc. As you enter the gate, you instantly feel the uniqueness and character of the home. He toured and told us stories for about 20-30 minutes and the rest of the period we were allowed to roam freely around the place.Elated and would do this again in the night time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelicag728
50,Amazing place,"There's no better place to see a fantastic view over LA, this is a truely unique and worthwhile experience. The admission price was completely worth it, it's lovely that the family open up the privately owned family home to the public. We did an evening tour which was perfect to see the day, dusk and night light.Our host was a member of the family and made us feel really welcome. It was nice to get an insight into how the Stahl family have enjoyed living in the house over the years. The personal touch was really appreciated and you get the feeling that the house is really well looked after.Some tips: Get there early to park outside the house rather than on the road, we didn't need our print out on the day (the host had a list of bookings) and be ready to take off your shoes. Also have a read up about the history of the house beforehand as on the day it's more about looking around and getting a sense of the place rather than a 'tour' as such. There were articles spread out for you to read but mostly you'll just want to soak up the atmosphere of being in this magical spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/starr187
50,LA magic - one of the best things to do in LA,"So good I almost don't want to tell people about it! The more people who go, the more strain on this piece of wonderful LA heritage. The good news is that LA is getting better at valuing it's past, and so we get the chance to see places like the Stahl house. Fantastic architecture that has stood the test of time. Part of the Case House program, a wonderful contribution to domestic architecture. Stunning views down onto Sunset Boulevard, looking across the houses of the rich and famous. Great service and knowledge from the docent. Intelligent, adult tourism. For a really interesting perspective, head down to Sunset after viewing the house and spot it on the hilltop as you look up - it's not easy but adds to the understanding of what the house is and it's place in history/LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJTSmith
30,A beautiful house but an average tour,"The house in itself is beautiful. It's great to be able to tour this house you can see in so many commercials and photoshoots around the world.However the house is pretty small and you can't go in some rooms that are either closed or under renovation...Also, I found the tour guide we had was not really into what he was doing. He kind of just let us there wandering around the house without giving any explanations or anecdotes about the house. Even though most of us knew what the house was about before visiting, I'm sure that some people, who pay $15 each for visiting, would enjoy having some insights on the house, rather than just being on their own not really sure where to go, and being replied with an undisguised feeling of disdain when they asked questions.Go for the house, but be prepared before the ""tour"" so that you know why, where, when, how the house was designed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Williamhi

The views are absolutely amazing, the house is pretty cool itself and the people that run the tours are very kind and very knowledgeable. We did the afternoon tour which was spectacular in itself. On our next trip, we will do the evening tour...its just that cool that you need to see it twice! The afternoon tour lasts one hour. During that hour, you get to act like you live there. You can take photos, sit on the furniture or hang out by the pool. The drive up to the house is amazing as well.

50,The Most Famous House in LA,"I just did the tour last week. First off, if you're an architecture fan, this is a must see. Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater is often referred to as the most famous private home in the world (that's not a palace or government mansion), but Stahl House is surely Los Angele's most famous home.My local friend and I took a 2:45 weekday tour along with six other folks. We arrived a few minutes early, parked in the carport as told to in the website instructions. Eventually the other six folks showed up and the docent came out to greet us. He gives you a brief safety speech and tells you the rules (which are pretty lenient), then you step in the gate to the pool area.Like almost everyone that does the tour, I was overwhelmed by the view when you first walk in. The main house is across the pool and you can see right through it, the bedrooms to your left, and a 270 degree view of the city below you. It was a very clear day and you could see Catalina Island almost 50 miles away.You can go into the house after removing your shoes, take all the pictures you want but only with camera phone, and the areas you are not allowed either for safety or family privacy are clearly chained off.I had thought that Mrs Stahl was still alive and living there but she actually passed away in 2011. The three adult children now own it although none of them live there, in fact the pool man who was there when we arrived (and left without speaking to any of the guests) was the eldest Stahl son.The docent Randy was very jovial, he gave one 5 minute or speech on the history, and we spent more in private conversations with him about the house and other related architectural things. We were there for about 90 minutes before being told our time was up, plenty to get a total feel for the place.Like Fallingwater, there will never again be a house like Case Study #22 built again. Regulations, building codes, lawyers, all transpire nowadays to make such a vision possible. It truly is an icon of the optimism of Los Angeles in those times and is in remarkable good shape for being 55 years old.I will likely go back again on a future trip, I'd love to do one of the sunset tours where you get to see the lights come on in the city below.PS: You can actually see the home from Sunset Boulevard below if you know where to look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottS129
50,Pilgram,"Our visit to the Stahl House was purely opportunistic and incredibly fortuitous! As an architect I go out of my way to visit such landmarks and we're thrilled that I was able to get to visit the Stahl House, My wife and I were in LA basically on an extended stopover and booked it the day before. We were so appreciative that the guide was available and squeezed us in. We were rewarded with the most magnificent time. The house is stunning, the story behind it was fantastic and it was brought together by such an enthusiastic guide. I have not stopped recommending to every architect I meet! Plan a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/El_Jefe_Especiali
50,THE VIEW!,"Perhaps the most photographed home in the world, this mid century masterpiece perched atop one of the hills looking down on LA, is beautifully maintained. The view is absolutely spectacular; words canâ€™t describe it. You have to book for a tour and I was lucky to have a family member take and talk us through the home, which is furnished in mid century classics. I loved wondering through the rooms, looking at the details and hearing about the family that had the foresight to build this landmark, designed by Pierre Koenig. Worth every cent of the tour cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seatseeker
40,Outstanding views,"The Skinny:More like 3.5 starsTickets - $30pp, reserve onlineParking- up to 4 cars in the driveway, after that good luck on the narrow streetViews- OutstandingBe Prepared- you will have to take your shoes offRestroom- small bathroom, not private (door doesn't lock) and it's part of the tourMy cousin was visiting from New Jersey and wanted to check out this iconic house so we went on a hazy LA day. You will have to fill out a legal form before the tour. If other people are late you will have to wait for them before the guide begins. You are given a brief history of the house then you can roam the house at will.You must take your shoes off inside (but the guide doesn't)You can not enter one of the bedrooms, you can take pictures from the threshholdYou can not go on the deck from the living roomYou can not take any pictures of the materials on the kitchen counter or personal photosNO VIDEO!You can use the strangely decorated bathroom but be advised, it is not private and the door doesn't lockYou are allowed to sit on all of the furnitureIt was nice to just sit on the furniture and enjoy the viewThe sliders were open and you could feel the breezeHopefully the pool sweep won't be in the pool on your tour to ruin cool photos of the houseSome of the info the guide gave out seemed suspect (pertaining to the engineering of the house) but if that's not your bag then don't worry. Is it worth $30? Probably not, but if you are into LA History and want to see a cool looking house with a view then go for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melobeam
50,Buck Stahl's dream,"Lovers of Midcentury Modern architecture will know the black and white photograph I am thinking of: Two young women in cocktail dresses are sitting in a corner of a glass box perched over the Los Angeles basin which appears as straight lines of streetlights extending to the horizon. When I got the chance to visit the Stahl house during full moon I jumped at the chance and I am very glad that I did. The house is regularly open to visitors, and while it was the most I have ever paid for an attraction ( $90 for one car/one driver) it was well worth it.I won't take up space with the history of the house. Instead I will tell you about the visit. You need to reserve one of the very few spaces in advance ( the house is small and the parking is even smaller). You wind yourself up the Hollywood hills on Woods Drive and stop in front of a unassuming housefront which gives no hint about how your mind is going to be blown once you step through that door. What awaits you beyond that breezeblock garden wall is a breathtaking 270 degree view of the Los Angeles Basin--it is as if you are hovering over it in a low-flying aircraft. The house itself, basically a glass box, competes well with the view: Simple and small, it uses its unique setting perfectly.The visits are well arranged because a knowledgeable docent is on site to answer any and all questions, and there was no objection to staying three hours to enjoy this unique house during day and night.Because of changes to the structure since the time Shulman took the famous picture it is tough to take your own version. But there are plenty of other pictures you can take to capture the feel of this masterpiece. One particularly beautiful modern photograph appears on the cover of ""Los Angeles Modern"".You will have enough time to learn the story of how Buck Stahl, the original owner, built his dream house. And when you leave, you will find yourself musing about one's dreams, architecture, and the peculiar beauty of this megalopolis which one always misses when driving in its flatlands.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelhos
50,"LA Highlight, without a doubt!","Other reviewers have pretty much captured how amazing Stahl House is. I went with a group of friends for the evening session so was fortunate enough to see the house in daylight and as the lights came on over the LA skyline. You really feel like you have free range of the house, even though you are in a group with other architecture fans (there are a few rooms off limits but one you can see from the pool but just can't enter). Randy, our guide, was friendly and very knowledgeable about the history of Stahl House and it's family. As the sun sets, the music goes on and you sit back in the stunning living room or by the beautifully lit pool, about the only thing missing was a martini or glass of champagne!! Having been to LA a number of times, this was the definite highlight on this trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AyJayJ498
50,A privilege to see this amazing home,"We took the chance to visit Stahl House on a stopover in LA before heading back to Australia. No photos can do it justice, you just have to visit to soak up the view and the amazing modernist architecture. Our guide was helpful and informative and the home was surprisingly ""open"" to us, in fact we were encouraged to sit on the furniture and make ourselves at home for the hour we sent there.Highly recommended for architecture buffs as well as anyone with an interest in property and amazing views of LA.Tip: if you're planning to visit Stahl by taxi (you're not allowed to ""walk up""), then print off detailed Google maps directions to give to your taxi driver, it's not a well-known tourist attraction in Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockDoctor
50,A MUST FOR MID-CENTURY MODERN FANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a beautiful home! I have seen this home in multiple fashion shoots for years and always, always wished to be able to visit it. I was so thrilled to locate it online and learn that guided tours are offered. We visited it on a recent late Saturday afternoon. Our knowledgeable and very personable guide was a member of the family still owning the home. She was a great guide, told us lots of information about the building of the house and about the family. Visitors have an hour to wander around this beautiful house and the pool, and marvel at the breathtaking views. The late afternoon sunlight gave the city a glow. The original bathroom is absolutely not to be missed! The remainder of the house was attractively staged by Design Within Reach with pieces reminiscent of this era. There are copies of books and news articles about the house to read. From the directions, I was afraid that the house would be difficult to find, but although the streets were narrow, steep and winding, it was not hard to locate. Nice to see a number of other interesting houses on the trip up, but none can compare to this one. Ticket proceeds are used to fund ongoing renovations and repairs. I cannot remember when I have enjoyed a house visit more and I hope to be able to return on a future visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BooKat
50,Conquering my husband's fear of heights...,"Was not the object of this visit, but nevertheless an added bonus. Amazing views of the city and a great story about a regular guy who wanted to build a glass house up on a forbidding rock. Lots of movies and printed ads have been done here, bring your camera so you can pose like a celebrity!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aimeedbaby
50,An architecture you must see in LA.,We booked an afternoon tour. Due to the busy traffic we arrived 10 minutes late. Luckaly the guide waited for everyone to arrive. We could roam around in this exceptional house for one hour and the guide answered everyones questions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lany57
50,What a joint!,"Be prepared for a steep, winding drive deep into the Hollywood Hills -- stick users take note! The pot at the end of the rainbow is this landmark home overlooking the whole of Los Angeles, and a sublime place it is. Was lucky enough to come when one of the Stahl offspring was there, and it only added to the great experience. Take a late afternoon tour if possible; if you can manage to hang out for a little bit, you'll see day drift into evening and get two magnificent views for the price of one. Don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steve10011
50,Amazing Architectural masterpiece above LA,"This home which is located in the Hollywood Hills is beautiful and open to the public by tour. Built in 1960, it should not be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/402dougd
50,Stahl House or Case Study House #22,"I always love famous architect photographer, the late Julius Shulman's portrait of the ""Case Study House #22"". I grew up in Asia and had no idea where the house was. Never even imagined I would be in it!Not even when I moved to Los Angeles in 2007. Coincidentally Julius Shulman passed away that year which garnered a lot of publicity. That revived my interest in the house which led me to the wonderful discovery that LA is full of iconic Modernist homes by famous architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, Richard Neutra, Rudolph Schindler, John Lautner and of course, Pierre Koenig. I can't believe they were all here in one place!So my husband and I were really thrilled to visit the Stahl house in Aug 2013! I had trouble with the website and would you believe it, I received a personal call from one of the sons, Mark Stahl! He grew up in the Stahl House of course. Really helpful and sweet.We lucked out again on the day of our tour. Steven Slomkowski, who is making the Stahl House film was there. His film entitled, ""Nobody famous ever lived here' was a quip from home-owner Bruce Stahl or more fondly known as Buck to friends. The film will be released in fall this year. Steve was warm, funny and charming and kept us entertained the whole time. I must confess he did steal the thunder from two seasoned docents, John and his wife, Lynn (spelling?).The house was kept in pristine shape. A mere $37,500 today but it was a lot of money then in the 1950s to build a single family home (one could build 3-4 homes then for the same amount). But the glass and steel design home on the precarious spot was the dream of graphic designer Buck and his wife, Carlotta. You can see their passion when standing at the edge of the pool - an expansive view of the famous Hollywood hill with Chateau Marmont sitting prominently below. Was told you can see Catalina island on a clear day, usually in Fall. Husband-and-wife team, John and Lynn kept feeding us intimate information about the house.You are given free rein to walk around the House, except for the children's room and the master bathroom. It's a glass house so you still get a full view of the children's room standing outside the glass panels. Note:- you need to remove your shoes before entering the House.The House does run evening tours which promised to be even more spectacular with Hollywood all sparkly and lit up. We will definitely be back for a different experience.It was easy to book a tour @ www.stahlhouse.com $50 for one person and $60 for two and so forth. The money goes to the maintenance of the house.Now the downside. It was tricky navigating the narrow and winding roads up Hollywood hill. Read the driving directions and parking instructions. Seriously. There's not a lot of room for parking. Try to squeeze your guests in one car. Let them know in advance if more than one car is required.No food and drinks allowed, though bottled water was provided. Yes, you can use their tiny toilet behind the kitchen.The tour feels like visiting old friends in their home. A great way to visit an iconic home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soletosole
