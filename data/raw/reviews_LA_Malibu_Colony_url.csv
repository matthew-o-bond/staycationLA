50,A fantastic place to live,"Nice neighbours, excellent view (of the Pacific; and they call it that for a reason), and suburb resale value (secure appreciation).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avidtraveler5
20,Unreal Life Styles,My wife and I knew some people who lived here and we were frequent guests and visitors down here in the 1980's and early 90's before we escaped California to Arizona. We have someone in our lives now who lives here and lost the entire sand beach in front of the house. Sometimes the sand comes back after a storm. For them that is a problem of magnitude but nothing compared to loosing your entire home to fire as what just happened to many in the area. On our November visit it was a cold early morning so we took a look and moved on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardS778
20,"Be honest, would pay $12m - 15m for one of these places?",Doesn't love up to the image created by the movies or TV! I simply can't believe that anyone would pay so much for these properties with their fixed view of the sea. It's a crazy world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nrf565
30,Nice place for a sunset walk but make sure the tide is out,We stayed close to this beach and decided to walk the beach at sunset however it was high tide and it was time to get our feet wet. It was interesting to see the surf colony of stilt homes albeit looking a bit shabbier than the heyday of the 60s and 70s.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonythebedouin
40,Great views on the Malibu Pier,"The Malibu Colony is made up of a few wooden stilt houses on both sides of the Malibu Pier, whit a more gentle Ocean on the North side of the beach which makes for a perfect place for surf beginners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ochassot
50,You have to know a resident to get in,This is a gated private community you can only visit if a resident puts your name on the guest list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
40,Charming,We are considering the colony the town and it's still full of old timers and while comercial it's still real.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vonschmidt
30,Not the best beach in Malibu,"Over-crowded, trashed, and dirty feeling I cannot recommend this beach. The water had a tinge to it. The beach name by locals is ""old malibu road beach"" just right of the colony. The waves are big for boogie boarding. There isn't much of a stretch between the crash and the beach though (not a long ride into the shore).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catv2014
30,Only out of curiosity,"Not that you get much chance to see it fully unless you live here as it is a gated community but like most people, curiosity got the better of me. Fascinating to see from a distance and didn't get to see any celebrities but interesting enough to make the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
30,Just another gated community-- it's living on its fabled history.,"The colony is now just another gated community----it's living on its fabled history.Malibu is filled with celebrities and many aren't in the colony anymore. The mystical-vibe of the colony is from yesteryear. There are many more tech and corporate raiders/owners/financiers than celebrities. More 2nd homes than primary residences.No entrance-- it's gated and guarded. If you really want to see it, use google earth or tmz.The best view is from walking the beach at low tide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
40,Don't be Surprised!!,"Don't be surprised as to who you might run into here. Cindy Crawford, Robert Downey Jr., and a host of other ""Beautiful People"" at the local grocery or Starbucks shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LetsGetOut
40,Sand of the Rich & Famous,"Fun to look ""At"" but you can't go in or see anything but the beach exposure of the houses. Parking is a challenge, but doable. Nice to do Once, then it's out of your wish list...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,Aplace that moviestars live but not accessible to the public,Access from the beach and good for house browsing but it cannot be accessed through the gated entrance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom734
30,Nothing authentic,"If you are not interested in people magazines and movie star legends, you will find nothing interesting there. It is very artificial.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sipivu
50,Paradise,"Paradise on earth with a Ralph's grocery store! Great beaches, movie stars, cool houses, and Malibu Seafood down the road! Great sunsets, whales, dolphins, it's a pretty cool place. Johnny Carson used to live there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maria44Tucson
30,Nice little neighborhood.,"A friends sister lives in the Colony by Heath Ledgers House as well as Halle Berry. The places are right on the ocean but there extremely close together, and i thought some of the houses were not kept up all that well. The security guard was very friendly and the Colony is very close to Geoffreys where you can have a nice dinner, or lunch. I highly recommend that place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bward27
40,"Malibu, nice place to drive through","I was born and raised in Santa Monica and when I was a Senior in High School, I owned a horse that I kept at my friend's house in Malibu. I drove from SM to Malibu each weekend to go riding, and back in the mid-60's the drive along the cost was wonderful. I was just back for my 50th HS Reunion and made the same drive from SM to Malibu. Lots has changed in those 50 years, but the beauty of the ocean, beach and lovely homes long the road are the same. If you're in the area, don't miss this drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TucsonGrammy
40,Upscale,Malibu Colony Is an exclusive area with some of the more expensive beach houses along PCh. When visiting a business friend the people next door were celebrities having a small get together. Everyone seemed to be having a good time. Park carefully!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyNYLA
30,There is No Such Thing as a Private Beach !!,"I'm afraid I'm a firm believer in that no one person can own a beach ! Everyone has the right to stroll along the Ocean Front and dip their toes in the surf ! It's the first law of nature !! But apart from that I found the colony to have a lot of spectacular properties with the same outlook , the mighty Pacific O !! There was also a lot of run down ordinary properties and the public areas were unkempt and a lot of refuse ! Don't they pay their rates/taxes ? The funniest thing for me was the multitude of luxury vehicles Porsche, Rolls, Aston's, Ferrari's, Lambo's etc, all parked outside as space is at a premium , it appeared as more was spent on cars then upkeep ? I'm afraid that there is a lot more scenic parts of the coast then Malibu even if Charlie might disagree ??",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skeney57
30,Have friends here... Nice homes but overrated,"The homes can be gorgeous!! The colony common areas are dilapidated, guard houses that look like they are ready to fall apart...I get it, it's Malibu...I live here too, but still like more of a well groomed lifestyle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/599yolandaf
50,"If You Can Get In, Great!",The Malibu Colony is a strip of PRIVATE BEACH that is located north of The Malibu Lagoon and south of where Malibu Rd. touches the beach. The beach was actually called The Malibu Movie Colony in the 1920s as that was where a number of stars had homes. The same is true today but they guard their privacy. If you are lucky enough to get invited past the guard gate. GO! The sand is clean and the views spectacular. There are no public facilites so plan accordingly if you try to walk in from either side.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/445ChrisR
40,Beautiful location in the hills,Awesome place to visit and feel far enough from the craziness of LA. Calabasa is beautiful and an awesome place to not only visit but to live.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zzixor1
