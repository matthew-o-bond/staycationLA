50,Unusual place to see big cats,Enjoyed the tour and the range of wild animals. The tour lasts a little more than an hour. Not recommended for young kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgenis
50,Warms the heart!,"It's wonderful to know, and truly warms my heart, that these beautiful and majestic cats are being well taken care of. It's unfortunate they cannot be returned to the wild, but nice to see they're comfortable. They have room to walk, stretch, things to jumps and climb on, and play with. Tippi is doing a great job for the benefit of these cats, and I know my donations are being used wisely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Climber773426
50,Must Visit,"Acton, California is a wonderful location for this wildlife preserve. Plan on spending at least four (4) hours at this beautiful location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/normac333
50,"Visit Here, It's Purrrrrfect!","I highly suggest visiting the ""Roar Foundation; Shambala Preserve"" in Los Angeles county, CA. You'll see tigers, lions, cougars, bob cats, and more. They are in large open natural secured enclosures, not like a typical zoo! All large cats were rescued from private owners, circuses, small horrible zoos, and/or brought there after being injured in the wild. Most of your entrance fee goes to the animals since it's a non profit org. They have a great gift shop that sells cool things too. Former actress, Tippi Hedren (google her if you're under 30) lives on the premises and started the foundation for large cats. Many times she talks to the tour groups and poses for pictures as well! Must be 18 and older to attend. This place is PURRRRRFECT!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grantf847
50,Like Herding Cats: Tranquil Preserve for Large Cats,"Beginning in 1972 after filming a couple of movies with wild cats in Africa and formally created in the 1983, Tippi Hedren has created the Roar Foundation, which supports Shambala Preserve. The approximately 40 acre property in Acton, CA (about 50 miles north of Los Angeles) has large enclosures for various wild cats. Lions, tigers, cougars, leopards, serval, bobcats and others are all housed in huge enclosures (many times the Federal limits for zoo animals), where they rule. The animals are not ""shown"", but you may or may not get lucky enough to see them walk around, eat and drink or just sleep. The goal of the Preserve is to provide sanctuary to exotic felines, while strongly advocating against any breeding, buying, selling, trading or commercial use of these large cats. Tippi in fact co-authored a bill to discontinue large cat breeding in the United States, that became law in 2007. This protects these wild cats from being bred in captivity, since the ""pets"" just end up in captivity or enclosures. Thus, public education is a large part of their mission. The volunteers and staff are quite serious about the rules (Jessca Howard and Chris Galluci were part of the animal crew, along with several volunteers), and thus the title: Like herding cats! Stay with the group; don't bend down; don't go near the fences; you and your camera must be >4 feet away from the nearest fence at all times; when you are told to move, move! However, all of these guidelines are what allow the animals to remain as undisturbed by the humans as possible. The preserve is only open 2 weekend days per month for tours, and thus you must book well in advance. The cost of entry is a ""donation"" to the charity, and thus goes towards food, enclosures (one enclosure costs >$160,000 to create), maintenance, and insurance (the latter a not insignificant cost given what they do!). After the tour of the property, you are given time to speak to the game warden (Chris), and then Tippi comes out for a meet and greet, and answers questions about her experience and love of wild cats. You arrive at about 11:30 and have completed the experience by about 2:30. Comfortable shoes (it is dirt and gravel throughout) and long pants and long sleeves will keep you free of sun and insects damage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lestertheinvestor
50,Tippi Hedren’s Lil Bit Of Heaven!!,"Really a “unique” place to visit!! If lions and tigers and bears are your thing this is the place to go! Tippy Hedren was the star of Alfred Hitchcock’s ‘The Birds’ And she’s made its her life‘s work to help those animals who have been abandoned neglected aged out of the Hollywood animal community, to be able to live out their lives with dignity! Tippi actually lives in the compound with a house full of Ligers, That’s a cross to create a lion and a tiger and they’re adorable but do not touch! You’ll get to see the animals being fed by their keepers and also you’ll get to bring your own picnic lunch on some picnic tables that are off in the far west of the property! The only sort of disturbing thing that happened is that these tigers and lions are chained up closer than 20 feet from where you will eat your picnic lunch!! Well it’s a Great lunch but you can’t help but think that maybe one of these grand & proud beasts will break free and try to eat you for lunch!! LOL! So my suggestion is if you’re ever in the Acton Palmdale or Lancaster (greater Los Angeles area really) that you take a day trip to Shambala Preserve. The kids will really enjoy being so close up to such. A lovely place to keep animals, you don’t get this kind of experience at the zoo!!!You might even catch a glimpse of Melanie Griffith, Tippi’s daughter!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USATraveler2012
50,Large Cat rescue,"A once in a lifetime experience. Join Tippi Hedren for a tour of the tigers, lions and much more at the preserve. You can bring a lunch for after the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaP3161
50,Wonderful Experience,We had a great visit to Shambala! Reservation book out at least a month prior to your visit as they are not open to the public every weekend so you must book early. The big cats are in large enclosures unlike any zoo.Wear comfortable clothes and shoes and keep in mind it can get very hot and not much shade so use sunblock and bring water. At the end of the walking safari everyone brought a packed lunch and ate together. Tippy Hedren even came out and spoke about her journey to get to Shambala! We were fortunate enough to get to meet her and she is an amazing woman who does such great things for these animals. We will go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toril976
40,Tippy Hedron's Preserve,You need to make a reservation but a very unusual place to visit and see large cats. We went for a birthday party for an adult.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janmaweber
50,Shambala is a Peaceful Big Cat Preserve,"When I visited Shambala for an afternoon Safari tour, I was pleased to see the wild cats were housed in large enclosures (and not small enclosures).The surroundings were peaceful, green, well-maintained and clean. I wore tennis shoes for walking, and brought a packed lunch and several bottles of drinking water with me (because the weather was hot). There is a small gift shop on-site, but no dining cafe. So, I ate my packed lunch near the little lake on the preserve and enjoyed the quiet surroundings.The wild cats looked healthy, although I'm sure they would prefer to be free in the wild - their true home. I saw lions, tigers, leopards, servals, bobcats, and a cougar. We were cautioned to not disturb the cats, and everyone complied with this request, without any problems. Everyone enjoyed themselves at Shambala and everyone was KIND to the big cats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/surferdoc
50,Amazing,This is a.place everyone should visit. The big cats are just beautiful. Tippi has devoted herself to the well being of the animals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamD791
50,Great place,I have been to similar places where the cages were very small - this was nice with large pens where the cats could roam around - I was able to get some great pictures & we enjoyed the visitLes7h,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Les7h
50,Amazing experience...,We had a private tour of Shambala with some friends who are very involved in the Sanctuary. Our guide Chris was amazing. He was so informative of all the animals and their habits. The animals were so beautiful and to be that close to them (4 feet away is their rule). Since we have never been to Africa this is the closest we will ever be to these exquisite animals. Shambala does such an amazing job in saving these wild animals and give a lot of love to them all. They have sunset safaris and weekly tours which you have to reserve in advance. It was the most memorable experiences we have ever had. Thanks to our friends for giving us the opportunity to experience this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraS803
50,Truly a sanctuary,"My daughter (22) and I visited Shambala this past Sunday, it was my Christmas gift to her. When we first arrived, we were a little concerned, because all of the cats seemed to be sleeping in their boxes. But we were happily surprised to see many of the big, gorgeous cats during out tour. There is clearly so much love and care put into this place. It was fascinating and my daughter wants to work there when she graduates from college! They operate purely on donations and the generosity of Tippi Hedren, the founder. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves big cats and supports efforts to protect them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spitty1963
50,Excellent Effort,"An excellent effort to preserve select exotic animals and provide an educational environment. I would recommend for anyone but particularly sedentary people and children, as most areas are easily accessible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCCowgirlLosAngeles
50,“Shambala Preserve”,I visited Shambala about 20 years ago and it was so memorable I was on a private donors tour and got to meet Tippi Hedren and she conducted a personal tour for us she is a beautiful person and what she does for the big cats is a true passion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louieh657
50,Fantastic preserve for big cats,"I've visited Shambala both for the regular afternoon tour & most recently for the sunset tour. Both tours are excellent; but I recommend the sunset tour (it's a little more expensive). Even on a triple digit hot summertime day, the cats were up & about much more at the later time. We even got to stand right next to Zeus's enclosure as he started to do his evening roar! At the end of each tour Tippi talks to everyone about what they do & answers questions. If you're on the afternoon tour you can eat your picnic lunch after the tour & the sunset tour provides a light dinner. The preserve seems to be well run, and all the animals have good sized enclosures with lots of enrichment. I highly recommend any big cat fans come for a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PurplMyst
50,Shambala Preserve,These magnificent animals survive only through the devotion of staff who dedicate all of their efforts to rescue from ill treatment and ignorant handling. What a blessing that this sanctuary exists - but a crying shame that it is needed at all. Website clearly explains the Preserve's mission and opportunities for the public to learn and share.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanWeston
50,Great fun,I had a wonderful visit. It was fantastic to see the big cats in a safe and healthy environment. I attended the afternoon safari. The docents were telling us about an evening safari that is supposed to be even better. Well worth the price and drive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsT7320UP
30,The advertising was misleading.,They say its a safari and you go there looking for one but come back disappointed.All the animals are in cages and its a walking tour of a zoo types. They tell you how they protected each of these animals.They probably show you some 10 Tigers/Lions and not more. It was a lot of hype for nothing I felt. We were driving from San Francisco and after a 7 hour drive we expected something nicer.They are open only during 1 weekend of the month so you have to book way early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krits27
50,Wonderful Home for Rescued Lions & Tigers,"I am amazed at how wonderfully cared for the animals are at Shambala. If you love cats, especially lions and tigers, then you must visit. This sanctuary for rescued wild cats is run by actress Tippi Hedren of Hitchcock fame (and mother of Melanie Griffith).TOURS: Tours are given only 1 weekend per month on both Sat & Sun. They book up in advance, so be sure to reserve early.The day we were there, they divided about 50-60 people into 3 groups of 20 or so visitors, each led by a docent. The docents tell stories of how the individual animals came to live at Shambala as well as interesting facts about big cats.You are required to stand 4 feet away from all enclosures - for the animals' safety.Plan on being there 2-3 hours. The tour lasts about 2 hours, followed by a BYO picnic and engaging talk by the Director. There is a picnic table grove alongside the lake where everyone gathers.BRING: Sunscreen/Hat. Picnic with drinks in a cooler or insulated bag. Camera.TOILETS on site are porta-potties.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunshineGirl2929
