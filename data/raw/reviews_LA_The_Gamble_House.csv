30,"Docent led tours, luck of the draw","This is a classic large Arts & Crafts, Japanese-influenced house by Green & Green brothers architects, built for heirs of the Proctor and Gamble fortune from Cincinnatti, who came out West during the Tuberculosis scare.Fascinating to see how thoroughly the ""bones"" of the house/ post& beam are exposed in this style of architecture, and the many Asian/Japanese shapes and touches throughout.The house is dim, dark, and ponderous, and I'd say much the same about the tone of the volunteer docent who led us through. There's a deadness to this place, which I wasn't expecting, as I'm a huge fan of Japanese aesthetics, especially temple architecture, and Arts & Crafts. There wasn't a single space where I felt ""Aaah,"" I'd like to sit down and stay.It was a cold overcast day, which might have influenced how I felt about it. You are encouraged to book the tour ahead of time ($12.50 senior, $15 regular) but the day I was there, at least a couple of people joined at the last minute. I believe the only way you can see the house is to join a guided tour. No wandering around on your own.",KATYBTRAVELLER
50,Truly a historic architectural home,This home of the Gambles is one of the best examples of a craftsman home built at the turn of the century.

We are in our early 60s for perspective. Such a treasure and delight. We have traveled the world and missed this masterpiece in our own back yard! If you live near Pasadena. Go. If you visit the LA area. Go. Skip Hollywood Boulevard and all the ultra touristy plastic. Go here.,OnTheRoadAgaininGlee

Definitely one of a kind for its exquisite use of wood throughout.After walking around and admiring the exceptional exterior, more delights awaited within. Numerous varieties of wood are used imaginatively to highlight varying colours, tones and warmth.As well as a marvellous museum, it was interesting to learn that two different USC students are annually granted full-time living space in the house.",permia
50,Be prepared to stand a lot w/out touching anything!,"Awesome part of history! 99K really bought a lot in 1908! This house is really beautiful inside & out! Stunning woodwork! If your into architecture... this is a must! Historically speaking very well worth it.If your deep into history & architecture? Take the 3hour tour. Way more intense & you get to sit down.If you have back issues, (Like I do...) it can be a challenging 1.5 hour tour, because you can’t even lean up against anything. It’s mostly all real teak wood throughout the home & your bodily oils will effect it.Still... Well worth the pain in my opinion!Back to the Future 1 was filmed there. So when you walk up to the property, take a look at the garage (Souvenir store now) & the house at the same time.You’ll probably remember it? It was the professors house where Marty told him about when he hit his head in the bathroom & thought about the Flux Capacitor.Very neat!!!Enjoy!",Chris D

50,Back to the Future at the Gamble House,"Tours are available Thursdays through Sundays and tickets can be purchased at the gift shop which was the original garage. This charming house was built in 1908 for the Gamble family as a winter retreat. The tour itself takes you into most of the rooms, all of which have original furnishings. The docent was knowledgable explaining about each of the rooms, pointing out architecture and stories about the furnishings. Known as the Doc's house in the 1985 movie Back to the Future - although only the exterior was used in the filming - we thought the tour was of average price and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our tour was just over an hour and you can mooch around the garden and gift shop for as long as you want to. the garden is public land.This would be one of the Must-See Places in Pasadena especially if you are interested in architecture and history.There is street parking albeit limited.",pinintheatlas
50,First rate,"Just a neat example of craftsman style, with wonderful woodwork throughout. You can now take pictures (though interior lighting is period, so clarity very much depends on the day). Full of detail, largely preserved in the family and brought back to original or close. the architecht in some ways (to my mind) was a FLW precursor, even down to designing the furniture :) I'll probably return someday and do the velvet rope tour, just to get closer to that woodwork! great giftshop, tricky parking - if you have a timed reservation, allow some time for that.",scott r
50,30 Years Worth the Wait,"The tour is very well done and after wanting to visit this very important architectural site for over 30 years, I was only sorry I had not come sooner. The detail is astonishing, but the history is even more interesting and the BOOKSTORE! Wow, how I got out of there with a second mortgage, I am not sure. Great, great collection. Only criticism, the pond needs an infusion of mosquito fish which you can get from the county. I made the mistake of stepping behind the bookstore to make a phone call and ended up with 11 mosquito bites on my hands. Ouch, but surprisingly worth it. Just don’t step back there!",KatrinkaSD

The guide was okay, nothing special and was only versed in a general overview. However, it sufficed but peaked our interest in the Green brothers other architecture, interior design and furniture design and when we visited the fabulous Huntington Estate the next day we were excited to see some of their work in the brilliant American arts museum and gallery there.

A certain highlight worth a trip from LA.",Sylvanian
50,Beautiful home with a fascinating history,My husband and I stopped in Pasadena just for this tour and we found it to be very worthwhile. The docent was knowledgeable and patient with our diverse group of 10 people. They’ve done an excellent job making the history come alive with stories about the home’s origins and the Gamble family. I highly recommend the tour but be sure to book tickets in advance unless your schedule is very flexible. I’ve posted a photo of the beautiful front door’s glass.,AnnArborMichigan

50,The Craftsman Jewel of Pasadena,"I've been going to the Greene & Greene Gamble House since the 1980s. It is the quintessential Southern California craftsman home. For this particular visit, I took a run to the house from Old Town Pasadena (about 1.5K) on Christmas morning. While everyone should take the time to take a docent tour of the interior, the Gamble House has so many fine details in its doors, windows, eaves, rock work, and joinery that a 360-degree walk around on a quiet day can be just as fun.",RH0s
50,Great architectural gem,One more architectural gem checked off my list. The tour of the Gamble House was great. The docent that we had was very good and she followed up with everyone's questions. The home and grounds are in great shape. It would have been an even better tour if the weather had cooperated a little better and was not rainy and chilly. The cost of the tour was reasonable and our family outing was one that the grandkids will remember.,archietek52
50,Astounding arts and crafts home,"I have heard about the Gamble House -- also known as the Greene and Greene house after the brothers who designed and built the house -- for many years. Nothing about it disappointed.It is a marvelous example of arts and crafts design. I found it dark because of all the wood, but the design and original artwork are fabulous. Lots of superlatives, yes, but none of them are unearned.The gift shop is a gem, too. Reservations are recommended, but we walked up for tickets and only had to wait about a half-hour. There are tours every 15 minutes, but the house is so big, the groups (very small, by design) do not end up on top of one another.If you are interested in architecture or the Arts and Crafts movement, this is a must-see.",nsmith2
30,Cave-like experience,"The Gamble House is a beautiful Craftsman house in a beautiful setting. There is a strong Japanese influence in the design of the house. Designed by Green and Green, the house is throughly curated and a wonderful example of how thoughtful design can transform space. That being said, in the interest of authenticity, visitors enter a very dark hallway because the lights are kept the same wattage as in Gamble's time. Other parts of the house are fine because of sunlight, but the stairs and entrance are cave-like. This seems like a disservice to both the house and the visitors.",_ivypruett
40,"Interesting, pleasant tour","I'm only mildly interested in architecture, but this is pretty interesting both in its own right and as an example of the Craftsman style.",Richard D
50,One of the first Craftsman homes. Awesome!,This is a great example of a Craftsman home. The attention to detail is amazing. Well worth a visit.

The guided tour was very integrating and the guide knowledgeable. The ground are also lovely. A well worthwhile place to visit in Pasadena.,CossyWombat
30,Some very interesting things to see...,"We got the feeling that there really was much more that could be done with this home. You have to sign up with a tour and we definitely felt rushed. The docent was obviously more concerned with staying ahead of the group behind us than making sure we saw everything in each room. She was borderline rude in pushing us along. That said, each room had interesting features and contents. If they would extend each tour by 30 minutes or offer self-guided tours it would make for a much better experience than we had.",Claude Y
50,A remarkable part of Pasadena,"When the Greene brothers were designing the Gamble House, they were creating a masterpiece of architecture. Made for one of the Gamble heirs to enjoy when in the west, this American classic is a must-see for lovers of homes.",michaelegray01
50,Entire Home is An Amazing Work of Art,"Today we toured the Gamble (as in Proctor & Gamble) Mansion built in 1908 in Pasadena CA. It is an incredible work of art with the minutiae of the design to incorporate natural light & ventilation, quality virgin wood, the ""joining"" of beams with ""pegs"" instead of nails and many other details that amazed us in a 110 yr. old home. Our guide Nancy was outstanding with 30 yrs of knowledge and expertise. Only 2 hrs from San Diego, modest tour fee and well worth the trip. Do make your reservation in advance to ensure a tour. My photos don't do it justice, but see for yourself. And spend the night in the area to also visit the Huntington Museum with related exhibits.",Bchgrl9

Our docent, Fred was very good and patient with all the questions. Be aware that there are three floors, so stairs to go up and down. Photos are allowed, no flash, no videos.

50,A Masterpiece of Early 20th Century Architecture!,"I went on an hour-long tour with a friend and it was a wonderful experience! The tour didn't mention this but you might be familiar with this place as the home of Doc Brown from Back to the Future! The Craftsman architecture from Greene & Greene feels both grand and cozy at the same time and it feels very open and expansive compared to most houses at the time (built in 1908). The neighborhood it resides in is also lovely as it features lots of trees and other homes from Greene & Greene as well as Frank Lloyd Wright!I noticed there are a lot of Japanese influences in this home, particularly in the beautiful nature decorations and wooden beams. The construction is very organic and refined, being both traditional as a reaction to the mechanical processes of the Industrial Revolution and in a way forward-looking because of its consideration of efficient air-flow and lighting.The glass work is also incredibly unique and is a great representation of the Arts and Crafts movement popular back then. There is such great attention to detail throughout, from the sloped driveway which prevents rain puddles, the extensive use of windows to increase air-flow, and the variety of different woods being used like oak, maple, and mahogany.There is a bit of congestion in the house when having to dodge some of the other tour groups but other than that the tour is very well run and the docent gave us some fascinating information about this lovely home. The Gamble House is a work of art and is a true landmark of Pasadena and Southern California in general that everyone ought to make a reservation and see for themselves!",Colby S
50,Wowza!,"You might read other reviews and wonder what all the fuss is about with Gamble House. If you care anything at all about design, architecture, history or aesthetics, don't miss this stop. The Gamble House is the premiere example of its style of architecture, and the miracle is that everything has been preserved, including the custom-built furniture.

The docent was very knowledgeable and the tour was most interesting. Will take visitors there in the future and recommend to my friends.",Sandra D
20,Disappointing.,"After all the hype, I really expected something more. Perhaps it was in the storytelling of our guide. Her knowledge of Pasadena history was very limited. My takeaway is that this is just a rich people house - look at my simple opulence, my imported wood, my fancy pottery, my Tiffany lamps, my old Persian rugs. There was limited discussion of the Arts and Crafts movement. There were no plans, elevations or drawings displayed of the architecture or construction. There was limited discussion about the choices that were made. The bathrooms were dismissed by the guide, which are really a statement of the time.There are many other choices for exploring Arts and Crafts in Southern California - the displays at the Huntington, the Hollyhock House, The Maloof House in Alta Loma.If you are determined to see every old house, you should go. If you are hoping to glean a little insight into design and construction at the end of the Arts and Crafts Movement, look elsewhere.",Erin J

40,Wonderful example of Arts and Crafts Movement home,"As a fan of the Arts and Crafts movement in architecture, art, and furniture, we really enjoyed our visit to the Gamble House. A beautiful step back in time, lead by a very knowledgeable and interesting docent. The house is very dark inside, due to the vintage lighting and the guide often used his flashlight to high-lite details. I would suggest taking your own small flashlight, if it is allowed. Quite a bit of stair climbing and walking, and not sure about handicapped access, but I'm sure a call could give you the details. Parking nearby was not a problem during our weekday visit. A great place to visit on your trip to Pasadena if you are interested in the art and architecture of the period. Nice bookstore with many art books and gifts. Recommended.",texasrepublichistory

50,Craftsman style architecture at its best!,"If you adore wonderful woodwork and fantastic details this is the tour to take. The docents fill you in on all sorts of tidbits about the history of architects, intimate details about family life. Makes you appreciate the old days-especially when you witness a new house being built these days. You can take photos as long as there is no flash because it ruins materials and pictures.",Kimpia

It was my third visit and I was extremely happy that they now permit indoor photos (without flash). The docents at the Gamble House are incredible. Each time I go, I learn something new about the house, the family, the architects. If you are a fan of architecture - and specifically Craftsman style architecture - this home is a must! Visit their website and make reservations in advance. The tour groups are relatively small - and during the summer the tours can fill up fast.",Gary
40,Very Unique,The scheduled tours last 1 hour and a led by a docent. First impression of the house was that it was dark. Made completely of wood with lighting that was dim compared to today's standards. The docent gave us the history of the house and the families that lived there. I was impressed with the balconies off the bedrooms that could be used for sleeping on hot steamy nights. Worth a visit if you are in Pasadena and have seen all the other major attractions.,wwjd1947
30,Beautiful home,"The Gamble House is unique and beautiful. There are plenty of beautiful craftsmen homes in the Pasadena area, and the Gamble House is another example. However, the entrance fees are pretty steep for what it is. It's great to be local and be able to see it once in awhile.",S L
40,Doc Brown’s House has amazing architecture!,"I finally made it to The Gamble House! As a long tine Back to the Future fan (this is Doc Brown’s House) I don’t know what took me so long! This is also part of the Passport2History program.The inside of the Gamble House can only be accessed via a docent led tour. Book early or online! We got there right before they opened at 11:30 and the first TWO tours were sold out! So I had to hang around the grounds for an hour with my 4 year old. Luckily, the grounds are beautiful so we split our tine between the bookstore, the garden area (which has a water fountain, my sons favorite thing), the Lilly pad pond (complete with waterfall and fish), and other areas in the yard.Our guide, Roger was fantastic. He did his best to keep my son engaged. Full disclosure, this isn’t one of the more exciting Passport2History tours with small children. But the tour itself is very cool. The house is AMAZING!I do think they price themselves a bit out of five stars. I’d say this would be a 5 Star attraction for a $5-8 tour. It used to be 12.50 for years which also would have been doable (especially after the Passport2History’s 10% off). But they’ve raised their prices to $15, which is a bit much for what this is compared to other similar museum values. They should consider going back to what it was.That said, it still gets a solid 4 star rating which I totally recommend people check it out! Any fans of wood will flip inside!!!",Michael T

It was so interesting to see how a wealthy family lived in their summer home near the turn of the century. The tour guide provided a >1 hour tour of this beautiful home, bringing out the architectural and interior details that make this space so special. I am so glad the Gamble family donated the property to the city so that the public could enjoy it in perpetuity.",Dave J

The #1 Greene and Greene home is privately occupied.",Andrew H
50,One of a Kind,"We took the 1-hour tour of the Gamble House last week. What a marvelous house and a marvelous tour. This house is the epitome of Arts and Crafts architecture and the Greenes put their hearts and souls into it. It's not just a house, it's a work of art.Our docent was amazing and had so many stories about the Gambles and the Greenes and the house that he could have gone for much longer than 1 hour. He was both entertaining and informative, a good combination for a docent. We both thoroughly enjoyed the tour and the house.We would return and take another tour next time: they offer a longer tour along with tours on lighting, on joinery and others.",Nancy F

You can walk through the rooms with original furniture and take in the beauty of architectural details crafted as wood furniture. The stain glass windows are breathtaking! The grounds provide a nice stroll. Incidentally this is where they filmed The movie, ‘Back to the Future’. The surrounding neighborhood has several Craftsman Style houses by same architects, also used in the movie. Worth a walk around the small block. Buy tickets at the detached garage (Doc Brown’s Lab in the movie) which is a terrific gift shop and book store. Free Parking is on the street out front.",516madelines
40,Interesting Tour,"All the tours to the Gamble House is escorted. You cannot view the house on your own. The house is interesting. What makes the tour really fun, is the history provided by the tour guide. The ""Gamble"" is the Proctor & Gamble, Gamble. He and his wife were very committed to nature and the house reflects the care in planning the layout. Caution - you need to ""reserve"" a slot. The guides are broken into one hour segments. The first day we went (in the afternoon) all slots were taken. So, we made a reservation for the next day. And, then, not all time slots were available ( sold out). I recommend going a couple of days earlier, make the reservation and then return.",DMUH
30,A Bit Darkish We Thinks!,"We visited the Gamble House on Friday, 22 Sept. 2017. There is free parking in front of the house and on adjacent streets. The house is in an excellent state of preservation with large rooms and dark woods. The thick, bold woodwork gives a ponderous feel as do the light fixtures, see photos. It was interesting to visit a house we have heard a lot about, but the darkness made it hard to appreciate the details and left a gloomy impression. This is the fault of the owner’s wishes, not that of the architects, Henry & Charles Greene. The tour also seemed overly reverential. Admittance is by docent lead tour only. Advance purchase recommended. Tickets sold in adjacent gift shop: Adults $15, Seniors (65+) & Students $12.50, 12 & under free.Did this review earn a “helpful” vote?",JohnAnnColumbia_MD
50,Such A Treat!,"This sweet gem was exactly what we needed for a beautiful Saturday afternoon in lovely Pasadena. Our tour guide Sylvia, knew every finite detail of this gorgeous home.

20,Craftsman home & furniture,"If you love craftsman style homes and into contemporary furniture, then this is a great home to tour. Built for the Gambles family of Proctor & Gamble as their retreat. The home is extremely simple and purely for architecture and design living (extremely minimalist). The docents highlight the features and designs purely of the home",Trendy_Explorer
50,"Magnificent house, a must-see in Pasadena but wait for a guide who speaks English","Much has been written about this splendid house, its architects and details. We won't repeat that, but will say that we love it and are thankful for the opportunity to visit and that it's been preserved and seems to be in great condition. A craftsman was making repairs during our tour; that's an encouraging sign of stewardship! Following are the complaints we had:1. In the darkness, it was difficult to see the wonderful details. The very small flashlight used by the docent was insufficient, especially for older people to see. We were cautioned to stay off the edges of the rugs, but in the dark, we were lucky to see the rugs at all.2. Regarding the docent, although she was enthusiastic and full of great and interesting information, much of it was wasted because we couldn’t understand her. She was soft-spoken and obviously English was her second language. We think it's admirable and great for her to have the chance to participate and show off a national treasure, but we and the other visitors in our group suffered because of not understanding half of what she said.3. We have waited years to see the Gamble House and traveled 3,000 miles for the tour. We’d wait for another tour guide next time.",Rachel F
50,An amazing piece of architecture,"Ever fantasize on what your dream house would look like? Don't know if the Gamble family did, but they sure got a home that anyone would dream of. It's not that the layout of the home is such a tour-de-force, though it is very comfortable; it's the attention to detail that the Brothers Greene brought to the individual rooms of the home that makes you shake your head in wonderment. The methods they employed in joining structural members that blended so beautifully with the surrounding woodwork, the artful placing of doors and windows, the serenity of beautifully finished woodwork throughout the building; it shows what a talented architect(s) can do to make a home a thing of exquisite beauty. We came away feeling that we had experienced the ultimate in home architecture.",DonaldYokum
50,Unique,"This is probably the best example in the world of a huge craftsman house from the early 20th century.If it could have been done more easily, they chose to ""do it right"".

50,Beautiful architecture...interesting history,"I needed something to do while my other family members took care of business during a trip here... this fit the bill! The history and architecture of the house was amazing. The house is very dark inside, which is very representative of 1908, so pictures may not turn out well (you cannot use flash photography).

50,Exquisite! Specialty tours highly recommended!,"We visited this extraordinary 1908 Arts and Crafts house museum with a group of like-minded folks interested in architecture. We were fortunate to have two specialty tours during our visit... ""Behind the Velvet Ropes"" (2½ hours; $45) and ""Greene & Greene Neighborhood Walking Tour"" (1¼ hour; $17). Both were excellent and highly recommended. You will need to plan ahead for both as they are not offered every day.The house is in perfect condition, and is kept that way by carefully guiding visitors through it. The docents are deeply knowledgeable and relay an infectious enthusiasm for the house and its history. I absolutely adore this place!Interior photography without flash is permitted but don't bother - most of the house is very dark and you will never get a good photo. There are beautiful books in the excellent gift shop with better photos than you could ever achieve.The docent-led neighbourhhood tour is recommended because, while you can walk around the neighbourhood on your own, the docent will help paint a historical picture. But even if you can't join that tour, do spend some time exploring the nearby streets - they are a feast for the eye!",jameskul
50,If you love the Arts and Crafts Movement...,"This is the place for you!Though originally started by William Morris in the U.K., the Greene Brothers built the Gamble House as the A&C Movement spread across the pond and made it to Pasadena.Beautiful hand crafted stain glass, wood carvings, and tiles decorate the home in the style of the California A&C movement and you will be dazzled by the downstairs of the house.",tvvvv2016

Designed by the architectural firm Greene and Greene, this home was the winter residence of the Gamble family. A docent led tour on a Tuesday took us through the downstairs where the art is the wood. 2 of the woods used are extinct, and one can see why with a tremendous amount going into this home. The carefully chosen accessories compliment the beautiful rooms. Spot the roses and cranes which are also in the owner’s family crest. A well stocked bookstore is the location to procure your tickets.",Nancy G
40,"Fantastic Arts and Crafts ""Craftsman"" Mansion","The house and furnishings are beyond remarkable. Fully furnished, right down to the original oriental rugs. Exceptional interior woodwork, even for the Craftsman style. One of the few, if only Craftsman-style mansions open to the public in the area. Designed, built (in and out) and furnished by Charles and Henry Greene, the best of arts and crafts builders around 1900. All handmade Craftsman-style furniture, and built-ins by the Greene builders. So good that the original 100-yeaar old Stickley furniture in the servants dining area and Mr. Gamble's original office was the ""cheap stuff"" at the time. Our docent was very engaging and knew everything about everything.Do not miss this. Five minute drive from downtown Pasadena. Almost walk there from the Rose Bowl. Just across the street from the Pasadena Museum of History.A perfect half day would take you to the Pasadena Museum of History and its Fenyes Mansion tour then an hour tour of the Gamble House just across the street.One warning - check the website or call to make sure of the type of tour offered on the day you plan to visit.

The magnificent stain glass window on the front door is three layers thick, creating effects not normally seen in stain glass. To tour the house is to be transported back to the early 1900s and world with different values than today. I've taken the tour probably 8 times and look forward to doing it again.",John W
50,Very Interesting House to Tour.,"The architectural details of the house were very intriguing. The story of the house is very interesting and our guide (the lady who trains the docents) was fabulous.It seems that we lucked out with permission to take photos without flash inside the house, which is generally not allowed. They were running a 90-day test to see how well that would work before they make a final decision. The house is necessarily dimly lit, but our guide brought along a flash light to highlight and call our attention to special decor and other areas that we should see.. She even kept the light on as long we we wanted for photos.Taking the official tour really gives you all the stories and assures that you won't miss any of the unique features in the house. It is a most interesting tour. .",iliketowrite

In order to preserve the home and the furnishings there are some rules such as photos may not be taken, high heeled shoes can't be worn and nothing may be touched. The tour lasts an hour. Given the guidelines I think that it would be very difficult for families with young children to enjoy the tour. The tour guide was wonderful and very informed.

Secondly high or pointed heels sandles are not allowed inside the house so better wear flats one. Third since its close to 1.5hr tour and one needs to be quite in group to listen to guide so it gets tough with babies and little kids to make them be quite for so long.

Be prepared to use the flashlight on your phone to catch some details as the house is lit with 7-watt bulbs to maintain authenticity of the times---though I am sure they would have upped the wattage if they could have! There are a lot of ""don'ts"" when taking the tour and they watch you like hawks to make sure you follow them. If you are wearing high heeled shoes you won't be able to wear them inside.

50,Architecture Review,"A visit to the Gamble House is a trip back in time to the turn of the last century. Architects Greene and Greene created this masterpiece for the Gamble family as a winter residence. It retains its original furniture, also designed by the brothers, and is maintained in pristine condition, both inside and out. Greene and Greene homes are rare and much appreciated in this area of California. One trip shows why.",Randall W
50,Take the tour!!!,We went to see the Gamble house because we like the whole craftsman style and read about this home online...The construction is unbelievable... I doubt if you could get this home built today at any cost. Our docent Jack kept the whole tour interesting and FUN....Go! You will be glad you did...,LASD
50,A historial treasure,"This is premier home designed by Greene and Greene is amazing for its detail, its furnishings and its historical value. In an area of historic homes, this one stands out because it's has been so well preserved and has almost all of its original furniture and art work. It is well worth the time to take a tour.",Dianne D
50,Incredible,"Absolutely stunning example of the brothers Greene. Probably the ""Ultimate Bungalow"". Great tour and a great bookstore. And the neighborhood is pleasant to walk around and enjoy a few other examples of their work, from the street anyway.",MrMTrim
30,Interesting Home,"We were having breakfast in Pasadena and found this house listed under ""things to do"" and thought why not? We got there just a few minutes before their last one hour tour for the day. We bought tickets right when we arrived and there was no need to make any advance plans, reservations or payments The grounds were immaculate and beautiful and because they are considered public anyone can walk the outside grounds for free anytime... you can even throw down a blanket and have a picnic! The inside of the home, the woodwork and the etched windows were all beautiful with amazing craftsmanship, although it was very very dark inside. The docent had to shine a flashlight onto much of whatever he was showing us or talking about so that we could actually see it. Although that is how the house was built and designed it was still somewhat frustrating. Our docent filled us with the history and took us through areas of all three floors. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and would recommend the 1 hour tour to anyone. I don't think I would be interested in the lengthy tours (2+ hrs plus) and I wouldn't do the 1 hr tour more than just one time.",la123brat
50,Arts and Crafts masterpiece,If you are into turn of century arts and crafts this is the house. My guests usually want to go here. Check schedule for when open as owned by city of Pasadena.,Jan K
50,No better architectural specimen available for regular viewing,"This GEM of Pasadena and Southern California is always worth a visit. To closely view the exquisite woodwork, details, and furnishings that perfectly match the Gamble house is a treat for all. The ground are beautiful, the bookstore excellent, and the proximity to the Norton SImon (a short walk) can not be beat.",CayeBoy
50,Amazing woodwork and interesting look-see into the family who lived here back in the Day,"Depending on the time of year you are in Pasadena, you might need to get your reservations ahead of time. The day we showed up all tours were booked so we had to book one for the following day. It was a little tricky figuring out where to park. You need to go to a middle entrance and park on the side in front of the house. If the lot is full, as it is not that big, you can park along a nearby residence street but will have to walk a little to the house. Go to the book/gift shop to pay for the tour. I could not find any discounts or coupons, other than the ones they offered in person for seniors and children.The tour then meets outside of the house. The lady who led our tour was great! She was friendly, professional, interesting and informative. She gives some history and then you enter the building. The tour starts on the first floor, then travels upstairs to the second floor and then the top floor. Lots of wood - beautiful arts and crafts period work. Ask about the little foot stool under the chair in the eating area. You will see the Gambles art and furniture and learn about their way of life when they stayed at this house. The tour lasts approximately an hour.Make sure you take the time to walk around the grounds to the rear to see the porch pool. Great spot for photos. By the way, you cannot take photos in the house. Lastly, stop over at the book/gift shop, which was the old garage, to check out items for sale - nice variety of good quality items. There is only one bathroom in there. No bathrooms inside the Gamble House.",joyceTL4

50,A Good Example of Pasadena's Gilded Age,The Gamble House is worth a short visit to catch a glimpse of Pasadena's Gilded Age in the early 20th Century and is a very good example of American Arts and Crafts architecture.

Be sure to walk around the neighborhood to view other early to mid-20th Century homes.,edlexin
40,Very Educational,This is a beautiful house that has been wonderfully preserved. There is original furniture and accessories throughout the house. The docents are very helpful and well educated.

50,A brilliant example of craftsman architecture by the Greene brothers,This house is one of the best examples of extraordinary architecture from two of early California's geniuses.,Mark B
50,Arts & Crafts Beauty,"This Greene & Greene home is wonderfully perfect for an A&C home of this era (and to my thinking, any period). All design elements from the joinery, choice of wood and details in each room (each room has a unique design that is carried out within the room) are validation as to why Greene & Greene are so highly regarded. The home and grounds have been maintained beautifully. The docent led tours are informative, our docent was knowledgeable and willing to entertain questions from the tour group. Now, my only complaint, I traveled to Pasadena from the east coast specifically for Heritage Weekend and to see the Gamble House. There was a contemporary art show that was being shown within the GH. The art was distracting and did not play off the A&C interior. Not only that but, piece of artwork was made of rebar, placed where guests would walk and yes, I my shin ran into the rebar. Minor injury but certainly the placement of this art was not well thought out. Would I return? Of course, it is a beautiful home and the home of Doc Brown!",Laura R
50,An Arts and Crafts jewel,Brought our out-of-town visitor...blew her mind! Take a few seconds while on the tour to actually LOOK at each room you are being shown and you will see even more fab details than are being pointed out to you.,transplanted2016

50,The best reason to visit Pasadena,"As a matter of full disclosure, from 1978 until 1990, my business partners Bill Dancy, Robert Nailon and myself did most of the systems maintenance here on the electrical, and heating system and refinishing on occasion. We ran a Architecturally Significant Structures Restoration company.The Gamble house was always a PLEASURE to work on, even more than the many other Greene and Greene's we worked on. The house is complete with its furniture, has never been painted, remuddled or messed with. It truly is the most excellent Arts and Crafts home in America.Although I have spent hundreds of hours working on the house, and getting paid to do so, its still a treat to pay and go on tour. I love being in this space. It is a wonderful experience.",Scott L
30,for arts & crafts architecture buffs,"If you are interested in this type of architecture, you will likely enjoy visiting The Gamble House very much. Much of it is restricted, however. The room at the top with its 360 degree view is a nice surprise. The gift shop on the grounds is high-end, featuring upscale pottery, lamps, books, jewelry and more.",VKN_11
50,"Beautiful, a must see in Pasadena","We visited the Gamble house on a recent visit to Pasadena. The tour was reasonably priced and worth the time.

50,A bit of Arts and Crafts architecture by Green and Green,"One of the best examples of an Arts and Crafts style home, which Pasadena is famous for. Take one of the 1-2 hour tours if time permits, and get reservations online. The house is magnificent and apparently only took 10 months to build.

50,"If you enjoy wood Craftsmanship, visit here",Every nook of the house is filled with craftsmanship and clever built-ins. Reserve your tickets and tour time in advance. Tour groups are small so you can visit each room and listen to the knowledgeable guide. After our tour we bought water and chatted on the rear patio. The only area you can touch is the stair bannister. This is a tour more appropriate for adults.,Rita B
50,not to be missed,"The Gamble House is one of the highlights of Pasadena, a beautiful city with much to see. I was born a few blocks away but it took me more than 70 years to get to the house.

What a treat!",Tony C

40,Lovely home but the art installation ruins it,"I love arts and crafts homes and was excited to visit this one. Unfortunately there was an art installation throughout the home. It was very distracting and took away from the beauty of the home. Some items were not accessible due to the placement of the art. Any art would distract from this historic home, but these pieces were more distracting than others. I'm afraid I missed many of the details while trying to ignore or not step on the art.",Imogene T
50,A must see for architecture groupies,"I wanted to build a Craftsman style recording studio in Malibu. I learned about the Gamble House tours from one of the docents, who happened to be the owner of a now defunct (and amazing) store called Historic Lighting. Anyway I took the tour and was blown away by the house, the joinery, the knowledge of the docents, everything. The Gamble House is the foremost example of the Greene brothers' genius.The architect for my studio ended up taking two more tours and took assiduous notes, as did my contractor. The result was Woodshed Recording, in Malibu (google it:). The studio ended up on the cover of the periodical of record for Craftsman architecture, American Bungalow. Some day WE will give tours:):)I visited years ago - there is no option for that under the 'when did you visit' button here. But I'm sure everything is still as it was back then! Go.",RichardGibbs

There is so much to absorb here that you'll want to return to see things in a different light, a different season. Docent provided guided tours and there are specialty tours to focus on a particular aspect of the home such as the multitude of structural and design wood uses (need a special appointment for these). You can linger on the grounds, shop in a museum-type store (they said this carriage house played a prominent role in the movie ""Back To The Future""), and join a museum group called ""Friends of the Gamble House"" ( receive information & opportunities on a frequent basis for lectures; visits to other private venues in and outside Pasadena, the US & overseas; discounts; special exhibitions; and other creative fun). Lots of outdoor photo ops & inspiration. Great for all ages. A real treasure.",2016Patti
50,Interesting tour,"You can only see the inside of the house with a tour. It is worth the money to look inside, especially if you like craftsman style. This was the winter house of the Gambles from Proctor and Gamble, and the excellent tour guide told us so much about the house and customs of the time (like the house was dark because the light bulbs were very low watt). The tour was about 1 hour and there is a gift shop in a separate building on grounds.",Vitarachel
50,A Pasadena Architectural Treasure!,"The Gamble House is an example of iconic California Craftsman style architecture, unique in its simplicity, its esthetic charm and its Japanese influence. An American gem! The exquisite attention to detail in each of the rooms is a tribute to the perfectionistic taste of Mary Gamble, wife of David Gamble of Procter and Gamble fame. The Greene and Greene brothers' use of minimalist lines and their love of the beauty of natural wood is evident in the artistry of the furniture, the decoration on the walls, the sheen of the grain of the heavy handsome bannisters, the incorporation of stain glass windows and doors. Views of the San Gabriel mountains, the plants and trees adorning the yard, the absence of the reminders of the busy city, transport the visitor to a peaceful and idyllic setting in Nature. The docent was so knowledgeable and enthusiastic in her presentation that it was a disappointment when the tour came to an end. A fabulous place to visit! Don't forget to visit the store afterward where you'll find a lovely treasure to take home.",KarieMeg
50,fabulous arts and crafts house,"The house is an excellent example of California's arts and crafts style, and is in pristine condition. The docent we had was lively and so enthusiastic about the house. Most of the furniture was made for the house by the architects, so everything goes together perfectly, in a subtle way, with certain motifs repeated throughout the house. One can easily imagine how the Gamble family lived in the house since so much of the house is exactly as it was when the family lived there.",caren s

50,One of America's Great Arts & Crafts Icons,"After touring the neighborhood with The Pasadena Tour Company (AKA Kristin -- whom we strongly recommend!), my wife and I booked a guided tour of the inside of this iconic home. The numerous pictures we had seen of it do not do it justice. The beautiful simplicity belies a celebration of craftsmanship, yet never loses track that this is a family home. Why would there be gracefully rounded corners to a countertop? So that one would not strike the edge when walking past it. Why the deep window wells for the full-length basement windows, allowing more light in the servant areas when narrow windows at ground-level would have been so much easier? Because servants are people too and their happiness was integral to a happy home. Nothing is purely decorative: the art is in the craft. Even the attic is a study in beauty. FYI: Unfortunately, no pictures are allowed inside. Flat shoes only. The docent (tour guide) was knowledgeable and engaging.",WIEireannach

Our docent was very knowledgeable about the Gamble family, the Greene architects, architecture in general, and the Arts and Crafts movement. The 1 hour tour includes the entire house (not the basement). Our tour lasted a few minutes over 1 hour. There was enough time to see everything.[Many reviews have commented on the low lighting ... It is pretty dark by our standards but your eyes do adjust (so I didn't find it an issue). Also, you are seeing the house with the amount of light that was used when the house was lived in. So while not to our taste today it is more authentic and is helping to preserve the house and furnishings.

A few other readers have mentioned the darkness, but our guide used a light, so it ended up not being a problem.I would note, though, that we took our tour at the end of a Sunday, and our guide seemed a bit exasperated with the younger kids in our group.

50,Required for folks interested in arts-and-crafts architecture,"We took the one hour tour of the Gamble house. We're both arts-and-crafts fans with a fair amount of knowledge, and found the tour to be both packed with details (woodwork, family history, artifacts and furniture) with great coverage of both public and private rooms of the house. The house is stunning also because it's so elaborate and detailed compared with Berkeley brown-shingle houses or Roycroft Inn in East Aurora. The attic, which wasn't used much when the house was lived in, was a particular treat. We got enough from the hour tour. If we'd had more time, I would have chosen the neighborhood tour over the three hour top-to-bottom tour.We stayed at Disney's Grand Californian hotel right after visiting the Gamble house, and found several three-step patterns from the Gamble house in the Disney hotel.Make sure to walk around the back of the house to see the back patio. I'd been expecting something more traditional, but was surprised and pleased by its crazy design.",Robert2765
30,Darkness behold,"Due to time constraints, I was only able to see the main level of the Gamble House, as tickets were half price and it was a 30-minute tour. The lighting was such that the interior of the home was very dark, other than the kitchen or a bedroom. Personally, the bookstore was wonderful and better photos were in a book I purchased as compared to the actual tour.",abanner2016
50,Reallly Something Special,"The Gamble House is an outstanding local landmark. (If you want to drive by or just walk around, be sure to understand that Westmoreland Place is a little street that runs parallel to busy Orange Grove Boulevard. You have to get off of Orange Grove in order to visit or drive slowly past the Gamble House ... you can really only glimpse it from Orange Grove!) Anyway, if you have time to take a tour, it's worthwhile and exceptional. So interesting and beautiful, astounding architecture, fabulous local and American history, inexpensive admission. If you don't have time for a tour, you can still walk around the grounds and look at the building up close, visit the bookstore, and even walk the neighborhood to see other beautiful Craftsman homes.

50,"For interesting house, great tour.","If you are interested in architecture or history this is a great tour. I don't think it is appropriate for most children as it is an hour plus long tour and there are appropriate rules in place to protect the house and furnishings such as do not touch the wood, sit or lean on furniture, and try not to step on edges of rugs. The rules are very appropriate but children may have a hard time with them and the content, in my opinion, is geared towards people who are interested in history and/or architecture. Our guide was great! She was knowledgable and was very good at appropriately keeping the tour on schedule, which was important as there is so much to see in this house. The front desk staff were so friendly and helpful. We were not sure how the tours worked and showed up a few minutes after the tour started. It was the only day we had to take the tour and we had time constraints. The front desk staff offered to let us join the tour that had just started, which I thought, went over and above for customer service.

You could just sense the love and devotion in his presentation.The grounds are nice, but nothing exceptional (e.g. Huntington).

40,"Interesting house, but tour suffers from low lighting and uneven guides","This is a lovely house that hasn't ever been remodeled, so it gives you a real glimpse into the period it's from. Part of that glimpse is very low levels of lighting inside, because at the time the house was built, the effect of electric lighting on the eyes wasn't known, so light levels were low, and lighting was indirect.The authenticity was nice, but it also made it very difficult to see and appreciate many of the details in the house. The guide used a flashlight to try to highlight them, but I think it would have been preferable to show one or two rooms as they originally were, then increase the lighting in the rest of the house.Our guide was pretty good, but there were a number of questions that arose that she was unable to answer, and she didn't seem terribly interested in finding out the answers. A place like this deserves more motivated guides.The house doesn't permit inside photography, which is frustrating, because the detail work inside is remarkable. Everything else I've written notwithstanding, if you're interested in arts and crafts architecture, this house is a must-see.",SomeGuyEnRoute
50,Best Green and Green around that allows tours to the public,I would suggest getting a docent guided tour as he/she willl explain the details of construction. Green and Green homes are the Frank Lloyd Wright of the area. Lovely and more livable.,Louise A

50,Wonderful Arts and Crafts style house 1908,"This was the winter home of the Gamble family from Cincinnati, of Procter & Gamble (Ivory soap) fortune. Local architects Green & Green (brothers) designed the house, inspired by a Japanese country house aesthetic they first witnessed at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The woodworking is amazing. Most of the furnishings are original to the house. Outside photos ok; interior not allowed. Parking is minimal; you must reserve your place as hour long docent tours are small groups. The attention to minute detail and the handmade craftsmanship are astounding as is the fact that the house was completed in only ten months! The style reminds one of Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie houses.",Merrill C

40,"A must see, if a little dull","We stopped her per my mom's request for her birthday and she and I both walked away laughing because she kept getting in trouble for leaning or peaking around the corner, etc. so it was a bit of a stiff tour. I think it was our tour guide, bless her heart she had to be in her 80's but she just wasn't very enthusiastic or entertaining. The woman who checked us in was much more vivacious. I was hoping she would be our guide. Anyway, it is a must see because it is really interesting to see the architecture and furniture from another era. Even how dim the lights are, it is like walking into a Californian downton abbey. Definitely stop by, the tour wasn't expensive and you an always leave early (like we did) if you get a little bored.",klindsied
50,Ramble through the Gamble!,"Greene and Greene, the brother architect team that celebrated the Craftsman ideal, built this house for the Gamble family in 1908. (Gamble as in Proctor and Gamble) The brothers Greene were comprehensive architects and working closely with the Gamble family, not only built the house but did all the interior decor and all the furniture as well. The Gamble family kept the house intact, never selling it but donating it to a college. The house being intact is one the most remarkable things, as it is very hard to find a house that had not been changed since its craftsman days. So many houses of that time had been torn apart or had its woods painted over. Here the stained glass and pearl inlays of the decor still glimmer like gems. The rich woods of the stairs and walls remain sleek and polished. A window into the past, you can truly see what it was like in 1910 when the house was finished and feel how it might have been to live in such a time. You cannot really ramble through this house on your own. As a group, you will go through the house from Kitchen to Roof. It has guided tours many times during the day. Pick up tickets at the well - appointed gift shop next door.",deabs8
50,Fascinating glimpse into the period,"I've been on the regular tour of Gamble House about a year ago. Recently I had a relative come to visit and drove him past the house on a tour of Pasadena. My relative was excited to see the ""Back to the Future"" house but commented on the ""dreary"" dark colors. Though impressive from the outside, the period style of ""lodge-style"" dark colors may seem dreary but is authentic, and is even more a reason to see it from the inside. It is not dreary inside; in fact one of the best views is in the foyer with light streaming in from the stained glass door. We walked the grounds and checked out the exterior and the open store, but the first tour wasn't leaving for an hour (noon) so we did not take it. I've been wanting to do the ""Behind the Velvet Ropes"" tour. If you're a fan of period architecture, Arts and Crafts movement, or just love natural wood accents or handmade furniture, you should tour this house. It is truly fascinating, and not just from an architectural point of view.",native210
50,Arts and Crafts Home,I always wanted to see this house. They gave a wonderful tour with a lot of details about the architecture and the trends of the era. The incredible fact about is that every part of it was hand crafted and it took about 10 months. This is not to be missed!,Mary B

50,What a gem!,"My husband and I were looking to kill some time before heading to LAX for a redeye flight back home. We visited mid afternoon and we were lucky to find parking. There is off street parking in front of the neighboring church as well as spaces in front of the home.We waited about ten minutes before our tour began. Be sure to purchase tickets at the bookstore/ garage before your tour. We made the mistake of going up to the front of the home to enter and buy tickets but were politely reminded by a docent to head to the bookstore. If you purchase ticket online make sure to check in at the bookstore as well before queuing for the tour.We then sat on the front porch and were given some general facts about the home and booties to wear over shoes to limit the damage to the floor and rugs. Our tour lasted about an hour and a half because we asked many questions and took our time.We don't know a ton about architecture but this tour sure peaked out interest! What a fabulous tour given by knowledgable docents. The Greene and Greene arts and crafts style is beautiful and we loved all the little details (grouping of three, trailing roses, tsuba shapes).

50,Striking Arts & Crafts Style House with informative tour,"I visited the Gamble House today and found it to be time very well spent. Just driving past the house, you'll find the property to be very striking. Then, by walking the grounds and taking the one-hour docent led tour you will learn the history and the process of building this architectural landmark.The tour group size was very manageable where you don't feel like you're missing anything at all. After picking up your tickets you will line up about 5 minutes before the beginning of tour. You can only take pictures outside the home and you are asked not to take any inside at all.The hour went by fast and by the end I felt I received a very informative story of how the house was built, the Gambles themselves and the architects who designed both the home and the furniture. The staff were all extremely friendly and happy to answer any questions. They even had a little activity for children along with flashlights to carry as it is pretty dark inside the house.

It's well worth the $15 adult admission fee for an hour long docent guided tour. Our docent was knowledgeable and passionate and his information packed tour actually went over by nearly 30 minutes! Photos aren't allowed in the house but arrive early and spend a few minutes taking pics outside of the exterior and gorgeous setting. The homes' former garage now serves as a bookstore and there you can purchase gifts and books about the Gamble house as well as many Arts and Crafts related books. For just $1.50 you can pick up a walking /driving map of the neighborhood which is filled with other incredible historic homes - even one by Frank Lloyd-Wright! TIPS: If you didn't buy tickets in advance online, tickets are sold in the bookstore to the right of the Gamble house (formerly the homes garage) with additional tour times available for walk up guests. Allow about 90 minutes to pick up/purchase tickets, explore the exterior of the house plus take the guided tour. Another 30 - 90 minutes will give you time to drive/walk through the surrounding neighborhood. Tours are available Thursday through Sunday afternoons and the house is also open during the lunch hour on Tuesdays for a 20 minute walk through the house.

The tour was supposed to be an hour, but there was so much information she wanted to pack into each room, we ended up going over by about 15 minutes. We asked plenty of questions and got great answers. The house itself is such a joy to see, whether you are a fan of architecture, woodworking, or hand crafted construction. Beautifully maintained and really worth the $15 tour fee. My tip is to go either early or late, since the craftsman style stained glass windows are only lit up when the sun is at a lower angle, so noon would be the worst. Highly recommend!",aerinn

They were fresh air addicts and each bedroom has an extended veranda where they had their beds and slept out of doors except for inclement weather, I suppose. The design theme goes from the entry stained glass design, copied in the furniture pieces. A beautiful home.",dorobo123

50,That don't build them like this anymore,If you are into design or architecture this home is not to be missed. There is so much to see and learn about the construction/design of this home down to the tiniest of details. Even the straps that attach the downspouts to the home are beautiful. The tour takes about an hour. I don't remember our docents name (slender man perhaps late fifties) but he was informative and funny. This place was worth the price of admission.,travelbrat20
40,This would have been great....,"I missed the Tour by half an hour. However, The Gamble House is a gem. There are different versions of Tours that you could take. The nature of the Tours here is informative. For Art and Craft enthusiasts and for those of you that wish to learn more about Pasadena, about this iconic house itself, I would strongly recommend you to partake in the Tours. The Fund goes towards the continuous conservation of The Gamble House. A few minutes away from The Gamble House, a Maya-influenced Frank Lloyd Wright's building has just been sold privately. At the moment, it looks like in a state of disrepair. Time will tell if that building would be done up by the owner to complement The Gamble House.",Ping L
50,Visit Every Room of the Soap King's Son,"USC watches over this 1908 winter home. The Gambles lived here until it was given to trustees. So, no alterations. Most furniture stayed with the house.Brilliant views of the Rose Bowl. Just minutes from Old Town Pasadena. You travel in a tour. Ours had 7 people. The guide was pleasant and pointed to a lot of unusual choices, specific to this house.After the craft movement begun by William Morris, this house and its architects broke away from the Ornate Victorian style. The richness here is in 19 kinds of wood, including teak, mahogany, and black walnut. Some subtle Japanese influences can be see.The original electric wires and plumbing still serve the house.Original carpets. Invisible doors. Rounded bricks for safety. A beautiful stained glass front door. This is a once in a lifetime treat. There are a few other period homes that have similarities, but this is the only one open to the public.",Dean1900
50,The Gamble House - a wood-workers dream!,"I wish I could have some for one of their special behind-the-scenes tours, so I could see the intricate wood-work up close. It must have been wonderful to live in this house. Who knew Pasadena was filled with such rich history!",SF_AlexK

40,Amazing!,"My sister is a master woodworker who greatly admires Greene & Greene. She lives in Seattle. I took her to the Gamble House when she visited. She was in heaven. It is a very informative docent-led extensive tour of the house. I love looking at old homes but this was really special for my sister. I wish I had known about a tour they hold occasionally for woodworkers that give them a special look at the finishes and construction. You will have to visit their website or call to find out when these are scheduled. I believe it is a 3-4 hour tour. The Gamble House has a great gift shop in what was the home's garage. They have left the doors and hardware intact. Wonderful tour for people interested in Pasadena history, woodworking, architecture or old homes.",MaryLouise H

50,Outstanding example of Arts & Crafts era,"This tour is a must-do! It is one of the best Craftsman houses anywhere. The architecture and furniture are the finest examples of the Arts & Crafts Era. We had a great 1+ hour tour with a great docent (think her name is Marie). She imparted lots of information about the history, the people, and the architecture. She also spoke loudly enough so everyone could hear (very important when there are people with hearing difficulties in the group).Be advised that you need to get tickets online or at the garage next door, then wait on the porch for the tour to start. The only bathroom is in the garage.It is hard to find the “street” which isn’t really a street and parking is not that plentiful, it is on that street in front of the house.",Sheilakeel

50,Time Travel!!,"Stepping into this arts and crafts masterpiece by Henry and Charles Greene is like stepping back in time. It is especially unique because the furnishings are original and designed by the architects to create a unified interior. Japan was the rage when the house was designed and there is a peaceful order to the shapes and proportions of the rooms and exteriors. Add to that the details: Rookwood pottery, Stickley tables, 14 watt bulbs in Copper lamps, and you walk away in awe of the aesthetic vision and craftsmanship that made this place back in 1908. Take a few moments to walk the neighborhood on Arroyo Terrace where there are a half dozen Greene and Greene cottages in a Swiss style as well as Charles Greene's own home. A must for architecture buffs, historians, and anyone who would like to take a relaxing afternoon to do some time travel to another era.",AuggieDaddy
50,A Green and Green Masterpiece,Architects Green and Green really went all out here for Mr Gamble. Beautiful Arts and Crafts architecture and interior design example ... quite unique in it's kind! The wooden constructions and the very first electric lighting installation can be admired here. Everything fits and you can see how this family lived in those days in this beautiful dwelling. At the time it was built it was the only house in a large forest ... now it is one of many. Pleasant gardens for a relaxing stroll. I can strongly recommend the guided tour ... you will learn so much about this house and how this family once lived here.,Bernard V
50,Take the long tour,"We visited three wonderful places in Pasadena at the end of a stay on the west coast (from England): the Norton Simon, the Huntington Library, and the Gamble House. All were amazing, but had similar closing days so needed careful planning, especially as there was so much to enjoy at them all.We took the long tour, of 2.5 hours. It was not cheap but worthwhile and included light refreshments half way through. Each group is limited to ten people though they exceptionally allowed eleven on the one we took, to accommodate us both. (This option was not allowed through online booking but the chap who ran the shop was more flexible so do not give up if the computer says No).We were given plenty of time to look around and the guide was clued up. We saw three floors: first and second plus the interesting basement (where we were given the refreshments).The only regret was that photographs were not allowed inside the house. I would have been willing to pay a suppement for this but it was not offered. It was dark inside though ( we were given torches) so perhaps photography was deemed impractical.The house and its history were fascinating. Anyone interested in Arts and Crafts architecture and furnishings should make the effort to see it.",geoffrey.hollis
50,A Jewel of Craftsman Architecture,"Make a reservation in advance and take the tour. Our docent was extremely knowledgeable and presented that information in a fun and engaging style.Even if you are a fan of Victorian architecture, check out an alternative perspective to what a house should be.Parking is a challenge, so get there early enough to find a legal spot and avoid the ire of the two schools on either side.If you like Craftsman style, get the $1.25 guide to other Craftsman homes nearby. You can walk or drive, but since these are actual homes, don't expect a tour.None of them could match the Gamble House anyway.",David T

50,Brown Bag Lunch Tour on Tuesdays,"We unfortunately had only a brief first floor tour of the house because Tuesday is the day for shorter lunch time tours but this one encouraged me to go back to see more of the house. We had a very knowledgable and animated tour guide who gave us the background of the Gamble family. Thankfully when the final Mrs. Gamble put the house on the market in the 1960's, she overheard a prospective buyer tell his wife he will paint the interior white to brighten the house which led the Gambles to take the house off the market and donate it to the city?? Not sure, maybe to a private foundation. At any rate the house was saved and is in original and amazing condition. Anyone who enjoys skilled and beautiful woodwork will be amazed at the craftsmanship and beauty of this house. Although we could tour only the first floor on Tuesday and it is not terribly large, there was so much to look at and marvel over that it was enough!",Eileen H
50,Arts and Crafts at its Best,"Tours of this lovely home are one hour guided and run every half hour. During busy times, it would be prudent to book ahead of time. We had a wonderful guide who made the house and the period come alive with the Gamble Family ghosts lurking in the background. The house is very dark as was common for the era. Those who enjoy architecture, home decor, interesting people, and history will love it.",Kateinshanghai
50,Amazing!!,I am into woodworking and this was a true delight. The docent was knowledgeable and enthusiastic. It was not crowded. Be sure to check out the days and times that it is open.

50,Exquisite example of Arts and Craft Architecture,The Japanese inspired design and craftsmanship of this early 20th century house is absolutely beautiful and meticulously maintained. The docents do a wonderful job of telling the story of the house and the family who built it and lived in it until it was donated to the city of Pasadena in the mid-20th century. Don't miss the stained glass rose windows in the dining room and the detailed design integration on everything from the glass light shades to the bedframes. The design elements even carry over to the gift shop that was converted from the original garage.,Linda S
50,One of the most magnificent examples of Arts and Craft architecture available.,"The house and furnishings were designed by architects Charles and Henry Greene in 1908 for David and Mary Gamble of the Procter & Gamble Company. Architecturally you cannot find a more perfect example of the genre, and it is a warm and inviting space to this New Englander who lives in an American Four Square, the style that evolved during the same era. The docent was hilarious (at least to us) who reminded us several times that the house was ""very, very old"" and that we had to be extremely careful of the floors, woodwork, etc. Our house is only two years newer and, by Connecticut standards, is a youngster. Everything about this house will knock your eyeballs out - Green and Green were the best there is at their craft.",Goldenspring
40,Historical landmark,We are from the east - so it was great to see the West Coast style of Craftsman home built near the turn of the 20th. century.The docents do a fine job of expelling all the details - and the surrounding areas areas are very pretty expensive suburban homes built in the 20's / 30's.,Stuart L

30,Bring a flashlight,"Touring an historic architect-designed home of a wealthy family offers a somewhat interesting glimpse into life a century ago. Frankly the place is quite dark inside (original lighting fixtures throughout). Our Docent guide used a flashlight to illuminate special features, but once she turned it off everything returned to the usual dimness. I’d recommend this only to people with a really strong interest in woodwork of the Arts and Crafts architectural style. Photos are not allowed inside the house. The gift shop has a great collection of books, colourful ceramic tiles and related items of the period.",ccvvbb
50,Amazing! Gorgeous!,I've loved the Gamble House since I was a child. Our class would tour the home every year. The amazing woodwork and furnishings are timeless. The quality and craftsmanship are unbeatable. There's nothing today that measures up. The grounds are beautiful. This is a Pasadena treasure. Be sure to check ahead for tour schedules. You will not be disappointed.,GnaBna

50,Amazing Home Tour,"I've toured quite a few ""old homes"" over the years. However, this is the first home I've been to where the home itself is the centerpiece. Even with no furniture in the home, the tour would be worth it. We arrived early and booked the regular tour. There's a lengthy 3 hour tour that's held once every few weeks. The tour was well paced and I learned lots. I'm no carpenter or architect... but on my tour was my architect friend and a carpenter (only 3 in our tour). They looked like they were kids in a candy store! I even learned what the Arts & Crafts Movement was. Hats off to the Greene brothers!",BLWesley
50,gorgeous,The Gamble house is open on Tuesdays for only two abbreviated tours but they are well worth it. You are allowed to bring a brown bag lunch to eat before or after the 20 minute tour which includes only the down stairs. The house is beautifully maintained in its original condition including furnishings. There are other tours which are more inclusive so check for the day you plan to go and reserve you tickets. This is an unusually authentic look at the arts and crafts style of Architect/Artist/Designers Green and Green. Don't miss out.,katy92027

The sheer beauty of it's features such as the stained glass and amazing wood features make it worth visiting. Even if you do not realise you have interests in any of these fields, the house is worth a visit. I hour docent led tours bring the house to life, pointing out the amazing details and features.

It felt like there could have been more interesting info shared during the tour, and her flashlight was not up to the task (it's pretty dim inside, so the guides have flashlights to point out interior features, and her light was quite dim). Also, they should place a few portable a/c units in the rooms! Gets a bit stuffy. But overall worth doing the tour to see the interior details of this gem.",Chris S
50,An extraordinary piece of architectural history,"This is the last of the great homes of the last century. A gem of the Arts and Crafts movement, this Greene & Greene home will delight your senses.

This is definitely a ""must"" stop in the wonderful city of Pasadena that has many attractions.",California Dreamer
50,A Must See,"When I was an architectural student in the 80's I quickly learned about the Gamble House and had not been there for several years. A friend and I went when it was closed and were taking pictures when the director came out to speak to us. Once he learned we were architectural students he allowed us to have free access to anywhere in the house and to his knowledge. What a wonderful memory.The home is a beautiful example of the Southern California Craftsman Design. You may not be interested in residential architecture but I believe you will after visiting the Gamble House. If you have an interest in architecture or are an architectural student the Gamble House is a must see.The short tour is worth taking as it provides the right amount of information to present life at the time the Gamble family built the house and the important points of the Crasfman style of architecture but with the added Japanese influences.Many times homes of the wealthy are built as a copy of some European style or with a modern flare. In this case the Mr. Gamble (founder of Proctor and Gamble) had a house designed for the times and for a Southern California climate. Extended overhangs with hand hued beams and iron strapping. Sleeping porches with their views. Intricate wood work and detailed craftsmanship of in-laid silver and stone, present the artistic architectural talents of the Green brothers.So make a day of it. Tours are daily",RoadBob

50,"A delight for design buffs, architecture history enthusiasts and students of lifestyles","I include myself in all three categories so find the Gamble House a fascinating place to visit. If you've visited any other Craftsman era buildings you'll see the similarities and the differences here compared to, say, Frank Lloyd Wright's works. I'm always struck by how relatively modest many of these well-healed families' homes from this era were. Perhaps that's a subtle element of the style; an apparent lack of ostentation or grandeur; that makes them all the more appealing. The integration of furnishings and services show how domestic architecture has failed to progress in the 20th century - and now we're all looking for greener buildings these 100 year old structures have some interesting things to teach us. Well worth a visit.",0591TimS
50,Interesting look into an old way of living,We've lived in the area for many years and this was on our list for awhile.

50,Extraordinary.,"The Gamble family (of Proctor and Gamble) had this house designed and executed by the firm of Greene and Greene, including the furnishings, in the first decade of the 20th century. Because the house was passed on, intact, to USC and the city of Pasadena in the 1960s, you get the feel how a wealthy family with very good taste lived in that time period. It's open for tours only a few hours a week and it is worth adjusting your schedule so as not to miss it. If you can't make it, there is a display of Greene and Green's work in the Huntington Library and Gardens.",Ron S
50,A Most Incredible Home,"Being a woodworker by hobby, this home was pure delight. However, I'm positive most people would enjoy the decor of the rooms and the superb architecture.

Our docent was knowledgeable, entertaining, articulate, and accommodative; we couldn't have been better guided through this wonderful home.",Jan L
40,As advertised,"This is an easy one to do your homework on, and you are advised to do so. If this is your kind of thing, you will be fascinated, as there is nothing else like it. If you aren't sure if it is your thing, research it carefully before you spend the money (and more importantly, the time) to go. The tours are long, longer, and really long. The amount of detail they can go into is amazing. But if you don't want to spend hours discussing every nook and cranny and every join and angle and piece of stained glass, well, let's just say if you are not an architectural or art buff, you could get bored. I loved the one hour tour the first time, but can't imagine doing the 4-hour version. When I did the one-hour tour again a year later with my mother, I was bored silly, and so was she.",EBrowne

50,Don't go just to see the outside,"I have to admit I ended up at this place because of it being featured in a certain time travel based film, but I'm so glad I took the chance to have a look inside too. (For fans of BTTF, note this house was only used for external shots and another Greene & Greene house was used for internals.) I find architecture and craftsmanship interesting, and similar minded people won't be disappointed here. The 'brown bag tour' is particularly good value for money.",Kay549
40,Worth a visit,"If you have any interest in architecture and/or furnishings, the Gamble House is well worth a visit. The tour is interesting, and goes to the major rooms in the house. Each docent gives a slightly different tour, so it is possible to go more than once and still find it interesting. The grounds are open, so it is not necessary to take the tour to see the outside of the house and the landscaping. My only objection is that tour tickets bought in advance are more expensive than same day, in person tickets.One would think that in the 21st century, organizations could manage to sell tickets without the extra charge.",MartineB

40,Great architectural tour of a grand California style wood house,"Buy tickets and take the one-hour docent-led tour to see most areas of this historic home, which belonged to the Gamble family of Procter & Gamble fame, designed by Green & Green, a beautiful, fascinating wood craftsman home with an intriguing history. Well worth the visit.",ECrowther
50,so much more interesting in real life than in all the books!,"the docent was amazingly informative and the experience was very personal and gratifying. The attention to detail in all the craft work and design, and the well maintained and original quality of the interior and exterior make this Green and Green building, plus all the furnishings, a true exemplar of Craftsman style.",elisaGlenEllen

40,Wow! Beautiful!,"The skinny:Parking: free paved street in front of houseDecor: craftsman, exquisiteCost: $13-15 per ticket for 1 hour tourBathrooms: yes in gift shopStairs: 2 sets to climbTip: no pictures inside allowedI had heard of the Gamble House but after living in LA for 20 years, I finally went! Our docent Eric was funny and knowledgable and the hour went by quickly as we toured beautiful room after room. I would definitely come back to do the other longer tours where they concentrate on specific designs of the house. The gift shop, while small, is jam packed with goodies that you will be easily emptying your wallet for!! Just be advised, you can not touch anything in the house and the house is very dark inside. Try to go on a sunny clear day so the light that can com win the house helps see the tour better. Our docent had a flashlight but it was kind of weak, I would bring my own small one in order to see detail on some of the furnishings!",melobeam
50,Remarkable architectural history,"I'll come out and admit it: I went to see this home because the exterior was used as Doc Brown's house in the ""Back to the Future"" movies. I had become enamored with the design from those brief moments in the films and eventually, years later, I finally visited the Gamble House in Pasadena.For those who would like to marvel at architectural history and admire the Arts & Crafts style movement of a century go, this home absolutely cannot be missed. It's so beautiful inside and out and the craftsmanship is simply unbelievable to see close-up. It's probably one of the most amazing examples I've seen of the integration of artistic style in the form of a building.Also take time to look in the gift shop (where you buy your tickets); this was the original garage of the home and itself has some interesting features (but sadly, no DeLorean...).",Valkyrie_Kate
40,Beautiful Home in Beautiful Neighborhood,"The city and neighborhood are gorgeous and worth a visit on their own. Home is well-maintained with friendly staff and well-stocked book and gift store. The tour process was well-organized and professional. Tours left often and it appeared many folks bought tickets for tours the same day (we purchased ours a few weeks in advance). It did not appear to be handicap accessible as there are some stairs involved in the tour.The ""one hour"" tour ran about a half hour over, which isn't so bad, but it caused us to miss the next attraction on our agenda. So be sure to budget a good two hours for a visit. It was also disappointing to learn that most (if not all) of the ""craftsman"" aspects are a veneer (e.g. pegs are seen throughout, but their only purpose is to hide the nails and screws - they don't actually hold anything together).",Porchsitter
50,Excellent and magical,Our visit was in December and was a delight. The docent was very knowledgeable. Having visited the British source for so much of the Arts and Crafts movement it was a delight to see such an incredible example of art in architecture.,Ian M
50,Inspiring,Impeccable craftmanship. A visit should be a requirement for all woodworkers. Learning about Mrs. Gamble's pivotal role in collecting for and decorating the house was a pleasant surprise. Simple but elegant pine garlands on the mantels for holiday decoration...a nice touch. Guest shop has wonderful books and treasures for yourself or gifts. Ask for a small group tour if possible so you don't have to listen to annoying guests. I want a sleeping porch!,Miramikeadv
40,For those who love architecture and history,"The Gamble House in Pasadena is a wonderful example of the emerging Arts and Crafts movement, and exacting design of the Greene brothers, the architects and designers of everything from downspouts to tables. The Tiffany lighting, the beautiful inlaid woodwork everywhere, hand-made furniture, the gorgeous front door...it will appeal to anyone who appreciates such artistry and thought. There are a variety of tours, and best to plan ahead. No photos inside but great selection of books about this house in Bookstore next door. After the tour, ask docents to point out the street nearby that has a few more Greene & Greene homes, and walk around for 10 minutes to get a feel of the effect of these architects and their vision in 1909.",Janice S
50,Beautiful Craftsman house,"The Gamble House is a Beautiful Craftsman, Greene & Greene house. I really enjoyed the tour. The Tiffany lamps and a beautiful stained gass door were my favorite things to see. The craftsmanship of the house is remarkable. The gardens are lovely. You can also walk around the Arroyo neighborhood and see many other craftsman homes in very good shape. We were shown the inside of one that was for sale a few years ago and it was beautiful. It had Batchelder tiles around the fireplaces.",Bakeries

As my husband is a carpenter, we took the special joinery tour by master craftsman, Jim Ipekjian. Very informative & enjoyable. At the end of the tour, we were given info on other Greene & Greene houses in Pasadena & other bungalows. We really enjoyed our time & would highly recommend gamble house to others.",UMDKatie03
40,Behind the Velvet Rope Tour,"Having visited the Gamble House twice in the past we decided to pay the extra for the 2.5 hour ""Behind the Velvet Rope Tour"" which proved to be well worth the money as we were quite literally allowed 'behind the velvet rope in various rooms and also shown areas of the house not normally open to the public. Halfway through the tour we were also provided with lemonade and cookies. My husband did comment on the fact that our guide described just about everything as ""beautiful"" but I didn't really notice that.",phebert

50,CA Arts and Crafts gem,"The Gamble House epitomizes the restrained beauty, quality, craftsmanship, and artistic vision of the incomparable Greene brothers. Built for James Gamble family (of Procter and Gamble), it is a marvelous example of the Greene's 'ultimate bungalows.' Jointly administered by the University of California School of Architecture and the City of Pasadena, knowledgeable docents conduct the tours that last approximately an hour. The home's furnishings, also created by Greene and Greene, provide the visitor a rare 'complete package' of what a high-end Craftsman home of the era was like. This is a must see house museum for those interested in the American Arts and Crafts movement, architecture, and history. There is an excellent bookstore housed in the original garage that carries a good collection of books and related materials to Arts and Crafts.",Crowncitycat
50,A fascinating tour,"We visited in September 2013, and would recommend the tour to anyone interested in architecture and historical places in southern California. Even our 19 year old son found it interesting. The docent was informative and friendly. they help make or break a tour experience.",Arncliffegirl
50,You must tour this house!,"The Gamble House is an amazing example of the Craftsman style of architecture. It is particularly interesting because it was built at a time when the excessive clutter of Victorian architecture and furnishings abounded. The simple, clean lines, the extensive use of non-painted wood, the ""clinker"" brickwork, and the Tiffany glass are spectacular. Every piece of furniture, lamp, and rugs were designed by the architects - the Greene & Greene brothers. It is an experience that should not be missed.",169KenB
50,The Real Deal,"This beautiful Greene & Greene designed home is truly a masterpiece of Arts & Crafts architecture. The attention to detail is astounding, and the guides are very knowledgable and passionate. I have taken the regular tour of the house, and also the special ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" tour they offered this summer while they were refinishing the floors on the main level. That was a treat! They also have specialized tours if you are interested in more details on things like the art glass, or the wood & joinery. Great little gift shop too, where for a few dollars you can buy a walking map of the neighborhood nearby that has other beautiful A&C homes.",NatAtHome

Make sure you schedule in a tour, I don't think you'll regret it.",Maria S
50,Mini-tour great option,"We recently visited Gamble House via the ""brown bag"" mini-tours offered on Tuesdays. It was too warm for anyone to lunch on the lawn as offered, but for $8-10 pp, we enjoyed a 20-30 min. tour of the first floor of the home. The docent was quite knowledgeable and detailed in her descriptions of the family history and the home construction. Best to buy tickets on-line in advance.",TrishG87

40,Rare Glimpse into Art & Architecture of a Century Ago,"Designed by Chicago architectural firm Greene & Greene for the Gambles of Procter & Gamble in 1908, this house brings Frank Lloyd Wright to mind on first viewing. The tour, however, reveals elements unique to the Greenes as well as other artists involved in the project, such as Emil Lange stained glass and Stickley furniture. The docents are knowledgeable and incorporate art, architecture, history, biography, and humor into their presentation. Very enjoyable.",visuality
50,Stunning,"Had the good fortune to finally visit the Gamble House. Terrific tour, wonderful architecture.

The tour was of the upstairs and downstairs, they were refinishing the floors on the first floor of the house and that area was closed. Our tour covered the basement to the third floor storage area, except the main part of the first floor. The docent was very informative and shared some very interesting details of the house.

50,Beautifully preserved history,"The Green brothers were given an unrestricted budget and great artistic freedom to create this grand, yet intimate home. They designed every detail: the wood and stone selections, the hardware, the light fixtures, some of the rugs, the furniture, and much more. There is a unity of design throughout that is very satisfying. Highlights for me were the staircase, the living room, and the dining room. I appreciate that so much of the house and its interior is original. The bookstore sells postcards with professional quality images of the interior and exterior.",Robin L
40,Try Checking Out The Gamble House During MOTA Day!,"I came here on Sunday for the 1st time for the MOTA day (http://www.museumsofthea…) where admission was free for the general public (there 1 and only free day here at the Gamble House). I really enjoyed the self guided tour and learning tidbit of factual information from the many number of docents in the house. The furniture & structure of the home is beautiful and the reoccurring theme throughout the home (a crane and a rose, octagon shape and so on) was a special touch to the Gamble family. I though the Gamble Family had a very interesting life and would have loved to be a true guest in their home while they were still alive.When we first arrived here, we had to put on blue scrub booties so that the floors and the rugs (which are 100 years old) can stay in it's most pristine condition. We were constantly reminded not to touch anything because of the oils in our hands that can cause the furniture and architecture to deteriorate/ decline over time. Because of that, I would not recommend the Gamble House as children friendly.I wished there was more things to see on this tour, as I know there were quite a bit of things closed off by the velvet rope. But we were told by the docents that they do have a ""behind the rope"" tour that provides even more than the general tour.Overall, I rather enjoyed myself and the hour that was spent in here.By the way, the a/c seemed to either not be on or was on very light because it was rather quite warm in the home (but that could also be due to the large number of people inside because of the MOTA day).",meowmix318
40,Arts and Crafts treasure in Pasadena,"Had the opportunity to tour this beautiful arts and crafts home, built in 1912, by the Gamble family (son of one of the founders of Proctor and Gamble) on a Sunday afternoon. Beautiful craftsmanship: use of multiple woods, stained glass and artisan furniture.The tour focuses heavily on the architecture and Greene and Greene (the brother duo who were the architects of the home). Personally I would have liked to have a little more balance, and the opportunity to learn more about the family and the daily routine of this residence, their ""winter home"" in Pasadena.However, seeing that a later generation of the family donated the home to the city of Pasadena and the USC school of architecture, it is easy to understand why they have chosen the architectural emphasis for their tours. Even the books in the visitors center focus minimally on the family and have multiple selections regarding the design, architecture, etc. of the home.Ticket cost of $12.50 seems appropriate. Check their Website for tour times as hours are restricted primarily to the afternoons Thursdays - Sundays. Last tour at 3 pm. Get your ticket for the tour at the visitors center (to the right of the residence in what used to be the garage) prior to going to the patio of the home, where you will be met by a docent for your tour.",clpj

50,Excellent Craftsman Example,"Once a year, this tour is open free of charge. I feel fortunate to be able to go this year. This 8000 sq feet piece of beautiful craftsman was a true pleasure to view. Only able to take photographs on the outside. It would have difficult to take pics inside because it is so dark. It's somewhat like a cave in fact. Our docent assures us that it is lit up more than other homes that were built at that time.We were greeted at the door, seeing the beautiful stain glass in the door. There is a nice display of Tiffany bowls and lamps. The grounds are beautiful. I missed the famous garage. It was in Back to the Future movie. Something to look forward to on my next visit.",Traciran

50,"Arts & Crafts, Oh Wow, oh WOW!","History and architecture buffs will get particular enjoyment from a tour here but I recommend it for everyone because architecture, art and history have formed cultures into what they are today whether one is aware of it or not. This home was commissioned by the (Proctor and) Gamble family from the architects Greene & Greene. It is personal, oddball, sweet and spectacular.Honestly, you don't even have to like it in order to appreciate it but the rivers of stained glass and its riveting interior will definitely transport you to a time when the lightbulb was new and the wattage was dim. (it's dim to contemporary eyes; when this house was lived in, I am sure the bulbs seemed miraculous!)I chanced to visit on a weekend when the Arroyo Terrace Neighborhood Walking Tour was being offered. (I had researched and booked in advance; it is offered only once a month) and would definitely recommend combining the walking and house tours for a slightly more in-depth view of what the California Arts and Crafts Architecture movement wrought. And what a profound effect it had on what came later!My tour guides (inside and out) were wonderful, personable, informative and fun.High heels are not recommended for the delicate interior finishes (nor for a walking tour.)",bravo-cinzia
50,"Beautiful Craftsmanship, founding the style.","This is a gorgeous private home which has been preserved as a museum. It is perfectly maintained and feels as if the family just left, yet it is filled with wonderful detail which is especially fascinating. It is a woodworker's absolute fantasy.The docents seem knowledgeable. From the moment one enters, one is enveloped in a different world. The light coming through the Tiffany stained glass door suffuses the vestibule. The stairs are like a giant Chinese puzzle in how they are put together, yet it makes perfect sense. Each room has an individual character, but there is a common texture which comes from the thousands of hours spent on hand working and assembling the wooden and metal strap pieces. It is an enormous jigsaw puzzle.The gardens are quite small and simple, but fit the house exactly.It is definitely worth making the time to visit.",Marc S
40,A must for fans of Arts and Crafts American style,"Not to be confused with Arts and Crafts where it originated! The whole house is a very overblown copy of what should be a far more delicate expression in wood. This looks as though it was made by a trainee carpenter without any fine tools. As a fan of the real A & C movement, this was a big disappointment., as was the lack of visitor facilities.",Teacupcake

Had to drive to find the entrance. Tour tix available in the garage building. Great shop of a variety of merchandise.",TNG
50,It's a work of art,"Like the docent said in our tour, look at it not as a house, but as a work of art. The house truly is a work of art. On the tour you get to see nearly all of the rooms.Unfortunately, they do not allow pictures inside - I imagine the reason is a combination of copyright and keeping the tours from slowing down. However, you can take all the pictures you want outside.There's some pretty nice things to buy in the gift shop, too.",mobycat
50,A Beautiful Preservation of the Past ..,"If you are ever in the vicinity of the Gamble House in Pasadena, California, make certain you take the time to visit and take a docent led tour. It is a phenomenal tribute to Craftsman style architecture ... and the simple fact that it remains today is amazing, considering that California is (unfortunately) well known for 'pav(ing) paradise and put(ting) up a parking lot'.Our well trained docent took us through the house, giving us tidbits along the way ... even explaining that the reason the house seems so dark is that Mrs. Gamble had some sort of eye problem and couldn't tolerate direct sunlight. Each room has a wonderful history and we hung on every word.If you are wondering who 'Gamble' was, he was the second part of Proctor and Gamble ... and I know you know who they were!The grounds are stunning .. a direct view through the back of the yard trees to the Rose Bowl ... the trees are cut so one can actually see the Rose Bowl, as the RB didn't exist when the GH was built.The gift shop is in the old garage ... and is well stocked with books, tiles, ceramics, jewelry ... all beautifully presented and shown off to their best advantage.I promise you a tour that is worth your time and money.

Yes, the staff were gracious about finding a later time for me to enjoy the tour. WORTH THE TIME!",IrvineHarley
50,Beautiful and educational,"My husband and our seventeen-year- old daughter enjoyed our first tour of the Gamble House. It was an architectural delight. Our daughter preferred the small details that the docent pointed out in each room rather than the Gamble Family history. Our tour ran twenty minutes over the estimated one hour ten minute time frame, so we were ""over-cooked"" by the time we finished. We had no energy left to shop the amazing little bookstore.I recommend the tour for those looking for a pleasant afternoon of Arts and Crafts preserved to perfection.",AJMJGS

If you can get into the basement and attic you will see the realm of details, all in context of the final house, that go beyond what was needed.Explore and enjoy the house.",Cavydad

40,Beautiful Craftsman House Museum Seen Only By Informative Tour,"I have taken several relatives and friends on this house tour because the docents are very knowledgable and the tours are always really interesting. The house is beautifully built, in the Craftsman style and was the winter vacation home of the Gambles ( as in Proctor & Gamble ). Attention was paid to the smallest details and rooms were sometimes designed around a particular piece of furniture or even pottery that Mrs Gamble cherished. It is located in an older area of Pasadena, where the wealthy built their homes around the turn of the century. There is also a beautiful gift shop in the former garage. Tours are docent led only and it would be a good idea to make a reservation on crowded weekends as this is a popular site.",thewindatourfeet
40,Behind the Velvet Rope tour,"We took the 2.5 hour Behind the Velvet Rope tour, which was really in-depth. We were loaned (flaky) LED flashlights, so that we could inspect any details we were interested, like the silver inlay on a dresser, and the matching pieces. I loved the fact that there were so many hidden spaces for storage! It's amazing how much thought Greene & Greene put into making sure the house was well ventilated. For an old house, it doesn't have a musty smell. This is a massive, dark house, and our favorite rooms were the bright dining room, the storage room between the kitchen and the dining area, which was much simpler in design with brighter woods, and the attic, which was a giant single room, but was quite light.Given its intricate woodworking details throughoutnthe house, and its massive scale, how amazing to think that the Gamble House only took ~20 men, only 11 months to build. Those were the days!",Tescina
50,Great historic gem - well worth a tour.,"This wonderful Greene and Greene home is well worth a visit if you enjoy time capsule homes - and in particular if you enjoy the Arts and Crafts aesthetic.

50,Went to the gamble house and enjoyed it.,"On a recent trip to LA I decided to take the family to see the Gamble house. I have first heard of it from being in the Back to the Future films. I read up on it online and it sounded interesting. We went on a Saturday morning to the first tour. Our guide, Bruce I believe his name was, was a very nice, informative and engaging guide. He knew a lot about the property and its previous owners. He gave us a tour that latest about an hour. It was quite fun to walk trough the museum and look around at this beautiful house.They have free parking in front of the house. Tickets were $10 for adults and kids 12 and under were free. I don't really reccomened if you have small kids. If your kids are the bored easy type they will not like it. Plus you dont want them messing up such a nice place. There are some stairs to climb that I can see would be difficult for people who may have a hard time getting around. Enjoy etw.",triptaker092

50,Amazing example of arts and crafts architecture,"If you are in the Pasadena area and enjoy architecture or appreciate craftsmanship (woodworking, leaded glass), please visit this house. The docent led tours last about 1 hour which I felt was quick because I wanted to linger in the rooms and take in the beauty. An earlier review on here states that this home was built for a member of the Proctor family of Proctor and Gamble. This is incorrect. This home was built in 1908-1909 as a winter residence for David and Mary Gamble (the Gamble half of Proctor and Gamble), hence the name THE GAMBLE HOUSE. No photos are allowed inside but take as many as you would like outside. Yes, the house is dark inside, but the wattage of the lights in the house now are meant to be reminiscent of the actual lighting of the house when it was constructed. The furniture, rugs, pottery, etc. are all of the period that the house was built with several items being original to the house.

The house is the only Greene and Greene house open for public tours.The tours run most days of the week and take one hour. You can buy your tickets at the charming book store. Well trained docents loving give the tours. You can tell from the docents what love and respect Pasadena has for the Greene brothers.The entire home is on the tour (well not the basement or staff bedrooms). Most of the original furniture is in the house. The furniture was designed by the Greene brothers and made by the Hall brothers. All is museum quality and the collection is amazing.There are several times a month when longer, more in depth tours are given. You can check the web site to find these more in depth tours.Save some time to explore the gift shop. This is no ordinary gift shop. The items the store carries are unique and beautiful. The shop is housed in the Greene and Greene garage that was used in Back to the Future.I also highly recommend joining the Friends of the Gamble House.

I can respect this. After the one hour general tour I found out that they periodically schedule special tours geared to the woodworker. If only I had known. Now I'll have to go back... gladly.p.s.

50,Unorthodox but ingeniously designed house,"This is a great tour to go on, and well deserving of its high rank amongst sights to see in Pasadena. I'm not even particularly interested in touring houses or looking at architecture -- and I'm especially not a fan of Craftsman style houses, which the Gamble House is an example of. Yet as a resident of Pasadena for over 20 years I can say it's one of the most interesting things to see in Pasadena.Greene and Greene were well known architects and the Gamble House (built for the Gamble family who had a fortune thanks to Procter and Gamble) is perhaps their masterpiece. Every element of the house was carefully thought through, meticulously designed, and well-crafted, and the tour shows you those details. Just a few examples: no nails or screws were used in constructing the house (and this is a big big mansion). In some places the structural elements holding the house up are deliberately exposed, and in other places elements are hidden (panels which turn out to be doors). And the placement of windows and doorways to bring in air and light during a time before air conditioning, most interestingly in the sleeping porches built for the sons outside their bedroom. (They were supposed to sleep outside on the porch, not inside the bedroom, I guess because it was thought to be healthier.)I've also toured Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpiece Fallingwater, and although the Gamble House isn't as beautiful as Fallingwater (I still find Craftsman style houses to be intrinsically ugly) the tour is equally fascinating and the Gamble House was probably better designed than Fallingwater, which has had continual maintenance problems.See it, even if you don't care for house tours or Craftsman architecture.",mkt_travel

What a terrific experience! We started in the bookstore (once the garage), toured the outside of the house then had a wonderful tour of the inside of the house, seeing a number of rooms not always on the regular tour. John was extremely knowledgeable about art glass (of course!) as well as other aspects of the house. He has been a docent at the Gamble House for many years and the information he shared made the tour! We knew a fair bit about the Greene brothers and their architecture so going on this tour and walking the neighbourhood was a real treat. For those interested in the arts and crafts movement, architecture, woodworking, furniture design and/or art glass -- touring the Gamble House is a must! If you haven't been to the Gamble House, look at their website for directions and parking information.

This house is a wonder. Anyone interested in architecture or the decorative arts should see it. The Greene brothers designed the interior and all of the fixtures as well as the building itself. Lots of Tiffiny stained-glass, too. And a great gift-store in the old garage. If you can't be there for a tour, just stop by and walk around the house, looking in the windows where you can. Another note of interest: This was the exterior location for Dr. Emmet Brown's house in the 'Back to the Future' movies.",Regi184
40,Arts and Crafts style masterpiece,The winter/retirement home of the son of one of the Proctor & Gamble Company founders. Beautifully restored arts and crafts style home and furnishings. Authentic and mostly original. The home remained in the Gamble family until they turned it over to the City and USC. Thus the preservation is excellent. Well worth a visit. Contrast with the Wrigley Mansion/Tournament House --- located about one mile south. I would suggest visiting both. Be sure to call both as visiting days/hours are limited.,fromdelmar
