40,Extreme Beauty and peaceful,"The Topanga State Park is remarkable and easily accessed from the 405 highway. I would recommend great walking sneakers and dress accordingly as it can be cold and windy or hot and dry. I would also say to bring a good amount of water if out exploring because there is not much available. Bathrooms are a bit scarce also so maybe ""au natural"" is an option. Don't go hiking if you are inexperienced and your phone may or may not work in the canyons. Overall a very pleasant day trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3854JXmikes

50,Beautiful park and experience,"I am not an outdoorsy person by any means, but going on a hike here was one of the best, most challenging experiences - of my life! There was ample parking on a Tuesday morning, and there were several trails to choose from. We veered right and ended up on a 2.8 mile trek, which was steep at the start and end, but manageable in between. The end lookout was amazing and gave us an opportunity to stretch, sit and hydrate. Very convenient to have a restroom area as well. During the hike, we could hear the bees buzzing in unison in the bushes, and see so many lizards, butterflies, and even a rattlesnake on our way back down. Was just glad we didn't see any cats, as one friendly passerby mentioned seeing one a few feet off the trail. Two very obvious notes- bring plenty of water (there were two fountains we encountered, but both weren't working at the time) and wear sunscreen!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amart71

Do watch for deer, skunks, and rattlesnakes.

50,Great Paseo Miramar hike,Wanted to give great review for 50+ mom with twenty something kids hiking Paseo Miramar trail. First 1.4 miles is strenuous and straight up incline. Gets you to the topOf the ridge. It’s beautiful the entire hike w seeping views and wildflowers and lush green vegetation. We didn’t make it the 2.5 one way to the overlook but felt that was fine because we were at the top and views incredible. People there but not crowded. 3 miles round trip took 1.5 hours. Great morning. Then headed to Malibu Farm for amazing lunch and then time on the beach next to Malibu pier. Perfect day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dabuddy

40,Trail Hiking,"Actually I have not been on the trail for about six months at least. But from what I remember the trails are wide and I mean wide like a road. You can bike, you can hike, & it’s an easy easy trail. It’s so nice to get out in the open air. Views are beautiful. On one side you see all of the valley and many other little valleys. On the other side you see the ocean. You can actually hike down to the ocean if you want to. Or you can take one of the other trails and hike up to this great big huge rock. It’s a family fun family oriented place or singles or whatever. The best part is it’s really easy to get to. You feel like you’re way up in the mountains but you’re not...you’re just close to the valley between the beach and the valley. There’s also a little park inside the park & has benches and stuff where you can have a picnic. There are restrooms and I think they have drinking fountains but I’m not sure. The charge to park in the Park’s parking lot is five dollars. But you don’t have to park in the parking lot. Look for a space on the side of the road before you get there ... if you find a place on the side of the road pull over and park. FYI, after you enter the park to get to the trails there is a very steep hill but don’t let that deter you. If you go to the left it leads to many off shoot trails. If you go to the right it leads to some off shoot trails but it’s more of a shady hike (part way). Hope you have a great time. I always do every time I go. Oh, & be sure to bring water & wear sun block bcs it’s sunny & can get hot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/care558

50,"Outstanding views, great facilities","I brought my 6 year old here on a hike. We took the Eagle Rock trail (2 miles). It is a well maintained trail that isn’t too rough and is on a moderate incline on the way up. My son needed plenty of breaks but we made it all the way to the top and were rewarded with fantastic views. We also spotted deer, interesting bugs, lizards and birds. The restroom facilities were very clean and well stocked. The picnic area was lovely and shaded. There were also water fountains on site which was perfect for refilling our water bottle after a long hike. Parking was $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98haleyj

I was wrong, we made it to Eagle Rock and back down. It was a fun afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fahrtenhaler
40,Los Liones Canyon,"FINALLY had a chance to visit this place! Conveniently located by Santa Monica, this trail is definitely very popular. No mountain driving required either! I arrived around 8:30 AM on a Sunday and the parking lot was pretty full already. However, there are a few small parking areas and street parking is available as well so finding parking shouldn't be too bad. It also seems like there are several trailheads that take you to the lookout: the Los Liones Canyon Trailhead; from Paseo Miramar; and lastly from Trippet Ranch. This review is specifically from the Los Liones Canyon trailhead. Parking is free and no pass/permit is required. Restrooms (Yes, non-pit, flowing water toilets!) are available by the parking lots. There was also another structure that kind of looked like a restroom around mile 3.5. Didn't go into it so not quite sure about that one.Although I am a dog writing reviews (haha this account is under my dog's name), DOGS are NOT ALLOWED. It does mention near the parking lot that dogs must be kept on leash so they MAY be allowed in that area only. There is a sign at the trailhead that says dogs are NOT allowed. I have run across a few dogs and I'm not sure if they are service dogs but technically you can't hike with them here (don't know the restrictions for service dogs). Most state & national parks do not allow dogs and there are usually various reasons on why they're not allowed. It is a bummer for people who like to hike/run with their dogs, but at the same time there are PLENTY of trails nearby that welcome dogs. So no real reason to break the rules and bring fido to this one. Last thing you want is a ticket to ruin your hike/run!Now on to the details of the trail. It is approximately 4 miles to the lookout and there is somewhat of a ""mini"" lookout at around mile 1.5. The first 1.5 miles is a nice single track with some shade and a gradual climb. Past that point, the trail is pretty much a wide fire road that overlooks the mountains. The climb also becomes steeper. Unfortunately, it was pretty cloudy today when I got to the lookout and the views were somewhat limited so this review probably needs to be updated when I get a chance to revisit on a clear day! After visiting the lookout, I did a quick detour towards Trippet Ranch. I only went around 1.5 miles down this trail but it was a lot more peaceful and definitely had way less people!!Today was a trail run and with some detours and wrong turns, it ended up being a 11 mile run with 2,444 ft of elevation gain. Took about 2 hours roundtrip. The total hike/run should be around 8 miles or so if you go to the lookout and come back.All things considered, an ""OK"" for now. The amount of people was a bit too much for me but this could vary depending on the time and day of the week. I'd also love to revisit on a clear day to experience the wonderful views everyone is talking about!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jiro_Shiba

50,Fantastic hike!,"Of all the hikes in LA, we chose this one because it seemed to be the least crowded and the most natural. We started from the Trippett Ranch Trailhead and went up the Eagle Springs Fire Road to Eagle Rock. This 2 mile route was on a wide fire road and featured an 800 foot elevation change. Eagle Rock was a beautiful destination with sweeping views. We went back down via the Musch trail (2.5 miles). We were surprised by the difference in foliage and terrain. Glad we did a loop so that we could experience the different scenery. All told, we spent about 3 hours hiking. It was a great experience! MUCH less crowded than the hiking trails in Hollywood.

You should also wear hiking shoes/boots - Yeah, I slipped & fell wearing sneaks. We probably spent 2 hours total....starting at Musch Trail & almost getting to Eagle Rock. There are some steep parts of the trail, but for the most part is easy-moderate.There are also so many other trails you can go on, but we definitely recommend the one we took. Very scenic....we got great photographs & a good work out.Go to Topanga Living Cafe after for an amazing healthy meal, delicious coffee or a smoothie...nom - we just happened to stumble across it after our hike & it was exactly what we were craving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weberemk

It has many more trails of varying lengths and difficulties than we could take advantage of--it even has a campground. We walked a relatively flat 2-mile loop and then broke out a picnic basket at one of the many shaded tables to enjoy some bread and cheese and fruit.

Our stop here ended up being much more than we expected, and in a good way. The guide at the entrance suggested hiking to Eagle Rock. It was absolutely a beautiful hike at a moderate difficulty and certainly worth the time. It took us about 2.5 - 3 hours at a leisurely pace. Definitely wear sneakers. So many people ahead of us were turning back before they got to the rock because it's hard to gauge when you'll finally get to it so DON'T GIVE UP!! When you feel like you're never going to get there is literally right up the hill and around the corner and it's worth every effort!

You get there via the kind of mountain highway used in commercials for sports cars. In this sense, the journey is part of the destination. We had a little trouble finding it at first, because there was a sign about the forest fire risk level that was actually quite a bit south of ""Entrada Road"", where turn off route 27. You drive up a fair bit on Entrada before making it to the park. You can avoid the $10 parking fee by parking right on the side of the mountain near the entrance, but we weren't ready to live that dangerously with the rental car. In the park, we liked how there are many trails and distances you can choose. We walked just a mile or so each way with the kids, and got to see a lot of views, even though it wasn't all the way to a particular marker. Lots of friendly folks out and about.

40,one of many beautiful parks in the greater LA area,"A lovely park with access to the backbone trail, a hiking trail with mountain and ocean views that runs from Will Rogers state park in the Palisades all the way to the ocean past Malibu and Leo Carrillo state park at Point Magoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobH105
50,Great hike (moderate),"First, the drive to Topanga State Park by itself is very nice. Once you arrive, the hike is very nice too. It is not too difficult and I saw some families with kids at the Eagle Rock. The trail to Eagle Rock is only 2.2 miles but be prepared to spend at least 1.5 hours for each way. As others have remarked, the view from Eagle Rock is breathtaking and you have to experience it. I took some pictures but it does not even come close to describing my experience.Tips: Take a bottle of water. I had a large bottle and finished it all. And there are no restrooms once you depart the parking lot. Even more important. There is a $10 parking fee that you have to enclose in an envelope (available on site). Make sure that you have a $10 bill with you and a pen. They do accept personal checks. There is free parking on the street outside in case you do not have money which is fine since you are going to hike anyway. But if you want to use the parking lot, you must have the $10 bill and a pen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodman1
50,A short drive in the park,We drove through Topanga State Park while in LA. Lots of interesting views from the main route and nice sightseeing. To be done once in a life..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alain19531207
40,Great Views - Good Trails,"We just got off the plane and had to kill a few hours before meeting family at dinner, so we decided to drive up here and take a hike. We're crazy like that. The views are amazing and the trails weren't too challenging. California is in a drought though, so there wasn't any water to see. Creeks were pretty empty. We didn't bother to try the waterfall trail since we figured it was probably dried up anyway.Only downside is you have to pay $10 for parking and it's through some weird envelope system, meaning you'd have to have exact change or a check on you (being that it was our first visit, we had no idea). Luckily we had a bunch of 1 dollar coins that we got from a vending machine earlier that morning. Would be nice if they had an actual person so you can get change, otherwise we would have been out of luck if we didn't happen to have those coins on us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsween13

20,Typical Rude Californian Pretty Boy,"We have liked this beach in years past. We tried to visit again and had difficulty determining if our dog could come with us. We looked at some signs coming from the parking lot, attempting to understand the situation and did not see anything about dogs. However, we got down the stairs and were greeted by a sneering, condescending California Pretty Boy lifeguard who decided to point to a mosaic that was supposed to represent a no dog policy. It was not a clear depiction. We apologized and went on our way - we don't push our dog on anyone and had no need of being insulted. I would not trust that boy to save a life unless it was convenient for him.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KcgCO

It was an artists' enclave back in the days, which means it is now full of rich people, but there's still cool stuff. The trails are nice, there are often vendors along the side of the road (this is how I obtained a very nice set of hot sauces), towards the southern end there are restaurants and shops, and it feeds right into the Pacific Coast Highway and Malibu, so you can experience trees and mountains and beaches all in one go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dietcoupon

You get some great views on LA and surrounding country during the hike a fantastic overlook at the end towards the ocean and the city. You have to bring water and food yourself and enjoy the solitude. When I was there during the week in the morning I ran only into three other hikers and this only a few minutes away from LA :-).

50,A spectacular hike in the Malibu/West Lake Village Area.,"Topanga state park is definitely worth a visit when in the Malibu area. I hiked to Eagle Rock and back from Tippets Ranch. It's about 5 miles round trip. We got there about 3 hours before sunset and got back in plenty of time on a hot day. The views from Eagle Rock are breath-taking and the rock itself has quite a cliff on one side. There were no readily available maps or staff to be found. There aren't too many trails, so you're not really going to get lost, but it's always good to have a map. We took the Musch trail up and the fire road back. We saw lots of lizards and a few birds. No snakes.There were plenty of bathrooms.We parked outside the parking lot for free because were weren't sure if we were going to be done hiking by the time they closed the gate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UncleCaveBear

We had brought snacks and water and although it was heavy to carry at first, we went through everything we brought. The hike had some beautiful views of the city, the ocean and of the natural area. It certainly gave a person a view of what the area looked like prior to the city being built up. The view from the rock was quite spectacular as well. It certainly was a good hike as everyone felt it the next day. It was a great family event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BOBBYGHollywood

Be prepared with water and a quick snack! Average 3-4 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lcollazo23
50,Took A Hike!,"I did a long hike up Trippett Ranch Trail up to Eagle Rock, where I did see and hear, in fact, a number of eagles. There were beautiful vistas, often on both sides, aside from a large variety of plant life and birds. The hike, overall, was quite challenging, but was on quite secure terrain, following the system of fire roads that were forged around the canyon. That being said, it was mostly an uphill climb up to Eagle Rock. Having gone as far as the rock, I stopped for a breather and proceeded up to the higher peaks and did the extra three mile loop.Was a bit nervous about the warnings about rattle snakes and mountain lions, but persevered, seeing other people seemed to have survived. There were many opportunities to go off trail, but I resisted the temptation (fear of the snakes). I was happy to see a state park ranger pass by by truck part way through my hike (never know when one might sprain an ankle), a jogger older than me on the most remote part of the trail, and the occasional cyclist. All encouraged me to finish the eight or so miles with gusto.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbilmer
50,The Musch Trail in Topanga State Park is the way to go!,"The Musch Trail is definitely the most scenic way to get up to Eagle Rock. The trail winds through the natural vegetation. You get a chance to get to see the flowers, oaks and of course the poison oak up close.I volunteer in the park and our group, the Topanga Canyon Docents, have free 2 hour guided walks every Sunday starting at 10:00 at the Trippet Ranch parking lot. The walks run from January though June. Walking with a guide gives you a great way to get to know and appreciate the plants, animals and history of the park. Its one thing to go for a hike in the woods but walking the trails and being able to see and identify the flowers such as the Sticky Monkeyflower, Black Sage, Yucca Whippli and Popcorn Flower make the walk special.Happy trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110genec

40,Loads of mountain biking if you have time to explore..!,I have hired a bike from Topanga Creek Bicycles several times to ride the 10 mile loop through the park and it's a great way to spend an hour or two.

I will not say the trail is easy, but there are some spots on the way where you can stop in the shade. It seemed to me like a cardio trail, with numerous inclines and some flat trail. Most of the trail is an old non concrete motor-able road that is not maintained any more. Saw lot of bicyclists on their mountain bikes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bikramdas
50,near to LA and heaven too,"Aside Runyon Canyon, there aren't a lot of places where you can be in pure nature and still be a hop-skip from the Strip. Topanga is one of the options you have, and it is lovely. Trails are varied and reasonably well-marked, there are 36 miles of them, you can go for hours and not see another hiker (depending on the time of day and season of year of course), the vistas are vida pura. Officially no charge for entrance but parking fees are high. You can reduce with yearly or other specialized passes, or park outside the entrance area. Dogs regrettably not allowed, but that may be a good thing, since rattlesnakes reside here. Pay attention.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParoleAnima

40,"Great outdoors, but watch out for lack of knowledgable rangers.","We hiked to eagle rock on a beautiful Sunday morning in September. The views were tremendous, as was the $10 fee to park ! How in the world do they not include a trail map with that fee??? It was about 85 degrees that day and even though we specifically asked the ranger about the degree of difficulty of the eagle fire trail she shrugged here shoulders and said it wouldn't be a problem. Wrong ! There's almost no shade on this 2-mile uphill trek (plus 2 miles back down), and the canyon and rocky trail emit tremendous heat. We weren't the only hikers wilting. Young (mid-to-late twenties) women and a young couple with babies were equally delirious. By the way, why wouldn't they install a bench or two along the way to sit on?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Irreverent-in-Cleve

50,On a clear day...,"You can see forever, but such was not the case. Still, an overcast day can equate to excellent hiking conditions! Trail to Eagle Rock was via Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park at end of Reseda Blvd off Ventura 101 frwy. Parking was free, or pay a fee for slots near trailhead. A popular hiking spot on weekends so arrive early for primo parking. Sorry, no dogs allowed on trails, a pit toilet near trailhead and another can be found less than 3 miles in on the fire road.Hike was almost 8 miles r/t, approx.1100 ft gain and took over 3.5 hours to complete at a leisurely pace with rest stops. A nice, uphill trek so bring enough water to stay hydrated. Not much shade can be found, but proximity to the ocean offered occasional breezes. Although hazy, we could make out PV and Catalina Island in the distance, nice!Lots of photo ops on and off Eagle Rock and you can't miss it, it's an eye-catcher! Enjoy the view and rest assured, it's a mostly downhill trek back to the car!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shimadog

40,Urban delight,"A fine place to get away for a few hours or an afternoon without burning up a lot of $5 gas. The parking is a little steep but the upside is that it goes to the parks which we think is an important investment. It seems ok to park outside of the Park itself if the cost is too high.We did an hour's hike and took some pictures and got away from the city, stretched our legs and enjoyed it all very much. Hiking can be on trails or primitive off trail which which might not be so good for erosion.We appreciate the pet restrictions. Their scent, noises and marking are disruptive to wildlife. We have returned often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaguaroJoe
20,Very Disappointing,"We found that many people were parking on the side of road, and realised why when we drove up to the State Park car park. Having had to drive a fair distance to find anywhere green to walk in LA, the charge for the car park was a little steep at $10. It was a good job we didn't pay, as the State Park doesn't allow pets. I can understand that the State will have had problems with irresponsible owners in the past, and I guess these kind of rules are becoming inevitable - the few spoil it for the many. The signs explaining that the State Park considerd dogs to be carriers of disease was upsetting enough for us to want to leave anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RossiniKervene

Just a short distance from some of the best evening dining spots, try Froggy's Topanga Fish Market or Abuelita's Mexican Restaurant.

40,Ocean Views & Deer!,"For locals or out-of-towners, this is a great place to experience scenic views and nature without a lot of travel. Hikers take note and go early in the day. Much of the area is fully exposed and temps can get very warm. Sunscreen, cool clothes, wide brim hats and lots of extra water are recommended from April through October. Mountain bikers love the area but you can easily share the road since much of the travel is done along wide fire roads and pathways. The terrain is challenging at times. There are many steep climbs.Just getting there is fun! Drive up through Topanga Canyon to start your hike from Trippet Ranch. Do some research and pick a route that suits your group. For instance, you can hike to Eagle Rock by going up the fire road then back down the Musch trail to create a loop.There are bathrooms at the Trippet Ranch parking lot and new bathrooms are under construction at ""The Hub"" where you'll also find a new shady resting place with giant map of the area. Bring your own map, anyway. While some trails are well marked, it's always a good idea to be prepared.Some vantage points offer scenic ocean views and cool breezes and if you are lucky, you may see some of the many mule deer that live in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Actual_User

Our hike was from a parking lot along the Musch trail. There was no ranger to offer directions. There were no visible maps posted so I didn't know what our hiking choices were but the trail said 2.0 miles to Eagle Junction and 2.5 miles to Eagle Rock. The trail was easy to follow but this was July and hot and I'm 55 years old! My son is 21 and he was fine. I would hike this hike again if I were in the Malibu area but honestly, it doesn't hold a candle to Big Basin Redwoods, California's first state park. There was a drinking fountain that worked along the way, a nice touch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneM49
50,Beautiful hike with lots of sunshine and wildflowers.,"Following advice from the internet, we did the hike to Eagle Rock by going up the fire road then back down the Musch trail to create a loop. We had hoped to get an early start since people had said the fire road gets very warm on a sunny day. However we didn't get started until after noon and it was hot. Still it was an absolutely beautiful day. There were all kinds of wildflowers in bloom and birds singing. We also saw a couple of lizards. My husband & I are in our 50s and our son and his girlfriend in their 20s were with us. We completed the loop in less than 3 hours with a few stops to look at the vistas, drink some water, check out the birds and flowers and a few minutes on Eagle Rock to enjoy the moment. This hike was well worth the effort and one of our LA highlights. Even the drive along the Pacific to get there was beautiful.

At about 9 p.m., we started up the trail and headed up to the point where the fire road meets the main trail. At this spot, you can look out and see the ocean and all of LA. Simply wonderful! The hike was fairly strenuous toward the top, but definitely worth it. The trail continues from there a long way up to Parker Mesa, but for a night hike, I'd recommend doing something fairly short (because you can't see where you're going as well in the dark!). It was a very neat experience, and a beautiful park.Word of warning, though: You will get a parking ticket if your car is there after hours. This happened to us.

40,Beautiful views,"There were many trails available. We hiked to Eagle Rock which was about a 4.5 mile hike, round trip. There were many places to stop and look at the views on the way up, however it was a rather hazy day so the views were somewhat limited. This particular hike definitely got the heart rate up (coming from someone who does cardio on a daily basis), however we had some people in the group that are out of shape and they were able to complete the hike as well (at a slower pace with several breaks). The park was rather difficult to find (it took us two attempts) but it was well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csebourn
50,Memorable views near LA,"This park is about a 40 minutes from Los Angeles, and it's not hard to find. You can choose from among about 5-6 trails that range from 1 mile to nearly 10. No matter what you choose, you get to hike up and down valleys and canyons, while watching canyons across the way. The trails are well-maintained and moderately steep, but you're not climbing over boulders or logs; I did about 4 miles in sandals. When you've had enough of crowded city stuff on your visit, check this out for the afternoon, and then hang out at Topanga Beach (15-minute drive) for a well-deserved ice cream or beer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allen1000
