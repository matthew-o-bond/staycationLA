40,Grandkids love this place,"I bring my 9, 7, and 5 year old grandsons and they live this park. The island gives them plenty of things to do and the off island playground is pretty fun also. Could use more places to sit and watch kids, but the cleanliness of the park ( except the skanky lake water) is acceptable. Just watch for the duck poop!",Gary I
40,Fun Place For Kids,"Great play equipment for kids and the island is very clean. Lots of ducks. Very cute buildings, lots of room. Great for photos.",createandcapturelife
50,"Fun for Kids and fa,o;u","Endless play house, ponds with turtles, ducks and a baseball field. This park is great. The kids love to play hide and seek in all the play areas. The park is really popular with wedding people and quincenera folks who want to take pictures. Saturday is not the best day to go because you will be fighting the crowd of bridal parties taking photos. Huge area for the kids to run around and and some picnic tables. On Thursdays in the summer they have concert in the park at 6pm. They always bring great performers",aanyiam02
40,Great Park with Ducks and Turtles,"My grandson loves Heritage Park in Cerritos. It has everything you want in a park. There is a large pond with ducks and turtles. The one thing that would be great is if they kept that area a little cleaner, and of course people could help with that by not leaving food and bags around the area.This is a great place for a picnic or just to spend several hours and let the kids run. There are plenty of play areas. Parking can be trying, so be patient, you will find a spot.You will have a great time here. It is safe and the visitors are pleasant. Take your kids and go.",elizabethlascheid
40,Daughter loves it here.,The pond scares me since there is no fence or anything around it stopping my incredibly fast toddler from running right into it. I have to literally keep her on a leash around the pond. Ducks and turtles are very fun to watch. Last time we were there we saw these huge fish in the pond coming up for some food someone was throwing in the pond. I agree human food should not be thrown into the pond. Parking is tough during busy times.,Little Debbie
40,Duck pond,Nice park for the kids. Pond is smelly. People tend to feed the duck with human food. Droppings all over the place. Needs a good cleaning or forbid the feeding.,HenryjrH
50,Summer outing-thursdays,"We were very fortunate to have been invited by the our son and his family ,to be be part of the Thursday picnic at the park.There were different activities that were hired ,it was festive safe and very pleasant.The kids played in the park and ate their dinners.we also celebrated our different birthdays at the event.we met other familiar families and think its an amazing stet up and activity for the kids.",Kasturi S

50,What A Great Park,We stopped by the park to eat lunch after walking the nearby sculpture garden. We were really impressed with the new playground equipment and the village area. Looks like a really great place to have a picnic and for kids around 5-10 yo. The picnic areas are reservable so that is nice. The parking is somewhat limited for such a nice family oriented park.,BoboTravlr
50,Unique park that is super fun!,The grandkids love climbing and exploring the little New England village on the island or just playing on the more traditional playground nearby.,JudyBellflower
50,Great for Big Office Picnics,"We have our annual picnic here. The park is spacious with the following facilities: tennis courts, playgrounds for children, running track, Baseball field, volleyball area, shelter areas for your picnics and BBQ pits. Bathrooms are clean and accessible.",Brook P
20,After the 4th of July,"We went for a small picnic after the 4th of July, and we were sickened about how messy the whole park was, even the pond where the ducks and turtles swim and live was a discussing mess, water was full of trash, and thick with green sludge, it was a hot day and the turtles were sunning on the rocks, it hardly looked like any of them could move in the water! The Animal Saftey needs to go there and rescue those poor animals until they can clean up the parks water!",Michelle M
40,Bday party,"Nice , clean with Basketball courts for kids to play. A small lake with swans and island with a bridge. Also good to walk around the lake .",evelyn284
50,Fun and Educational,We loved Heritage Park! There was so much to see and do for all ages. The staff was all very friendly and knowledgeable giving us a great idea of how things were in the past. The food at the Club Cafe was delicious and the park was so clean. It had some of the best Canadian souvenirs we saw and regret not buying more while we were there. We definitely hope to return on our next trip to Western Canada!,Stephanie B

On top of that there is a moat filled with ducks.There are other offerings for sports in this complex making it versatile for all ages.It is very picturesque and many times you will find wedding and prom groups taking pictures in the area.,dankit1
40,If you have kids or grandkids.....,this is a great park to visit.....the island is wonderful for kids to run around and explore all the structuresand it gives the parents/grandparents an opportunity to teach a little history.....the water is so fun because the kids can feed the ducks and geese and follow them as they swim around the island....the park has a wonderful playground to get the kids worn out...and then you can have a picnic lunch on one of the many shaded or sunny benches,radcar
50,Great Family Park!,"This park has something for everyone. It has a duck pond, there are cute ducks and turtles there in the water, and in the middle of the pond is an island that you can get to over a neat bridge. On the island there's a cool stone building that the kids love to play in.The park is noted because it also offers lots of grassy areas for picnicking, two separate playground areas for the kids, and the best part of all, they rent out community center rooms right on the premises.You can use these rooms for family gatherings like birthday parties, baby showers, or whatever you want and the rooms hold varying numbers of people. There's a smaller room for only 25 people and two larger rooms (I think) that hold up to 50-75 people if needed. For a modest amount you can reserve these rooms for your event but you need to reserve EARLY! Plenty of parking for your guests and you can do all you clean up there. The rooms have kitchens too, if you are serving food to your guests, and each has access to a restroom nearby.We used this place for my daughter in law's baby shower and had a wonderful time. We had some time before our event to come in and decorate the room and it turned out great! We have also had several family picnics on the grassy areas (there are lots to choose from) and our kids LOVE the playgrounds and the island.Check out this local park that is surprisingly close.",fyremaven
50,Great Park to take kids or grand kids any day,"One of my favorite parks for kids when they were growing up twenty years ago and now for grand kids when they happen to be in town.

You walk into what looks like a barn; beyond that are jungle gyms inside mini buildings! Hard to explain, you'd have to check it out for yourself! I've also seen lots of photo shoots done there due to the beautiful landscape! A must if you're visiting, or passing by Cerritos!",Erica R

40,very nice venue and park facilities,"colonial themed park with buildings on an island in the middle. Two bridge entries to island with small private event venue on the island. I had my sister's baby shower there and was pleasantly surprised. Although there is no running water so had to work with a water jug. Playground areas have rubber ground, but still plenty of grass to run around on. Book your picnic space way in advance - they fill up fast!",Debbie S
40,History made fun for the kids,"This is a beautiful park with a lovely pond. This has a wonderful sculpture of Paul Revere, miniature village surrounding the Old North Church, were Paul Revere hung the famous lantern! One if by land, two if by sea! Bring the kids, some bread or crackers for the birds. You may even see a species of bird you've never seen before. Bring a picnic lunch, and be prepared to spend a lot of time here, either with the kids, or even a date. I enjoyed just walking around taking in the sites and sounds of the part. I was even fortunate enough to come upon a young man proposing near the water wheel. Romantic. Come for the day, you will enjoy yourself!",charlottesl

This place has great play ground for kids.",francesychen
40,Nice park - quick lunch....now I don't like music,"I worked in SFS for years and found this park so relaxing and quiet to either bring my lunch or purchase their weekly specials from the little cafe. Now they have changed restaurant services, which is more Mexican themed and they play loud music. It no longer has the quiet visiting element. I was meeting a friend on Fridays to visit and catch up. We probably will meet someplace else.",mom4tim
50,Awesome park!,"This is a great park for families with young children ages 1 to 12. The Island is a facsimile of late 18th Century Boston - the time of the Revolutionary war. It has buildings for the children to play in and slides and bridges that connect levels of the island. The island is surrounded by a moat that is home to fish, ducks, and turtles. All of interest to young children. There are several playgrounds with creative play equipment. This is the location for Thursday evening Concerts in the Park during the summer months. Definitely a great park for families.",MajMom96

50,Super Park With A History Lesson.,"""Listen my children and you shall hear, of the midnight ride of Paul Revere, on the 18th of April in '75, hardly a man is now alive.......Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote that poem to tell the story of Paul Revere's ride. This park plays tribute to our founding fathers and Revolutionary Boston and Paul Revere. There is a bronze statue of Paul Revere on horseback to welcome you to Heritage Park.As you cross the Charlestown Bridge (""and I on the opposite shore will be..."") you can see the spire of the Old North Church up on the island's hill. Walking along the path you come into historic Boston town. The church, and all the towns shops have playground equipment inside the buildings. There is a slide down from the steeple, there is a ship in the harbor, and cannons all over the hill protecting the Town of Boston.A great park paying tribute to our revolutionary heritage. You might want to do a little study about Paul Revere before you visit, the kids are going to ask you some questions.",Joe K
40,"Heritage Park, Cerritos","Great Park! We love the Island. My family and I have been coming to this park for 26 years. It's the best park around by far.

50,Beautiful,Both my kids loved it. Very well kept park. We will definitely come back. It was worth the drive. Very multi cultural. It has 3 playgrounds.,Sandra H
40,Impressive but crowded,Beautiful park across the street from Cerritos high school. This center island is the main attraction with old town new england-style buildings that have slides and playground built into it. Fun to explore with young children.The playground off the island has been recently updated with padded flooring so no longer wood chips. Also basketball courts that are pretty busy and a softball field.Great to visit and to take pictures for people visiting from out of town. It can get really crowded on the weekends which is the main downside.,Allmotorking
40,Interesting place to relax,"This is a small community park but a nice place to enjoy the nature.Tons of ducks enjoy the pond in the park. Though some of them are noisy, seeing them swimming in pairs or in a group at sunrise or sunset is for sure a moment full of joy.This park is also for people with a big heart. They come to feed the ducks all the time. With stable food sources, no wonder the ducks call here their home.Unfortunately the small house was closed when I was there so I didnt have a chance to visit the bridge and the small island connecting to the small house. I am not sure if access is available to the small house, as for sure I was there during the business hours which the facility is supposed to be open.",flora z
40,Great park to visit with children.,Nice park to visit in Cerritos and great to bring children. There is a pond and miniature buildings to climb on.

50,Historical,"Used to go here all the time as a kid. It has changed, modernized and of course improved for safety, but still pretty unique. The middle is an island and you go check out the history. There are little buildings and it looks like an old ghost town. When I was a kid the middle church used to have a ladder whcih you could climb the inside of the stiple... now it's clsoed off.",Fernando J

50,Beautiful,Its a beautiful park that's fun for the whole family and children of all ages yes the lake isn't crystal clear its a green color but really what lake isn't its home to many ducks and turtles so what do you expect I could honestly say its the best park I've ever been to.,Desiree M

50,Fun for all,"This is a great park for all. Well maintained and staff is always on site to answer questions. The only downside of park is parking can be tough on a beautiful sunny day.A must is going to the ""island"" lots of stuff for little ones to do and explore. This is a very picturesque park so don't be surprised to see lots of photographers here taking wedding, prom, family portraits....",J M
50,A wonderful place for fun and learning,"Going to Heritage Park not only is a place to play and what a place but you can learn a little bit of history. The island is a recreation of Boston even has Paul Revere riding his horse. The kids can climb in the north church, slide down an incredible enclosed slide and just be kids. They can shoot a pretend cannon. Along the island you will find ducks to feed, also some turtles. A great playground, basketball courts and picnic shelters. Come here on a Thursday evening for free summer concerts and some great food venues.",genealogygail
50,Great park,"Feed ducks, play tag or hide and seek in the castle, play on the playgrounds, play baseball, even check out a football and toss it around, this park has pretty much everything. And free concerts in the summer. Get an ice cream at the trucks.",htwh
20,Murky Swamp!,"Staying at the Sheraton Cerritos and wanted to find a place for an early morning walk. We saw that this park was really close by, so we headed there. Bad idea! Walkway surrounding the swampy, filthy, black, smelly, moat that in turn surrounds the most interesting part of the park which was blocked by a locked gate that wouldn't open till 10am was littered with bird and duck droppings. Very unpleasant experience. Why is the best part of the park not open till 10am?",BetterDavid
50,Wonderful way to teach children history,"This park is great. The children love it from the ducks to the fort they are never ready to leave. The City of Cerritos keeps their parks beautifully maintained and Heritage Park is one of many great parks in the city.It is a great venue for any event, from a birthday party to a family reunion or just a day in the park. You won't be disappointed.",katnsocal
50,Let the kids have fun,"In the middle of the park is an island, a recreation of Boston and Paul Revere, slides, climbers, tunnels you name it. Every Thursday night during the summer there are free concerts. A real treat",genealogygail
50,The kids are always eager to go there,"The kids call it Castle Park, but I've yet to find the castle. They gleefully wander and climb through the buildings on the island. The little ones never tire of feeding the huge flock of ducks and coots, but those birds are getting a bit brave, and so watch your backside.",Paul T
40,Very crowded,"ducks, little houses they were like a village, play ground equipment. This park has heavy use and shows it. Would look for a different park next time. It is very cute and maybe a different day other than a Saturday would be better.",Babs074
50,Great family fun,"This park has a nice duck and turtle pond, and lots of grass to run around in. Children can climb in and out of slides , monkey bars, swings , and more. Also great place for a picnic.",bruinrx
40,Kids love this play,"You see little turtles in the pond and there is a sculpture that allows kids to explore, but don't let them out of your sight since they may decide to take the slide and if you're not quick enough you'll have to hunt them down. I would say it is safer for older tykes not babies.",LizC2012
50,Amazing park,Great Park especially for the kids. I am the photographer for the City of Cerritos and it's always a joy to come out to this park to shoot and or relax.

40,Great park for the kids,"This park has an island; all the buildings on the island are set to the theme of Paul Revere.

Concerts in the park during the summer. Picnic areas and large playground are also available. You should also visit the Cerritos library a block north of the park, all ages will enjoy the displays and large fish aquarium.",brenda_w_90803
50,This is one A-MAZING park!,"So, my family has lived here for almost 20 years, and there are still things I'm discovering around here whenever I visit! I JUST discovered Heritage Park because I was meeting my good friend and her family there.Seriously.. this place is amazing! It's a regular park (as in, you drive there and park for free and walk around with your kids feeding the geese, ducks; climb stairs to slide down the slide, etc.), except it looks like a miniature Boston! You sort of feel like you need to pay admission to come here--but you don't have to! :o) The park is made up of many ""miniature"" landmarks (big enough to house a large slide or jungle gym); there is an old-fashioned cobblestone street with doors and signs above each door that say ""Cobbler"", ""Bookkeeper and Binder"", etc., a new England style church with a steeple that kids can slide out of...The ""park proper"" is like the entire park structure is built atop a large lake, which is home to many kinds of birds (including ducks and geese) and even turtles! There are mini waterfalls and beautiful landscaping. We had a little picnic lunch at some tables. It was a sort of rainy day, so the park wasn't crowded at all (us and maybe one other family). I can imagine this place getting crazy when there are lots of kids, though. BEAUTIFUL park! It's across the street from Cerritos HS and just down the street from Cerritos' WONDERFUL library! If you visit this park, then you definitely need to make time to visit the library--it's like a mini amusement park in itself!Cerritos is chock full of shopping areas with LOTS of restaurants, places to hang out and walk, or park yourself with a laptop in a coffee shop. It's really a beautiful place to live. While it may not be a travel destination for most, it is a great place to check out if you're in the area. Close to Disneyland, Knotts, etc. Many little pockets of shopping areas and movie theaters.",CLaw_9
