40,Beautiful urban development,"Long Beach waterfront and downtown area are really worth visiting. The waterfront park provides a nice venue to stroll, or ride a bicycle. One can go from the dedicated path on the beach, through Shoreline with its restaurants by the water, through the park, and even the small shopping’s outlets across the street. Walking in the park by the water also leads to the beautiful Long Beach Aquarium: a must see. One can also easily take a ferry to Catalina not to far away. To come here from an other area in Los Angeles, one can easily take the Metro Blue Line all the way to the end and arrive in downtown Long Beach.

40,Better experienced than described,"The Long Beach Waterfront is an amazing place to spend a relaxed day. Perhaps the best way to discover the waterfront is by taking a stroll or a bicycle ride on the boardwalk – the Rainbow Harbour Esplanade, starting from Shoreline Village.The boardwalk runs by the side of Rainbow Harbour and Marina. The harbor and marina are teeming with photo opportunities literally at every step you take. The marina is your start point if you are looking to go whale watching, paddle boarding, kayaking.As you walk the boardwalk, you continue to see shops on the one side and the marina on the other. As you keep walking, the shops become fewer until they disappear altogether. Even as you walk, you can see Lighthouse Park across the harbor.Along the boardwalk, you will find rentals for powerboats, pontoon boats, jet skis, surf boards, sailboats, charters including fishing boats and catamarans.The Rainbow Harbour Esplanade connecting the harbor to Shoreline Park is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy harbor views even as you take that relaxed stroll. You can see fishing boats, large yachts, speed boats all cruise the harbor.The colourful bridges throughout the Esplanade offer great photo opps. From the Esplanade you can easily get to the Aquarium of the Pacific, Southern California’s largest – home to some 11000 animals across 50 exhibits.One of the very interesting features we found on the Esplanade is a series of panels about the 2,225 nautical mile Transpacific Yacht Race from Long Beach to Honolulu, an event that dates back to 1906! It traces the fascinating evolution of the race in 10-year intervals starting 1900-1909 through 2010-2019.You can also catch some interesting performances at The Off-Boardwalk Theatre - we saw a really high energy music performance where the small audience was as involved as the musicians themselves!Keep walking and you eventually get to where the Queen Mary is berthed – now the Hotel Queen Mary. This British luxury liner has been berthed in Long Beach since 1967. This is a floating museum and if you have the time, you can go aboard to learn more about its storied history. The Queen Mary is a favourite attraction with its 347 staterooms, fine restaurants, spa, shops and magnificent ocean views.Grassy Lighthouse Park is perhaps one of the most restful areas of the Long Beach waterfront. While you cannot climb the lighthouse, the small peninsula on which it stands is very popular for skateboarding, picnicking, and for amazing views of the harbor and the Queen Mary.The Long Beach waterfront is better experienced than described – whether it’s a relaxed day you’re looking for or an adrenaline-charged one, you’ll get it here.",TMenon

40,Miles of beautiful trails for bikes and joggers,"I couldn't resist the opportunity to take a jog on the pathways here, and I'm not even a jogger.

50,Toddler and teen,"We got there at 5pm. It was good timing to see the sunset.Parking: there are public parkings that you pay depending in the time you want to stay. Aprox 5 dlls. Recommend to have a debit or credit card the machine didn’t accept change for the moment.Place: If you have little kids like us we recommend the stroller. There are different shopping stores with lots of things. Pubs with good music and restaurant. Restrooms were clean also. There is an arcade. The carrousel is 2 dlls. It’s a nice place to have dinner, take pictures and walk. Walk a lot. You can do window shopping if you want. The shops are like museams. Very unique. You can walk to the light house. It’s not a must do, but if you are near go and see it. My toddler love seeing the boats, birds, etc. and my teen daughter taking pictures.Sorry a forgot to say you can take tours on boats and rent electronic scooters.",CaroToFlo
30,Time to kill,"If you’re going to turn up for you flight from LAX early then this location is an ideal stop off to while away an hour or two.Walk along the marina, take in the sights of the harbour or even take a boat trip around the harbour, it’s up to you.Otherwise unless you want to visit the Queen Mary or the Aquarium there’s no need to make a special trip here",Dr3w66
20,"So Dirty, Trash Everywhere","This was the dirtiest waterfront location I have ever saw. There was so much trash floating in the water, all around the boardwalk area and all around all the nice boats. I was there for a week, and never once did you see anyone picking up the trash or scooping it out of the water. I will probably never return to Long Beach, so rundown.",Love2TravelUS
30,Just ok,"My mission this summer was to visit Jersey beaches I had not been to. So, we went to Long Branch...While it resembles Westfield with a beach, upscale stores and eateries it was very crowded and even congregated in the retail area. I was there on a Tuesday afternoon in August. Food was average, ate at McCloones. My opinion-visit once because after all it’s not bad and scenery is pretty.",Tracee J

40,Gorgeous for a run,"Stayed in Long Beach for a week right across from the waterfront. Loved the variety of shops and restaurants. Also, lots of walking and running paths along the waterfront & by the lighthouse. Enjoyed early morning runs there. Just a note-there appear to be a few homeless people in the area but they were friendly and didn’t approach me while running in the mornings. A number of fisherman were up early too so it made the run interesting and comfortable.",Lorie R
50,A visit into the West Coast - New Englander LightHouse,"This is a place not far from my Home in Long Beach. It is always a romantic venture when I come to the Shoreline and see couples taking a stroll or Fishermen taking their chances at casting their rod into the waters of Long Beach. I myself take my dogs down to the Oceans edge and take in the sweet ocean breeze while walking along the Rocky seashore on one side of me and the Long Beach Marina on the other side! It seems like a lot of people get away from the City atmosphere and can get a Oceanic experience while taking in the sites of the Queen Mary and the Long Beach Aquarium situated right here by the Lighthouse. A place where there is a lot of History of our most Wonderful Long Beach, CA , if you need a place to relax and enjoy the scenery~ Come on down.",Robert C
40,Well worth while,"The water front is well worth while. Parking in a garage can be a bit hard, Go early and you will get a space. Very busy on the weekends. Buba Gump Shrimp is worth while. Take a harbor tour.",happytoberetired
40,"Attractive and pleasant, near the aquarium","My teenage daughter and I spent the day at the aquarium (and loved every minute!), but just wanted to wander a bit before dinner.

50,A lovely surprise!,"We had no idea this existed. No one in my social group had ever mentioned Long Beach, I cannot think why not. It is modern and very well laid out with lots of restaurants to choose from.",Niggle

30,Great spot to walk and explore the board walk on a sunny day,"We were in town for the day on a cruise ship and spent time walking around exploring the surrounds on the marina, shops and had lunch as well.Plenty of big name restaurant's to choose from along the board walk.

40,"Nice waterfront, not too sure about the beach","Long Beach has mainly a lovely, interesting waterfront, with a good mix of industrial and pleasure areas.We were rather disappointed at the beach. It is a lovely beach, very long and bordered by houses/apartments rather than Macdonald, Starbuck etc BUT we realise that sand is difficult to walk on, but did Long Beach have to install concrete paths, one for walkers and the other for skateboarders etc? Those 2 concrete paths, yard after yard, really spoiled the look of the beach. How much nicer it would have been with paving of some type instead of concrete. There weren't many people on the beach except walkers when we went - it maybe looks different when it is busy.",Annechad
30,A lovely stroll,"It was a bit challenging to find the best way to reach the harbour from our hotel on 1st Street but once we got to the walkway on the harbour we really enjoyed it. (Look for pedestrian overpass to avoid the traffic in front of the harbour.) There are lots of sites to see as well as restaurants, shops and boat tours out of the harbour. We enjoyed our walk to the lighthouse as well as an ice-cream on such a beautiful day.",Twickes
50,Looking for a Great Long Beach Walk?,"This walk in Long Beach may not have it all, but it has most of it: Harbor views that include the Queen Mary, the fabulous city skyline, the harbor, the lighthouse with its Navy Memorial and the concrete walkway. All possibly as close as your hotel. Shops and restaurants in the Village are a delight. Yard House and Tequila Jacks are favorites. Go at happy hour and enjoy the deck overlooking the private boat harbor.What are you waiting for?",TraveLee073
40,keep your eyes on those islands!,"I remembered talking to Dr. Hynes in my geology class about subsidence, how the ground sank after you pumped all the oil and gas out, and he said that was what happened in Long Beach….Almost 30 feet.Really! I had no idea they pumped oil out there! Don’t kid yourself, California did not start with Teslas and windpower, he said! The oil out there was from the East Wilmington Field.Sure enough, those four islands looking like condo developments were disguised oil derricks.They were called the THUMS islands but were renamed the Astronaut Islands.The closest one to shore was Grissom Island, about a baseball throw from the lifeguard station at the end of the marina.I had to check this oddity out myself. (Mention in Atlas Obscura).BTW. Nice walk or jog all the way. Lifeguard station to Catalina Express landing. A real workout! Throw in climb to Lighthouse as extra.",Lapster2011
50,Beautiful views,"What a beautiful place to visit. I was there on a very sunny Sunday morning and it looked to be very busy. Lots of restaurants and shops are there too.

50,Scenic beach,"My friends took us to 4-5 beaches; while we were in Signal Hill!!This area was very clean , beautiful, & had different paths for riding your bike, hiking, or walking the many, many friendly, healthy dogs!

40,Great views and doesn't have to be expensive.,"If you want an afternoon relaxing in the sun (weather permitting), then a walk along the waterfront is a good idea. With views of the Queen Mary and a chance to see the boats coming in and out, its a cheap day out. There are plenty of good restaurants and if you like shopping, then there are plenty to choose from just before you get to the marina. You could also take a whale watching trip which run twice a day (1pm and 4pm but better check this before hand!)",JamesTW2013

40,Fun waterfront.,"Fun, family friendly waterfront. Nice paved path for walking/running or biking. Multiple public restrooms along the path. Large selection of shops and restaurants along the way.

Otherwise, an enjoyable way to spend some time outside in Long Beach!",Jennifer H

30,Wide beach with white sand,"If you live in an area that's not near the ocean, then this beach may seem okay. It wasn't the cleanest beach and there were some sketchy characters hanging around the entrance of the beach. If you're in Long Beach, then the beach is okay. I'm absolutely sure that there are better beaches further up the coast.The waterfront itself had a variety of marinas and shops and restaurants that all seemed nice. But this beach would not be my first choice to go and swim.",Skip D
50,Beautiful Drive with Wonderful houses and views,"A drive along the Long Beach waterfront is not to be missed. Early morning sunrises or late afternoon sunsets are every camera buffs dream.

30,Dirty Air,"We stayed about a 1/2 mile from Pine Pier and decided to enjoy the waterfront by walking the pier before we had to leave the area. It was a decent morning, and we expected a sparkling early morning view before it got too crowded. We were somewhat shocked to see the very dirty air on this January morning. Normally, the Queen Mary would be visible from this pier but the very best I could see was the outline of her shape. The air smelled dirty and made our eyes burn.Mostly the pier is a boardwalk with restaurants on the landward side. It wasn't spectacular and the air quality shortened our walk by quite a bit.We very disappointed and probably will not return as this caused breathing issues later on that morning",Violette54
50,Nice visit - lucky to have had perfect weather,"Visit to Long Beach was very nice. Luckily, I experienced perfect weather for 8 consecutive days.Not overly crowded, easy to get around, friendly people. Not a HUGE attraction but a nice stop along the way from LA to SD.

There was also a Mexican restaurant next to it and one down on the other end of the shops. A small cafe was also there with tables to view the harbor. We walked around the harbor to go up to the lighthouse. Many boats and ships out. Queen Mary is across the bay. Beautiful walk. There were bikes to ride along the walkway if you desired. There were rental boats by the hour and tours as well. Homeless were out but never felt threatened or uncomfortable.,amber1127

30,Nice Stroll,Long Beach Waterfront is a nice place to take a leisure stroll. You can check out the shops on the Warf or find a restaurant overlooking the water. Paid parking structures nearby. I would suggest the aquarium parking structure for trucks and bigger vehicles. Most store and restaurants will validate for parking however we found that some stores will only validate part of your parking fees. We found out the hard way!,bdy328

On a tiny little hill you can relax around the lighthouse. we really liked this tiny quit oasis.",Raroboy
50,Good place for a family outing,"There's not a lot of places that you can just go, for free and walk around but this is one. When I was a kid, the Redondo Beach Pier was like that.

40,Great for walking or exercising,I had a superb brisk 8 mile round trip along this sandy beach on the pedestrian trail. It was very enjoyable although a few more seats would have been welcome. There were regular facilities in case you got caught short! Cyclists and other people with wheels were kept apart on a different trail. It was popular with many people also exercising and felt very safe in the daytime.,RossOrpington
50,"1 of our ""Go To"" spots","Just started reviewing all the destinations I've had to visit on business, not to mention the places mi familia has gone to...But there's no place like home in California, and when making the traffic filled trek to the ""Beach Cities"" exits, this is the quickest and cheapest place to just hang out for a coupla' hours. We almost always end up at Bubba's Shrimp, but the kids totally dig seeing all the ships large and small. From the tiniest lil' dingy tethered next to a yacht, to the Queen Mary herself, I swear they're all going to join the Navy someday. They are just captivated.

50,Serene setting,"We were in Long Beach a few days and spent a few evenings walking around the waterfront. How different from say, the LA area beaches, this place feels really relaxed and nowhere near as seedy as some other places that we had visited seemed. It was really pleasant and we found a lot of people like us, strolling about with young kids. Some people chose to picnic up in the grass around the lighthouse, but you will find ample (albeit largely chain) restaurants and some places to shop.",Long-strange-journey

40,I love the Long Beach Waterfront,"I live in Long Beach. I love the Long Beach Waterfront. I wished I lived closer to the waterfront because IMO that is where all of my tax dollars are spent. The city does a good job of keeping the tourist areas vibrant. This is great for the tourist and tax revenues. It also gives us locals many great places to frequent. So in summary, all in all the Long Beach Waterfront is a great place to visit. Carnival Cruise line knows this and build a port here. If you were a tourist would you prefer to have a port of call in Long Beach or Los Angeles (San Pedro)? Enough said from a Native Californian.",roneiges
30,Just another waterfront,"Personally I think there are nicer waterfront attractions to visit around the world. I feel that the local Long Beach Government can do a lot more to make this a real worthwhile visit, and now to us it was just another waterfront. Should you go, yes sure to have seen it. Is it worth seconds, not really in our opinion.",ThomasEMM

Gladstone's, PF Chang's and many other restaurants are all good Then I walk out to the lighthouse for a spectacular view of the ocean and Queen Mary, the city, the boat harbor and Shoreline Village. To complete my ""pretend ""vacation I walk around to Shoreline Village for an ice cream and to explore some of the shops. When I get home I feel totally renewed.

30,"Restaurants, shopping and fun shops!","The Long Beach Waterfront restaurant and shopping area has a lot to offer for every taste and activity. The big draw in this area is the Aquarium of the Pacific, beautifully designed and a great adventure for the whole family. There are several different restaurants to enjoy, along with ""street"" food carts offering ice cream, snow cones, and slushies. Along the waterfront are harbor cruise boats and water taxis offering different affordable tours of Long Beach bay, or just a quick trip across the bay. If you rent a bike from the Long Beach bike rental, make sure that you double check your bill once you get home. They double charged me for our rentals, and on a day that we weren't even at the waterfront.After passing through the waterfront village you end up at the beach. This is the downside of this area. The beach and water are littered with trash, and this beach is also a popular hangout for homeless people. I would recommend finding a nicer beach for your family visit. We ended up going to Manhattan Beach, it was beautiful, clean and family friendly.",RSkier05

30,A waterfront that is not appealing or inviting.,The water in the location is blackish in color. This is not the type of water I would want to swim in or even stick my finger in to see what the temperature was. The restaurants around this location are average at best and I feel that there are better beach side locations 15-20 minutes away.,tonyraye1

The city has also improved some of the facilities available as well. Summer hosts "" movies on the beach"" and they recently expanded the dog beach area too.If your looking to unwind and listen to the waves of nature, Long Beach is great. Along the warf of downtown you'll discover some great restaurants, shops and music festvals. The Queen Mary is a short drive away and you can catch a Catalina Express to Avalon or Naples Island water taxi.",nsfalk
40,Lots to do and see in concentrated area,"The long beach waterfront that I am referring to runs from the Long Beach Aquarium to Parkers Lighthouse. In between these two areas are many available activities and sights for all members of the family.

30,Long walk along Long Beach!,"Walked along Beach from marina end. Actual Beach is clean with nice cycle and walk way and lovely views. We were very surprised though that there are no obvious cafes to sit down to eat or even get a drink from for over the 3 miles that we walked!We walked to Veterans memorial pier then walked back as was nearly dying of thirst by then!

50,Great way to spend the day!,"The Long Beach waterfront offers a large variety of things to do. You can easily spend the entire day there. It's great place to go with a spouse, or family/friends. I took advantage of going during the week, so far less crowds and highly recommended if you can get a day off or happen to be sick (cough, cough). The hardest part of the trip is figuring where to park. There are lots of options, but it can be expensive oif your not careful. If you plan on eating there, then I'd recommend parking at Pike's Parking, with validation (eating or buying something) it's very reasonable. You can also park at shoreline park, but it's a 2 hour max, which is kind of limiting. From any of these locations you can go to Shoreline park and see the lighthouse as well as the queen mary and great ocean views.Take a few min stroll and your in Shoreline village with all kinds of eateries from Tequila Jacks to Parker's Lighthouse. Want ot do some shopping, go across the street to the Pike Outlet, not a huge number of stores but enough to keep you busy for a while. There's also all kinds of harbour cruises you can take, or there's always the aquarium of the pacific in the same area. It has something for everyone!! Make a day of it....",Don B
50,One of the Best Places to Just Chill,"One of the most scenic places in Long Beach and free to chill at.

40,Crowded yet can find secluded spaces. Soothing ocean breeze and view of islands,"Went for a long walk. Crowded near the restaurants. Not so near the water.

The parking meter was not expensive at around a couple of dollars an hour. There were lots of boats at anchor and we could see the Queen Mary Hotel across the bay. The Aquarium of the Pacific is here also, and no crowdsThere were quite a number of people about exercising and chasing Pokemons.It was hot and sunny, but not a lot of trees for shading, so we kept our sun hat and cap and long sleeves on all the time we were here to minimize sun burn.",H L
20,Nothing much to see,"Compared to the other beaches near LA, i did not find anything great at the long beach. Took me over an hour to reach there by metro.

50,Walk for miles,Or bike. Lots of restaurants and shops.We rented bikes and there is a fantastic bike path from shoreline village.,dlarocqu
40,Beautiful at night.,"The Long Beach Waterfront is a gorgeous place to visit. It is exceptionally beautiful at night with the Queen Mary Hotel in the background and the lighthouse and harbor lit up. It’s a nice place for a stroll or to gather around with your friends or family to sit glued on your phone while taking in zero of the wonderful sights – which is the popular one of the two.If you are one of those people that like to get out and experience life this is a good place. You can walk along the path up to the lighthouse, around the boardwalk, or around to the other side to the shops and restaurants. Again, if you prefer to gaze at your cellphone while outdoors this is a nice place for that too.",R Giansanti

The Long Beach waterfront provides that break for me.Lots to do and see, some for free. I like the lighthouse, water views, boardwalk and big selection of restaurants. Good happy hours combined with people watching, boats and sunset are a favorite. There are also some pretty good activities for kids (or young at heart) like the little amusement park and aquarium.It's walkable from the downtown area and seems pretty safe to me into the evening hours.",DVilleDave

It was also peaceful seeing the calm ocean water.",FitnessTrekker
50,WOW--WHAT A WALK!,"Be prepared to walk...walk...walk.... Started out at the aquarium, then walked to harbor to catch a 45 minute bay cruise which was worth every penny! Then out into the bay and saw all the man-made oil (Valdeez) islands Interesting info on that. The lighthouse was great and this harbor is worth every picture taken. It took over 200 shots in an hour.",KARIN D

30,Parking is a challenge,"Even on an off night, it will take some time to find parking anywhere near the mall/dining areas (Rainbow Harbor, Aquarium, Pike Outlets). Meters are $2/hour and require coins (don't take credit cards). Valet is the sure thing, but starts at $6 the first hour (plus tip).","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
30,Average Beach,"Good news - it's the ocean! Bad news - this beach needs some clean-up. Needs some litter patrol. The beach front has a nice wide paved walk path - suitable for lots of bicycles and pedestrians. Definitely not a tropical beach. Even for a city beach, this could stand some improvement. Get the trash out of the landscaping.",texas_forrest
40,Very pretty,"Nice pretty little place for a couple of days , plenty of walking and good photo ops , plenty of seats to people watch . Sit in the sun watch the boats and the world go by then choose one of the many places to eat and it's very pretty all lit up at night too",Jangransutton

20,Beautiful marina well kept - beach is another story,What a beautiful place Long Beach is. We walked past the marina envious of the lifestyle and the beauty of the light house. Had a lovely meal. But ... All changed at the beach. The sands at a distance looked lovely. Up close they were littered with pieces of plastic and bottle tops ( this was at lunch time) and the sand near the water edge was black - and this stuck to us all day. The facilities would not even get a one on the score rating. Long Beach do something about your public restrooms - they are a disgrace - the one behind the first food shack on the beach had no walls and no doors - REALLY!! Filthy. Who would build restrooms like this. The only thing to redeem Long Beach in my mind on this short trip was the marina and the wonderful Aquarium.,Louise W
40,A little haven,"We were staying in San Pedro 15 minutes away and Long Beach waterfront was our go to place for sightseeing and evening strolls and dining. The Marina is beautiful in the daytime and at sunset and the Yard House is a great place to have good food and watch the sunset. The silhouettes produced at twilight are stunning. The whale watching trip was one of the highlights and the souvenir shops are fairly priced. We didn't make it to the lighthouse nor a bike ride or the Aquarium, too much to fit in. If you are not on a budget, it's a good place to base yourself.",Hazeangel64
50,Refreshing place to Explore,"The Long Beach Water is packed with entertainment, food and shopping venues. We picked up souvenirs for all of our family and friends there. Even though we didn't purchase one, water cruises are available. Another must see attraction if you're in the area.",KIT35443

50,Poke Mobbed,"This beach was a great stop on our first full day in California. We ended up here because my boyfriend made an appointment at an excellent Barbershop nearby called The Lodge. We found a plethora of free parking which was a rarity we discovered. The walk was so pleasant it wasn't too hot and compared to Santa Monica very clean. I wanted to rent a bike to ride around but just did not have time. The covered four seaters looked especially fun. We ate at Bubba Gump and during the wait for table walked towards the light house. There are quite a few poke stops that way and along the way the cry went out ""Charizard!"" and I found myself in the middle of a poke mob. It was very exciting and despite the amount of people who suddenly flooded the area it was easy to keep walking through. Very respectful crowd. (I was not able to catch the Charizard because Bubba Gumps texted about the table just then.) an extremely good time and the next day we went Hydrobiking in the area, so ,much to do so little time.",Jennelle S

30,Has Potential,"Went for an early morning run along the beach, and while the ocean view is impressive and has lots of potential, you're immediately aware of the amount of garbage both in the parking lots and beaches. Just too bad the city doesn't provide more resources to address this issue because other than that it was very picturesque.",osokdfa
50,"Awesome setting, Great for walking","One afternoon after a full day session at the convention center, this setting enticed me for a walk to the lighthouse and I was well rewarded. There was a Polynesian festival going on but I had a few minutes to get to the lighthouse and take a few pics. Despite a hot day in the upper 80s, I found this to be a great setting for a walk with great views of the city and the waterfront. Well worth an hour stroll especially if you are trying to burn some calories before dinner during a convention.",Grover R

50,A brief stop but lovely!,"We stopped here for about an hour on our drive from Los Angeles to San Diego. I would love to come back and spend more time in Long Beach. It was absolutely beautiful. We went to have a look at the Queen Mary. An impressive sight but looking like she needs painted. There's a Russian submarine too which my boys liked but we didn't go into either due to time pressure. We crossed over to the other side of the waterfront. It has been upgraded and really lovely and great for taking pics of the Queen Mary. Beautiful beaches and canals at Little Venice. Very picturesque!

20,Very disappointed in how nasty it was.,"The water in the harbor is nasty. It was full of trash and looked awful. I was a bit concerned for the sea lion that popped up in there. Straws, bags, bottles, etc. just floating around. There really aren't that many stores around the harbor and across the walking bridge to the outlets there aren't that many stores either. The city does have public restrooms by the boat dock but use them at your own risk. They are filthy.",Amy C
50,Aquarium and Good restaurants,"The Aquarium was an excellent choice while in Long Beach for entertainment. Beautiful walk along the ocean that is paved with restaurants to one side and shopping, did not see a beach you could go onto.",RAWITCH
50,One of the best waterfronts in all of Southern California,"The Long Beach waterfront is amazing. Great restaurants, available easily accessible parking. Outlet mall nearby. Aquarium of The Pacific located there. Soirtfisjing chsrters, dive boats, and dinner cruises all a available inside the inner harbor. Queen Mary close by. Fabulous lighthouse located there as well. The most scenic waterfront in all of L.A. area",Les R
50,Beautiful large waterfront beach,Our family of seven chose to visit this shoreline beach and waterfront as an activity for the day. We found it very busy and hard to park during a June stay. It had plenty of restaurants and fast food places to purchase lunch or even to bring a picnic lunch. The board walk is busy and fun to watch all the action taking place with fishing and swimming. The beaches are clean for the most part although parking is hard to find. Parking is not for free and there are meters everywhere up and down the main streets.,proudmom5

20,"you can walk here, which is a novelty","The ""village"" on the waterfront is a series of colourful shacks selling junk food and cheap tacky souvenirs. You can walk or cycle etc along the waterfront, which is a nice thing to do (there is very little to do in Long Beach).",emmachisett
50,Clean and Calm,A great place for a walk after lunch or an evening stroll. Several nearby restaurants and shops combined with the water and sailboats make for a good time.,007Beaner
30,Typical modern waterfront,"Validate your parking. Otherwise it will cost you $10 for 2 hrs. This place looks a lot like a waterfront anywhere else you go but you still want to visit. Lots of restaurants and shops, pesky birds and interesting boats. We live on the North Coast so it had a familiarity about it but for an inlander, visit for the uniqueness of the experience.",RickCrescentCity_CA
50,Family time,"We were pleasantly surprised at all the things we were able to see and do here.You get a nice walk with a wonderful view at the Queen Mary, the ocean, the Lighthouse and and area where you can walk on sand over viewing boats and the water of course!You walk around the pier to the Shoreline Marina and enjoy shopping, food, bars,live music and a wonderful view. It is so relaxing!So much to do and see in one spot! The aquarium is next to it also.",Veedot
40,Nice stroll after dinner,"My husband and I walked from the beach back to the hotel one night after dinner. It was very nice down by the Marina. We did not make it over to the lighthouse area, but there is a lot of waterfront area to explore. Hope to return one day.",AshevilleGypsy
40,Nice little pier & park & promenade,"Parked our car downtown, walked to the waterfront pass the Aquarium and the Convention Center, checked out the pier - it's much less crowded and commercial than the Santa Monica Pier or the San Francisco one. It's nice and peaceful to sit at its end on the benches, look at the park, the island in front of you and relax. I bet the sunset there must be very beautiful.",articok
50,Very nice walk,"After going to the Aquarium, we took a walk to the lighthouse. There is a lot of grassy areas for you to sit and just enjoy the water, boats and more.",Mary V
50,GOTTA SPEND SOME TIME HERE,"I love just wandering along the trail, walking up to the lighthouse to watch the sunset or take in the waterfront. The colours over at Shoreline village are spectacular at sunset. Plan on just plopping down on the grass or a bench and enjoy the atmosphere.",SenorGancho
50,PERSONAL (L.A.) FAVORITE GETAWAY,"I had a stressful job in a stressful big city. To unwind, I love to go to the beach, even though we have a big swimming pool at home. This city's waterfront includes the long stretch of beach, shoreline village, marina, Queen Mary, Aquarium of the Pacific ... It's minutes away from Pine Ave, which is another fun place in Long Beach. In addition, it's across Long Beach Convention Center, Terrace theater (for concerts or plays). There are 4 major hotels: Renaissance, Hyatt, Westin, Hilton within a few minute walk. Lots of things to do: boating, water sports, whale watching, Segway, biking, dinner cruises etc. plus numerous fantastic restaurants, cafes, bars, shops, movie theaters and even a Ferris wheel for kids. There's a shuttle that can take you around major tourist sites in Long Beach for free. I like watching sunsets at the marina tremendously after a long afternoon stroll at the beach, that we got to love it there. We even decided to buy an ocean view condo that's 2-3 minute walk from shore line village for our weekend getaway. Long Beach is only 30-50 mins from LA (depending on traffic).",rosario308

50,Family Fun for Everyone,"I visited the Long Beach Waterfront last year with my best friend of >30 years and wanted to take my husband and two teenagers for a day trip. There was something for everyone to enjoy. We strolled along the waterfront, sitting on a few of the benches along the way to take in the view while eating ice cream. We used the telescopes on the 'lookout tower' to check out the action across the water and could see some sort of car show up close. My husband liked the shop that had a variety of hot sauces. My 16-year old son was thrilled to find a comic book store while my daughter and I shopped the Soapy Delights store. We listened to the live music while perusing the harbor shops then walked back over to the Pikes Outlet Mall to visit a few chain stores while waiting for our movie at the Cinemark to start. Of all the SoCal beach / waterfront areas we've visited, my family agreed that they enjoyed the Long Beach Waterfront most of all. Relaxing, safe, family friendly fun for all!",GinaR400
50,Lots to see and do,"Get the free Passport bus and go right around the perimeter , you will see Queen Mary, Aquarium, etc, can get off anytime but this ride gave us a good overview of what's around, walk down the beachfront, walk or get a bike, plenty of shops around as well",Julie F

30,Cute but limited,"The Long Beach Waterfront, Shoreline Park, is cute but rather tiny. A patch of grass, a small lighthouse on a low mound, some concrete walkways an a small boat harbor. Worth a glance or a 10 minute dalliance...",Michael V
50,Plenty to See and Do,"The area along the Long Beach Waterfront is very clean and attractive with paved walkways that you can walk or bike on. There's a convenient parking deck (fee) or a shuttle you can ride. Attractions include boat tours, a lighthouse, a beach, the Aquarium of the Pacific, the Queen Mary, shopping at The Pike Outlets or Shoreline Village, and many restaurants. There's even a ferris wheel! We enjoyed strolling along the beautifully landscaped trail by the harbor, looking at the fountains and people-watching. We visited the aquarium and had lunch at Tequila Jack's. It's pedestrian and wheelchair friendly. You can easily spend an entire day or even a weekend here. Note that there is an auto race held here in April that closes the city streets and some of the attractions, so check before you go that time of year.",CrankingChick

50,Long Beach has beautiful shopping areas near the water and the beaches are nice.,"I was born in Long Beach and I live here still. The weather is great! The shopping is pretty good. Lots of night life downtown with different show and dancing. Entertainment has become part of the scene in the Pike area. Long Beach is a large city and is multi-cultural. Many restaurants and always something to do in the city or close by. Disneyland is 30 minutes away, Knott's Berry Farm is 20 minutes away and the mountains are 2 hours away.",Cynthia M
40,"Great views, chain resturants","The Waterfront was the closest thing to the Queen Mary where we stayed. The food was chain after chain and we chose Tequila Jack's, the only chain we didn't have in CO. The sunset was beautiful seen across the marina.",vnboyd

The harbor activities include wonderful beach shops, many restaurant choices, tourist attractions such as the aquarium and the Queen Mary, a free shuttle to take us everywhere, and harbor cruises, whale watching, the Catalina Express, etc. We spent the few days we had within a 15 mile radius of the airport, (except the boat rides, of course).

40,Nice Walk,"We had a few hours to kill between ship and plane, we found ourself walking the Long Beach Waterfront. Nice easy walk right across the bay from the Queen Mary.

40,Great area to stroll and have family picnic day,There is a nice sidewalk walking path that winds around the waterfront. The lighthouse is surrounded by a green belt which is perfect for a picnic. The path also leads to the Aquarium of the Pacific. Close by are several restaurants as well as boats for whale watching,Always 5 Star

50,Gorgeous port,"Beautiful place, lots of activity in port and in downtown. Beautiful cityWe went over on second street and walked around and people watching. The lights in the port along with the Queen Mary and the cruise ships made for exquisite evening lightshow.",Belinda L
50,Great place to see the sights of Downtown Long Beach and the Queen Mary,"This is a good place to walk where you can see the Queen Mary as well as the light house and the boats that you can take out for sightseeing, fishing, or a trip to Catalina. It is pretty in the day and also a great place after dark because you can see the City lit up.",hrhrachel
40,Walk off your lunch,A good hike from the street but the view was totally worth it. They still had the race course set up which was very cool. Lots of little shops but the local Gay Rights advocates pestering you for opinions were really annoying.,fmattship
50,"""Walk for Kids""","The LB waterfront was the scene of the annual ""Walk for Kids"" benefiting the Long Beach Ronald McDonald House (on 27th Street near Millers Children's Hospital). It was my first 3K walk along the waterfront starting at the Boardwalk located near the Aquarium. Weather was great, there was a large turnout for the Walk, and it was all for a very good charity and cause. If you haven't taken this walk before and want a great 3 mile workout with a wonderful view for the entire length of the walk on any given day--I say try it. I was pleasantly surprised by how scenic it was and would actually walk it on a regular basis. Great location! Highly recommend.",Connie11201

50,Great walking paths and beachfront,"The walking paths are separated from the bike paths and are very wide. Marine patrol is out at all hours so there's plenty of security and bathrooms.

40,Beautiful Place to Visit,Taking a walk down the board walk and enjoy the views and parks. Lots of places to eat & shop and close to the Long Beach Aquarium,Paul W
50,A Place to Relax,"The waterfront does not have any piers. It is simply a waterfront that provides a nice relaxing atmosphere.There are various paths for you to simply take in the scenery as you walk or ride your bike. You can enjoy the boats, the restaurants, and the entertainment the street vendors provide. We expecially enjoy going there on New Year's Eve.Parking can be a bit challenging unless you park in the parking structure adjacent to Bubba Gump's shrimp or the valet parking. Personally, I do not suggest you park in any of the lots with parking meters because it is such a hassle to keep returning to your car to feed the meter and these lots are more expensive than the parking structure. As the parking structure has a maximum daily rate of approximately $10, during special events it may go up to $18.You can actually walk from the Aquarium of the Pacific to Belmont Shores. I would suggest, you bring your bike or rent a bike if you plan on going that far. Once you pass Parkers Lighthouse ( restaurant), then you will begin to see the Beach. Since the beach is within the Breakwater, I don't believe rip currents are a concern.During the day time we normally confine our walks to the path going up to the lighthouse and during the night we usually confine our walks along the restaurants on the waterfront. I have never heard of any crime in the area, probably because there are usually people all around.",LA-Gluttony

Surprisingly the area is not too noisy despite a good amount of people being present and there is plenty of space to sit in the grass and hang out. The views in this area are beautiful and it is definitely a place worth visiting while in the LBC.",Eric W
30,"Long Beach needs to fix sidewalks, clean public structures","Long Beach is blessed with so much beauty but I think the city needs to take better care of this exquisite resource. One of my friends almost fell on her face because of poorly marked hazards on a sidewalk near the waterfront. As I contemplated that beautiful and very expensive city center that is being torn down without a clear and compelling reason, I could only think that the city and all of its citizens would be better served by funds being directed to street repair and clean up. The lovely hotels are ill served by broken down sidewalks",JWP8
50,GREAT PLACE TO GO,"Looking for fresh air? I recommend visit Belmont, Long Beach waterfront. You can satisfy yourself with all the fresh air you ever wanted. You will enjoy wetting your feet to the warm water of the shore and playing with the sand. You can walk, jog or ride the bike. It has a concrete walkway/runway close to the shore. You can run along with the baby stroller as well. If you are hungry … just go up the stairways and you can choose what restaurant you wanted. I am from Long Beach but I never get tired walking along the shore of Belmont, Long Beach waterfront.",maria f

30,could be beautiful but lessened by people,"Race weekend, so all the restaurants were blocked off to public access unless you had a race ticked :-( I was in town for business and staying across the bridge. I decided to walk over and visit the aquarium and check out the waterfront and have something to eat. Part of the view is just lovely- waterfront and a view of the queen mary! walking trails and the lighthouse. BUT the trash in the water is just disgusting",David J
30,Not the nicest,"The view was disappointing all along the water. All you can see is the massive port. Cranes, oil rigs, container ships and trucks.",Bits58

40,Fun place to check out with kids or romantic at sunset,"There are lots of attractions including a carousel, a ferris wheel, a mall and of course the entire waterfront which you can explore on foot or you can rent a bike as well. We walked on foot and explored and it was really fun. I would recommend.",iberostarnightmare
50,Great waterfront,"For the past few years, Long Beach has been like the little engine chugging along the tourist destination track saying I think I can I think I can"" while areas like San Diego get all the love but as a Californian, I prefer long Beach. It's a working city near two huge ports. You dare not go in the water but you can admire the beautiful boats docked in the marina and enjoy the cool organically grown hip streets that run parallel to Ocean Blvd. The city is always hustling bringing in concerts and turning the seafront area into one big race track every April. The downtown area is easy to bike and was my preferred transportation when we had a weekend condo there. Depending on the season, you can take a water taxi for a marina tour or the aqua link to travel to Alamitos Bay and then on to Seal Beach for a beach visit. There is also the passport bus you can take to Belmont Shore or Alamitos Bay. On the weekends, visit the local museum and take lunch at their Bluff cafe.",Kerrylee1
50,Rainbow Harbor is Beautiful,"We stayed overnight at the Hotel Maya and did a run from there to the harbor area in the morning. Being on foot is quite different from driving in a car. I'm from Long Beach so I've been to the harbor area and Shoreline Village numerous times but this is a preferable way to take in the scenery. The harbor is especially lovely all lit up at night, as seen from across the way at the Maya. Made me love my hometown even more.",MarciSoCal

30,Okay trip,"There are nice places to eat by long beach and the boats are really nice. The bathroom on the waterfront by the beach are like prison bathrooms. There are no stalls, just short brick walls separating the toilets. Luckily at the end of February there aren't many people but if it gets crowded, those bathrooms would be pretty uncomfortable. The bathrooms by the restaurants were nice though. The ocean is very calm like a lake which is strange. Also, there were a lot of homeless people! Overall not my favorite beach.",Michelle B
30,Nice for a Walk,"Went for a walk through this waterfront park and it was nice. The park itself is quite cute, but the views leave a lot to be desired. It's such a shame to look out and see so many barges and rigs just off the shoreline. What could be a beautiful view just completely destroyed by industry. Certain portions of the waterfront also are very busy with kids and tourists, particularly around the aquarium and all the chain restaurants. I'd avoid that in future. You can see the Queen Mary from here, so history buffs might like that...it does seem a long walk away though.",mere13

Kiosks offer sunglasses, hamburgers, hot dogs and souvenirs, while brick and mortar restaurants provide higher end refreshments. The Aquarium is right there, as are harbor tours, whale watching and fishing boats. Around the curve at Shoreline Village are more shops with really fun items, more restaurants and of course, more kiosks. Have FUN!",thizizliz

40,Walking the Waterfront in Long Beach,This is always a fun place to go. I like to walk there and have a meal with a friend at Porters Lighthouse.

I live in the Port area and recently did a painting of the Port and the Queen Mary which now sits proudly in a home in Palos Verdes nearby.,sabelsart
50,Beautiful CA!,Long beach is nice near the water. There is so much to do and see in such a small radius of the beach. Less crowded in November than in summer for sure. But still warm and fun!,Quest332312
40,A great place for a walk,"The Long Beach waterfront area is a great place to walk around and I particularly enjoyed passing through that area as I do my long 10 mile walks along the coast in Long Beach. You passed through some interesting areas and you can even take your walk up over the bridge to the Queen Mary.

40,Relaxing,"The waterfront walk is what I call a relaxing walk. Going around little shops with colored houses remainding me Bergen and the Norway was nice. The view from the light house is nice and for sure istuctive if you read the story available at the ground level outside.

You can even jump on the Metro here which will take you into Los Angeles.",iggtigg
50,Seems like the whole world,"From Long Beach you can stare out to sea, see ships, islands but also the docks - a little reality of the world in which we live. Each bit of the horizon gives of its own story and therefore Long Beach is quite magical - reality and promise. This is a really good place to base oneself for trips northwards or southwards on the Pacific coastal route. But long beach is also a destination worth spending time in - we have loved it and would most definitely come back again.",Cassie2808
40,What a wonderfull experience,We where here for a night and thought we would go for a walk around the waterfront.Amazing views and seeing the Queen Mary in the distance was a bonus. It happened to be at night after dinner so was great to walk off the food.Very enjoyable walk!,dpmason

50,A Typical California Beach,"My friend and I came here from our cruise ship next to the Queen Mary across the channel. Took the fabulous and free Passport Bus to the marina and, voila!, there was the walking/bike path which we took to get to our main destination: Kayaks On The Water in Naples about three plus miles south of there. Great walk. Obviously, a lot of money has been spent on the fantastic path and facilities. And what a view! Have to say, the amount of homeless and garbage on the beach was a little surprising, but didn't feel threatened....if you get in the way of the cyclists, now, THAT'S a different thing! HA! Mostly happy walkers, runners, and cyclist....only a few with roid attitudes! I would highly recommend this beach walk and stop at Naples for a kayaking adventure to all able-bodied cruisers in port!",RunningInGrace
40,It's long!!,"We had one day to fill in LA having been to the city several times before. After under exercising for some time on a cruise ship we paid $20 for a taxi from the port and walked the length of Long Beach from the lighthouse to Belmont Shore and back again. You will pass the Lone Sailor statue along the way. It took 4 hours (with a drinks stop) and is about 8 miles return.This is not the most exciting beach or walk, but it was far far more enjoyable than spending time in the grubby Hollywood or downtown areas. In fact we had such a good day here we could almost have forgotten we were in LA and were very happy to have made the effort!",Pete_Gill_W
40,"OK, if you like running/walking along the beach/footpath","In truth the beach is dull. Long and flat, with very little in the way of places to eat along the walk. We walked all the way along the beach and even around Naples Island (even duller). As somewhere to walker run it was good. We did walk 12 miles in total, it was good weather etc and we got the fresh air. We looked hard to find a pleasant place for a coffee on route and failed - this was a real surprise.",DavidGHooper
30,Nice bike path and nice ocean views Not as uniquel for a tourist like the craziness of Venice beach but pretty,"Great bike path to run my dog along the marina bikepath. They are allowed just on the bikepath in harbor area, not on part of bikepath that cuts though the sands of the beach past shoreline drive. Will get a ticket there",Timothy V
30,Depends on What You Want to Do,"We were staying across the street at the Hyatt Regency so very convenient to walk across the bridge and take in what the waterfront had to offer. There's a lighthouse, restaurants and a boardwalk with a few tourist and specialty shops as well as a coffee house (which doesn't open until 8am) and more restaurants. If you want a leisurely stroll and window shopping, this area is for you. If you like looking at boats and yachts you would most certainly enjoy the views. There is also an outlet shop area across the street called The Pike but there were only a handful of shops there.",Jan P
40,Awesome!,"Awesome views, the colors at night they shine on the lighthouse and bridge are breathtaking. You. Can see the queen Mary and eat from a collection of establishments. Be polite though, many homeless people line the hill by the lighthouse to sleep at night so if you walk the path you will be walking through their home.",Joshua W

40,Great for a walk around.,"We spent a lazy afternoon here just soaking in the sights. We walked around the bay, plenty of people seem to use the space for running or sitting on the grass with a good book. There was also lots of watering holes for drinks in the sun or a bite to eat. Loved the blue sky and palm trees, I'm sure my friends back home will be jealous of the photos...",NaomiF2901

40,Decent place to visit but a bit sterile,"The waterfront is immaculately maintained, with not a scrap of rubbish and lots of standard type restaurants and tourist shops. Perhaps lacking some personality but perfectly OK and with good views.We spent some time here and ate at a few of the places, which were all fine. It was quiet in the week but very lively at the weekend!",ShazyD
50,Waterfront area at Long Beach,We looked out on this area from our hotel at the Hyatt Long Beach and walked to it most evenings and en route to other attractions and to eat in the evenings. It's a well designed and safe clean and attractive area with a great deal of thought to its design and ambiance. Beautifully lit up at night and always safe it has the air of the Mediterranean about it and its restaurants are varied and plentiful--you can eat in a different location every night for three weeks if you like! Buses ply from Downtown to the waterfront and on to the Queen Mary every few minutes from Parker's Lighthouse area and the car park for this waterside development.,neilmorris75
50,Really nice place,"This is really a nice place to visit. I had not been to Long Beach since the 1980s, and what they have done to the area is spectacular. This is a really nice place to walk around, view the marina and harbor area, and take in some great food.",DennisAtkinson

40,Quite unexpected,We saw this area from the road and turned round to come back to it. The aquarium and Queen Mary were nearby and the whole area was clean and well tended. Car park a bit dear but with the position of it all you would expect no less.,mummybearSpain
50,Chill out time,we spent quite a few days down on the beach here miles of white sand warm shallow waters and not to many people on the beach it was great.,Normiejoe

40,Short little walk. Good for couples and an excuse to hold hands with your date,"Well, this almost belongs as part of the Shoreline Village review since they are directly abutting each other.

40,Delightful place to stroll,"There is plenty to do along the Long Beach waterfront - the aquarium, the harbour, whale watching, eating and drinking and shopping.

Its also fun to bring park toys like frisbees.",orangebluetime
40,Home Town,"Long beach California is not like LA. Traffic isn't nearly is bad. And it has the best urban school district in the nation. It isn't really like a city. It's like a collection of distinct neighborhoods. You have exclusive beachy / coastal neighborhoods. You have exclusive suburbs. You have middle class suburbs. You have an urban downtown. And you have some sketchy urban areas in North Long Beach. Overall it is a very relaxed, mello kind of attitude in my opinion. But the main point is you'll feel like each neighborhood is a different world. From Belmont Shore to Virginia Country Club to Downtown to North Long Beach there aren't many similarities.",Alberta R

40,Beautiful area to walk,"This area is a nice place to walk and just enjoy being outdoors. Walking pathways are shared with bicycles but for the most part it is pedestrian and pet friendly. Nice breeze off the water and several spots to sit to take a break. Wear a hat and sunscreen though as there are few shady areas. You could walk from the waterfront park area, past the Aquarium and several restaurants, the ferry boat boarding areas to the marina and Shoreline Village and right to the beach.

For those needing to take a bit more easy, there's the Queen Mary cruise ship and aquarium, along with a few beachside restaurants and cafes.Definitely a place to visit.",Don M

40,Lots of choices and things to see,I loved the bike/walking trail that went from the Waterfront along the ocean.

50,Long Beach Waterfront - Touristy But Scenic.,"The Long Beach Waterfront is a combination of shops and restaurants that meander along the waterfront ending with a lighthouse at the point. At one end sits Shoreline Village, where you can shop or dine. The middle features a clutch of mid-range restaurants. The Aquarium is beyond the restaurant cluster, and a short walk later, you arrive at the lighthouse, which offers a great view of the Harbor and the Queen Mary.There are plenty of small stands that sell water, hot dogs, hats, and other tourist items. The prices are what one would expect for a touristy area. You can find t-shirts three for twenty dollars, hats, sunglasses and other items marked with Long Beach as you stroll along the waterfront. A large marina sits in the midst of the shops and restaurants.You can visit some of the attractions, like I did, or just enjoy the view. Parking is available at different locations along the waterfront and will run you close to ten dollars unless you get your ticket validated. It is also serviced by the free Passport bus, which travels through downtown Long Beach.",John S

50,pathway on the beach,"Beach has an incredible walkway of three miles so a good walk of six miles can be achieved. It seemed safe and we saw no disturbances of any kind though we were warned that it is not safe to walk around some places in LA, this wasn't one of them. Although it is a seaside resort I am not sure there would be many activities for children other than the beach but that was pretty fantastic with masses of pale sand which was well groomed and cared for.Two Marinas within easy distance of each other are worth visiting and Shoreline Village is a centrepiece for that part of Long Beach. Parkers' Lighthouse restaurant is particularly good for fish and indeed fish restaurants in the area were all very good. Americans like value for money so food is plentiful, too much sometimes, and doggie bags seem mandatory. Getting in and out of Los Angeles airport is always busy and gridlocked despite the amount of lanes on the motorways but that is expected in most cities.",Gabrielle S

Many of the houses along Ocean Blvd are worth a view and some of them have been in the background for movies (Clark Gable - Run Silent Run Deep or It's a Mad Mad World). They film a lot of movies in Long Beach and this is a great place to take a walk just don't go in the water or expect any waves!,Bill C

We chose to walk all around, and even walked over to the Queen Mary, just shy of 2 miles but great scenery and fresh air.

10,Disgusted by the condition of the beach and facilities.,"I was in Long Beach ( where the beach meets the marina ) for a 15K run last Sunday morning. It was dark when we got there, and it was beautiful to see the sunrise. That was until the light of the sun displayed the disgusting conditions of the beach and washroom facilities. Garbage littered the beach, the public washrooms were filthy with plugged toilets, trash and discarded clothing on the floors. There was no toilet paper for the runners who did dare to enter to use. 100s of people came to this race, the powers that be knew there was going to be the race because they made sure to collect their parking fee before the meters even opened. They had the fore site to collect their money but not to have a clean facility for the people coming.The local government and beach goers who leave the beaches in this condition should be ashamed. Such a beautiful place to have such a bad experience.",JAC

Beautiful views and if looking to stay for an afternoon I’m sure would definitely be worth while.

From there you can cycle about three miles along the waterfront area.Stop at the Belmont Veterans Pier and check out the fisherman on the pier. Continue on for another mile where the bike-path ends at Ocean Blvd. Ride back toward Shoreline Village and stop at Belmont Brewing Company at the foot of the pier where you can bask in the sun while enjoying a beverage.

I admit, the Pacific Ocean does frighten me a slight bit. (I grew up in the Midwest with Lakes, Rivers and measly Atlantic waves.) None the less, pedaling around the Bay, I felt at ease within the first 5 minutes. So much so that I was laughing about all the Cheesy ""YeIpsters"" that tried to dim expectations.The Wife and I explored the canals and relished in more cool breeze with less degrees.

Parked at the Aquarium, if you visit the Aquarium your ticket is discounted. Went out on the 12pm tour which lasts for 3 hours. The guides are informative, boat is clean, lots of places to sit. We saw lots of dolphins and a blue whale, what made it special was the fantastic picture we took of the tail as it lifted out of the water - magical.

30,The Long Beach Waterfront as viewed by a local,"I am a Long Beach local, so just as a Parisian might turn up their noses at the Eiffel Tower (it was built only recently, by European standards), I feel compelled to give an honest perspective of the Long Beach waterfront. If you have the time, by all means include it in your itinerary. It is certainly not the Louvres, but it may be the Tuileries (inside joke, unless you've been to Paris). Simply put, if you are only here for few days, skip it. There are so many incredible things to do in 1-3 hours drive time. Here is a list of places that offer more and better than Long Beach:1. Touristic: Venice Beach2. Food: Newport Beach3. Beaches: Bolsa Chica State Beach (next to Huntington Beach)4. Dog Beaches: Huntington Dog Beach5. Wow factor: Catalina Island6. Cool factor: Venice Beach and Huntington Beach7. It is so hot right now, why aren't you in Big Bear? You do realize that if you sleep in late and leave around 10, you could still be in the ski resort of Big Bear in time for lunch? Clean mountain air, an increasingly charming town (it has, in the last few years, polished itself from a red-neck/meth-head town to one more approaching, say, Aspen). Take Hwy 38 through Redlands. It is about 10 minutes longer, but MUCH more scenic and fewer sharp curves. Stop at every scenic turnout that you have time for, it will take longer to get there, but it is SO worth it!Speaking of lunch, there is some really REALLY good food to be eaten in Big Bear. Pick a nice spot at an outdoor table in the Village. After that, take a nice walk on the bike trail next to the lake, or pick out a hiking trail. Stop by the National Forest Visitor Center for directions or hike ideas. There are lots B&Bs, lodges, cabins, etc., if you want to spend the night, definitely worth it. You can decide when you get there, no need to reserve ahead. Or you can drive the 2 hours back to Long Beach in time for dinner, with time to spare to check out the Queen Mary.",LBGrandBanks

40,It's not like Long Beach used to be.,Long Beach has changed so much especially downtown . Lots of little places to eat cute shops. and an eclectic mix of people. Great place to ride a bike. Long Beach is one of the most bike friendly cities I've seen in California yet,Drnasadan

Not too many places. This waterfront area rivals many of the best along the coast, especially if you are there on business. If there on business, you're not going to be short on having a lot to do during your down time. If you bring the family, they will not be bored at all while you're conducting business.",LasVegasSlim

40,Postcard Material,The Long Beach Waterfront truly is a stunning spot to visit. There are a number of first rate attractions quite close to one another.

50,Best place to take a walk.,This is our favorite walk in all of Long Beach. we start behind the Aquarium and do the entire walk all the way to the end of the boardwalk by the oil derrick. Its about a 3 mile round trip walk. We take our dogs with us as it is all dog friendly as long as you have them on a leash. The late afternoons and evenings are the best as the breeze comes in and the sun is not so strong. We have taken this walk at least 100 times over the years and have never had a problem or ever felt unsafe. There are also many places to get food or drinks along the way and some of the food places have seating for you and your dog. If you are in Long Beach visiting its a good way to get a feel of what long beach is like. It will make for a nice fist date too.,Sammyvelvet
40,Beautiful Waterfront,"Lot of photo ops in this trendy place. Plenty of restaurants next to a boat harbor, walk along the shoreline and also a small amusement park nearby and an aquarium. Can also take a ferry to Catalina Island from there but check the schedules for departures.",oradba11g

The food was great, as was the view, and we all really enjoyed walking through some of the shops. Only wish time had permitted us to stay longer, but we needed to get back to the convention center. I plan to return to Ports o' Call, a three hour drive from my home, to spend the day just walking around and enjoying the fresh air like I used to do over 20 years ago.",Mary Kay W

40,Very enjoyable.,A very enjoyable experience walking around the waterfront. Lots to see and do.

50,Boat Ride in Harbor and Beyond,"While spending a couple days at the Long Beach Harbor, we found that a cheap and fun thing to do is to take the Aqua Link, a motorized catamaran to Belmont Pier and then down to Alimitos Bay. For $5 you can take the ride which starts at the Pike area and goes down to Alimitos Bay and $5 for the return. The coastline is beautiful. There are plenty of restaurants and shops in the Long Beach Harbor area as well as in Alimitos Bay. On the return, the boat goes right up along side of the Queen Mary and the Russian submarine. You can get off the boat at any stop and then catch the next boat to continue your trip. This is a great way to see the harbor as well as going someplace else for a fun inexpensive experience.",alanmhersh

We parked in the big parking garage next to the Aquarium and just walked around enjoying the waterfront. We went into some shops, took a 3 hour Whale Watching Tour and saw a lot of wildlife, including a whale! There was even an employee from the Aquarium on the boat with us giving us information about the area and the whales. It was the best tour I ever had! We ate at P.F. Chang's. There are a ton of restaurants in the area to choose from. The Indy race was the following weekend so they had parts of the track set up. That was really neat to see. We wound up spending the whole day at the waterfront. Would definitely go back.",audwel72

20,"Pleasant, hard to find the centre, car parking intrusive","An assorted collection of miniature harbours, quays, eateries and pleasant enough walks. Car parkng comes right up to the harbour edge in some places. Various interesting vessels but the Queen Mary dominates the horizon across the bay.Found it hard to work out exactly where the sea front centre was. Long Beach provides a free, frequent red PASSPORT big bus service but even as a veteran public transport user I found it impossible to work out which side of the road to wait just to get to the Queen Mary and wasted 30 minutes going the wrong way. Better luck next time. The PASSPORT bus double-runs up the same stub avenues by the harbour, then goes left or right, or...While waiting for the cross-harbour ferry I was taken aside by a local and told the ferry never runs to the timetable, which turned out to be the case.If you go there by Light Rail, the Blue line, from Downtown LA, I don't think you will find a single sign pointing to the harbour (which is only a ten minute walk).",Stephen J
40,"Great Place to Stroll, Eat and Shop","The Long Beach Waterfront is a great place to spend time in downtown Long Beach, CA. There are several great places to shop and eat. If you wish to simply take a stroll or sit on a bench near the water, you can do that too.Though there's no fee to enter the waterfront area itself, you will pay handsomely for parking. If you shop or eat at most of the Shoreline Village businesses, they will validate your parking ticket, which features 2 hours of parking for just $1.00 the weekend we were here.Yes, there is a bit of trash in the water unfortunately, but the overall view is lovely and the waterfront is conveniently located across the street from the Long Beach Convention Center. We spent a good part of two days along the waterfront and would do it again next time we visit Long Beach.",DiveMoreWorkLess

The waterfront offers great attractions during the day with the aquarium and the Queen Mary as the cornerstones. At night the place really comes to life.

Definitely worth the time and money to get away for a couple of days.",Techkraut

You can have fun at GameWorks, see a movie, or have a pleasant meal at waterfront restaurants. One of my favorite restaurants is Gladstone's 4 fish. Very good food and wine selection. Portions are very big, so, one has to be pretty hungry to be able to enjoy the whole meal. However, do not be in a hurry. Enjoy the view and great food.",Mila K

50,"Inspiring, Tranquil and Picturesque","From the rising of the sun to its setting in the Pacific west, the waterfront has an assortment of sites, sounds and activities that will not disappoint. From the natural sounds of seagulls overhead to the calm waters in the bay the sense is more analogous to a nature preserve than a commercial district. The boat tours, restaurants and Aquarium of the Pacific provide more than a few activities to enjoy. The lighthouse provides a look out point for photography and the boats, waterways provide a romantic background for a nice long walk with someone you love.",Craig B

Goes from Alamitos Bay, near Seal Beach to the Queen Mary and on to stops along Shoreline Village....all with plenty of restaurant and fun tourist areas...and can you believe a boat ride for $5...and that is for the express from one end of the harbour to another. The short runs are onl ONE DOLLAR to get from the Queen Mary to the Long Beach Aquarium. Modern catamarans, with bath rooms and snack bars...what's not to like??",wavefanz

50,A good place to visit while in Long Beach,"They have done a lot to rejeuvenate the appeal of this area. They still have a ways to go, but at least there's been an attempt. If you go during the day, the little island where the lighthouse is, is so cute, and kids love it. The boardwalks and piers are nice to stroll around and the area is a bit easier to access than some pier area's like Hermosa and Redondo. Its worth the visit while in Long Beach.",Seashellstew
