50,My favorite bike path to the beach,"This is the best bike path. It is wide, safe to ride and an awesome view to the beach. I absolutely love it, and don't have to be afraid of cars even though it is traveled by cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EarthAngel419
50,"Hidden, Flat Bike Loop","Nearly 5 miles of uninterrupted biking on a wide Blvd. next to LAX. Newly resurfaced, with well-marked bike lanes next to two very wide lanes for cars. Almost no intersections on this little known access road between the Airport and Westchester.You can watch the planes land as you bike or jog. Magnolia trees bloom on sides, plus there is a large landscapedmedian, and large sidewalks for jogging or walking on this little traveled road. Access from West end on Pershing, and from East from Sepulveda. At East end, you can get food or drink at nearby shopping center, or coffee at Trader Joe's or Panini.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliLosAngeles
