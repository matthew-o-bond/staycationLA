50,Excellent but little disappointing,"Art Astor had about 275 classic cars and a gazillion antique radios and telephones.Just prior to his death he sold a bunch of them at auction and raised $15 million.His arrangements with the city of Cerritos to house his extensive collection changed after his death. The city decided not to use the Mullikin building because it required too extensive a restoration.The contract with the City of Cerritos was voided at his death. The Astor family had prior agreements on about 50 cars and they took them. An auction in Monterey Calidf in August 2017 sold another group. When I visited there were about 50 cars left, all beautifully restored classics, but the cream had been skimmed off.The facility will allow you in, but you must call and make an appointment. A city employee will take you around and show you all the stuff and they have a little history on a lot of the pieces.I got a big kick out of all the console radios. Back in the old days radios were furniture, big wooden boxes almost as big as your washing machine. I told the guide when I was a kid when we listened to the radio we actually sat around it and looked at the thing, as if it were a TV set.They also have hundreds of telephones, none of them you can carry in your pocket.A nice interesting experience,If you are interested in seeing the 50 or so cars remaining you better hurry. The city is considering disposing of the collection soon (9/17)",Joe K
50,"If you're a classic car buff, you're HOME!","Charla is right-- what an amazing hidden gem! I didn't know it was there-- tucked away in an industrial plaza [because it needed a hangar sized space] without drawing attention to itself--- here is this little gem that you probably won't know about until you've been invited to an event. In addition to a tiny museum space of collectibles from the early days of electronics, you then walk into a space like Jay Leno's Garage, where row after row of polished perfection of classic cars are on display for your perusal. Now, because you can take photos next to them, you migh consider wearing 1920's or 40's costume and give yourself a free souvenir. These cars are PHENONMENAL though. You see them up close and in a very un-pretentious setting. You can host private gatherings there- with great catered food and bar. Delightful.",happywanderer13
50,An amazing hidden delight!,"Astor Classic Event Center is a hidden delight packed full of amazingness!! A wonderful venue for all types of events. I've attended multiple fundraisers & it's a truly unique place. From the outside it looks like a warehouse -- then you go in! The foyer/lobby area is filled with antique radios, phonographs, vintage bars & more. But then you enter the main room which is filled with perfectly restored vintage/classic cars. There is no way to describe their beauty & it's not just a few cars - it's more like 35 of these gorgeous babies!! Plus look around you'll see a wall of antique telephones, gas pumps, vintage luggage & the list goes on.If you're looking for a venue that's more than just 4 walls with banquet tables & chairs Astor Classics is worth checking out!",CharlaAV711
50,Excellent for dinner events,"I was there in 2007 during a dinner fundraiser and auction. I went in there for dinner with some friends and walked out with 2005 Kobe Bryant autograpged and game worn Shoes! I also got awesome Dodger tickets at the ESPN box, right next to Steve Garvey! I walked away with that stuff for a very cheap amount as the Angels Merchandise was hot because it is Anaheim and nobody cared about Laker or Dodger gear. The event was a hit and the cars were way cool. I thought I could walk in and show my wife around but nope. We asked very nicely and the guy gave us 5 minutes. It's all in the approach.",Daniel A
40,Cool place for a party,Had a great time for an adult birthday party. The cars are beautiful and you can get close up and really check them out. Food was good too. It is not open to the public as a museum. Only rented out for events.,Asnlsma
40,Nice venue for a dinner; surrounded by these classic automobiles,"Special treat to attend a private dinner meeting at the Astor ------ While the museum is not big it was still great to see the beautiful old automobiles, signs, radios, and other automotive memorabilia. It is possible to walk here from the area around the convention center. It took about 1 hour at a good pace",NSP9454
50,Awesome collectible cars,Art Astor has the nicest car collection around. Great Venue. Would use for an event anytime. Decorating is cool too,taxnerd
50,Arrived mistakenly thinking this place was open tp,"The public-- it's an event center, not a place for tours. The gentleman who was working there showed us around the absolutely fabulous radio collection and gave us a peek at the antique cars in the back....he was most gracious. It was still worth the mistake to be able to see all of the antique radios-- would hope to be able to attend an event here",onygo12
50,Beyond Amazing Displays,"Tucked away on a small street between industrial buildings is this unassuming building. As soon as you enter the amazement begins. The long foyer is filled with countless antique radios, bar set-ups, vintage phones, and other treasures from the 1920-50's. Then you enter the main gallery & I think I gasped as I stopped, stared & tried to take it all in. At least 40 mint condition vintage cars on display that you can walk around & check out up close & personal. On the surrounding walls are old gas station light fixtures & on a raised shelving throughout vintage luggage. It's just totally cool & you don't know where to look first!I've been here for multiple fund raising events & a better venue I can not imagine. I always look forward to visiting this amazing place.",CharlaAV711
50,A hidden gem!,"My friends held their wedding reception here. From the outside, it looks like part of an industrial park, but inside, it's an amazing museum of antique radios and vintage cars!! It was a beautiful reception with plenty of antique eye candy!",Frenchee A
