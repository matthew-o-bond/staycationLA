50,Off the Beaten Path With a VERY interesting history,"Really well preserved Craftsman style home that is chock full of stories of the settling of this area. The Wisteria is absolutely infectious when it is in bloom and you can smell the beautiful flowers waft over the neighborhood. The periodic events are always well attended and the volunteers make sure everyone has a wonderful time. Ukuleles, lemonade, dressing in white, dancing in the ball room. A beautiful tribute to a time long past when people whiled away a Sunday without electronics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/510kerryg
40,One of the cooler Passport2History Museums,"Another one of the Passport2History Museums, The Lanterman House is very interesting and pretty inside. The tour starts with a pretty boring video (if you have a toddler), but the actual tour is very cool. The highlight is probably the ballroom which apparently still has bi annual balls with live bands and period dress! I loved all the antiques throughout the house. While not there anymore, they had built an organ room, and that organ is now at the El Capitan!The woman giving us the tour was very nice and even let us pick a few oranges to take home! Make sure you double check that they give you the Passport discount, as we forgot about it and missed our discount. Check it out though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
