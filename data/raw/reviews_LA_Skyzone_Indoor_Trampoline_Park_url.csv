40,Donâ€™t rent the bounce board,Excellent place. Itâ€™s clean and has a nice set up. Strange pricing as each section of the place has a separate cost. They do have tons of summer specials and their hours are NOT whatâ€™s listed on their website they are open a lot more. The climb area is great one of the best I have seen with variety there are times two workers would be better so the kids arenâ€™t just standing around waiting. The workers are all very attentive which is a nice change!Do not waste your money on the bounce board- the Velcro does not stay latched on the left foot of waiter board and itâ€™s a waste of money.The color changing cup is a great deal free refills forever n soda!!!!The board is why I donâ€™t give it a five. There are no refunds even though itâ€™s defective.,G3612INchristinem
40,Pricey but fun,"A great concept for exercise indoors in a clean, air-conditioned environment. High levels of adult supervision from trained staff ensure the more adventurous activities like wall-climbing and zip-wiring are safely undertaken. A one hour session of high octane energy expenditure is not cheap at around 20 dollars but is very enjoyable. Beware the add-ons of compulsory socks only to be bought from the concession and the electronic games that will eat up your cash. Pity the latter has to be there at all.",Goomsu
40,Fun times,We came here on a CAA family day so it was a crazy good deal! It is clean with lots of bathroom facilities. I like that it is a little different from flying squirrel so as we live in between them and can easily switch it up!,Dawn L
40,Great Place To Get Energy Out,"Really fun place. They've added some new fun obstacles so it's not just trampolines, and of course the Dodge ball games are always a hit. The lines to pay and get stickers are always long and slow, with only 1 or 2 people working the computers when there are 3 or 4 empty ones available. It's also rather pricey, so I'd recommend getting a groupon...they are always available and make the experience much more affordable.",Lindsay S
20,Trampoline,Hey skyzone is a big trampoline. Place is clean and nice..... But hey its just a trampoline...... The website could have been clearer.Not much fun.....,larryram1962
40,Prices & jumpin,"This is the perfect place to take a couple bored teenagers & kids! The trampoline arena is huge! And there are various games that are available for everybody to play such as: dodgeball, shooting basket balls, and jumping in a foam pool. There is also an arcade. This is an excellent place to host a birthday party although I have never done it! Definitely recommend everybody to try it once !",Sophi B
40,Tons of fun for family great location!,We live this park. They always have discounts on Groupon etc. so check that out before you go. Either way itâ€™s affordable and fun for the family. I wish they had more jump areas for adults. Iâ€™ve seen people do some amazing tricks and jump/flips but some of them arenâ€™t permitted for liability purposes. Great place for birthday parties and located right off the strip if you want to get your kids to burn off a bunch of energy playing dodgeball or trampoline basketball etc.,LasVegasBarbie
40,Worth a visit!,"Wanted to visit an American trampoline park on my vacation more than 6000 miles from home, and this worked just fine ðŸ˜‰ The trampolines were a bit too narrow for us a bit older, and it was pretty hard to even do a crash dive anywhere without hitting the unforgiving edges.. But the staff was awesome and I met some fellow Youtubers! Overall a fun little detour!",Uncouth
50,This place is great now,We have been here a lot lately . The place is well ventilated now and has so many new areas . I would love to say thank you to one of the mangers Walter who always treats my kids like family . Super great guy,lb33wonka
30,Be prepared for long lines and large crowds,"Fun place for both kids and adults, however, this location can get jammed packed. Staff here are hit or miss.",Kryssy Pooh
40,Son's Birthday Party,"It was a pretty good atmosphere, but it was a little too busy and crowded. Not enough space for everyone to have an enjoyable time. However, the manager was nice and accommodating.",Sandra L
20,Very disappointing,"The place has huge lines, the service is pathetic. They treated as like if they were doing as a favor. It is 28$ for 2 hours and 2 bad slices of pizza. It is run in a very disorganized way!",Elizabeth S
50,Number one energy buster,"This is a very clean, active trampoline center. The kids always have a great time. It can get very busy on the weekends because they have a lot of parties. Even then, it's organized very well and worth every penny.",Marci C
40,"Found this around the corner from our vacation hotel, and it was an awesome find!","My son and I found this place while we were at our hotel during some down time on our vacation, and it was a lot of fun! They didn't have dodgeball open for his age, so he was a little disappointed, but he loved the other things, and had a blast on the ninja wall and rings. It was a great time and we'd come again if in the area!",livs_mama
40,Rainy day,We were here with our cousins when it was lashing rain out side it was safe and was a lot of fun we were there for an hour such was the perfect amount of time,cholahan
30,Overcrowded Trampoline Park,"I have visited this location previously in the summer. My most recent experience.... Not so good. It lacks security, anyone can walk in. It was overcrowded. Parking is a little awkward. And did I mention, it was crowded. Went to a birthday party on a Saturday afternoon.",Tonya2011
40,kids had fun,Sky zone is full on fun for kids and the family. Couldn't ask for better time.Great time with the kids but do not eat the pizza. The plate tasted better.,PR733
20,Too Many People,"When they first opened, it was a nice to take the kids. I think it's gotten so popular that they can't control the capacity. We attended a birthday party and I swear it was a fire hazard. They should monitor the number of private parties they have and walk-ins.",Traci C
40,LOVE THIS PLACE,Great place for adults and kids. Clean and seems safe. Highly recommended for locals and tourists.The staff are helpful as well.,Tamara A
10,The worst customer service ever!!!! your better off at chuck e cheese,"I was looking to give our 6yr olds 7th bday party here at the Torrance Sky zone which would be in October, so we decided to take her for the first time to Sky zone just to see what all the fuss was about. Okay so this was on yesterday 07jul14. We arrived and were greated by a lovely personality behind the counter with a smile and all. After checking in she pointed over to where it read Main Court and said that the staff there would give us all the rules..etc. When we got there the 2 guys who worked there in the orange t-shirts did not aknowledge us at all.I then let one of them no that we were told that they would give us the rules. The nicer one of the 2 said very nicley to our 6yr old about where she can jump and pointed and then proceeded to tell the other guy with the colored eyes that it was his break time and he gotta go. So he talked to my baby for about 10 seconds and then he was out!!! So I asked the other guy with the colored eyes to give us the run down and rules since this was our first time and he POINTED to the board below where the rules were very unconcerned. Unbelieveable!! So I started to look around to see if there was anything else that my daughter could do and I actually found other little jumping areas that she could to participate in. So yes silly me I asked the guy with the colored eyes another ? and he was clearly irritated with me asking him another ? and walked away while I was asking him. I will never give my baby a party THERE ever. They need to give some customer friendly classes there at Sky zone Torrance or shut it down. Horrible experience.......",Riecca C
10,I should have rented a jumper instead,"Bad Birthday party experience, this place is good if want too jump around but birthday parties are not good, after my party for my 6 year old daughter I felt it would have been better to rent a jumper and put it on my front lawn rather than waste money at skyzone.Jan 18, 2014 I had a package for 1hr jump time and 40min party to follow, jump time was good the kids loved it , the party not so good, our party host kept getting interupted by some guy wearing a orange ninja outfit, I assumed he was a skyzone employee he was in and out of room several times, after pizza while we were eating birthday cake ninja boy, some guy wearing a head band and 2 women started moving stuff into the room for the next party, we then turned to our host and asked what was going on can we finish our party, she apologized and asked ninja boy to wait our party was not over, headband guy and 2 women waited at door watching our party, ninja boy returned with several skyzone employees with a few carts of party items, skyzone employees started to clean while my guest were still seated at tables our host gave no warning party time was up. we complained to managment but they said that there was nothing they could do because it was a party for someone from the corporate office that is why we were rushed out.Scooter's Jungle, Adventure Plex, Kids Concept, Chuck E Cheese and renting a jumper are much better options than wasting money at Skyzone never again!!!",Eric B
50,Good facility for kid's party,"We became aware of Skyzone when my son was invited to his friend's 4th birthday here. It's in Gardena and easy to get to right off the 405 freeway.The place was very well maintained and managed. There was free valet parking upon arrival. Check-in was quick and they either loan you free shoes to jump in or you can buy a pair of socks for $2.For the bday party we had our own large trampoline reserved which was perfect because it wasn't crowded. Our group had it for one hour which was plenty of time. You can also go check out the other jumping activities during that hour. The staff were pretty good with keeping things safe and orderly.Afterwards we had pizza in a reserved party room where you get two staff to hand out juice, pizza, cake, etc. Those party rooms are booked tightly, we didn't have much time to lounge around after pizza and cake.It really seemed like a great idea for a party because they handle everything for you from the second you valet and walk in the door. Plus the kids had a blast.After jumping we had a reserved r",Mario0007
40,jumping is lots of exercise!,"$10-15/hour. During weekdays I think Monday and Wednesdays parents get to jump free with child under 7. We unfortunately came on Tuesday. wear socks as you get ""jumping sneakers"" to borrow to jump in. as far as i could tell, no extra fee for the sneakers. lots of supervising staff for safety. they were good, very vigilant to try to keep crashes/injuries to minimum (1 jumper per square). 60 minutes is A LOT of jumping- i would have been fine with 30 min of jumping. lockers available. i watched parents with 4 yo and under chasing them. i don't think that is a good age. i would think ages 6-teens would be good. there are 2 -3 large trampoline dodgeball areas which you have to sign up ahead of time. there are lines for the basketball dunk and the foam pit, but they move pretty quickly. the staff doesn't let you dawdle. i think 30 minutes would be good as you have to lock up your stuff and after 30 min you will be thirsty enough to get something to drink and check out. otherwise you have to finish your drink in the central area or lock it up again.large school groups come on weekdays in summer time. i think they clear out after 1pm. i don't know if weekends are crazy busy, that might not be as fun.",gypsy41
30,Good to try once,"Got a Groupon for a 2 for 1 price on 1 hour of jumping. We went with our three kids. Parking fills up quickly and there was a sign at the entrance that if you parked next door at ""Tonerland"" you would be towed. I would recommend preprinting the waivers everyone has to sign before getting there. That saved us time checking in. Once your waiver is signed they put you in their computer system and they said that the waiver is good for one year, so on future visits you don't have to fill one out again. Next you're given shoes, like when you go bowling, your not allowed to wear your own shoes or socks on the trampolines. I'm not sure if normally they charge separately for the shoe rental but it was included in our Groupon price. If you don't want to wear the shoes (they're high top, boxing looking type of shoes) you can purchase a pair of special socks for $2.00 a pair and you're allowed to jump in those. They have small rubber grips on the bottoms and we were told you can bring those each time you visit and jump in them. My husband and I did the shoes and we bought the socks for the kids. You're then given a sticker that's printed out to wear and it shows what time you can start jumping and what time you have to stop depending on what time you paid for. The nice thing was we were set to start at 4:00pm but were allowed to get on the trampoline probably 10 min early. Next we rented a locker for $0.25 to store our stuff. I liked the cheap locker price but it's one time use only. Meaning, it was a quarter to start and then 5 min later our kids wanted something to drink, so we open the locker and guess what, that's another quarter. Just be aware and maybe keep some money on you so you don't have to reopen every 5 min.So the place is basically a giant warehouse with giant super long trampolines running along the perimeter of the building with a snack area/rest area in the middle. You climb a set of stairs to reach the actual trampoline and staff are positioned there, sort of like referees. They explain the rules to you which are, one person to a square (the trampolines are divided into squares, maybe 4x4), you cant' sit or rest on the trampolines, if you're tired you have to leave the floor. Also, our 3 year old could not jump without an adult supervising him. But we had to stay in a separate square than him.We start jumping, and within 5 min we're sweating. Now I'll admit my husband and I are out of shape, but I think it was a combination of the actual jumping and the fact that it is HOT in there. There is no A/C. Only large pedestal fans oscillating and then when you leave the trampoline to the eating area, there are huge industrial fans on the ceiling that do provide some relief. However, when it's hot outside, packed with people who are sweating, I can imagine it must start to smell.So jumping with the kids, it was very annoying that every 2 min or so the staff/referees are shouting the rules at you...""One person per square"", ""You have to stand up"", ""No leaning on the sides"". I get that it's for your safety but with a 3 year old who wouldn't listen it got annoying fast.The dunk area where you can jump to dunk a basket ball you have to wait in line. Same for the area where there is a foam pit to jump into. We passed on both because my kids didn't want to waste time in line. The rest of the courts are empty apparently reserved for dodgeball, which you can't even play unless you sign up ahead of time.After jumping for about 5-8 min, I was bored. I couldn't really jump high enough to jump from square to square and I kept landing funny where my knee would give out or my ankle would give out. I can completely see someone landing wrong and twisting or spraining something. Aside from that, you're jumping up and down in the same spot. At least someone could have been showing us how to do some tricks or tossing a ball around or SOMETHING. Of course my kids had a blast, but for adults...eh.Even though we were paid for 1 hour we left after 30 min. Lastly I would like to comment on the fact that this place has only been open for a little over a year and it's already beat up in some areas. Couches provided to sit on had duct tape on them. The tile floors were so dirty. The bathroom was dirty with one toilet clogged and hair in the sink. I get that a place that caters to kids will be hard to keep clean, but that just means you double the effort and get employees cleaning. Most employees were on the younger side and I didn't seem them do much but stand around.All in all, ok we tried it once just to see what the hoopla was about and I'll have to pass on a second visit. I can't even imagine how some people have bday parties here. Between the kids running back in forth to eat and drink something and then jumping, I can imagine someone has tossed their cookies.",Helena C
