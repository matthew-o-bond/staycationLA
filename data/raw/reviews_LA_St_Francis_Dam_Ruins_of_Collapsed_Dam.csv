40,I read about this Dam and the collapse,"I read about this Dam and the collapse, among the critical moments of history in California. Fascinating, education, still a powerful memory of a tragedy.",Dana Los Angeles
30,St. Francis hike,"Pretty scenery. The hike up/down the hill is not the most even footing. To the left and right of the trail there is not the most secure barrier to prevent falling off the path. As of yet, I haven’t made it to the top of the mountain.",Scenic185473
50,There it Is! Take It!!!,"The Title above....Immortalized the Words that William Mulholland said when the first sluice gate opened and (remember this) water came rushing down the paved aqueduct by where the Northbound 5 & 14 Fwys dissect . ""El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles del Río Porciúncula"" NEEDED three things....A) A shorter name!! B) People-Capital $$ C) and WATER!. Well...We Call it now ""LA"" (short enough?) or Los Angeles. There are PLENTY of People!!! And the Water ""thing"" has always been a challenge when your trying to turn a desert into vibrant city!So who to go to? Mulholland of course. He stole, murdered, and sometimes legally purchased lands up along 395 Hwy to Bishop. But, we needed a method to store this Water.It is March 1928 late at night and THE WORST CIVIL ENGINEERING disaster just occurred! The San Francisquito Dam just failed!!! The wall of water did not stop until it hit another immovable geographical area...THE PACIFIC OCEAN almost 40 miles away. Was it reported in the Los Angeles Times? Barely a 10th page note!!! It was not until the gravity of the amount of dead people was discovered by a syndicating press member. That it was then Known!!!Now today you can see the few remaining concrete ""Pieces"" left. It is best NOT to go during the summer months unless you are into Heat, dust and More Heat with blowing winds! Bring water for everyone and tell someone where you're going. Sunset and sunrise are the best times. If you bring a Pet-Dog, please REMEMBER there are coyotes who will come from behind you and grab your best 4 legged friend for a snack! So use caution. Dress, being aware of (I've never seen one) rattle snakes! Now if one DOES happen to bite you...You will not die...OK? Just either drive to the local Hospital (local one, not Long Beach for example). They have ""Anti-Venom""Look up on Google Earth the approx area of the Dam (San Francisquito and Copper Hill Dr.) and look north about 3-4 miles. You will find pieces as small as gravel and as large as 30 feet squared! Do yourself a favor and your family...Do NOT take any concrete pieces home! Just read the reason why on Bodie Ghost Town up by Mammoth June Lake Area for your answer. Be aware there is Private Property around. So DO NOT TRESPASS! There are areas to park, and they just happen to be the closest to where you can see the pieces of concrete. There are no graveyards or bodies buried there. In fact a while later there were 500 Eucalyptus Trees planted along Hwy 126 in recognition of the Dead. The Glen Tavern Inn in Santa Paula served as a morgue for the bodies found down stream. It is reported to be an active place!",Steve
50,"Devastation, flooding, death, debris","Devastation, flooding, death, and debris. Hubris, pride, and ego led to the construction of a large dam without investigating the stability of the canyon wall. Debris and remnants of the dam remain in the canyon as testament to the dam collapse. More of a foot note to the Los Angeles effort to bring water and the development of the San Fernando Valley. Wathch the film Chinatown to understand the push to build the dam. Piru, Fillmore, and Santa Paula were flooded by the dam break. Hundreds of people died.This event should be discussed in the California water project in high school. Not every event can be engineered without investigating the site, terrain, and locale. Good lesson in humanity.",Cavydad
40,Amazing history,Crazy more People don’t know this damn disaster. It is rather hard to spot along the roadside but it’s well worth the effort a bit of a hike and you will appreciate once was a giant damn and reservoir,1kenny
30,Ruins are hard to find from the road now that the one big piece of the dam that once was still there is gone,"On many a Boy Scout camping trip during the drive up San Francisquito canyon Road you could see a large center section of the dam still standing. But as of about 20 years ago when I drove up there I couldn't find it. It took several trips back and forth before I was sure I had the right spot and it looks like that piece was taken down at some point, probably because it was becoming a hazard.The history of this dam reads like a how to do it book for creating a disaster.Contrary to the only options for last visit to this site, I was actually last there in 1995 and have been familiar with this particular collapsed dam since the 1950s.",Roy H
30,So Much History here along with a lot of memories,"There is not much left to see of the dam, but if you research the history or travel with the historical society which offers tours once a year on the anniversary, this is an amazing place. How many chances will you have to visit a place of such catastrophe and have it brought to life, when it hasn't been changed or memorialized to an unrecognizable state. It is still here as it was. Come check it out.",Sojournarita
30,hard to find location,There isn't much leave from the dam collapse of 100 years ago. It's up San Francisquito Canyon. You can barely make out the rubble and need to hike up from the side of the road about a quarter mile to the location.,wvillamil
40,Hook up with a Tour of the Dam,"Besides reading up on the dam before you go to this site, another good way to experience the ruins (the second largest disaster in California history) is to hook up with the Santa Clarita Community Hiking Club for a tour of the St. Francis Dam site presented by the SCV Historical Society. That's what we did today with about ninety or so other folks. The tour started at Power Plant No. 2 where the original power plant was wiped out by a 140' tall wave of water when the dam collapsed. The Power Plant has since been rebuilt. The tour then moves up the road to a large turnout where we hiked down the old San Francisquito Canyon Road, closed ten years ago when it was washed out by an El Nino storm. The road makes for an interesting hike in and of itself and is slowly being reclaimed by nature. From the old road, you can see dam ruins in the stream bed as well as the eastern wall where the dam was affixed to schist and near an ancient landslide and the western wall which is a completely different and porous rock type. There is a faint and overgrown trail (but passable) to the top of the western side of the dam where some dynamited remnants of the western attachment to the dam remain. We also learned that there is an effort to get a bill passed to establish the area as a National Monument with a visitor center and wall with the names of the 400 plus deceased memorialized. Right now a visit is free. And, the hiking tour and historical discussion by the SCV Hiking Club and SCV Historical Society was free. The hiking tour then continued with an optional hike across the streambed, along the DWP road (closed to vehicular traffic), which skirts across the hillside above the eastern portion of the dam and then exited near Power Plant No. 2 (about a five mile hike with some steep, rustic wood stairs at the very end).",CacheOn
30,Lived in the area for 25 years,"In reading the other reviews about the St. Frances Dam ruins I must agree that there is not much to look at to the layman eye. Living in the area for 25 years I have walked all over the old dam area and I am still amazed by the power that was unleashed that morning. There are large concrete pillers moved way downstream with wrought iron rods mangled & broken off, there are parts of the foundation still in-place with a little waterfall tucked back in there as well as a pond that is slow moving. There's not much water these days but spring time is the best time to go or after a good rain. Also, when you drive down San Francisquito Canyon Rd toward Valencia take notice of the north facing slopes of the hills and you will see how the granite was exposed from the rushing water. Take a minute to try and imagine that huge wall of water rockin' through that narrow canyon and you will start to see it better.If the ruins are not your cup' then the old road that was wiped-out by the ""real"" El Nino is still in-tact and is great little walk or bike ride up and down especially in the morning -bring your dog. One caution...there are snakes, most are not poisonous, but I have seen a rattler or two in 25 years.",Vin S
30,"Hard to spot, but cool none the less.","Make this drive for the history alone... the ruins aren't plainly visible from the road, so you need to do some looking around.",Kaisertod
30,"a slice, or flood of history","there is not much to see, but the story behind it is tragic. We pay little attention to the dry riverbeds around town, but they were once a scene of destruction.",Leslie H
20,There's little left here and nothing to guide you.,"The dam is not marked at all. Most of the directions on the web are from the years ago days when the previous San Francisquto Canyon road was the path between Santa Clarita and Green Valley. That got flooded out a decade ago. I saw on the news (KHTS or The Signal) a couple months ago that they are finally going to make what is left of the ruins a historical site. That is long overdue. The dam failure is probably one of the deadliest events in 20th Century California and yet there is not even a historical marker.Hopefully this piece of history gets the recognition it deserves. Right now you have to do the ad hoc, self-guided tour which is unmarked and ingress/egress is more challenging than it should be.",ready2gonow
50,Birthday Family Hike,"Had a awesome time, want to go again soon. This would of been awesome for the city of Santa Clarita, if the dam was still in use. Things do happen for a reason, but why did it have to be so tragic? Life still goes on, flowers of St. Francis Dam disaster site live on, Gos Bless.",Deena70
30,Shambles and strenuous hike,"This is a historical site in the area. It is near a power station, but is hard to hike to. Most of the recognizable structural parts are long gone. Best to see it when the SCV Historical Society takes a tour there in March I believe. You learn a lot then with the excellent docent.",Cherie P
30,Tough place to visit nowadays,"This location used to be a very interesting place to visit and explore but those days have past. A storm washed out the main road and they put in a new road that bypasses the location. You can still find it but you have to be attentive to the markings or you will pass it by. There used to be a large poster of the history of the damn at the power station just south of it but I'm not sure that's there anymore either. If you go, look for a turnout to access the old abandoned road and then hike in. Most of the recognizable features have disappeared so it will take some imagination to envision how the damn used to be. Still a nice hike but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",TF146
50,A very interesting but somewhat strenuous hike.,"We hiked with the SCV Historical Society and had a terrific and very interesting time. Wear hiking boots, a hat, sunblock, and bring water. Watch for snakes. Worth the effort!",vinojeff

You can walk the dry river bed and the huge boulders are part of the dam walls. Be VERY CAREFUL in the summer with rattle snakes. To get there you will be walking through the brush, long pants and shoes are recommended. There is no charge for this also no restrooms.",wvillamil
40,Fun Hike!,It was a bit tough to tell what was part of the Dam and what wasn't. Overall though it was a pretty cool hike. There is a cool old road that runs down the middle of the site. The newer street signs make it look like a zombie movie set. Definitely worth a trip!,bubbagump813
40,Discover a piece of history for yourself!,"It was a beautiful drive up San Francisqyuito Canyon. At one point you could see the remnants of the dam from the road so we parked and walked less than 1/2 mile and found where the dam had been. We walked down the riverbed for quite a ways and then hiked back up. Luckily, we were with a CA native who lived through the big dam flood and knew all about it. If you're not that lucky, I think you will get more out of the experience if you read up on it first. Lots of books and tons on the internet about it. Overall a great hike on a gorgeous summer day - before it got too hot! Enjoy...",KnowsWhatSheLikes
40,Hike It for Best Views of Dam Ruins,"You would probably want to read up on the history of the St. Francis Dam collapse before viewing the ruins in order to appreciate the disaster that occurred. To really see the ruins, and in fact actually walk on top of pieces of the collapsed dam, you have to hike in and up to the top of the hill. The ruins are unmistakable blocks of old concrete. It is an interesting place to explore in general, especially now that the storm-ruined old San Francisquito Road is closed down and slowly being overtaken by nature. Usually a small stream is running, there are lots of animal tracks and the vegetation is green along the stream bed. Spring is a great time to visit before the hot summer months hit. If you happen to be a geocacher, there are several geocaches in the area to find as well as an earthcache.",CacheOn
20,A Great Place in History ... but not much left,"This is an interesting place if you know the story, but honestly there isn't much left to be seen. If you don't know what you are looking for you are likely to drive right past it. Still the story is fascinating.",mrliterature
