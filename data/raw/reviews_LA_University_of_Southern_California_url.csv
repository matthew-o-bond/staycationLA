50,Memorable visit to outstanding campus,"We spent a tremendous couple of hours exploring the beautiful campus. From its first intake of around 50 students in 1880 it is today ranked as one of the leading academic institutions worldwide.It was the annual homecoming weekend and there was a palpable atmosphere of celebration and excitement.A number of exceptionally marvellous buildings were on our itinerary. Doheny Memorial Library is splendid with ornate features and terrific reading rooms.Further south we visited Mudd Hall, also called Hoose Library of Philosophy. It is delightful, again with great embellishments and a wonderful reading room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia

50,Leadiing University and Always Fun To Watch The USC Band,We have been to the USC campus a number of times. This time we went to a USC football game .

40,University Village Complex A Relaxing Spot In DTLA,"The campus is a great place to roam. You will find toilets in most buildings but if it's a weekend, opt for the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. People near the student union can help you out. Definitely walk past the athletic fields and the pool, see the fountain, the library complex, and check for events while you are here. Across Exposition Blvd is the Coliseum complex with the stadiums, rose garden, and museums. If you pick a weekend you might be inundated with sports fans and tailgates. Weekday afternoons are best if you don't like crowds. Along Jefferson Avenue is the delightful University Village lifestyle complex. Lots of restaurants, shops, and a couple of bigger box stores. Al fresco seating means the opportunity to watch the student crowd drift by between classes, dorms, and events. Definitely one of the best spots to relax in downtown LA. Take the Exposition Line here either to Jefferson or Expo Park. You can also drive. There is both street level and underground parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoom_Gotti

50,Fighton! The most beautiful campus in the world.,"It still seems surreal that I get to walk this campus consistently as a masters student. It’s truly gorgeous in every sense of the word. Obviously, we’ve had our troubles and issues with the admissions scandal and the reputation as the University of Spoiled children. But there’s so much more to USC than that. It is one of the best universities in the world, one of the most elite universities in the United States with an extremely low admission rate and home to one of the most diverse student bodies on the planet. If you get a chance, definitely take a tour of the place. Bring comfortable walking shoes.Unfortunately, despite the immense wealth of most people who attend the university and its prestige, the area around USC isn’t the best, so be aware of your surroundings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natesmith1016

50,Very 'LA' campus,"The campus is quite cozy to walk around. Buildings are in different styles. So you never get bored. Modern ones like Annerberg school. Historical ones like the cinematic school. Don't forget to check out the stadium and outdoor pool. USC is famous for its sports team. You'll see different teams training on site. I love the water polo team the most :p Also You'll see skate boys/girls all over the campus. That's how they commute in campus. Decent cafeteria with Chinese, American, Mexican food if you want to eat there. Good luck with the parking tho. Street parking will take forever to find. The parking structures on campus is a bit expensive and mostly reserved for students.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmzhang
40,"Nice place to visit, but good luck getting in!","So many people buy USC merchandise, but the odds of getting into the university are extremely low. Not just a university for ""spoiled rich children"" anymore, USC has gone out of their way to recruit ""underprivileged"" minorities as of late to improve their image. But with that said, you have to get stellar grades to get in or be a nationally ranked athlete to get priority/early registration. Without a scholarship, ""SC"" will set you back at least $200,000 without factoring in food or housing. It's currently more difficult to get into USC than UCLA or Berkeley, with Stanford being the most difficult in the US. Nice campus and people are polite, but the campus is in the middle of a ghetto. So unless you live on campus, your safety is questionable in off-campus housing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
50,"Toured this place with 2 sons, grandson and grandaughter","USC is a beautiful campus once you are on the campus and parked. It has many interesting things to do.

30,Expensive & In the Ghetto,"They have some amazing programs at USC, and it is really well thought of as an institution, but the cost is through the roof (around $50,000 per year if you live there), and the school itself is in the ghetto. USC would do better to relocate to anywhere else in So Cal. I wouldn't walk around here at night, you might get shanked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850dd
50,Much improved,"The campus of the University of Spoiled Children has always been impressive, but it verges on being dangerous because the school, a bastion of white privilege, had done little to connect with the largely poor and non-white community that surrounded it. That has largely been rectified. Go, USC!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl

30,"Good college visit, neighborhood could be better","While the Campus of USC was certainly wonderful and has almost anything a student would want, the neighborhood adjoining it left a lot to be desired.I would recommend that USC start the long and hard process of developing the adjoining areas into up-scale residential and shopping / mix use developments that would compliment the rest of their hard work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkH-WS
40,One of California's many great institutions,"I didn't attend this university but I would come here on my weekends to visit their botanical garden and sometimes just walk the campus. Its beautiful, huge and filled with lots of sights to see even on the weekends. Parking is $1 an hour and you can walk over to the gardens or through the campus. You will see many people their on the weekends as there is usually a lot going on and international students. The surround area is good, safe and filled with many shops and restaurants. Its a great little college community.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
20,Money grubbing elitists,"Wanna visit? Shell out $12 for parking. It's the first thing you do when you get there. Doesn't really leave a pleasant taste in the mouth and provokes the thought, ""Apparently they don't care if you attend or not."" In contrast, three other schools in the LA area offered free parking in areas that were obviously used normally as a paid parking area.One presentation was less about scholarship and/or personal development, and more about how they were the best (which is an easily debated assertion). That said, the tour guides were pleasant and the campus is secure and well-kept...which is why they get 2 instead of 1 as a rating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ComedyTragedy

50,USC is a beautiful school to visit and to send your child to.,"Both of our children, now very successful adults ages 38 and 25 went to USC. Both graduated with honors. Both are well employed as business executives. Our son was in a fraternity and our daughter was in a sorority and lived in a very safe, lovely sorority house ""on the row."" Their college friends and Greek families continue to be close friends. I address this fact because lots of ""Greek"" groups get a very bad rap and parts of that are true but for our children's experiences USC Greek Row provided a home base away from home. The University provided the accelerated programs our bight kids needed and prepared them well for employment and life. I strongly recommend that you and your college bound students visit this gorgeous campus and consider becoming part of the Trojan family. That is a lifetime adventure and major advantage as USC is one of the best Pacific Rim schools you can find.USC is located in Los Angeles across from the famed United Airlines Memorial Coliseum and is the official home to the USC Trojan football games and has been undergoing a rumored $270 million dollar renovation this year.

If you take the college tour, be sure to sign up for the long version and add the specific college afterward. You learn more than just walking around campus. One thing that stood out for us was that they had a rising senior give us our tour.

The campus is almost entirely flat so it is easy to walk, bike or skateboard around. We found lots of parking in the parking garage that we were instructed to use in the email from admissions. We stayed for lunch at a campus eatery called Lemonade. The prices were above average, but the food was fresh and delicious.

The bathroom signs were in elegant bronze plaques and USC is engraved into each elevator button - a bit over the top. Ate at CA Pizza Kitchen (limited menu) in the Student Center and also visited Lemonade on the second floor there for their signature drink.

But I believe I can pretty objectively say that this is a very very beautiful campus that is going to get even more beautiful as the many ongoing construction projects are completed. For example, still under construction is the new USC Village, which will house about 2500 students and which will also have dining and other retail stores for anyone. The architecture at USC is a bit diverse but the buildings launched since Max Nikias became president about 2011 have Gothic features that I find very pleasing and well-suited to a university.

Behind the walls along Exposition Boulevard sits a glorious compound of brick buildings, broad walkways and large, grassy squares from which one can take it all in. They keep adding more buildings, but somehow keep the new consistent, and complimentary to, the old.

The tour lasted 2 hours and consisted of a talk from one of the school's admissions officers and then a walking tour led by one of USC's students. The admissions officer had some great info about the nuts & bolts of applying, admission and student life. The walking tour really allows the campus to shine. All buildings appeared to be well-maintained and the grounds were clean and nicely landscaped. We were shown the interior of a library, a building displaying their athletic awards (including Heisman Trophies), the Cinematic Arts complex (featuring the Steven Spielberg Building and George Lucas Building) as well as several other places from one end of campus to another. Campus was buzzing with activity and students zipped by on bikes and skateboards. And of course, the weather was perfect. It was probably the nicest college campus I have visited. We didn't spend much time exploring the surrounding neighborhoods, so I can't really speak to that. But keep in mind that USC's campus is in the heart of Los Angeles, for better or for worse.

It is one of the ""bigger"" games for us each season and we always root of course against USC. However, it is still fun to see their football team (in spite of some recent issues).The one thing I dread however is the number of times the USC band plays the same song over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.As such, to me, its just a 4 star place but still a good university.

In addition the Grade Point Average (GPA) was 4.0 out of a 5-point system. USC is a very competitive and selective school. The faculty student ratio is 9:1 even though they have 40,000 students enrolled out of which 18,000 are undergraduate students. The average class size is 26. The annual tuition fee is $ 48,000. If you apply (using common app) before December, 1st you are automatically considered for the scholarship program. Otherwise the application deadline is January, 15th. The campus is unbelievable!

While visiting LA you'll hear people state that they are a USC or UCLA fan, so make the best choice of the two and become a USC fan yourself.So much to see and do on the campus and its close to the Science Center and Natural History Museum across the street and there is always some new shopping or section getting remodeled in the school or around the area, very nice place to visit or see some football.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Roaming_Raven

But before I ever attended this university, I grew up in the suburbs just a 20 -30 minute drive from the campus and my family and I used to frequent many of the attractions in the area immediately adjacent to USC. This included taking walks around the campus and seeing the Tommy Trojan statue. You can't beat the variety of attractions within close proximity to USC or just a short drive away (e.g., famous beaches, Downtown LA, theme parks, professional sports teams, concert venues, world class museums, Hollywood, Pasadena, the mountains, etc.), not to mention the world class academics and outstanding sports teams of the university.As a USC alum, there is something I would like to suggest to anyone who will be attending the university this Fall or anytime in the future. (Now that I think of it, this message applies to all alumni of USC, too.) I wish you much success at USC and beyond, but please don't be an obnoxious, arrogant, pretentious student or alumnus who walks around with a sense of entitlement.

50,Fight on,"We come from a family of die hard ivy leaguers and small new England colleges. Yet everytime I visit, I love this school more and more and can see why the students are so happy. The sun is shining, the campus is beautiful and has many lovely places to sit and talk. The bikes abound because it is so big. The band is fantastic. The football fun. The dorms are just ok but the sorority row is buzzing and the students while laid back are engaged in their pursuits. It is as diverse as a campus can be and yet you feel everyone morphs into a Southern Californian. The surrounding area is somewhat daunting but that is true of most of the Ivies. You can understand why so many movies are filmed here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCR_12
