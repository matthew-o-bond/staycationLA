40,Historic LIghthouse but not open to the public,"We had spent time in the nearby Interpretive Center, which also houses the original 1800's lens from France that was used for many years at the lighthouse. It was a nice easy and beautiful walk to the lighthouse from the Center. However, disappointing that you cannot see it, except from a distance. The area is quite nice though, with some green park shade area with picnic tables - great spot to eat. Wonderful views. Quite a bit of history with this lighthouse.",pasowine
50,Historic Lighthouse: Pointe Vincente Lighthouse,"We went to see Pointe Vincente Lighthouse, which was buildt in 1926. Its a beautiful lighouse to see in the Palos Verdes area.",mini
50,Enchanting,"We arrived at what we regarded as the perfect time to admire the fine construct and its gorgeous surrounding panoramic land and seascapes. Late afternoon as the evening light began fading.Walking from the Interpretive Centre towards the lighthouse was wonderful. Seeing the ever changing light on the rugged coastline creating varying patterns of hues was inspiring.It was fascinating to learn that its famous 5 foot Fresnel lens, which was hand ground in France, spent its first 40 years in an Alaskan lighthouse before ending up in Point Vincente in 1926.",permia
40,Lighthouse closed but place worth visiting.,"A very nice location to enjoy LA cliffs, sometimes whales or just have a relaxed walk. A little away from both LA and Orange (about 45 min drive) - but very nice and worth going there. Highly recommended if You have 2-3 available hours.",Grzegorz S
40,"Beautiful, but not open to the public","I visited the area last week (August 2019) and others have said there are days the lighthouse is open but we did not see where you could get anywhere close to it. There is a nice park like setting and going around sunset is gorgeous. We found it a great place to dog watch, too! I am a lighthouse fan so I was disappointed to not get to see it closer but I get many beautiful pictures.",BeadedWhimsy
50,Beautiful!,This is a must see. It is a lovely park with an incredible view. The day we stopped by was a bit overcast but it didn’t keep us from seeing the beauty of this area. It’s a definite picture stop. Bring a picnic and stay awhile!,yazdragonfly
50,Beautiful Lighthouse with Santa Catalina in the Distance,"Its all about the timing! Had been cold and rainy but that morning it cleared with the sun out and the Coast Guard practicing helicopter rescue training! Had a great front row seat of hovering craft lowering and retracting rescuers. This is one of the most dramatic viewpoints on the Southern California coast and it is free! Plenty of parking and an interpretive center right next door with clean restrooms. As an active Coast Guard facility the lighthouse area is fenced off. As it should be, considering the sheer cliffs of Point Vicente.",kumtux

40,A jewel of the Palos Verdes peninsula,"Point Vincente was named by Captain George Vancouver, an English explorer who surveyed the Pacific coast on his sloop ‘Discovery’, around 1790. He apparently named the point after his good friend Friar Vincente of the Mission San Buenaventura (located in present-day Ventura, CA).The Point Vincente Lighthouse is one of the jewels of the Palos Verdes peninsula, located at its southwestern tip near the intersection of Palos Verdes Drive and Hawthorne Boulevard. The lighthouse is situated north of the entrances to Long Beach and Los Angeles Harbours.While the lighthouse makes for a delightful view, until not too long ago it served a much more vital purpose for mariners, helping them avoid the rocky shoals that surround the nearby shore. The lighthouse was listed in the National Registry of Historic Sites in 1979.Built of plastered reinforced concrete, the lighthouse is 67 feet tall but as it is built on the edge of a cliff, it marks Point Vincente at a height of 185 feet above the ocean. Its beam can apparently be seen twenty miles away from shore. In addition, the lighthouse also had a fog horn to send out an audible warning to mariners during times of low visibility.The Point Vincente lighthouse came about as a result of a petition from sailors and navigators who sailed these dangerous waters in the early 1900s. Commissioned in 1926, it was one of the brightest landmarks on this coastline at that time.The lens that magnifies the lighthouse beam was manufactured by Barbier, Bernard & Turenne of Paris, the oldest lens making company in the world. This lens was apparently shipped to Point Vincente from Alaska where it had already been in service for four decades.During the Second World War the Palos Verdes peninsula was defended by the artillery of Fort MacArthur. History records that the during those war torn years, the 1000 watt beam at the lighthouse was replaced by a small 25 watt bulb and blackout curtains were kept ready to cover the lighthouse windows. In 1939 the Coast Guard made Point Vincente their main communication centre in Southern California.After the war, the relentlessly rotating beam became the target of bitter complaints from the residents of the peninsula who said they could well do without their slumber being disturbed by the powerful beam shining through their windows at night!In a bid to ensure a good night’s sleep for their neighbours, the lightkeepers did in fact paint the insides of the land-facing lighthouse windows a pearly opaque white. And that is when the “Lady of the Light” appeared. Many claimed that in the dim light shadowing through the painted lighthouse windows, they saw the silhouette of a tall woman in a flowing gown who slowly paced the tower’s walkway.Apparently, many stories did the rounds about the Lady of the Light – some said she was the ghost of the first lighthouse keeper’s wife who stumbled over the cliff one dark and stormy night, others had it that she was awaiting the return of her lover lost at sea, while yet others said she was the spectre of a heartbroken lady who threw herself from the cliff after her beloved abandoned her!Well after the war, the lighthouse was automated and the last lightkeeper left in 1971.The lighthouse and its grounds are usually closed to the public. However, while we cannot confirm this, we were told that the tower and a small museum are open to the public from 10am to 3pm on the second Saturday of every month.",TMenon
40,Nice Scenic View,The Lighthouse is closed but Interpretive Center is open. Beautiful view of the ocean and scenic vistas of the Rancho Palos Verde Peninsula. Plenty of parking available for free.

The second was taken north of the lighthouse. It was a gorgeous day!",LivPurple

50,Pretty Cool,"We took our 6-year-old son to check out the lighthouse. The lighthouse itself was a cool experience and something to see, but the view from the surrounding bluffs was breath-taking. The cool air breeze, the miles of kelp patties, and the waves crashing on the rocky shore was great to watch. We visited the nature center afterward and spent about an hour total between the lighthouse and the center. I""m glad we checked it out.",realmattwalker

40,Point Vicente Lighthouse Visit,"As a member of a local Club here in Palos Verdes, I was able to visit this old Lighthouse in the most SW part of LA County. It is open to the (general) public only on specific days; a visit to the nearby Point Vicente Intrepretive Center (PVIC), which is run by the City of Rancho Palos Verdes will provide more information about the potential to visit and specific details that apply for a visit to the Lighthouse. The Lighthouse is on US Government property and managed by the US Coast Guard with active duty USCG personnel actually living on the property, which largely explains the more controlled environment there. The property is VERY well kept and secured by an unmanned gate at the entry point. Again, access is very controlled and by specific permission only (contact the PVIC for more info). The Lighthouse also has an interesting Legend associated with it, as do a lot of older, similar structures. Access to the top for an impressive view of the surrounding area as well as an excellent view of the Fresnel Lens is sometimes allowed - be sure to take advantage of the climb up the stairs, if offered/allowed.Parking for the Lighthouse is free and convenient, right next to the fence and gate. A rather nice walk, once inside the gate, will put one right up to the Lighthouse. There is also a very small museum of some displays related to the Lighthouse right next to the Lighthouse. My several visits were all very enjoyable and worth the effort to get there to the now, NON-Functioning Lighthouse - replaced by advancing technology. There is also a very loud Fog Horn that still functions on foggy days - not a good time to visit with the impaired views & the periodic loud noise.I last visited the facility a number of years ago - NOT in Aug '16; and things may be different with elevated security in most Government facilities.",PVJOE
50,A walk Among The Clouds,This is such a great walk from the parking lot to the light house. It parallels the coast and the entire view is the Pacific Ocean. It is an amazing walk before sunset. And how often do you get to go to a lighthouse? Took the kids on this walk and it wasn't too hard for them at 10 years old.,Kristi Z
50,Picturistic Place,The ocean view was magnificent. There was a little trail you can walk from the light house to the other side along the ocean. Handicap accessible. We attended a wedding there and came back for a relaxing walk on another day. Wroth the visit!,May L

The landmark is open to the public on the second Saturday of the month or during the city's Whale of a Day Festivities in the spring. Check the City of Rancho Palos Verdes website for details. When the grounds are open, you can go into the lighthouse and tour adjacent buildings, one includes a display of Hollywood films and television shows that have been filmed in the area. Very interesting and informative. The lighthouse can be viewed from outside the grounds as well. It is operated by the US Coast Guard and occasionally there are training exercises conducted utilizing helicopters.",olinmom

This was our first real sightseeing in LA and it was awesome. The day was beautiful and you could see all the way to Malibu. The combination of the lighthouse in the palms set against the cliff was a great view and made for pictures. This was a much more traditional lighthouse than Point Fermin. Still what made it more picturesque was the cliffs and the setting. Just incredibly gorgeous.",Grover R

My main purpose is to look for the sunset. Well, it never ceases to inspire me with the beautiful sunset view there.

I just urge those that loves beautiful sunset to give this place a shot.",Tony S
40,Whale Watcher's View,"The lighthouse itself wasn't open when we went on a weekday, but there was a very nice Visitor's Center with a small museum that we went through. The docent there was very chatty and let us know about the history of the area and the whales that you can see. Outside there was a group of volunteer whale watchers who tallied their sightings on a whiteboard. Although there was a sighting posted earlier in the day, we were not lucky enough to see a whale.Mostly, the area is one to stroll and watch the waves hitting the rocks below. There are picnic table set up and during the summer it looks like there will be refreshments available. I would say that this is one of the must stops if you are driving along the peninsula.",VEC24
50,Simply Beautiful,"We got to visit the nature center which was very informative. Staff is very friendly. Walked the trail along the coast & enjoyed the beautiful views of the cliffs & lighthouse. One of my favorite spots for sure. There is a nice shaded area with trees where you can relax and read a book, picnic, take a nap. I highly recommend visiting this place. My plan is to come here at sunset next time as I can imagine it being even more romantic or also would be a great location for family photos.",christy91730
50,One of my favorite places!,"We love going to the lighthouse. It is a beautiful area. Close by you can walk on the cliffs and down along the coast. On our visit this time we saw Grey Whales, a mom and calf. This is a great place for whale watching in general, depending on the time of year. The cliff where the lighthouse sits is also home to a Red Tailed Hawk nest. Very peaceful and beautiful area, worth a visit!",Joe B
50,Great spot to see the sun set,"Very scenic coastline, good spot to go to see the sunset. There is a lot of parking available (unpaved lot, quite a few potholes to be aware of!) and a path to walk along the coast.",CJG_in_the_UK
50,Not open.,"I wasn't able to visit the inside of the lighthouse, but you can get spectacular views from the walking paths near the Interpretive Center.Lighthouse is open the second Saturday of each month.Stamp hunters don't fret, stamps are available in the Interpretive Center.",ExperienceMy31
50,Stunning!,A great place to look for whales and learn about the history and science of the area through 6 short videos.,Jeff C
30,Only only once a month,"The lighthouse can be viewed, but you can only tour the lighthouse one the second Saturday of the month between 10am-2pm. It is a pretty lighthouse to look at, but we were not there at the right time to go inside.",jeepplover2000
40,Great View,"The actual lighthouse you can take a 'tour' but the tour isn't really a guided tour, just people going up the stairs in the lighthouse.Point Vicente Lighthouse is open to the public the second Saturday of every month, from 10 am to 4 pm. Free admission.",orcaandbeluga
40,Nice free parking area,"We didn't actually visit the lighthouse but there is a large free parking area with parkland, from where you can watch the wonderful sunset and experience the v-shaped flock of pelicans gliding by. Lovely spot to spend an evening.",Alan L
30,Cannot walk down to the lighthouse,"The light house is by the interpretative center.For some reason, the walkway to the light house was blocked.We could only watch the light house from a distance.",DavidNYC11
50,breathtakingly beautiful,"As a lighthouse enthusiast and photographer this was a great treat. Atop beautiful cliffs overlooking the pacific ocean she comes to life as the sun sets and blazes the red clay rocks. Drive down the road little and photograph it from different vantage points so you can get the waves crashing on the cliffs. Being on coast guard property, make arrangements in advance to see it. Please dont bother the residents.",jodar21
40,Amazing views and beautiful photography area,"We went on a spur of the moment, let's go out and do something today. Boy, it was worth it! I got some of the most beautiful shots I've ever taken. The views are spectacular! My husband and I had a little picnic and just took in the sights. The only thing we could ask for was the tours to be more frequent, we were a little disappointed by the limited schedule, we will probably never be able to go for that.",Vanessa C
50,Pt. Vicente seen in many TV/films,The lighthouse is an icon of the area; the Interpretative Center exhibit excellent and important to understand the local terrain and history,Stephanie M M
50,Breathtaking views,If you like walking beautiful trails you must take the hike around the Terranea Resort to the Lighthouse. The ocean view is simply gorgeous and the trail goes for miles. It's definitely worth you time! Enjoy!,Melody M
50,Perfect picnic & hiking spot,"Bring a picnic and hiking shoes, this place is awesome. Great views and trails. Not busy, even on the weekend when I visited. Free parking. Trails are wheelchair accessible too.Great greenspace with park and lots of trees. Very peaceful.",DeeThunder
50,really pretty place to visit,nice run from hotel and great views of ocean from the parking lot. good interpretive trails near here as well.,rdrdr1
50,20 minute drive from the South Bay Area,"I've lived in Los Angeles my whole life and have never heard of this spot until Trip Advisor. Actually I haven't heard of quite a few LA spots until Trip Advisor?Anywho, it is absolutely gorg and is definitely worth a trip. My family and I decided to take a Sunday drive up to the light house and were amazed at how beautiful and peaceful it was. We arrived around 7pm which was disappointing because we missed the sunset but there was still enough light to see everything including Catalina in the distance. It wasn't crowded at all, just a few folks taking pictures and 1-2 couples taking in the view. There is a paved trail that you could walk but we got there too late. The lighthouse it self wasn't open but I'm guessing people go there for the views more than the light house. Definitely recommend going if you love ocean scenery and serene places.",310dini
50,Romantic place for a Picnic,There are benches so close to the ocean that you can feel the ocean spray and watch the sun set over Catalina.,Kim W
50,The most valuable hidden gem in Los Angeles,"I think most people, even in LA, don't know how good this place is. It's better this way, because maybe it's good just because many people don't know that.I often consider the Point Vicente as a mandatory stop in every bike ride I do over the PV peninsula. I can't name another place with so many qualities:- It's a few miles from home, but feels like a place that's hours driving from home - even better than some places that are really a couple hours from LA, like Ventura or Santa Barbara;- Not crowded, therefore tidy, and breathtakingly beautiful;- Great for nature-themed pictures;- With an excellent, free and well managed museum;- It's free;- You can see whales often (mostly gray whales, but even the blue whale sometimes) - it's a perfect observation point;- Not only whales, but there's diverse fauna to photograph: birds (pelicans, falcons), rabbits, squirrels, even snakes (seriously);- Great to visit by bike - easy access from Torrance/Redondo Beach or San Pedro;- The lighthouse is open to the public one Saturday a month. It's no big deal, but interesting;- Best place for picnic in LA in my opinion.However, this place wouldn't be as good if it were crowded. So, it's best to keep it as a hidden gem.",pvdesign
50,Don't pass it up,"I love that when you come to Rancho Palos Verdes Peninsula, and you drive along the Palos Verdes Drive to Terranea. You defiantly forget that you are in Los Angeles. You really should check out the Lighthouse. It is still the same as it was back when my Dad was little. really neat and the views are amazing!",Anna U
50,History,Beautiful view. Plenty of parking. Great location for taking pictures. Very well maintained. Not a lot to look out. A nice place to relax and take in the sight of the old light house.,Kathy F
30,short diversion,"Little lighthouse, little museum only open 1 saturday a month??? Don't make it a desination, but nice to stop if you're driving by",LaurieUtah
40,Fun hike,It was fun to hike over to the Lighthouse....It's right near the road so you need to be a bit careful...but it's a fun hike from Terranea Resort.,markdmarc
50,Lady in the Lighthouse,Great tale to make you wonder about the lighthouse being haunted. Little know place but very scenic. Only open on the second Saturday of the month except for March.,la_la_land_lover
50,Scenic walk!,A wonderful half mile trail overlooking Pacific Ocean from the south end of Hawthorne Blvd. to the light house is worth your time to hike. I did twice on X'mas day and numerous times at different months. We took many pictures and videos.,Susan R
40,Place That Deserve More Notice,This lighthouse has been in Ranch Palos Verdes since 1926. It is a place that deserve more attention and appreciate. It is actually an important landmark and beacon mark for thousands of vessels traveling down the S. CA. coast. It is open for tours on the second Saturday of each month between 10am to 3pm. Best viewing point is from the City Interpretive center and half hour before sunset. The sunset ray shines upon the reddish cliff.. it is truly an astonishing sight to see.,Tony S
40,"For a place with a View, Where close to the Ocean, You can Renew!","It makes for a beautiful photographic shot, for even the Non Photographer! There are gorgeous views of the ocean below and places to have a nice Picnic! I bring a blanket and do a little massage, too! MasseurJoe",MasseurJ
