40,Good Place to watch Sports,"This is a fun place to have a couple of drinks, some food and watch Sports. The prices are average but they have a large menu and good finger food.",Phillip H
40,Good eats and cheap drinks,"I've known about this place for years, but just tried it recently. I think I have been here every week in the past 3 weeks! It's a great local bar to have inexpensive good food and drinks. They have a live DJ on Thursday night and it's pretty crowded for a weekday. Don't have to go far for some food and drinks.",Michelle I
30,Noisy.....,Great selection of beer. Not much for food. Place is so noisy and not ideal for getting together with friends. TVs showing different sports and news at times which adds to the chaotic noise. Not a place to converse with friends.,Drokis0301
50,Heaven for Sports Fans,"As if it was trying to hide, it is located in a secluded shopping mall across the street from the Cerritos Mall. For someone trying to find it there first time, it can be a little difficult. Rule of thumb is to find the Carls Jr. and park there. Then head past the liquor store into the corner and you will likely find smokers in front. Once inside a variety of noises hit your ears from the jukebox, to the t.v.s, the fish tank bubbles and clamor of voices. This a self seating restaurant, so just make yourself comfortable. Eventually someone will greet you if you are at a table but if you need that beer asap, then head straight to the nearest bartender. 35 different beers are on tap and a full food menu is served till 1am. With nearly 40 flat screens adorning the interior walls, you are bound to find the sport that suits you. Find your niche and enjoy your damn self.",Frederick v
30,Food and a TV for your favorite game!,"You can go early and eat and watch a game, or go late and just party. A local spot, typical sports bar, but food is better than average. We liked the sausage and cheese plate the most followed by the nachos (both chicken and beef). The garlic fries were really good!",george p
