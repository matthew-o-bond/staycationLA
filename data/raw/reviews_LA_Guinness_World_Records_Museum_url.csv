30,Average,Something to do as part of the multi pass but not very interesting or intuitive quite boring just writing on a wall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agt96
50,Pleasantly Surprised,I wasn't expecting much and only really went as we had a combo ticket but this place was good fun. Very interactive. Almost like a little arcade as you pit yourself against some of the records. Had a good time in here. Especially the decibels challenge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBRoxx
40,Interesting..,"Great way to spend the day of you have kids. Get the triple package though. It's worth it for entrance to Guinness, Wax museum, and Ripley's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glitter_In_My_Soul
40,Fun and Interactive Entertainment,"My wife and I bought the triple package (Wax Museum, Guinness and Ripley's) and it's a pretty solid deal for the price, especially considering the individual pricing. Of the three, I would say this is the most child friendly but honestly, most kids would do fine at Ripley's and the Wax Museum as well. This one seemed to have the most interactive activities of the three locations, while also being pretty informative about the records. The screaming room in particular had my wife in tears from laughing after I tried to break a record (almost did it!) and she realized that the room wasn't soundproof. It was a lot of fun to get competitive and see who could do better on different records. I'd definitely recommend this if you're already planning on the Wax Museum or Ripley's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RSzklarz
30,Interesting but no so recommended if you havent so many time,"Interesting place, but you can read and view almost everything you will see there on internet, not everything, but it is not so interactive and becomes to read and walk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danquinb
30,Fun,Fun place to visit. Some interactive activities for the kids. I would suggest getting the three attraction VIP ticket on line.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamedlovers
40,Fun Visit,"With grandkids (7, 10, 12). We all liked this museum. There were clever activities to do in addition to displays of the world records. Clean and spacious facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parrishh2013
40,Was better than I thought it would be,If you like this kind of stuff. There were interactive activities that made it worthwhile. Without them it would have been a dud. Ask for a combo ticket if they don't offer because it is a little pricy like everything here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/705matthewy
40,Fun but get the vip pass,"The admission price is steep for what you’re getting, so I’d splurge for the VIP pass that gets you into this, Ripley’s and the Hollywood Wax Museum for a full day of fun. Full disclosure, I didn’t do that but bought tickets throughout fundraising auction so I was at a meter instead of at an all day parking lot and I honestly could have used more time here! The first floor has some cool exhibits and a lot to read that is lost on younger children (I was with my five year old)... but they have some fun things for those kids to do like how many hits of a drum can you do in a given amount of time.The second floor has TONS of fun games! Like an arcade but you can play anything as much as you want without extra fees. I would imagine this would be terrible if super busy but it was just fine for us. We didn’t have to wait long. The basketball game was my favorite just because I could play those all day. They had a cool movie too.Then back to the bottom is pretty much the end. I wish it were larger but it was fun! I’d be mad if I paid $26 for just this though! Spend the extra 9 or 10 and go to all three museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
50,Pretty fun,Went here while in Hollywood walking around. I must say I really enjoyed. I honestly thought it would just be me walking around and reading about the records. That was not the case. There is so much interactive stuff to do which made it a great surprise for me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nykkitar
50,Don't think twice GO !,I just went with my boyfriend on 4/3/19 it was AMAZING! There's so many fun game to play ! You learn and record holders and you actually get to play the games and try to beat records it's so cool. My boyfriend made it to the record wall they have there and it was so cool how they announced it. If you wanna have a really fun time with someone I really suggest this is the place to go !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vcruz7597
30,It is interesting but not that much,"We've bought a combo ticket (Guinness Museum, Ripley's Believe it or not, Hollywood Wax Museum).It is interesting but not that much. There is an area to try to break some world records that is funny to play with your kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarioCanedo
40,Family U.S trip,"Great place to visit, pity about the location. Very informative and interesting facts. Easy to navigate and easy to read.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonrB1253YW
20,Meh,"It wasn’t that great if you are just going for it however, it was included in a 3 pack of tickets for about $30.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NFMTravel
30,Okay,"We had some time to kill so we got the 3 pass to Guinness, Ripleys and Wax Museum. Guiness World Records was our families least favourite. It is definently one we could have done without.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kay343
30,Questionable,"There were interesting facts,but wouldn't plan a vacation here. The kids weren't to thrilled. But, since we were in the area we went. There is a package deal, you get the wax museum,Ripleys and this museum. But the strip is so dirty. No public bathrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rtjjeda7
30,A quick fix,"We had just done 5 days of theme parks and were looking to kill some time in the morning before heading to Griffith’s Observatory.The place is pretty small and can be completed in about an hour. The displays were average, some are pretty clear and had good explanations and comparisons while some others were plain boring. The statues could be a more life-like.Towards the end, there were interactive games where you can try your hand at beating time which the kids enjoyed.In summary, I felt that for the price we paid, I would expect more from this museum. There is a good package deal for Ripley’s the Wax Museum and Guinness if you wish. And from what I read from the other reviews, the other 2 are better, so don’t make this your 3rd stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sammi_Ng
50,We had a blast,It was our first time visiting and we had fun interacting with the trivia stuff and taking pictures and trying to beat eachothers scores 😄,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/demonaliam
30,3 Museums,"It was fun, I got the ticket to go in to Ripley's, Wax Museum and the Record Guinness, Ripley was my favorite, Record Guinness was my least favorite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaViz
20,A Bit of a Disappointment,"We bought a ticket three pack that included the wax museum, Ripley's and Guinness. Guinness was by far our least favorite of the three. There isn't much here that's very interesting and the museum is pretty short. I would definitely recommend skipping this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PowerTrippersTravel
30,Small but fun,This is a fun place to visit if you actually take the time to read all of the exhibits. There’s a lot of information there. It’s kind of like being inside of one of the big box that all adolescent boys seem to love. Some funny and interesting exhibits as well as some gross ones but our boys enjoyed it. Does not take more than an hour to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationplannerMa
50,The Guinness world records museum was very straight and to the point.,"We had an awesome vacation in southern and central California. It was short and very jammed packed to fit in everything. We ended our trip in LA and my daughter wanted to do the Guinness world records museum. I was very skeptical doing it because we had traffic to deal with, a car rental to return and a plane to catch, so time was not on our side. We went for it, also knowing we would just leave if need be (which I really thought was going to happen). Was I blown away with the set up, the straight forward and to the point displays. We even had time for most of the games too. Past experiences led me to be skeptical with attractions similar to this one, even though it was not the same city or even the same museum. Often places fill up time with nonsense and stuff that just doesn't need to be in the presentation, show or museum etc. We were there for the info of the world records and all the displays were very well presented with clarity and enough background info to keep you intrigued but not bore you with nonsense. This was a true winner in our books and we will be back again, hopefully sooner than later!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpenberth076
50,WOW!,"that was a really nice and adorable museum. We had so much fun in there. I defin,tely recommend to everyone",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/795tu_eu
20,Already included,I came here with my family of 4 while on vacation and the only reason why was because it was already paid for from when we bought the multiple admission ticket from the wax museum. This place was really not good at all . The only cool thing was the musical steps we tried otherwise very boring and really quick walk through . I wouldn't be able to recommend this place. There are way better selections to see in this area so save your time and money,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lous593
30,Interesting,Interesting place if you I really into these types of facts. You can take as much or as little time as you want to explore each and every little detail of the facts. Great place to see if you have kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrailBlazers04
30,Family Adventure,"Interesting facts and enjoyable for youngsters. I found it interesting that Ripley""s and Guinness really had no gift store or information that you could take about the exhibits that you saw. A little disappointed with that. Some people may not enjoy Ripley's or Guinness because you you have to look and ready and interact to enjoy. Some like instant gratification.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thekingofswapmeets
30,not so interesting,"It may be interesting if you go there at first. But we went there after ""ripple's believe it or not"" museum and it was nod interesting at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/577jannat
50,Interesting,"My family and I visited the museum and found it very interesting, my 24 year daughter and her fiance visited for a second time and invited us and we like it, my 12 year old daughter loved it, we are thinking in visiting it again.Is good idea to wear casual and confortable shoes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cabral4311
40,Fun trip full of nostalgia!,"We purchased a ticket for Ripleys, The Guinness World Records museum and Hollywood Waxworks. The cost was $30 per adult and $20 per child, and we felt it was great value for money!My husband and I visited this place in March 1999, and didn't remember until we spotted the man on the scales! My kids LOVED this place, and of course they are now attempting to figure out what record they want to break!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superdella
50,Chef,Awesome we had a great time the staff was great the the displays were amazing my niece and nephew had a lovely time as well as my wife,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jparks143
20,Kids found it boring,"The kids did not find it interesting or entertaining. The displays are not really interactive and everything seems to be made from shiny plastic.We did this after Ripleys, where kids could interact with the exhibitions. We should perhaps have visited this one first and the expectation of entertainment would be been different.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E128XQalexc
50,Amazing place to chill out,"In this museum you will find a lot of world records exhibitions.It is an amazing place if you are into crazy and uncommon stuff.The museum is not extensive so you can see it in about 1h and you are allowed to take pictures to everything.It is a little bit too expensive, so i advise you to buy the combined ticket which has more attractions (it is a better deal).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joaov184
10,Don't go,"You have there just a bunch of reading parts of explaination about the record, and a photo. At the end of the museum you can try and break some simple silly records that is the only nice thing there. Spend there 20 minutes top and was a waste of time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/579ofekb
50,GREAT AND FUN,Very interesting and lots of fun facts u get to learn!! I went with a couple of friends and we all got to laugh and interact with the exhibits!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/927bennyc
10,Such a waste of time,"We only came here as we got free entry after purchasing a ticket at the Hollywood wax museum. Tacky, boring & a total waste of time. Don't bother!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AWTYblogger
30,Not too much to look at....,"This museum is more full of signs with writing on them than actual exhibits. A lot of the stuff in there is just explained with paragraphs on a sign. Pretty boring compared to other local museums. I wish there were more actual artifacts and such, instead of a bunch of signs to read.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravvenesque
20,A waste of time and $,Been here before for free and it was a waste of time. Im glad that I didn't pay anything to enter this place. What a boring attraction. The wax museum across tbe street is more fun. Exhibits were outdated and not interpretive enough for this places general admission price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/436stug
40,Read if you want to enjoy this place.,This place has lots of interesting and useful information. You'll need to read and watch videos. It's not much on display pieces. We enjoyed the place though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAROTZAMM
40,UNPLANNED ACTIVITY DAY TRIP,"We're from Cali but have never been here. It wasn't too bad, just a lot of the info were based on a whole lot of reading, then the vids weren't loud enough, a few of the interactive activities were broken. Aside from that we did have a blast when it came towards the end of the museum because of the games and staff. I honestly think it was worth it because we bought the VIP package which allowed us to visit 2 other museums for a decent price altogether.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280biancah
50,Lots of interesting info!!!!,"Everyone of all of all ages will enjoy what it has to offer:). There are sooo many fun facts and interesting n engaging things for you to see. From learning about how fast JFK spoke in his speeches to how many COCKROACHES someone ate...Ewwwww! The pricing is fair and there's a package deal if you're interested. Overall, it a good stop and break during all the walking on the Hollywood strip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V6089DGmariak
50,A good way to spend an hour,"We took the VIP experience which was a three in one deal , it's a cheaper way to see the three things that my 9 year old was determined to see, there's not really anything there that isn't in their books , some good interactive stuff for adults and kids , my young bloke loved it and some good photos to take. If you have children that are in to that sort of stuff then do it , but if it was just my wife and I , we would have skipped it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulBelyndaJosh
40,Amazed by Pres. JFK fastest speech in 1 minute (357 words),"best recommended for teachers,students,parents to know about history and culture,with the advance technology now a days,kids knows nothing......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benz2283
20,Out of date and dull,"This museum was out of date and dull, very little about the museum was better than a simple google search. I wouldn't recommend this unless you really like trivia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattwA642GO
30,Been there done that,"Just like reading the book, the thing that made it worthwhile was the 3 attraction pass for much cheaper than a sole entry price, grants admission to world records, ripleys and wax museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaptainPlankRivers
20,Two stars is generous,"This place is seriously in need of an upgrade and in fact, a complete overhaul. It is tired and old and boring. Some of the activities that you could actually try were supremely lame and were done with paper cups and masking tape. My kids could do better exhibitions in primary school projects! Very boring and the facts need updating.We bought this as part of the trio-ticket for Guinness, Hollwood Wax (only vaguely looked like the actual people) and Ripleys. Pesonally I wouldn't waste my money on any of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMTB
20,Like reading the book,"Just a whole heap of signs that are exerts from the hook which explain 3D models, pictures and videos. There a couple of interactive activities that are average. And when we got to the record breaking section no one was there to record all of the records that we smashed... ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iddles
30,OK,We bought the VIP ticket from the wax museum and this was our last stop from the three museums we visited. A lot of the stuff was outdated and it pretty much exhibited the same thing Ripley's odditorium did. I found myself growing bored about halfway through though. I don't think I'll come back here again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriar437
40,"Great activities, not easily accessible for the disabled.","We loved the part of the museum where you are allowed to break a world record. However, this and other areas were difficult for my daughter to access on crutches. We received no assistance, or any invitation to use an elevator.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/graymail
20,Not That Great,"I bought the VIP Pass which is $29.95 for the Hollywood Wax Museum, Ripley's museum and the Guinness Museum. Was in and out of this place in about 30 minutes as there isn't much to see. I'm glad I only paid $10 to get in. Not really worth the time or money. More of a tourist trap than a museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTheRoadAgain1056
50,Awesome!,This place was a lot of fun. There is even a section that you can test your own skills to try and break a world record right in the spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/846samanthaf
20,"Needs to be brought ""up to date""",A large number of displays had not been updated for 10+ years as my partner and I knew that facts had changed. We were VERY disappointed that an organisation like Guinness would not keep its museum upto date!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/day722016
10,World record for the biggest waste of money!,Cost our family of 4 $70 US to see this 'attraction' ( I use this phrase very loosely.Very dated exhibits and no real structure. The one live person in the place was rude and obnoxious.Save your money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YolandaApplebee
30,Out of date but still interesting,"A lot of interesting facts - but many are out of date (highest building, biggest ship, longest bridge) just to name a few.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandyAbr10
30,Okay - for kids,"If you think you must go, and as a tourist why not, then get the VIP pass so you can also visit Ripley's and the Hollywood Wax Museum.Unless you don't have the internet, almost everything here you will already know or easily be able to find out for free if you even care, so it's not really worth the effort to see the cheesy displays. What I disliked the most were 'records' that were already at least a decade old, had already been broken several times since but there were no updates. At any rate, kids will enjoy it I guess and there are some hands-on things, but as a parent I wouldn't be surprised if your kids are just plain bored with the place, and you can blame the internet on that. Also note that if you are in a hurry and the place isn't busy, you can actually walk through in about 20 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ydnar
40,Guinness record,Very good a lot of things you don't know and find out which helps with my teen on giving them good information,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/101482
30,Ok,I visited with my 12 year old son. This place was average. My son loved the hands on area as well as several exhibits.It was ok and a bit overpriced but if ok. I would consider it a filler to a travel itinerary but not a destination.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamLam3
20,Waste of money.,Very small with very few exhibits. Sub-par even by schlocky tourist-trap standards. Do not go unless you have money (and 15 minutes) to burn.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FloridaFamilyofFive
40,VIP Pass is the only way to go,"VIP Pass includes: Ripley's, Wax Museum, and Guiness. Only way to go! $30 for all three. Not worth the money to go just here. Great way to get out of heat and see some interesting facts. Loved the interactive area where you tried to beat certain records. Our family stayed there for about 30 minutes to make sure their name got on the board!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeboo16
30,Part of a 3 pak,Since this was part of a 3 pak of the museum in Hollywood we went other wise wouldn't have went. Did like the interactive world record activities. Super cool info but Lots and lots of info to read.. Sort of over whelming could have been a better way of displaying maybe more video ?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicarC2448MO
20,Not very interesting at all,This place was not very interesting at all. All it had was statistics written on the walls along with replica mannequins of some of the people they were talking about. We walked through the whole thing in about 20 minutes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ISONirvana
40,Great Experience,"Bought a combo ticket for the Hollywood Wax Museum, Ripleys Believe it or not and Guiness World Records museum.Enjoyed Hollywood Wax Museum more compared to other 2.Its really a great experience to see all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArunPotti
20,Pretty boring...,"We bought a combo ticket for the Hollywood Wax Museum, Ripleys Believe It Or Not and the Guinness World Records Museum. Overall the combo ticket is worth the money, but you aren't missing a lot if you just skip this museum. It's basically a whole lot of reading, with a couple of ""interactive"" parts where a machine can quiz you on the records. The only part I really enjoyed was a section near the end where you can attempt to break some world records yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmilySparrow
20,Wouldn't rush back,Found this place to be pretty tired and in need of an update.Not overly good for kids.Wouldn't rush back in a hurry.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kosta100
30,So So,Not really something you want to take kids to. It has a lot of reading and interesting facts but nothing to really distract kids long enough to enjoy it. It was mostly like walking through a World Record book with the writing on the wall. It's nice to go to at least once and the people that work there are really nice but you might be disappointed if you pay full price and don't buy the pass to get into the Wax Museum and Ripley's Believe It or Not as well. With some fund raising and a little bit of work to get some more fun interactive exhibits it would be more fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rach340
40,Pretty Good,It's nice to see all the things in there and take pictures.It's nice to do all three including Ripley's and the wax museum so you save money.These three places are close to each other so you can do them all in one day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sally155017
30,RIPLEY'S BELIEVE IT OR NOT,It was very interesting and fun. There was was some fun Guinness record games to participate in. But a bit overpriced though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karen_sook510
30,Not Bad,"We’ve bought the VIP Tour – 3 Museums (Wax, Rippley’s and Guiness). Nice places to visit with kids or when it rains. It took 3 hours to visit the 3 museums. They are pretty close to each other. Interesting but there is more stuff to do i Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryL549
30,"Good for a quick tour to kill time, but over-priced","A two-story exhibition that carries an interesting assortment of stimuli on all sorts of different records set around the world. Plastic dolls, TV monitors, small little interactive games were what made up most of the tour. Nothing fancy, maybe an interesting place if you have kids.I went with a couple of friends and we had an amusing time laughing at a few weird records - but felt it was over-priced and not worth what we ended up paying for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/930minnam
30,Just OK,"To be honest I liked Ripley's Believe it or not better. This museum is very ""plastic"" and it felt like there were not a lot of real artifacts in it. You get a good deal if you buy the ticket together with the Wax Museum and Ripley's. Otherwise, I probably won't go in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justinehresman
30,INTERESTING,"Not worth a special trip there but some very interesting things can be found here. Some things are down right odd but still worth a look. NOT a true museum as you think of museums. This is a collection of pictures, items, and molds of people with write-ups telling you about the world record it holds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2travelersasof2001
40,Fun for kids,"We took our 9 year old twins to this ""museum"" as part of a 3 part package with Ripley's Believe It Or Not, and Madam Tassaud's and this turned out to be the best of the three. At forst, they were overwhelemed and a little bored by the various displays, but when we got upstairs to where the kids could try to set records for themselves things became really fun. They had a blast! The staff was so friendly. They have one person who is the official expert in a white lab coat and takes their efflrts very seriously. Turned out this was the best of the three My recommendation, skip the other two",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellynvb
30,Ok day out to fill in some time,We did this while exploring the walk of fame. It wasn't amazing but some of the things in there were interesting. If u need to fill in some time out of the hot sun id recommend it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/153ericas
10,A highly-avoidable rip-off,"This may be one of the worst attractions we visited in Hollywood. This is NOT a ""museum"" as it claims to be; it's like someone cut out pages from the Guinness Book of Records, stuck it on posters, hung it on a wall and asked people to pay $30 for the visit. They also have some videos playing which keep showing very outdated records (the grainy VHS quality should be a dead giveaway), which have long been broken (no, Guinness World Records Museum, ""Titanic"" is not the highest-grossing movie of all times). A complete ripoff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripasucks
30,Not very up to date,"Was disappointed going through the museum that the newest records that I could find were from 2011. I understand it would be expensive to be constantly redoing their exhibits to keep up, but one area could at least be dedicated/updated regularly to include more recent records. The best part of the museum for our family was the last room upstairs where it was interactive (timed lego table, timed dominoes table, etc).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyM291
30,ok for about 45 minutes,"My wife was intrigued by this place and after walking around Hollywood Blvd. we decided to inquire about tickets. We found out we can get 3 attractions for 30 dollars a person so we decided to try it. Guinness was ok. It sure didn’t define my wife’s first visit to America but it didn’t take away from it either. We spent perhaps about 45 minutes and I enjoyed the interactive pieces such as the quizzes. My wife just likes to run around and see stuff and I like to read each piece. I would have perhaps taken a little longer but my wife kept calling me to, “Check this out and oh, see this.” If I don’t come immediately she gets annoyed, lol. Thus, this visit was for my so I did what she wanted to do. This was a little more kid friendly than the other attractions that were part of the 3 attraction package. The hands on games would intrigue them the most. Guiness should remove the Barry Bonds figure in the sports section for reasons of stroid use.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
30,Fun for an hour,"We had a fun time out of the heat of the sun for an hour. There is stuff to do, like stack dominoes to see who does it fastest. If you win, you get your name on the board. It was interesting for adults and my 5 yo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgiaMichaelTaylor
30,Nothing Spectacular,"I thought it might be interesting! Nothing fabulous, just ok / tacky information. My husband was actually a tag along and he was bored. Maybe a good place for kids with the game section. Way over priced!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlot
40,Short but sweet,"Lots of reading but nice to go and have a look. After the ""game section"" make sure you go down on the left for the rest of the visit, do not follow the restroom sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tialerte
30,Just average,Guinness was a average didn't spend much time in thereThe kids tried to break some records with dominoes and coins but didn't get very close to breaking the recordGood to fill in time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gooskie
30,And not a drink in sight,"A spur of the moment decision to buy a three for one ticket included rip keys and wax museum...which was good value. Guinness book of records was good time waster...interesting and some quality items..some pretty tacky, but hey ...its Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/769lesleyw
30,Fun trivia,"If you like trivia, this is an interesting place to spend some time. We noticed some of the records are already broken and Lance Armstrong is still listed with the most biking awards....Still not a bad place to wander around in",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oaktree56
30,Just ok,This place has been here for ever theres nothing new here its stuff that was fun and interesting 20 years ago save your money and do one of the other newer funner Museum on the blvd,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luna6373
20,Not worth it,Bought the tickets in a group deal from the Ripley's museum. The exhibits in the at this museum were not at all as interesting and interactive as the ones at Ripley's. There is a lot of reading which little kids are not patient for so if you are traveling with children chances are you will zip right through this museum without really getting to read about each record breaking exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/474brittneyd
20,Tired and obsolete,"Saw with Ripley's and Hollywood Was museums. Weakest of the three. The vast majority is written descriptions, illustrations, pictures and models. Frankly almost all the museum could have been as effectively presented on a web site and therefore the place is kind of obsolete. I really cannot recommend this, you'd get more out of buying a book. Furthermore it looked like the place was out of date. They had a diorama of tall buildings that did not include recent records like Burj Khalifa.The only reason to go is as part of a package to extend the day because it's doesn't take that long to go through the three museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_MTJ_99
50,So many interesting things to see,Amazed by this museum and the interesting information...was cool to see a drummer friend of mine on the wall as the world's fastest drummer... again access for a wheelchair was so easy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/181AndrewH
30,Nothing special,I agree with a lot of the reviews that for the $ as a single visit for sure not worth it. Combine with other places like wax museum and Ripleys believe or not. I have kids so that helped with the value. It is nothing special and not as interesting as I thought it would be. Think they could maybe think of a few more things interactive wise to make this place more attractive. I'm guessing they are just making a killing on this place because they really don't have any over head and you are either going to go in once or not go in but rarely come back,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffsY122LR
30,entertaining,its entertaining to those who r interested in the facts..but its poorly made. It needs to be more organized and the information should have been put more straight forward.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rayoody88
20,Okay,It has a lot of interesting stuff but you got to read too much and at times it felt you were in class. It needs to be more interactive. Good for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferf860
20,Waste of time,"Just was totally disappointed. Nothing of interest to us. Glad this was part of a package deal. If I had paid full price for this attraction, I would have been VERY upset!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsTipp
30,Fun- but expensive.,"This day was fun, although it was really expensive.It was very interactive- so teenagers & kids will absolutely love it, as well as people who really like statistics.If you can buy it as a package with the wax museum, you can get a better deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holidaygal25
20,So-so,Worth it if you get it as part of a group ticket but I would not recommend it as a separate attraction. Some interesting facts and figures but just not enough to keep young ones diverted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525shanec
10,"Waste of time, but it was part of a group ticket so we did it anyway","They have a special where you get a ticket for this, a wax museum across the street and Ripley's Believe it or not. This place takes a few minutes and is not worth the time at all, however it didn't cost us anything extras so it is hard to complain to much. My kids loved the wax museum and Ripleys was fun too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovetotravelfamily4
20,Outdated and creepy,"This was extremely awful. The place is dull and dingy and could use a modern makeover. It has been a while since Lance Armstrong fell from grace, yet he is still considered relevant here. Spend your money elsewhere. Look up the records online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pitufo00
30,out of the book discover the personages,"Everybody knows the year publication of the Guiness and there are already several museums coming with illustrations coming from the book and showing exentric from the smaller to the bigger from around the world.Of the three museums offer in package of Hollywood Blv, this one is surely the most interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanPierreB722
30,Disappointing,"I'd been to the now defunct Guinness World Records Experience in Orlando, so was expecting something similar. It isn't.It does have a good amount of interesting information on various world records but the displays are very dull and boring. You have to be in a ""museum"" frame of mind - which you probably aren't after walking along Hollywood BoulevardAs an individual purchase it was overpriced. It may be ok value if you want to go to Ripleys (I'd rather rip my eyes out) and the Hollywood Wax Museum (I'd already got tickets for Tussauds) but it is really little more than a distraction",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_fatdonut
30,Lots of interesting exhibits,As a family with two teenagers they both found this museum interesting and full of interesting facts and information and interactive displays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rumours1
30,"It is ok, have a quick visit","It is ok to see, you can have a quick visit but don't expect something fancy or Wow. Visit it if you have spare time with nothing else to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/osamayoussef
30,Quick Visit,Interesting stop with several facts part of the trifecta 3 for 1. Our children enjoyed learning about various records. We cruised through it very quickly. I expected that it would have been bigger... With more international records.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elladah
30,Not a world record place,"Records shown were not from all over the world but mostly dealing with America. Such a small place, not a world record storeroom. The owners should revamp the place. Luckily, we did not have to pay so much as we entered with the 3 in 1 ticket , ( the Hollywood Wax Museum and Ripley's Believe It or Not being the other two.). That was the only consolation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GanL
10,Very outdated and overpriced.,We went in here on an impulse and I really wish we'd saved our money. The tour is in desperate need of updating and has very few interactive exhibits which are generally a feature of these places. It cost us $42 for 2 adults and 1 child and took us about 15 minutes to see the entire thing. Not recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmeraldTrio
20,uh BOOORING!,"The only reason we came here was we needed a rainy day activity and purchased a ticket that included the wax museum, ripley's and guinness. There were a couple of things here that kept us amused but it is literally just a few rooms with big displays and lots of reading. We were in and out well under an hour. No need to add it to the to do list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshH1611
30,Average,"We came here during our trip to Hollywood. Though it is definitely in need of some refurbishing, the displays them-self were very interesting to see! We really enjoyed getting to see displays of the records we read about in our books. I do believe that some of the records were a bit outdated now, though.Overall, the attraction is not super special, but worth a look if you're around! Also, if you have the time, it's a much better deal to get the VIP pass, which includes the Guinness Museum, Ripley's Believe it or Not and the Hollywood Wax Museum. You get all three for just a little bit more than the admission price to one of them. Plus, many of the brochures and maps that they give out around there have a coupon for the VIP pass!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caribby96
30,It's best as part of the trifecta including the wax museum and Ripley's,"I think by itself the Guinness World Records Exhibition is not worth the full entry price, however, as part of the ticket that also includes the Hollywood Wax Museum and also Ripley's Believe It or Not, it works out to be a decent value and is a great way to kill some time in Hollywood in the air conditioning if you want to escape the madness of Hollywood Boulevard. The exhibits have been around for years and for older people we certainly remember the most common records, however there are lots of hidden tidbits that even I didn't know. I did find that the venue was fun for my kids - and finding true family entertainment that keeps kids engaged in Hollywood can be a challenge. It's worth a look on the multi-pass. I never thought I would visit this place, especially because I lived in Hollywood for so many years, however, in the end, it was worth the visit, if for any reason, now I can give feedback to other travelers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dalessiopietro
10,Dull and boring,"A dull and boring place to visit. There were many interactive displays but most of them were broken or didn't function. Most of the other displays were simply information sheets stuck on the wall, meaning the venue was basically like reading the actual book - not much fun, and nothing to look at. Big rooms that are pretty empty, and even one that was completely black with a big non-working screen on the back wall - nothing else, not sure what it was supposed to be. Don't waste your time and money visiting this venue, just go next door to Ripleys which is a great deal more entertaining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wattostudios
40,World Records - Hollywood,"You've seen it on television. You've read the books. Now come and see with your own eyes what it takes to be in the Guiness World of Records Museum!This is an interactive adventure that will entertain and delight the entire family. With exhibits that offer the opportunity to test your weight against the world's heaviest person or your height against the tallest man, you will be astounded, astonished, and often in a state of utter disbelief. Portions of this museum feel like a science center turned on its head, while others leave you marveling at the absolute power of human potential.Located right on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the museum is easily accessible by all means of transportation.Visit them online for additional information, or call 323-463-6433.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DestinationDiaries
10,Needs an urgent update!,"This is a complete waste of money. The records on display are all really old (sporting ones especially), and it's just that - a display. Very little interactive features; the only thing you can do is that you can weigh yourself against the biggest man on earth, but even then there's no comparison measure or anything that would make it more fun than a simple public weighing scale. Plus, the feel of the place is quite grubby, as if the owners hadn't invested in it for a very long time. I was expecting something much more worthwhile, entertaining and educating - a big disappointment!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PuffleIreland
30,Guiness World of Records Exhibition exhibits,"These exhibits were ok. I wouldn't go bragging about it though. I doubt that I would make a special trip to go in and while it wasn't overly expensive, it wasn't worth the go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErickS15
10,2 words: Rip off,"Total WASTE of my 18 bucks (and that was for 2 people from a Groupon deal) This place is gross! Old, dirty, outdated, unimaginative, and creepy even. I think my allergies acted up when I was done. I only went here cause I had bought it through Groupon, which I should've known to look it up on TripAdvisor first. If I were a tourist from out of state, I would be so pissed wasting my time and money in here. I didn't come all the way here to look at crap.Geesh, what a waste and a shame. It's very, very embarrassing to out of state tourists to have something atrocious like this on my own hometown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leesheeleeshee
10,The best part is the view of Hollywood Blvd from the front of it...don't bother going in.,"I try to find the little things to enjoy in ANY place I am at, but this one was pretty sad. Basically facts on the wall to read and a few extremely poor done props. Even my 11 year old was not excited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michelle_Haley
10,"Skip The ""Museum"", Buy the book","I wish that I could give the Guinness World Records Museum a negative rating!My boyfriend and I visited in August and bought the museum package (Wax, Guinness, Ripley's), which essentially gets you three for the price of two. I get it now, because there is no way on earth that anyone should pay to go to this museum, they need to throw it in for free.If you want to visit this museum from the privacy of your own home, just go buy a Guinness Book. All they did for the museum, was slap facts from the book and rewrite them on the museum walls. Seriously, that's it. An example would be the weight of the worlds largest cow- fact listed and then a drawing of a cow. Not a picture of the real deal, just a drawing of a cow.We left after fifteen minutes.This ""museum"" is beyond pathetic, don't give them any of your money.Please check out my blog for pictures and an extended trip report of the Hollywood museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenH644
30,"When it's good, it's good...","The good parts of this museum are fabulous, but a lot of it just did not interest me, and were a bit dull. There was a lot of walking around and reading things, more interaction would be good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhiRa
30,Glad I got the dual tickets with the Wax Museum...!,"A friend got us dual tickets, the Guinness Museum and the Wax Museum and I’m glad she did. I wanted to know what Guinness was like, but it was a little too loud and didn’t hold my interest that much. It is really for kids, lots for them to run around and see. It is a fast-pass tourist trap thing that I like to do, but yawn. I say, get the dual tickets and see them both together. Do Guinness first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorBuckles
30,A little boring,"Interesting to see, but it was basically just reading the records on the walls. Not much to do. There was some interactive things, but the kids were somewhat bored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuartt144
20,Boring!,Walked through with kids ages 8 and 11. We saw a number of interesting facts but it was really just reading signs on the wall alongside pictures or clay-type statutes. Husband and I were not too impressed and kids were downright bored. Not worth the 50 it cost us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisaasselin
40,Celebrate Fantastic Achievements,"Anyone who truly appreciates such marvelous (but often inconsequential) achievements of mankind would find this place devoted to such accomplishments interesting.Many of the records listed are not current, but the true spirit of achievement is hardly lost in all of this. It's nicely organized, and if you're even slightly nerdy you'll love all the factoids. It's also fairly interactive with videos and quizzes. As far as people go, it's got a few displays that are drawn to scale, which is interesting.Overall, we thought it was quite fun to spend a couple hours here. The biggest drawback besides the currency of information presented is that it looks dated and could use a facelift. But that's easy to fix.Fun and family-friendly, and not at all bad for what it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inavigator
30,A bit outdated but interesting,"As some other reviewers have commented that they are a bit outdated in their information, it seems the latest they have updated their stats was in 2000. I did enjoy reading the records and looking at their displays though. My 11 year old son flew through it as he didn't have the attention span to stop and read everything. I bought a 3 museum value package (Ripleys, Wax Museum and this) otherwise I probably wouldn't have spent the money to check it out on its own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueDahl
10,Not worth it,There is a mess of Guinness records with huge noise of voices representing museum!I didn't like it.I got headache with that part of my trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Awesome_Coral
50,Worth a look!,"Better than the Gold Coast exhibition. Very interesting. The last bit where they had the special lighting, kids were both dancing and having some fun watching the shapes it made. Cool",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kazzmich
10,REALLY outdated,"This place needs an overhaul. Didn't have the heart to tell the guys working there on the way out that to us, it sucked. At least at Ripleys the exhibits are generally in good condition. Guinness is very tired and in need of an update. Like my review for Ripleys, it would be a good educational attraction for parents to take their kids but it just wasn't for us (but at least Ripleys was in good condition)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carmania
10,Most cynical waste of money ever,Spent about 5 minutes walking through a terrible exhibit that clearly has not been updated since the 1980's. Awful compared to ANY exhibit i've been to. Total waste of 18 dollars. A complete and utter p**s take and insult to the name of Guinness.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveF1
10,"Buy the book and save yourself some cash ... boring, outdated and unimaginative","My wife and I visited this place during a layover instead of going to the tarpits (whoops!). Bottom Line: It was scandalous to call this a museum. The museum is more of a poorman's art gallery in my opinion. A plaque below a picture cut out or a dummy proclaiming what the record was is the model. The interactive stuff didn't work while we were there - ie. the Hollywood Squares piece. Additionally, the museum is outdated. For instance I went to the sports section and it still had Hank Aaron as the home run king - something that has been shattered for a few years. I know I saw more, but wish I wrote it down. As this was a dual ticket for a wax museum, its counterpart definitely bailed it out. If this attraction were free, I wouldn't waste my gas money or my time to go even with the kids. Add an hour to your life somewhere else - you'll only lose it here. Boring!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Army_Dude
30,If you're into this kind of things,"We went with our two kids (8 & 11). They really like this stuff. But frankly it's pretty outdated and the flashy outside is not reflected on the inside. For people from Europe that are not used to inch, feet and lbs many of the records go lost in translation. Some show inches but surely not all. Appatently some visiters thought it funny to steel parts of exhibited records. These have not been replaced. Sonif you are not into these kind of things you can easily pass this 'museum'. But to be fair my kids loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marten162
10,Very poor,"Don't bother going there, it's a rip-off. Guinness' brand is being damaged by this old, worn out and pathetic 15 minute walk-through thing. Instead go to Ripley's over the road, and either of the wax museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Otaview
30,moderately interesting but expansive,"my wife, 14 year old son and I visited the three museums offered in one package, Ripley s, Wax Museum and this one. Perhaps this is the less run down and more interesting of the three although not worth the money spent in the package. It has interesting facts and figures, but same as the other two, has a fair maintenance. It is the only one which may be more interesting and it has more in it, but do not feel sad if you skip it if having other alternatives.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rbalassa
20,lots of reading and very dated!,"this place was kind of a joke. It appeared to be very dated. I didn't like the fact that I had to do a lot of reading, but some of it was interesting. Don't waste your time on this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwg415
10,The 80's called: They want their museum back,"This was on our list of attractions that came with the LA ""Go Card"" so we decided to check it out. This museum has barely been updated since 1984. Almost all of the ""records"" reviewed were pre 80's and if there were updates it was common to see black tape over some things or things glued on top of the original signage. Basically just a bunch of reading and looking at a few pictures. Did the whole thing in about 15 minutes and we were seriously disappointed. Not that we had the highest expectations, but I can't imagine paying full price to see this...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmaTahoe
