50,Stunning and Beautiful Beach,"Hands-down favorite beach to visit for beautiful sand and rock formations! Small but affordable parking area (may have to wait for a space) atop an overlook to El Matador Beach. Following a climb down a series of steep stairs, the beach had many beautiful rocks to climb through and around. There were two or three photo shoots happening in the hour or so amount of time we visited. It was very unique and rather different than the massive beaches (beautiful also) to the south near Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllthingsD
10,Used to be my favorite beach in Cali,It used to be fairly quiet even on weekends and now it's turned into a selfie taking backdrop. You can't walk more than 10 feet without having some idiot bump into you because they're staring at themselves on their phone. You might even have to wait to go any further as full photo production crews take up giant portions of the beach. It's sad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yannbe68
50,theatrically dramatic and beautiful view of the california coast,pros.....takes your breath away spectacular majestic views of the coast and ocean...sunset was incredibly beautifulcons...parking lot and beach were very crowded...but worth it overall...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericbN8422UM
50,Beautiful,"Beautiful beach along the cliffs. This beach offers a semi-private beach experience along with fantastic photography opportunities. Be sure and pay for your parking, they will ticket you if you don‚Äôt. There is no legal parking on the highway, but couple of spots you can park if you are looking to walk down before the sun comes up and the park opens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CohibaRalph
50,Unique!,"Finally made it to El Matador on this visit. Definitely worth the trip. Very beautiful place. We loved it, even with the late morning fog. Definitely would go back. Lovely beach and area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevef824
50,The most beautiful beach in LA,"We went to this beach in the late afternoon to watch the sunset. There were many people getting their photos taken by professional photographers on the beach (people in wedding suits, beauty queens in peasant dresses, pregnant women, instagramers) but it was not busy to the degree of discomfort. It was in a way fun to people watch but I suspect it will be difficult to swim or relax at the beach due to the crowd. The rock formations looked impressive, the waves crashing on the beach beautiful and the water clear. Best of all, the sunset from this beach was stunning!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanzx
40,Lovely beach,"Well, from what I could see. There is a steep incline down to the actual beach from where you'll park your car. I did not go all the way down. But what I could see was lovely. If you have children - be very careful!!! But the rock formations are awesome!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geeluv05
40,Small and beautiful,"Really beautiful, thin strip of beach. There are a few entrances to the beach, looks like they all include wooden stairs. Parking lots (paid parking) are small but the beach wasn't extremely crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/742chloem
40,Beautiful Rock on the Beach,"After reading all reviews on how crowded it become, we decided to go early on Sunday morning, yet the parking lot is full hence it's a small lot. You have to went down on stairs to reach the beach from the parking lot. I won't suggest this place for people with knee problem or at old age who can't climb. I saw many people struggling with their coolers, tents, etc. It's not a good idea to bring heavy stuffs. No Pets! So please make sure don't bring your fluffy friend. Watch for No parking sign on the streets, we saw many cars were ticketed on our way back to our car. We parked on the street that is designated for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livelifenotjustexist
20,I agree with the comment about the tar,I've been here multiple times in the past and never had an issue until recently. The pockets of tar in the beach are terrible. I didn't even notice until I got back to my car. It was all over my sandals and my friends feet! Watch your step!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richs994
20,Tar at all LA beaches,"I‚Äôm born in Hollywood and have been to every beach in Southern California. Lately every beach I‚Äôve been to... from Long Beach to Oxnard, I‚Äôm left with tar stains on my feet! It‚Äôs for sure tar as you can smell it! Takes forever to wash it off as you have to use an oil and scrubber to get it off. It‚Äôs very sticky and thick. Disgusting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TalfromLA
20,Totally overrated,We have lived in Malibu for over 40 years and know every inch of beach. This tiny beach has been ruined and is not worth the parking headaches and accessibility problems. Stick with beautiful Zuma/Westward beaches...so much nicer and more accessible. Can‚Äôt believe how many out of town folks are duped into thinking this is an undiscovered gem. It is very disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimboMalibu_CA
50,Raw Beach,Great natural beach. We were there early and it wasnt crowded at all although we grabbed the last parking spot so get there early and be ready for a hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Localinfuse
40,Nice beach,To be honest..I thought it was going to be more spectacular. If is true is cute...its very touristic and kind of not clean and parking is almost impossible so..it you are passing by I would stop..otherwise don't bother. But I guess sunsets could be cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaPrince70
50,Beautiful spot for photos!,"This beach spot is heavily populated with photographers and people wanting portraits, engagement photos etc at sunrise/sundown. It is a beautiful, photenic spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pennie727
50,Beautiful beach,We drove up the PCH and stopped here for a bit to explore. There is paid parking but there are about 30-40 spots which fill up real quick. You can park on the highway for free and walk over. This is not a good spot for folks with mobility issues. There are lots of stairs and the stairs are covered with sand.Beautiful beach though with some stunning rock formations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventuresahead
50,Beautiful Sunset,We were driving through Malibu and wanted to catch the sunset. Someone told us El Matador was the beach. We arrived just before sunset and took the steep stairs down to the beach. It was beautiful! The rock formations did not disappoint. There were several professional photographers there doing sunset photo shoots.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferdP938AH
50,Gorgeous Beach,"We traveled to this beach on a weekday, late morning and it was low tide. There were some people, but not crowded at all. Although we were unable to, this is a great place to bring a blanket and just relax with a picnic basket. The scenery is gorgeous!! (For those with mobility issues, there are steep steps that can be slippery to access the beach from our location.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dustyfeet4
50,Get to know more of California,Great place to be with your family and friendsAfter that you can go nearby to walk at the mountains,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cesar4X4
50,Breathtaking!,"This is a definite stop on the Pacific Coast Highway. It‚Äôs a beautiful beach with large outcrops of boulders. It is a long way down from the small parking area to the actual beach, with several flights of stairs, and long sandy/rocky inclines. Anyone who has difficulties walking or climbing stairs may not be able to climb down, but the view at the top is just as amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yazdragonfly
50,"El Matador üèñ beach , Natural Beauty!","First of all driving on Pacific coast Highway had been my dream for years, although missed my family. The most scenic setting when you are driving along the sea. It could have been more fun looking around then concentrate on driving. Immense natural beauty on the El Matador beach. Although parking was limited and paid. Wonderful life time experience and long lasting memories of the drive to Malibu!‚≠êÔ∏è",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RSARAN9
50,Great place to see and explore,"When in Malibu, this is a worthwhile visit to explore the shoreline and take in the scenic views. Expect more visitors on weekends than weekdays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveTheWildWest
50,Rock formations on the Malibu coast,Beach is a state park so you pay for parking - roughly $6 USD - at the parking meter. Two portable toilets. Steep climb down. Two staircases along the way to help one get to the beach. Rock formations have eroded greatly since my last visit in 2016.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginomichael
40,Late Sunday (Easter) afternon 7:00 PM (1 hr before closing),"The beach was very pretty. Today was chilly and little windy so there was a bit nippy. However with sun setting, it was a very pretty. There was very little crowd, because it was windy. This is a wonderful taste of Malibu.Please take your trash with you. There are portapotty in the parking lot... dirty. So do your business before you get to the park. The lot is small (holds 40 cars max). So best along the East side the PCH.... Watch the traffic before crossing.Again, take your trash with you!!!! keep our local park clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenC51
50,Overwhelming Otherworldly Exploration,Overwhelming otherworldly exploration. A spot can will transport you geographically and temporally. A short drive up the PCH will take you light years away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexafzali
50,Gorgeous,"Beautiful beach to stay for an hour or the day. Parking is limited but available on road if not in the lot. No services available except port-o-potties. Two long sets of stairs and uneven paths of dirt down to the beach so not accessible if you have mobility issues. But absolutely gorgeous stretch of sand, beautiful rock formations, and the water was pristine. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ACW948
50,Lovely beach üèù,"This beach is really amazing, it is not too crowded and the view from the top is beautiful. You can take wonderful photos here, and of course take your time to relax with the sound of the waves üåä. I miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/918vidalinam
50,Beautiful beach,"Beautiful beach. Went at sunset! It was quite crowded which is fine with me. There were lots of photo shoots going on- maternity, couples, models. Makes a great backdrop for photoshoots!Make sure to wear sneakers or good shoes when you go- there are lots of steps!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anitaphilly
40,Worth the trip.,"It is really pretty, but very popular. If you are looking for a secluded area or a place to take pictures, it is not the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dandelna
50,Our perfect spot in Malibu,We visited by recommendation of hotel concierge and were not disappointed! Beautiful beach area with plenty of rock formations for exploring. We actually went to Zuma after and wanted to go back to El Matador because it protected you from the wind and you can find some shade when needed! Totally worth the small trek up and down the cliff side.... the stairs are in good condition. Thanks El Madator for a great day!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisnTink
50,Omg! So gorgeous,This place is fascinating. Plenty to explore. The hill going down is quite steep. Make sure to have good shoes on. There are many awesome picture spots. There are caves and beautiful rocks along the beach shore. Absolutely recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/codyk214
50,El Matador State Beach a must see,"There are a lot of beaches in California, but this one must not be overlooked. Just off the Pacific Coast Highway is the entrance. I would recommend going during the week as parking is limited to 20 spots. There‚Äôs a pay station to pay for parking. The first hour is 3.00 and 10.00 for all day. There‚Äôs 5 port-o-potties at the entrance to the beach. There is a bit of a decline trail followed by two sets of stairs that lead down to the beach. There are lots of photo opportunities here as the view is simply amazing. I highly recommend a visit to this beautiful beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFLapham
50,Beautiful! Interesting rock formations!,El Matador State Beach is a prize to professional and amateur photographers alike. Very pretty beach with interesting rocks. You can catch a nice sunset there in certain times of the year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/904lindae
50,Rocks in the ocean,"El Matador has some of the coolest rocks and caves right up to the ocean. The kids were exploring and crawling in and out of crevices as the tide went out. There were lots of anemones in the rocks and mussels galore. Just when you think you‚Äôve reached the end of the beach, you can shimmy around another rock and find a whole beach waiting to be explored! Sadly, you can see where the fires came right to the cliff edge here.Parking is limited, and you pay by machine either by the hour ($3) or for the whole day ($10)(enter your license plate). Yes, they do come around to check!There is a moderately steep walk down that comes to a bunch of stairs to the beach. (Maybe 3-5 minute walk down) Know your abilities...if you get down, you need to be able to get back up!Be aware, this place is photo shoot central, so there will be professional photographers snapping pictures of clothing models, wedding parties, or whatever all over this gorgeous backdrop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenRed2014
50,Gorgeous sunset photos,Wear sturdy sandals! Clean and peaceful! A little crowded but not bad at all. I parked on the street. Google maps sent me to the right location as there are other sets of stairs that are closed. Check tide levels before coming as there may not be a beach!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshmC5623UU
50,"Beautiful, enjoy a sunset here","Beautiful but not accessible for people who cannot do stairs, there is quite the staircase up and down but well worth it if you can",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ciannh
50,Felt like another country!,"We are from the South, Alabama to be exact, where you either choose to vacation in the mountains or the beach and here those two worlds come together perfectly. The short hike to get to the waters edge was so worth it! The water was so blue and the scenery did not disappoint!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/71amandat
50,beautiful rock formations.,El Matador State Beach is worth the stop if you find yourself in Malibu. Be prepared to pay for parking and climb down a lot of stairs. The rock formations are beautiful. Theres lots of little caves and rocks to climb under around. It was very eerie and foggy when I visited. Be careful of the tides because you can get stuck down there during high tide.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessiAnn85
50,Enjoy El Matador Beach!,If you find yourself in Malibu I recommend seeing this beach. The rocks add a beautiful look to the beach. Do be careful as it can be a little tricky navigating the steep descent to he bottom. Especially if your a little older. Saw a couple photo shoots going on. Not too many people on the beach. Just a cool place to spend an hour or two...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChalieB_99
50,Spectacular views and peaceful place to relax and take Instagram photo-worthy moments.,Spectacular views there and it is a peaceful beach to relax and take Instagram photo-worthy moments at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/250ka1
50,Awesome Rock Formations,The beaches on the east and gulf coast don't have the awesome rock formations. This is a great beach for photos and looking for sea life.There is a pay machine for parking. It was $8 when we were there.Walking rugged terrain and lots of stairs are required to access the beach. We wore sneakers to better navigate our way up and down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RyanAndTiffany
50,The most beautiful cove,"This beach / cove kept popping up in social media as the number 1 place to see and now I see why. The sand, rocks, waves, Cliffside and setting make it one of the most stunning places I have ever seen.Nike were even doing a photo shoot here at the time we visited.Parking is around $3 an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/343jasonc
50,Great surprise,It is a gem off the hidden path. its a hike down but it offers you great views. They have a picnic table that you can eat there with the most spectacular views. highly recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VPonthemove
50,The beautiful beach,You have to walk down a cliff to get to the beach but there is a cut path and it is easy walking. It is not as crowded as the easy access beaches and it is so beautiful. My husband actually proposed to me on the cliff because the view is so magnificent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Winkylee12
40,"Nice beach, with elbow room!","Was at this beach last week and it was near perfect - no major crowding, unusually diverse group, nice variety in the topography of the beach/coast line (not just a stretch of sand). The short ""hike"" up and down the stairs was a nice little work out for us non-fit folks. Waves were breathtaking, but made swimming - even immersing - difficult! Unless you were out there riding the waves. I'm told the beach just north of this one is even better (less crowded, more sand?) . But this one was great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B1384CCannes
10,Used to be Beautiful.. not any longer,"This place used to be an escape. A beautiful beach, free from the crowds of Zuma, Paradise Cove, and Surfrider, where you can explore striking caves and rock formations. Not any longer.I have visited the beach twice this summer, and I do not plan to ever come back. Here are the reasons why.---- Parking is an absolute nightmare. Not only is the lot always filled, but PCH is jammed for over half a mile in each direction. Furthermore, the Malibu parking enforcement mafia is driving around ever 5 mins, ticketing any car that dares to stick out one inch past the ""No Parking"" signs, or is 14 feet from a fire hydrant instead of 15 feet (the legal limit, obviously not mentioned on any signs). So trust me, it isn't free parking.---- The beach is crowded beyond belief. It is very difficult to get a place to sit, and if you do, you will have people all around you. I went on both a cloudy day and a sunny day, and both were jam packed.---- Cops roll through on a regular basis, and will hand out open-container tickets to anybody who dares to bring a beer to sip on the beach. We saw over 10 people get cited in one round, none of whom were disruptive in any way. Amazing, they actually come down on foot and just hand out tickets. ‚ÄúTo Protect and to Serve‚Äù, LOL!Overall, the City of Malibu has managed to ruin what was once a beautiful beach with their authoritarian tactics. I urge everybody to avoid this place, and if you choose to visit, be very careful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dfotinich
50,Very Pretty Beach,"Easy to find and a bit difficult to get to. A very steep slope with many stairs. We didn't go to enjoy the beach, but only to view. And the views were incredible. If you go for the day, bring refreshments, but not a big cooler. It is tough to get up and down the cliff. Plenty of free parking and a small lot you can pay to be in. Bring a camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/265kylev
50,Heaven....,"Travelling from the East Coast we were excited to check out the California beaches. But, my God, the traffic and all the people! We just kept driving past Venice and Santa Monica before finding this GEM. Relatively uncrowded compared to sardine-like situation on the other beaches as we drove up the coast. It was a little tricky to find parking on the street as the parking lot was full on a Saturday afternoon. Beware there are a few flights of sand covered stairs to get you down to the water--not suitable for those with mobility issues.For those that make it down, you will be rewarded with a chill vibe and the ability to take that nice walk on a relatively unspoiled beach with that special someone. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sazoram
40,Unique and impressive show of mother nature,"El Matador presents a unique formation of rocks and semi caves nestled by the ocean providing a very unique and impressive beach. You can simply enjoy the variety of rock formations while getting wet on the shore. Lots of visitors enjoy laying in the sun as well as getting photographed among the rocks and the water. I saw many visitors who come to pose for modeling pictures.The dirt parking area is limited and you can pay by the hour or by the day. Going down from the parking area to the beach is demanding as you take several levels of stairs, maybe as much as climbing up and down a 5 story building. The views are fantastic and it is worth the effort.There are few picnic tables and mobile toilets next to the parking area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/614abdelghanie
40,Nice beach for photos,Enjoyed this beach for photos. Small parking lot but people moving in and out regularly so didn't have to wait long for a spot. Don't let the walk down discourage. It is worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLS006
50,Breathtaking,"This beach is absolutely beautiful. There is very limited parking and you pay by the hour which is very affordable if your not spending the entire day. The view from the top is breathtaking. There are picnic tables where you can sit if you decide not to go all the way down to the beach. The dirt path going down to the staircase does not have a rail to hold on to. This caused a bit of anxiety for my husband who I are afraid of heights. The staircase down has 2 handrails and feels very safe. Once we reached the beach it was amazing. Not very crowded, clean and perfect for pictures. Totally worth the climb down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/700DianaC
40,Peaceful and serene,"Matador State Park/Beach is about as peaceful as they come. One reviewer complained about seaweed on the beach. Well duh....it's on the Pacific Ocean. Easily strollable, the serenity is overwhelming, in spite of the sea weed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelP179
40,what a view!,"If you want a place for beautiful photographs, this is it. It is a small beach, lots of rocks in the water, but a nice sandy area on shore. Stays busy - even at sunset. Not readily accessible for small children or people with mobility issues- there are many steep steps to make it down below from the small parking area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggiegust
50,Loved it,"Beautiful nature , great for photography , not overly crowded and the rock structures make it so unique. Loved our visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/593kristinag
40,Beautiful,"So, this beach is stunning! But it was so crowded and there was so much seaweed (literally huge clumps taking beach space) that we couldn‚Äôt stay. We took some nice photos and then moved to another beach for the kids to play and us to sit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinasJ1795QG
50,Stunning Malibu beach,"El Matador is one of the most peculiar Malibu beaches with its rocks and cliffs that contribute to its rough and wild vibe. The surrounding nature and the ocean are both amazing, so it must not surprise that this place is usually packed (at least on weekends). It can also be difficult to find a slot in the pay and display parking lot, which is pretty small. The other option is to park the car along the PCH.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Francyfre
50,Lovely Beach,This was on my ‚ÄúTo do‚Äù list while we visited California for my birthday(May-4) and I‚Äôm glad we did. Despite the cardio work it took for us to get to the beach it was well worth it. I even did a photo shoot lol.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ms_Smith2011
40,Beautiful but so crowded,"This beach was really hyped up a lot to me, and even though I really enjoyed the short hike down and the beautiful rocks/caves by the ocean, it was extremely crowded. I don't think I got a single good picture here because there were people crammed in every cave and place possible. Parking was also rough, and I witnessed a very loud verbal parking dispute in the parking lot. I read that Instagram and social media in general has taken away the solitude this place once had, and I think that could definitely be true.That being said, maybe going on a day that's not so hot and no one else has the same idea would be a better time! It was scenic and beautiful, I only wish it wasn't so crowded. I only stayed for maybe 10-15 mins max here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sar219
50,Breathtaking,Simply spectacular views... breathtaking In fact. However parking on the Pacific Coast Highway - if the lot is full... feels like you are playing Frogger. It can be a bit of a treck so keep in mind if you have young kids or elderly folks. The hike up would be demanding for those who have physical struggles or are in bad shape...but if you can handle it please visit - you will see a lot of photographers and wedding couples.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151yvess
50,Beautiful Beach!,This was a beautiful beach to visit. We did only go for a short time. Would not want to make this a location to beach for the day but great to explore! It is fairly small and on a Saturday was pretty hectic. Many of the rocks etc that we wanted to explore were being utilized by photographers and people getting photographs making it difficult to truly explore. It is a bit of a hike from the parking area but very doable. We had kids with us and they were fine making the trek.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pixhappymom
50,Great stop for pictures!!,Omg! I love Malibu as it is. I googled nice picturesque beaches and El.Matador came up. What a beauty!! I took great pics. A nice secluded beach. I went there right b4 noon July 5th. It's more of a stop and go beach to take in the views and great photo opps. Little hidden treasure that my LA friend never knew about it lol!! He loved it. Try to go b4 noon. As we left more ppl started coming in. A must when in Malibu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisselissette
40,Small beach,"We were taken here by a friend. Really a beautiful area. Maybe a little over rated though.Parking is horrendous, the beach lot is very small. Parking on PCH is dangerous. Traffic whizzes by pedestrians at close distances and half the people are on their phones. I suggest driving into the small lot and dropping everyone off then parking.If you have small children or older people in your party I would skip this beach all together. There are steep walk down and a lot of steps to contend with. Not a lot of beach area either and there are a lot of rock formations some submerged and some are not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMc33
50,Beautiful Beach and Rocks,"This is a beautiful quiet and small beach with picturesque rock formations. It's $3 for one hour parking, and $10 for the day (make sure to get your license plate # before you go to the meter). Some people recommended to park on the street to avoid paying fees. The walk from the parking lot was short on a sandy downhill path and then some stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c9017
40,Beautiful location,Loved our stop here! The beach was lovely. Lifeguards were picking up garbage on the beach to keep it clean. Very picturesque. The water was warm. We didn‚Äôt spend much time here but it was a nice stop. The only downside was the top: The parking lot bathrooms were dirty and needed to be emptied and The garbages were over flowing. It would be nice to see the money from the parking lot being used to empty the garbages and the outhouses faster before they become a problem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shonac602

50,It's Worth the Steps!,"You'll find beautiful seascapes at El Matador, but beware...parking is limited in the metered lot and there are steps to the beach-LOTS of steps!Beach is small (most people go there just to take pics) and can get crowded with everything from film crews to families. Definitely worth a stop to see some of the most beautiful seascapes California has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H7799RJlisas

50,Favourite beach visited,This was my fav. beach that I have visited so far close to LA. When we came there weren't too many people around and it was a very pretty nature beach with nice sand and rocks/rock formations and cliffs. I guess this would be a great location for a photo shooting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mathieuchevallier

Great rock formations, tide pools, wild life, beach, parking, etc. we didn‚Äôt bring a lot of stuff with us but if we were for the day, it would have been difficult to carry everything down.

This place is amazing!,"El Matador State Beach has become a very popular destination for everyone from photographers to adventurers looking for more than the standard, lazy day, sandy beach experience.What was once perhaps the best kept secret in Malibu, is now a crowded little strip of a beach - even on a mid week winters afternoon. Still, if you're a local who has yet to visit our a visitor front out of town, you must see what all the fuss is about at El Matador Beach.Amazing rock formations? Check.Beautiful seaside cliff views? Check.Wonderfully adventurous seacaves? Oh Yes!As a hobbyist photographer I'm a little disappointed the secret is out but, everyone needs too see this place. Do yourself a favor. If you ever find yourself anywhere near Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, make absolutely certain to stop and see El Matador State Beach. You will not regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quantumottle
50,This is your destination drive on a nice day while in LA,very cool rock formations down below on beach after long cliff walk descent makes it a great destination to drive to . Small parking lot so that can be a hassle . you will take a bazillion pictures here inside the small caves . do not try the walk to beach if you have elderly people or disabled as its steep and twisting ( but quite safe ) .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryecapital
50,California Adventures,"Perfect place beautiful scenery. Absolute peace. Great for taking pictures or listening to the water. Other then the stairs super easy to get there. The water was cold, but then again it was late November. An awesome experience parking was great and super cheap. The porta potties were clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brisa1103
50,El Matador State Beach Rocks!,"Our hotel concierge recommend we visit this beach on our Malibu Beach swing on the Pacific and boy were were glad we did! As beaches go, this one offered an alternate view from the traditional Sandy beach - this one offered cliffs, boulders and rough terrain and a narrow shore line of clean sand and waves.Parking is a minimum $3 for an hour which was more than enough time for a quick visit to venture down the 2 sets of metal rail and wooden steps, take pictures and return to your car. The stairs were very sturdy but sand builds up on the steps so it would be a good idea to wear runners or shoes that grip and hold on to the rails while descending and ascending the cliff. The parking lot can hold about 100-120 cars depending on how efficiently everyone parks. There are port-a-pottys off to the side of the parking lot so use it before you go down to the shore. The parking ticket machine will ask for your license plate so know it before you start paying for your ticket.If you like to take pictures of a shore that's not boring and flat - don't miss this beach. You'll be pleasantly surprised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/951olivias
30,Kind of Dirty,Good view and interesting rock formations along the beach. The biggest detractor for me was that it was kind of dirty and more garbage than I would have like to see. It got my blood pumping going up the stairs to get back to the car and was good exercise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzikay1
50,Best beach in california!!!,Extraodinary beach! Beautiful view!Be careful with the rocks. Not so good for swimming. It is the most beautiful beach in the coast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThaisTuyane

50,Must see!,Truly a beautiful beach to spend a few hours exploring. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for anyone who has difficulty walking or going up and down steps as you have to walk down very steep steps to get down to the beach. But otherwise this beach is definitely a must!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessavena
50,Absolutely Beautiful!,"This place is soooo beautiful! We spent an hour to two hours walking this beautiful beach. It is $3 an hour to park here. We did not know this. GREAT place for families, couples, and you can picnic here as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224krisd
50,Serenity,"I had several hours to burn before taking a flight back home so I wanted to head out to a nice, off the beaten track beach with the typical rock formation the California Coast is know for. I was not disappointed. On a weekend this small beach was not crowded and was just wonderfully serene and great for photography.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcoSieber
50,Nice tiny beach in Malibu,We went there for a Malibu day visit and found this beautiful spot to hang out. We didn't stay long but there were people doing picnic and preparing themselves for a long stay.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jantonio
50,Great state beach to catch a film crew making a movie! Awesome sunset!,We go to many state beaches in Malibu and this is one of our favorite. Every time we go here for amazing sunsets you never know what you may see. Everything from sea life to celebrities taking photo shoots to film crews shooting their next big screen picture. The views over the ocean are one of a kind no matter where you see the sunsets. We enjoy taking a picnic and hearing the waves crash over the rocks and beach! Cool place for any event or just a great day at the beach!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yehbut
50,So Pretty,I was there in September driving from LA to Santa Barbara and read online this was a great beach to see. This was so picturesque and worth the trip to see. There is a bit of a walk down the hill but worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaniceCaribbeanQueen
40,"Great views, plan for walking","My wife and I traveled to the Malibu area in Summer 2017 in search of beautiful beach areas. El Matador was one of the popular ones I found online. On the weekend, parking was tough here. We ended up parking in a nearby neighborhood with about a 15 minute walk. The neighborhood was cool to look at houses and flowers though. We ventured down the staircase to the beach to find cool features and plenty of photo spots. This was the most crowded beach we visited on the trip, so getting that perfect picture or time alone we take some patience. Overall, it wasn‚Äôt our favorite beach spot on the trip. Be sure to check out Leo Carillo State Park or Point Dume first!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28mitchm
50,"Nice views, great beach bring your camera and remember you have to walk up",Nice state park with a small parking area decent trail and steps down. Remember you have to climb up. The inquest rock formations and fantastic views of sunset. It is worth the drive north of Malibu to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Biztravr
50,Great place to enjoy the beach and watch the sunset,"You can pay to park here, or find free parking along Highway 1 on both sides of the highway. If you choose to do the latter, make sure you park where it is legal - it is very clearly marked - and watch out for cars when walking to El Matador. Stairs and dirt path will bring you down to the beach. You can catch the sunset at the top at the edge of the cliffs, a very short distance from the parking lot, if you like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theimmc
40,Amazing Views and Cliffs in Ocean,Definitely worth the visit! Pay a little to park and enjoy the steep descent to the waters edge where land meets water in random outcroppings scattered along the shores edge. Great for families and romantic for couples. Don‚Äôt advise for elderly due to steep descent but they can enjoy magnificent views from parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charlesmdawe
50,Prettiest beach in LA,"It‚Äôs a small beach in Malibu. Right before Leo Carrillo beach. Very small parking lot for which you have to pay for the whole day. But if it is full, people park on the street on pch. If the tide is high, there is no sand for beaching. But if you get there when tide is low, you get to enjoy an amazing beach with beautiful rock formations. A lot of photo shoots take place there...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poli-ca5
50,El Matador is lovely place,"Beautiful beach..Just a perfect place to watch a magical Californian sunset and to feel the ocean breeze. Also, especially for girls, great place to make a photoshoot , the beach is surrounded by the big rocks and cliffs, so take your favorite beach dress and enjoy!Come to El Matador with the closest ones to feel the atmosphere in full ‚ô•Ô∏èMy recommendation : DO NOT GO TO THE BEACH on weekends and holidays ! There is too much people also you can stuck in traffic on the way to it.The place is around 40 miles far from LA. It will take around 50 minutes by car. Also you can take a bus from Santa Monica , I think it will ride you right to the beach.El Matador is highly recommended place to visit :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_A450HC
40,Gorgeous,Coming from the east coast el matador was absolutely breathtaking. It was a warm foggy day and descending down the rockiest stairs and hill to the beach was quite the (short) adventure. The beach was overcrowded but the view was like something out of the goonies. You 80‚Äôs kids will understand. We didn‚Äôt stay long and it wasn‚Äôt a very swimmy beach but I‚Äôm giving 5 stars for the gorgeous views and fog shrouded dreamlike atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brweber
50,AMAZING SCENERY,This is my favorite beach because of how secluded and picturesque it is. You have to hike down quite a bit to get to it and I love that part. Also leaving the beach is pretty much uphill so if you have mobility issues this may not be the beach for you. The views are definitely worth the drive!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glamris
50,Great photo ops,"It is quite a climb to get to and from this beach. But once you are there it's really nice.Halfway down the stairs you can see dolfins if you're lucky as we were.The rock formations are like the ones you can find in the south of Portugal and Italy and are very popular with ""destroy the dress"" photoshoots. We saw at least 4 couples in the surf.The surf itself is quite wild so be careful getting into the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamesrvp
40,Beautiful place!,I've been out to Malibu four times and this was my first visit to El Matador Beach. It was beautiful! Great scenery and the rock formations were fabulous! Go for a walk! Great place for pictures! Good hiking up and down the hill. Very steep so take shoes! Rocky path but good workout!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLWGirl

40,Worth a trip,"I visited in early this beach in November. Beautiful views, not a lot of people perfect chill spot. Seriously worth a trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/demitraokc
50,"Picturesque rocks, sea life, oceans","We stopped here on whim while driving down the PCH. Boy was that a good decision. Parking in the lot is hit or miss but be patient and it can happen. Walking along the beach has plenty of opportunities to explore cool rocks, take photos, look in tide pools for sea life, and talk to happy locals. It was a cooler cloudy day and it was perfect weather to get your feet wet. My friend says she is remembering this spot for the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annalida500
50,Quiet and serene!,"Parking fir a fee only! Know your license plate as you have to type that in.Gorgeous views, sweeping panorama and quiet! A recipe for a relaxing couple of hours.Bring a couple of folding chairs, maybe a blanket and chill on the beach enjoying the rhythm of the waves gently crashing on the shore.You‚Äôll have to walk down a small hillside and maneuver some steep steps - not fir anyone who is not stable.Option is to stay up top and enjoy the spectacular views. Bring some food and use the picnic tables. Or grab lunch at the nearby Seafood Market in Malibu.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelcT7673WN
50,Beautiful rock formations!!,"First, this beach is very difficult to get to. There will likely be no parking in the designated lot, but you can park along the US 1 and walk to the lot. There are several sets of steep stairs that you must descend to get to the beach (I don't suggest packing a ton of stuff, although I passed several coolers, chairs, etc... IDK how they did it?!).But the good part - make sure you BRING YOUR CAMERA (or a phone) because the rock formations are just beautiful!!! Definitely my favorite beach while visiting SoCal.. we observed many ""modeling"" sessions here too - I'd say it's a Malibu favorite :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahigdon3

40,Quick Trip or Relaxing Day,"Pros: usually not crowded, great views, away from the public beaches. Cons: decent drive into Malibu, very short walk from one side to the other, and if there are crowds, it feels more crowded. Worth a quick trip though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoneExpLauren
40,Good one.,Not easy to find and difficult to park car. Step down of hill and you ar einfront of Ocean. Narrow beach strip and relatively short one plenty of people who dressed in shirt and jeans for unknown reason and not so many swimming or surfing.I did not like place because of those people. But anyway as everything in Great LA this great pace to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/593yurys
50,Gorgeous!,"We have been visiting every beach we can see in the last year since moving to Southern California, and while they are all nice, many look similar. This beach is a rare exception. There are amazing rock formations and caves to see, the waves are not too high. The water was cold, and beach a little crowded but had we walked further there was a lot more empty space. Overall, one of the coolest beaches we have seen and already can't wait to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rfpanhorst

50,Unforgettable beach!,"My husband and I LOVED this beach! We stopped here on our way down PCH. It was really fun to look at the rock formations and explore them. We were here on a Thursday mid-morning, and it wasn't crowded at all. (but when we drove past some of the other Malibu beaches they were super packed). I definitely would not want to bring down a lot of equipment though as the stairs are steep to get down to the beach. The parking lot is small, but you can park on the road, too. We have some of my favorite photos of our trip from here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/URspider03

40,Nice day on the beach,We visited on a weekday and it wasn't too crowded. Mostly young couples or groups of friends. Not the best beach for kids because the waves are large. There are also rock formations in the surf so you have to be mindful of the tide and where you're swimming. Otherwise it was clean and peaceful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiraN218

50,Secluded beach which is a sheer drop from a small cliff.,This beach is off a cliff with a sheer drop with stairs leading down. The beach is not very big and secluded with Rocky formations that present an excellent opportunity for photos. In fact if you are lucky you will see some photo shoots happening there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bidyutbhanjdeo
40,Gorgeous Rocks - Small beach - Steep Stairs,"Breathtaking rock formations stud a narrow strip of sand about a football field in length and half as wide. We went on a weekday afternoon and it was busy but not unmanageable. My parents, who are in their 70's navigated the step stairs carefully but without a problem. There is a small pay lot with honey buckets. For us, a place to take amazing photos and hang out for a few hours. A very enjoyable afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Going_with_Teen

40,Great spot,"Though parking is a bit treacherous along the highway due to the lack of space in the lot, this free beach was really lovely. A bit crowded as there is not so much room between the rocky cliffs and the sea, it's fun to walk through the rocks in the sea. We were surprised by the huge amounts of massive seaweed on the day we went, wrapping around our ankles, but the waves were great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/takingtea
30,Amazing view,A very nice beach. Take into consideration that you have to walk down quite a bit and the bad news is that you have to climb it back but it worth it as it is a very nice place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gidital
50,Simply stunning,"This beach is simply gorgeous! The rocks, the cliffs, the ocean...it's just like a painting! I visited here a few years ago and my advice is the same: The path down to the beach is a bit treacherous. Be very careful winding your way down a cliffside with a ton of sand and stairs. If you have knee/walking problems, this probably isn't the climb for you. However, if you're able and up for it, the beach is stunning! There is a small parking lot to the side, but it can be tough to find a parking spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katies94

By the time we got out and paid for parking, 1/3 of the lot was full.We were just stopping by on our way to Santa Monica to check it out, not to hang out or anything. The beach is small and you could keep your visit under an hour if you wanted.When we left around 9:15, the parking lot was full, but there looked to be street parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginap426
50,"Best Beach in Malibu, Uniquely Amazing Rock Formations","I visited in the morning (around 9:30am), it was beautiful! You follow the sandy trail toward the beach, then once you turn the corn and see the stairs... It's amazing to see how those huge rock formations and somewhat romantic, movie-scene like beach that was rather private. There are a couple sets of stairs, but the scenery makes up for it.Huge rock formations on the beach make even for more scenery and privacy, perfect place for photography or swimming (I swam and was only able to go about thigh deep, with unpredictable waves). Waves vary drastically in height from barely none to the kind that knock you over, even thigh deep, but it was still great! I step in something, though that was sticky (maybe it was tar); it still didn't dampen my experience.My dad just stayed just before the first set of stairs (and you can still see the beach and rock formations, too). Scurry among the rocks behind you are rare lizards (see photo), we saw these same lizards on Point Dume.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/718gregoryj
50,Beautiful,Wonderful Beach nestled between multi million-dollar homes. When the tide comes in it does crash right up against the Rocks.

40,Unique beach worth visiting,We took Route 23 to this Beach from the Simi Valley area. What a ride! Twists and turns on a narrow road. There is a small parking lot that you pay at the machine (bring your plate number!). Nice places to take photos just beyond the parking lot. But I agree that it is not an easy beach to get to -- as there are numerous stairs. The tide was strong but the rock structures are worth it. One resembled a dragon's head to us. Fun stop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaD741

The place is full of sea caves, rocks, and breathtaking scenery. During the morning hours, visitors can get a glimpse of dolphins.If you plan to visit this place, I suggest to go early. There is a small parking lot with a kiosk for parking permits. But once the lot is full, parking can be such a pain. Also, bring minimal things as you would have to go up and down lots of stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dear_maryyy

I could not get to the bottom because of how steep it was and I had a panic attack. Yes, I am an adult who is afraid of heights. Had it been an easy sloping way to the bottom, I could have done it.

If you are taking pictures this can be easily done within 2-3 hours depending on the time of day, before either the lighting gets too harsh or too dark. If hanging out on the beach, to swim or sunbathe, depends on each individual person and how long they want to stay.There is no food here so you have to bring your own liquids and food.Great beach and less populated than Malibu, Santa Monica and Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G7823URdanh
50,beautiful or stunning...hard to decide,"We arrived here mid morning, still cool and the smog had not yet burnt off yet still it is one of the most beautiful beaches we have visited. There were already lots of people staking claims to areas of the beach and there must have been at least a dozen photo shoots happening. The rock formations and scattered rocks along the beach and out into the surf were amazing. It was possible to get out and walk around the rocks and through the caves which was a lot of fun. The beach itself was very narrow and the sand was wet so not the best for lounging around and the rocky shoreline made it hard to swim or play much in the water. However that said, this still remains one of our favorite beaches of all time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rexhans

50,Wow! BEAUTIFUL Beach!,This was a worthwhile hike down the hill for all the beautiful pictures and rock formations! Very picturesque!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ButchHogan
50,great beach,"Amazing rock formations. Beautiful cliffs. Parking is limited but 10 dollars all day is well worth it. People do park on main road, I don't know if they give tickets or not. I parked on road last time because the lot was full and didn't get a ticket. Walk both directions from the stairs.Most only venture north but south is also amazing.bbeautiful cliffs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markdX8860EH
40,Nice,There is a paid parking on the top. The beach is nice and suitable for a short walk. When i was there the weather was good and there were not too many people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965micha_d
40,Be Advised,"This beach is beautiful but me and my boyfriend will never go past a certain poitn again. We became curious and decided to go further and we lost track of time and ended up getting stranded because the tides were really strong and high. We got stuck in a cave and the water kept knocking me against the rocks and I hit my head a few times and got a bunch of cuts everywhere. Me and boyfriend could have drowned if we didnt escape the cave. My point is dont go far if you are expecting to be at the beach for awhile, privacy is nice but being alive is much more important.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifercN4410ET
50,Stunnin!,beautiful views and beach. small but gorgeous. easy to get to. great for taking pictures. another gem along the PCH,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolej151
50,Gorgeous views,"There are many beaches to stop at between LA and Malibu, but thanks to the photos on Trip Advisor, I selected this one -- I'm glad I did! The views were gorgeous, and it actually took my breath away. After coming from the flat sandy beaches of Venice and Santa Monica, I thought the rock formations were absolutely stunning. If you have just 20 minutes, pull off the highway and take a look -- you'll be glad you did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellerP9052VJ
50,Glamorous Malibu Beach,"My favorite beach in LA, El Matador had great waves, good sand, amazing cliffs, and fun attractive people. It's an awesome drive on the PCH to get here, and it will certainly be a memorable relaxing beach day. For travelers, if you're looking to spend a solid day at a beach in LA, El Matador would be very high on my list of recommendations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewsC7868UF
40,Gorgeous but I wouldn't bring a toddler,"Went here with my teen daughter over Easter. It was completely gorgeous. One thing, though, to get to it, you need to wind down a narrow gravel path with NO guard rails! I kept thinking that if my three year old was with, we may not have made it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allisonr453
50,"Beautiful, scenic beach!","My fiance and I came here on Sunday morning to take engagement photos. It's a beautiful, unique location! There were a few other photographers there as well taking photos, but it definitely wasn't crowded by any means! We left around 10am, and there were a few more families and photographers arriving, so maybe it gets a little busy in the afternoon? Also, you have to pay for parking by the hour, and it's a little hike to get down to the water. It's definitely worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snhughes1
50,A bit far but worth it,It's a bit far from LA but it's a quiet spot with some nice rocks. Really lovely beach. Only problem is the parking is a bit small. It has one of the nicest views around LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanimirc2014
50,Our Favorite Beach,"Just happened on this beach while roaming around Malibu one afternoon. Favorite features: the rock formations, the tide pools, uncrowded, clean, the flowers and greenery, the people watching, the waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VickyF394
50,Stunning even in heavy fog,"Those who travel on Hwy 1 knows fog can be an issue. Not all days will be clear and sunny. A lot of beaches loses it's scenic appeal on foggy days. However, El Matador is one of a few beaches that is still stunning on a foggy day and the fog actually adds to mystic with it's rock formation. We had a great visit here in March on a foggy day. Water was still cold but this area is so scenic that it doesn't matter. Lots to see, the view is stunning, beach after beach area to explore. There is paid parking at the beginning of the trail going to the staircase the lead you down to the beach area. Amazing view and photo op there. Once you head down, just enjoy the scenery and all the rock formation as you walk along the beach. Worth the visit regardless of weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herbulous
50,Magical,"We love this place! The kids wanted a beach that also had tidepools, we saw lots of anemones and even a starfish!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/334kristianj
50,Beautiful but please respect this beach,"This beach is beautiful and very important to people who live in Malibu as are all of our beaches. This beach has no ""life guard"", no food service, and no easy access to the bathrooms. They are at the top of a step hill/walk way. There is limited parking in the lot and it costs to park. Get there early as parking on PCH can not only be dangerous, you will get ticketed and/or towed. People who go there and throw trash, urinate everywhere, and don't respect the wildlife all in the name of a selfie should just stay way. So others who have respect and want to see an amazing part of malibu can enjoy it. The homes on the beach there do have legal beach rights and you are not allowed under the homes or in front of them so keep in mind the public part of this beach is not big.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuFamily
50,1st beach stop in CA,"It was our first day in CA and I found this place on Trip Advisor. We drove about 30 min north from Pacific Palisades to see it. Take the time to go!! So beautiful! Arrived early, around 9 am, plenty of parking, pay and display. Tide was high so waves were crashing against the rocks. Water was cold, but my kids didn't care. Great spot for pictures, saw many professional photo shoots. Glad we found this gem, thanks TA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/254amyt
50,Your trip will be incomplete without a visit here,"THEEE most amazing beach of all time. Arrive early for a good parking spot - it's $10 for all day, and you'll want to stay. Get stocked up on snacks/coffee at the small shopping plaza nearby & set up camp for the whole day. What a beautiful place to take pictures. Not too crowded because it's a hidden gem. There are locals & tourists alike...plenty of space for everyone. Lots of professional photoshoots happen in early AM & later in the evening for sunset.My sister & I were visiting from MI and wanted a stereotypical California beach & this delivered + MORE! Malibu itself is incredibly beautiful...and this beach is absolutely stunning. One of those situations where every step you take you want to take a new picture because it just gets even more beautiful.All kinds of people were here - families, small children, teenagers, middle-aged -- it's perfect for anyone & everyone. The walk down is definitely steep & there are many steps...the way back up definitely makes you huff & puff a little....so make sure you're aware of this!Incredible....I will let my photos do the rest of the convincing for you ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weberemk
40,Good for the Sunset View,Get a good view of the Sunset from the top. Trek down to the beach for a stroll. Lots of photo shoots happening so you know it is good for photo opportunities. It has a parking lot else one can park on the shoulder of PCH.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkislaya
50,View from Above,We stopped here after lunch and didn't make it down to the beach but the view from above were so awesome. Really enjoyed just sitting and listening to the ocean and the birds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharimc68
40,One of our Favourites,"Spent a couple days stopping at beaches along the PCH. Based on a recommendation from a local, we made El Matador State Beach a priority. We were at the beach in February at around 11. Tide was out and we were able to walk on the beach and view in the pools of water left behind. It was quite the walk down, and more challenging walking back up! We took lots of pictures with all the rocks, water and sky as a background.Parking was easy - and paid by the hour. Of course, in February, it isn't as busy as the summer!We enjoyed the beach and the view and would recommend it to others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23tn
50,LOved this beach!,There were lots of people out doing photo shoots here & it certainly is a beautiful spot. It isn't necessarily handicap friendly though as it is a walk down to the beach & has some steep stairs as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/On_Da_Road1
50,Beautuiful!,"Can't wait to return! I came here on a high surf day, but was struck by the beauty of the vistas. Although I lost my prescription ray bans, I still thought is was amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vsisnero
50,The most beautiful beach in Los Angeles,Just the most beautiful beach in Los Angeles. Just look at the pictures and you will see! This is where I shoot most of my couples and family photography sessions when I am not in Santa Monica!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alamodephoto
50,Stunning area,Well worth the drive from LA. The scenery and beaches around this area are stunning and very picturesque.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonDoz
50,Our favorite!,My husband and I recently drove PCH on our honeymoon and this was our favorite beach along the way. Stunning views. Beautiful rocks/cliffs. We went during the week so it wasn't crowded at all!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiffanyG870
50,Fantastic Sunset Views and People Watching,"We went to El Matador for sunset in mid January and I could not have been more pleased. The views are unbelievable. The rock formations make for great shadows and the colors of the sunset were wonderful. We saw two couples shooting engagement photos...one proposal...and a couple of just straight up fashion shoots. Somehow, even with all of these people on the beach....you still feel awash in the splendor of the natural setting. Parking on the street is easy in the winter, but might be very difficult in summer. The parking lot is very small and always full.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/632carltonh
40,"Among the better beach spots, but very limited parking","Please don't even think of trying to park on the landside of PCH (opposite the beach). The H in PCH stands for Highway, cars regularly do 10+ MPH over the posted 55MPH speed limit, and oncoming drivers can't always see you trying to run across the street. That's why so many people have died at precisely this spot. Thank you California Coastal Commission and CalTrans for maintaining conditions which regularly risk visitors' lives.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
50,A Little R&R,"If you need a place to walk, sit and watch the tides roll in, El Matador is a great place. The park offers paid parking, and you can always park on the PCH for free. There are lots of rock formations, and if you're into people watching, there's always a photo shoot going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimH_Tarheel
50,Best beach in Malibu,Lived next door to this beach for 10 years on encinal bluffs. Best part of the beach is to the right down in front of encinal bluffs. Walk in to caverns and caves and come out the otherside on semi private encinal bluffs beaches.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomadnicaragua
50,beautiful photo ops,"located off pacific coast hwy, parking easy for walk down to the beach. great photo ops with the rock formations. great walk down the beach to the other parks as well... recommend several hours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catmalways4ever
40,"Beautiful, clean beach","My wife, our baby, and I stopped here for about an hour to watch the sunset. Having to pay to park at a public was a little annoying for a person from the Midwest but probably helps keep out the riff raff.The beach was clean and the large rock formations make for good photos. Great place for sunset photography.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TacoSteveTime
50,Great couple visit,Went in the dead of winter and were the only two people which was awesome. So quiet and peaceful. There are a lot of stairs but If you love the movie the notebook you have to come here nonetheless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/766christinal
50,super,very nice beach! So calm and so beautiful. I was there in December and it was about 20 degrees and almost no people,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piotrh1982
40,Be prepared for a workout getting to and from the beach,This is the place to be to catch that California sunset.Just a little warning:There are a fair amount of stairs to actually get down to the beach from the parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KylaE_12
50,The most romantic beach in Malibu,"Never a big crowd. There is always a spot from which entire beach seems to be just yours, but try to come during the week and you likely will be the only person there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexJenia
50,A Must see!,"It is a Beautiful beach, the rocks are amazing, and the view is fantastic, Weekends can be a little too crowded, it's a must see Beach in Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/houseofbarov
50,Worth the climb to see the amazing big rocks and surf,I was lucky to come on a sunny day in November when there were few people here. It was easy to park in the small lot at the top. The climb down to the beach is not as bad as it looks and you will be rewarded with a great walk on a sandy beach around some amazing big rocks. There were lots of professional photographers taking pictures here. You can see some the amazing Malibu Ocean Front homes from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertkM5959BT
50,Loved this edgy jagged sandy beach!,This beach has character! Loved the fact that it had large boulders along the beach. Beautiful! Great stop for an afternoon snack!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/568debbieh
40,Great rocks,Great rocks on the beach making this a fun stop views wee fantastic and the beach uncrowded. They were filming a tv show but no issues,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vonschmidt
50,Gorgeous and Pristine!,"On a recent trip to the Los Angeles area my girls and I decided to explore Malibu. We normally don't stray far from our favorite beach area in Newport but we were staying near Santa Monica and Malibu seemed like it would be fun to explore. We were happy with out choice.We had a tip from our Airbnb host that Matador State Beach was a good one to visit. The drive up the coast was short and sweet and we stopped at a few places along the way. It was easy to find the beach and there is a pay parking lot at the top. You will have to walk down some stairs and a path to the beach - which also means you will have to walk up at the end. The path isn't hard but it could be too much for very young or older visitors.The view from the top is so beautiful but once you get down to the beach and start exploring its even better. There are lots of rocky pools and when the tide is out you can all kinds of little crabs, sea anemones, and sea slugs. It was fun checking them out.The beach is clean and beautiful and we enjoyed walking for over an hour and just checking out the water, the little shells and rocks, and the sea life in the small pools. There were really pretty photo ops and not a lot of people.I'm so glad we explored the Malibu beach area - in the future it would be a great place to pack a picnic and hang out on the beach for the day. If you aren't into crowds check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZVAL
50,A must,"This beach is incredible in beauty. It's not very big and parking is an issue, had to park on the PCH. But the rock formations along the beach are outstanding. It's worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SingonS
50,Fantastic,"Someone from work recommended I visit here versus the ""normal"" hot spots. The views are breathtaking to say the least.It was very quiet, bit of a walk down to the beach but certainly worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prenticew2014
30,Stopped to get our feet wet.,Nice little beach not too crowded. We just took a break from driving to get our feet wet. it was fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferdE2136UN
40,Amazing views for the hearty,"An incredible beach with an amazing overview of the area. There is a very steep, very lengthy stairway from the overlook to the beach and I would NOT recommend this for anyone who will be overworked by exercise. You can still get a glimpse of some of the sea caves from up above. Be sure to check the local tides and plan your visit for low tide. There is a decent sized unpaved parking lot, not good for RVs. There is a fee for parking ($3 self pay), but when I visited there wasn't anyone there checking on who was paid up. This beach is worth the drive up the PCH.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdelahalle
40,"Beautiful beach, watch out for the seagulls.","Got there early on a Monday and had the place to ourselves. It was lovely. I don't think we would have enjoyed it so much if we had had to share it though, as it is quite small. We brought breakfast to eat on the beach. Put the leftovers away and wandered down the beach a bit. Came back to a crowd of seagulls pecking away all over our stuff trying to get to the food. So: go early on a week day, don't leave any food if you go for a walk, and you'll have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/takeitorleaveit
50,So Beautiful!,Not known by many tourists- we loved this gem of a beach. So tranquil and such awesome views. Just a quick short hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rgarg_23
50,My fave little beach deep in Malibu,"I love El Matador for a couple reasons. First, it's a bit further north in Malibu so it's never as busy as the beaches further south. Second, it's a bit more secluded and feels like it's for people more in the know! Finally, it gives an excuse for a nice drive down the PCH to get there.I don't usually find a beach worth a review, but this one is for sure worth the stop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessehendon
50,Must See!,"El Matador State Beach is a must see if in the LA/Malibu area. Located right off of the PCH, After some great views from just past the parking lot, it's just a short hike down a series of steps to the beach. The rock formations and the cliffs are so picturesque and need to be seen in person. Great place to have a picnic or enjoy some surf.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Panelson4
40,Scenic Beauty,"There is cliff top parking and a steep walk down. Difficult to get parking at both places. There are no facilities on the beach, just a toilet by the car park. Beautiful rock formations on the beach and the sea is more gentle. Sunset View is Good",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sorabh
50,Worth the steps!,"Spectacular views from up high and even better when you go down all those steps to the sand. Waves pounding, gulls flying, rocks holding firm. Worth it for those sites alone. I went on a Friday and there happened to be two photo shoots with lovely models underway on the beach. Just an added attraction!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottB541
50,Worth stopping if driving up the coast,If you want to stop and get on the beach this one fit the bill. Not overly crowded. Did have to park on street but rock formations were very neat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aarony396
50,Unbelievable!!!,"This beach is amazing! Its a hiding gem! It was my husband and I's first time in California and we were looking for the best beaches near L.A. We were not disappointed! The beach is beautiful! The natural beauty of this beach attracts people to not only enjoy it swimming but taking pictures as well. During the hour that we were there we saw aspiring models having their pictures taken there, pregnant woman having her maternity pictures taken there, tourists like us, photographers chasing the perfect picture of the sunset and a couple who just eloped taking pictures there with their wedding party.Next time that we visit CA again, we'll definitely go back but at this time, in the morning because the traffic back to L.A. around 5pm sucks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FabianeB288
40,Fabulous beach,"This little beach is well worth finding. There is cliff top parking and a steep walk down. There are no facilities on the beach, just a toilet by the car park.If you need shade - take some!There are beautiful rock formations on the beach and the sea is more gentle than the Malibu surf beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AR-Greenwich
50,Spectacular,"so glad we visited here, it was a cloudy Sept day but that didn't stop us getting some wonderful photos and ever lasting memories of this beach. A special place along the PCH - well worth a look. imagine it would be even better at sunrise / sunset",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/343jasonc

40,Stunning beauty,My friends (who are California natives) and I opted not to go to beaches dominated by tourists but rather this one located 20-30 minutes further away from Malibu and we were not disappointed.The beach and the surrounding areas were truly stunning!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TashanC
50,Gorgeous,"There is a reason why photographers go to this beach. Great rocks, beach and ocean make for an amazing memory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pras499
40,gorgeous view,I only had a small amount of time before work to check out this beach. I was able to find parking for free on PCH and had no trouble walking down to the entrance. The view is beautiful. You can walk along the top or you can take the steps down to the beach to view the rocks. There were plenty of people there to relax on the beach. I didn't have the right beach clothes so I just took the steps down and walked on the hard sand to take some beautiful photos. I did go on Labor Day weekend and it was not that busy. The breeze feels amazing and you have an amazing view of the whole coast from the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellysp2016
50,Stunning Landscape,This is a cool hidden treasure along the Pacific Coast Highway that sports some breathtaking views. The rock formations along the stretch of beach are picturesque. I wish we could have spent more time here. Make sure to take in the views from above before heading down for a closer look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thetravelingmx

50,Double WOW,"Wait a little for parking unless u go early...it's worth it. Bit of a walk down...but the views and the water are well worth it. This place is out of the way, but you will love it, get ur camera ready from the moment u start walking u will start shooting. I'm sure u will recognize diff. movies having been shot here. Must see, must do, even if ur not going in the water. Lifeguards are on duty, waves did not look very rough. Probably the most beautiful beach around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2ENTravelers
30,Overrated,"Getting here is not a problem, in spite if the LA traffic. Parking is another story. There is a small - tiny parking for about 20-30 cars, and if you are coming in the afternoon then you are in for a good hike. We had to park on the main highway aproximatelly 1mile from the beach. That wasn't that bad. If you expect this beach to be somewhat ""secluded gem"" then forget about it. I don't think I saw such crowd on Venice beach. It definitely looks a lot better on pictures then in real life. If you think this is smth special then save the ride and spend some time in Santa Monica beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JurajM572
30,"Great rock view, linited parking or dangerous parking on PCH, crowded too","Mixed feelings great rocks formation, great view, Almost no parking, difficult access and crowded.I do not think this is your regular beach where you can take your umbrella, chairs, and cooler, or play volleyball. Actually. There is not much sand and lots of people. It is pretty crowded and if high tide there is no beach left.Limited parking, tiny parking lot, and expensive 10 for the whole day or 3 per hour. Your other option is to park on the busy PCH, then avoid get run over trying to cross PCH. There is no pedestrian crossing or stop light.Access is difficult, need to go down steep stairs to reach the beach. Once you reach the beach, the rocks and the ocean can make a great scenic views.You better bring water and snacks, there are no services here. There are some portable potties in the parking lot, but you can imagine, the heat and portable potty, it is very disgustingThere are other options around Malibu. Point Dume beach con offer some rock views as well. Parking is slightly better and is not as crowded.Another option is Zuma each parking is not as problematic. There are services here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericuchon

50,Gorgeous!,"Loved this beach. We arrived close to sunset and thoroughly enjoyed our walk and the view of the ocean and rocks. There were other people but not a huge crowd, which was nice.

50,Shhhh.... Keep it a secret!,"I was looking for a beach that is off the beaten path, with lots of sand area to sprawl out and that's pristine with swimming potential. Well this is the one folks! Though small this is one of my favorite beaches in Malibu area. I go during the week and it is generally pretty busy so I can't imagine how weekends are. Perfect place for self reflection and laying out. Few shade options so umbrella recommended. No showers but do have toilets, if your willing to climb back up the hill on the cliff side to use them...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristal48

10,What's the big deal?,"Crowded, not good for kids due to rocks and beach was more trashed than I would have believed. Parking is a total nightmare. We ended up on PCH and the traffic speeding by while trying to talk to the beach entry is very dangerous. There are other beaches in Malibu that are a much better beach experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericwY3226NA
20,Not worth the drive,"When I make it out to the beach I like it to be a simple process.This beach is located off a very fast moving highway, looking for the entrance can be difficult while zooming along PCH.There is a fee to park in the lot and free to park on the street. I never did like parking on the street, the cars zoom by quickly making me feel unsafe walking along the side of the road.The beach is tiny, and when the tide is high, it just about disappears. It has become more and more crowded every year and it is noticeable by the trash left behind.This beach is low on my list of beaches to visit. There are too many variables that do not make it worth my drive anymore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoeLa_25
30,misunderstood,"It was over 15 years since I went there before last week and it sure was different. It still has probably the best panaramic view of Malibu (maybe even S, oCal)....BUT this is NOT a beach you go to to have a beach day. I am writing this because I saw so many people bringing umbrellas and volleyballs and large groups trying to lay out. This is not that type of beach. It is very short and disappears at high tide; it has a lot of rocks so laying out is uncomfortable. Unfortunately, there is now a lot of trash and parking is difficult. This is a place to go for a nice 20 minute beach walk and take some pictures. Even the surf is rough and kelpy so no good for kids. If you want a beach day, go a mile down to Zuma beach or down to the Malibu pier where you can see some good surfing and get a meal near by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hikingdude
20,"CROWDED, SMALL, but BEAUTIFUL","This beach is a one time and done type of place...park on hwy 1 or get lucky finding a spot in the parking lot like we did ($10 for the day or $3 an hour). Hike down a few stairways and you arrive at a narrow beach area full of people with huge rock formations and cave like areas to get cool pics. SO MANY PEOPLE though...and when the tide starts to come in around 4pm the beach area gets even smaller and everyone crowds on top of everyone and it's just very strange. Literally had a space for 2 beach chairs and a blanket out front and people just piled on top of us when the water started rising. The trash left on the beach was atrocious and so sad. We saw 2 lifeguards and 2 sheriff deputies patroling this beach and they were handing out tickets! Unlike most beaches in the area you can't have alcohol or pets on this beach. You will get a ticket! The beach is so small it's good that no pets are allowed as I watched a dog do his business on one of the only open patches of sand there was. The police were soon on their case b/c again dogs are NOT allowed! The music is loud and people of obnoxious on this beach. I just don't recommend it other than to go, see the rocks, get your picture and get out. Don't hike down with all your gear and set up shop for the day...it will not be enjoyable. Try Point Dume or Zuma for a more realistic beach experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sparky8188
50,Great beach,"Great beach, in good shape with a nice set of stone formations. Parking is either in the parking lot or directly on the highway. Waves very pretty nice when we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ua917
40,Beautiful rock formations,"The beach was gorgeous when we went mid-afternoon but I would suggest going at sunset for the best photo-ops. If you want to avoid pay parking, park on the side of the highway (watch out for cars when you cross though). There are steep wooden stairs down to the beach so might not be a good idea for older folks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beautindah
10,sad but true --,"this beach was once a lovely haven, but over the years has been turned by humans and their animals into one massive litterbox. add the threat of parking tickets to the pain, and leo carrillo beach suddenly sounds like a much saner alternative after all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/242CoconutH2O
50,An Absolute Gem!,"I am so glad I did some research and found this beach to visit on our trip to Malibu. The sights are spectacular and lots of great photo ops with the different rock formations. It was fun to wade in the water and find shells between the waves washing in. It was a bit of a trek coming back up the stairs and hills in 30+ degree heat, but definitely well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferP315
50,A must see !,A small but lovely beach worth a visit if your passing not with a stroller or wheelchair though ! There's a steep path a wooden staircase down to the actual beach with car parking at the top $3 an hour or $10 for the day . Great views from the top and lots of nice photo opportunities !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinacs2015
10,Don't bother! It's not what it used to be!,"I grew up in Los Angeles so I know Malibu well. There was a time when El Matador was the perfect little secret beach and very beautiful! Well, apparently the secret has gotten and and I'm sad to say all those people have ruined it! So disappointing to see trash everywhere .... $10 to park and a dangerous risk on PCH. Don't bother!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zannav
50,Beautiful breathtaking views,Perfect for a photoshoot but be prepared to climb down! Quiet and exotic looking beach. Kids had a great time exploring the rocks and caves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InternationalGoddess
30,"Beautiful, but ...","Without a doubt a most beautiful and charming beach. However, the weekend visitors leave such an abhorrent mess that that's all you see. I feel bad for the state workers who have to deal with the incessant garbage week after week. Also, the parking is limited so one is forced to park on the very busy Hwy 1. You're better off traveling a few miles further north to one of the other beautiful Malibu beach nooks. Otherwise, bring a trash bag and help us keep this beautiful spot beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422sh
50,For good pics and a nice sunset,"The best Malibu beach for photos and sunset IMO. Not recommended for swimming. Also the descent is a little steep and can be slick. It's also pretty far from Santa Monica, so expect a long commute if traffic is heavy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/183ng
20,"Once great, now ruined","What used to be a nice beach has devolved into a place to avoid. Expect impossible parking, loud music, and garbage strewn everywhere. You will have to fight with for every last inch of this tiny beach. Always over crowded. This summer I realized that I could never return. The sheer volume of people here has really ruined it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coburnh
10,Will not go back,The beach was dirty and parking was impossible. We had to walk alongside a very fast speed strech of PCH then walk a long way down to the water. A long and dangerous walk to only find an overcrowded and dirty beach. Not a #2!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wino007
10,Dangerous and crowded,You should know that there have been a lot of dangerous incidents there lately including loss of life from crossing the road. This beach is tiny and so overcrowded. When the tide comes in the entire beach dissapears and so will your stuff. Try mugu or Leo Carrillo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bittybae
20,Overcrowded Every Darn Day!,"Every time I've come to this beach (including a rainy Tuesday morning in the off-season) there is no where to park. Walk to the water is very steep, not good for families or the elderly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wine_Kitten1
20,Lost its charm,"I used to enjoy an occasional trip to this beach. Since it's rocky, it isn't great for swimming or bodyboarding, but it is scenic and used to be quiet. But that all seems to have changed since the masses discovered it. It's almost impossible to park anymore, and most of PCH nearby is marked by no parking signs, and I heard they ticket there. The steep path down to the beach is now strewn with trash. It makes me furious that people would come to this beautiful place and leave dirty diapers all over the place. I wanted to walk amongst the rocks and tide pools, but there were so many people with their selfie sticks, that it's not even enjoyable to do that here anymore. I was getting glared at by the people taking selfies (not to mention those in line to take their own selfies)! Makes me so sad what has happened to this little spot that was like paradise 15 years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ceeinsocal
10,"Dirty, overcrowded beach - and expect a parking ticket","I was SO disappointed by El Matador! Not only is there VERY limited legal parking (and BOY do they love to hand out the parking tickets!), the beach itself is small, way too crowded, and the steep cliff walk down and back was actually too much for someone in my party. Plus, there's so much litter!To make it worse, people drive like maniacs on that stretch of road. I just read that this year alone three pedestrians have been killed crossing to This Beach from their illegal parking spaces.So many better beaches, so much closer to home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rwaytz
20,crowded & hard to access,"limited parking, crowded (for some reason the young gang-bangers have latched onto this place), and a treacherous dirt trail down to the beach. once you get to the sand, it's kind of just another beach. porta-potties are like ovens and a bit gross. there are better choices in malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/devob730
10,So badly over-rated!,"Friends wanted to go to this beach because of the good review. So badly overrated!! So much trash, super crowded, no where to park, so we drove around and around looking for street parking after giving up on the tiny lot (we were still early!), almost got hit running across the road with traffic going way more than 50mph ....then we had to navigate this steep downhill trail which needed better shoes than flip flops. So sad all the litter - It was so crowded and overused. And we got a HUGE parking ticket. Social media - you were wrong. So many nicer easier beaches. Bummer Sunday!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/masklisa
10,"Struggle to access, Parking Tickets and no Safe highway crossing site.","After seeing all of these great reviews, we decided to check it out yesterday. The parking lot was full, so we parked on the PCH, somehow missing the No Parking sign. $125 ticket to go to the beach, and we were nearly run down by cars trying to cross the highway, as there is no cross walk. It's a steep cliff and very challenging to access the beach. We ended up doing more beach clean up, than sunbathing, thanks to the ridiculous amounts of litter left on the beach. Zuma is way better, also Point Dune, safe access, better parking and NO Tickets. Save yourself the headaches, trust me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/styledir
20,Small and overcrowded.,"Sure, El Matador is very pretty. But it is small and not really meant to take on the crowds that go there now. The parking lot fills up almost immediately, even on weekdays. And don't even think about parking on PCH as most of it is marked No Parking. Trust me, you will get a ticket. Also, factor in that that stretch of PCH is very dangerous. I've witnessed multiple accidents there. As an alternative, I recommend Point Dume to the south or Leo Carrillo to the north.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdamD2184
20,Better beaches to visit than this one,"This beach was not meant to handle the crowds that it draws. Legitimate parking is extremely limited, so by parking illegally you risk getting a ticket (those ""no parking"" signs aren't just for show), plus I've seen so many people crossing the huge highway without even paying attention to the traffic whizzing by them. No wonder people have been getting killed! Do yourself a favor and visit a beach where you don't have to cross PCH to get to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catmom37
10,Avoid at all costs,"Don't understand how this beach has gotten such a good rating. I went this weekend, and my toddler stepped on a hypodermic needle. There are a lot of IV drug users and homeless that camp out here. The bathrooms are horrible. To top it all off, I got a parking ticket! The parking lot is ALWAYS full, and like everyone else I parked on the PCH. The entire row of cars, along with mine, got $125 parking tickets! The trail down to the beach is also extremely dangerous, last month my cousin sprained his ankle in the rut that has formed from the rains last winter. Point Dume is right down the road and is such a nice place, don't waste your time at Matador.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y9073CKbarrym
40,"Photo's, photo's, photo's","First I would park across the street like locals do, no need to pay $10.00. This is a great beach for photo's or a walk at sunset. For So Cal it's not really your all day chill at the beach kind of spot. Head down the street to Zuma beach for a classic day at the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacisWanderlust
40,"Nice rock formations, lots of people","A friend brought us here while we were visiting the area. It's quite a hike down the rocks, but it's a pretty cool beach. There were lots of people on a Sunday evening, some doing official photo shoots. We hiked to the end of the cove and got our feet wet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carly_V_McCoy
10,A beautiful beach ruined,"We live close by and used to visit often. This beach used to be a gem. Now it is turd. Thanks to online media, this beach is getting WAY more people than it can handle. The parking lot fills up fast and it is supposed to be no parking on PCH. People park there anyway and get ticketed. Spoke with a Sheriff's Deputy a few weeks ago and he said they wrote 448 tickets at at that location in one day! In the last two weeks, three people have been hit crossing PCH - one dead and two critical.The beach itself is nice, if you can find a spot among all the people. When the tide is low you can walk north for a long way. When the tide comes in you may be trapped. In some places the beach disappears in high tide. The beach shows the unfortunate signs of over-use: trash, cigarette butts, graffiti. There is a similar beach just a couple miles north that have not yet been discovered: El Pescador. I recommend going there instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wildscribbler
40,Beautiful beach!!,I don't think I would take young kids..main access and parking I think would be too difficult..small parking lot. But I can park in PCH. There could be different access point I'm not aware of. Worth a trip for sure!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/macial
50,"Lots of Photo ops, good beach","We spent the day at El Matador and were not disappointed. Parking lot is small ($10 pay and display) so get there early. We arrived at 11:30 to get the last spot.The walk down is a bit tricky - the path at the beginning appears to be under construction with a bulldozer and lots of dirt. Definitely wouldn't pass health and safety in Canada.Beautiful rocks once you get down on the beach. Lots of great places to take pics.Beach is clean (it was rough when we went so there was lots of dried seaweed, a few lost shoes).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaPep
20,"It's ok. Really crowded, and very dangerous to access when the lot is full","I spend a lot of time in Malibu. As a local to Los Angeles, I can say I've seen multiple people declared dead on the side of the road here. Very dangerous spot to park, and it tends to get extremely crowded. Better places both up and down the coast that are much less frequented.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/597spencera
20,Not what it used to be,"El Matador used to be a quiet, tiny beach with some pretty caves. Not anymore. It's super crowded even on a weekday. Loud families, gangster types (there's graffiti everywhere), trash everywhere. Someone was killed there a couple of weeks ago. The access route is long and dangerous, with rickety stairs and a narrow, eroded dirt path. That part never really bothered me til there were too many people. You really have to be careful not to fall over the edge. Speaking of crowds, the parking lot fills up almost immediately and most of PCH is No Parking. Yes, you will get a ticket! I saw the parking enforcement just sitting and waiting for people to park illegally. Sheriffs too. Overall it's hard to relax in that kind of environment. The water is pretty with some starfish and other creatures, and the caves are neat, but the tide pools up north or down south are much much nicer and quieter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/183annemariep
50,Pretty Cove To Visit,El Matador Beach is tucked down below a dirt parking lot. It is a little challenging to get down to the beach. I would check to see when low tide is to be able to see the most beach area. It's very nice to see tide pools during low tides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whiteshome1
30,Natural beauty,"Considering the name Malibu, we had to take a trip out to see the area and experience it for ourselves. I must say that I found this beach to offer beautiful scenery and views of the area. Great place to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrevorBurchell
40,Interesting rock formations with caves,"This was a nice beach to visit. Not too crowded, which is probably governed by the amount of parking spots (paid). There is a trail and steep steps to get you down to the beach. Some spots we tight and do not allow for two way people traffic. There is enough sand and some large rock formations that have been carved out by the natural elements.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLH-AZ
40,Worth the Climb,"Before heading here, you should know this beach is hard to get to. You have to climb down several flights of stairs and a somewhat precarious stretch of trail on the side of a cliff to get to the water. There are picturesque vistas on the way down, but I would opt for blankets and a thermal bag over beach chairs and a cooler if I was going again. We went around noon on a holiday weekend and it was packed, but we still felt like we had a nice spot to ourselves. We picked a spot near the cliff and luckily so because when the tide started coming in a lot of people closer to the water started losing their stuff. Overall, it was a great place to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeAnn385
50,El Matador,"El Matador State Beach was most definitely worth a stop. You do have pay to park. I may not remember the exact amounts, but I believe it was $3 for the first hour and $10 for the day. Either way, definitely worth the price to spend a little time here. We found the beach very beautiful and unique with its rock formations. There were cave-like spots we could play in. Obviously a very popular place for pictures. Scenery was just spectacular. Beach itself was nothing special. Sand was fine. Not a lot of space for a lot of people. That being said, I would still not pass up the opportunity to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/271danim
50,Lovely place.,Lovely place. But make sure you reach early. They may tape the gate before 30-1hr before the closing time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sakkarapanib
50,Beautiful! Stunning!,"Fantastic picture spot - tide pools - not good for boogie boarding, if that's your interest.Parking in the lot is about $8 for the day. Free parking along PCH, but then you have to run across the street so be very careful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AvidTraveler507
50,"Beautiful Beach, Gets Busy on Summer Weekends","This is a great beach for photos. In fact, the two times I've been there, I've seen multiple professional photo shoots happening (with models). There are beautiful rock formations, a nice stretch of open beach, and amazing ocean views. The beach can get crowded on weekends. There is a small parking lot with a kiosk for printing parking passes. I think the day-rate is $8, and you have to enter the license plate number of your car. This must be to prevent people from passing the parking ticket onto the car that takes their spot when they leave. Also be advised that there is a semi-steep dirt path that leads down to a wooden stairway to the beach. I would not recommend this beach for anyone that has mobility issues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/555donw
50,Lovely,Lovely semi private less known public beach. Prepare for a hike to get down to it. You pay for parking only.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malibugrown
50,"One of my favorite beaches. Picturesque, secluded and quiet",Lots of couples come to this beach for their wedding photos because of the beautiful sandstone rock formations. Also parking is cheap and street parking is free. Stairs required to navigate to get down to the beach so you better be strong if you have an ice chest in tow.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R1399JMpaulb
50,"Unusual beach, worth a drive up the coast","This is a very unusual beach for SoCal and was fun to see. The other reviewers are correct: parking lot is very small! We didn't luck out and get a spot and traveled north on PCH. Fortunately just past the beach we found some (free) street parking. Also warning, there are port-a-potties. The beach itself is small here, for us it was just a hike down the stairs to walk around a look, about 20-30 minutes total was good for us! The hike down to the beach may not be appealing to some.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcinptc
30,Park across the street,"This beach is pretty, and every time I visit there is a photo shoot going on. You need to climb stairs to down to the beach and back up. It is a pretty beach to visit and people watch, not much surf though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lifesabtthejourney
50,One of my favourite photo locations,"Gosh, I took a zillion images there. But be aware: If you want to shoot professionally there (and that means already bringing professional equipment), you do need a permit by the California Film Commission (as on all other public places).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuidoKarp

Be ready to transport yourself to another country when you walk down the steep (and not all stairs) path--you will be greeted by beautiful rock formations and coves, perfect for a real escape from the bustle of LA.

40,Beautiful spot,"wonderful photogenic spot, thanks nature!parts of this beach are very wet - if you want to be dry, stay on the sandy dry side.expect to pay for parking $3 for one hr, $10 for all day... portapotty toilets are available. Practice stretching your bowels and bladder to avoid using them ( you have been warned)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldsurfer3000
40,Great place to visit and take some photos!,"This beach is very beautiful and is a great place to take photos. Parking was easy just pay the $6 and you're off. A short hike down and you're there. Make sure to check tidal charts as the access to caves and Rick formations would be severely limited at high tide. Saw some hanging out for the day with chairs and cookers ect. But not an easy hike down with all of that stuff, take a bottle of water spend an hour or so then move down towards Zuma for easier access. If you have never been, don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Itsadadslife
50,Beautiful and Romantic,"The rock formations and the private feel at ever corner make this an ideal beach to get some alone time in as a couple. We went around sunset so I wouldn't recommend that time of day, because the mountains behind the beach completely cover any views of a sunset. Other than that I loved the rock formations the little caves and the hike back up was great exercise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShahidahN
50,Beautiful Place,Thought this beach and area was very beautiful. I love the rock formations in the water and on beach area and the cliffs were really neat. The tiny parking lot is not near big enough to accommodate everyone and it needs to be expanded. There is a walk (more like hike) down a path to the beach and it's not for the faint of heart or those with issues walking along uneven surfaces.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kloverfield
40,"Lovely, rocky beach","This is a lovely beach in Malibu, with large rock formations which make for great pictures. The beach is accessible by stairs which lead from the parking lot down to the beach in a bit of a circuitous route.

Alot to see and a great beach spot for locals and tourist. A Great place to get away from the Santa monica Crowd although parking can be tough on a crowded day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcthornton1
50,Another stunning beach,We went to this beach and initially were greeted by the park ranger in the car park. Lovely bloke and very passionate. We climbed down onto the beach and took photos with the rock formations which will definitely become postcard photos. Great place to go for a quiet relax in the sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/423hughj
50,One of the best rocky beaches I have visited.,This is one of the best rocky beaches that I have visited. Very good for photography during sunset. I suspect this will be a very good spot for night photography too.To access the beach one has to park the car in the parking adjacent to the beach and then get down the slopes of a hill and use a iron stair to get down to the beach.The sunset view of this beach is awesome!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soumyab784

I headed to the Pacific Coast Hwy for a drive and decided to stop by the El Matador beach. It does't have the whitest sands, but it was the blue water that captivated me. I headed down the steps to see the large rocks and they were great for pictures. I loved how the waves battered the smaller rocks and the waves were periodically strong that day, just perfect for seascape photography. I enjoyed the 2 hours spent there.Parking was $8 for the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VincentN640

50,CLASSIC CALIFORNIA SCENIC COASTAL BLUFFS,"El Matador State Beach is a jewel along Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, just north of Zuma Beach, and the Trancas Canyon Shopping Center. It features 300 foot red clay palisade bluffs, the beach at their base littered with giant rocks sculpted by the sea. It is so picturesque, you're almost guaranteed to see couples taking engagement photos. (Once I was painting on the trail halfway down the bluff and a couple came along and got married. Just them and the minister.)It's a pleasant afternoon wandering in the sand among the huge rocks, some the size of houses! (You need to be in decent physical condition to make the descent, but can still picnic at the top if you want.) This is a gorgeous beach, but if you're looking for pristine white sand, this might not be your thing.... Keep reading, though...You can't see anything from the highway, and you'll miss the state park sign if your attention lapses. Also, the parking lot might be crowded/full if it's a beautiful weekend day. State Park fees apply: there is a machine to purchase a parking pass.Sunset is an excellent time to be there. Bring backpacks with your food & gear; it's a long way back to the car if you forget anything. Also,the only restrooms (porta-potties) are at the top.All this said, El Matador is a stunning location: you descend a moderate trail (Bring a hiking stick or cane if you have any instability) - to wooden stairs at the base of the cliffs, and those lead down to the sand. Explore your way north on the beach; if the tide is low enough, you can get farther to the north through some great caves. Bring snacks and water so you don't have to leave before you're ready.Oh, and you WILL want your camera! One gorgeous afternoon there, I took 300 photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DNGartist
50,Absolutely Incredible!!!,"If you're visiting the Los Angeles area, this is an absolute MUST SEE. However, it is not for the faint at heart. You have to descend down am uneven sandy path to some steps which are relatively steep, down 3 flights until you reach the pot of gold that is El Matador. The last step is a bit of a drop. When I visited a few days ago, the surf was high so it was impossible not to get wet. You have to make your way over some rocks (although there is a slightly less rocky and more sandy path closer to the ocean) if you hang a sharp right off the stairs, whuch brings you to the meat of the beach: boastful rock formations amid a rough surf with a few coves which make for a picturesque scene. To the left off the steps is a nice beach with is equally as scenic with uninterrupted sands and ocean in the backdrop. Highly recommended!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theOneiricTraveler
50,Beautiful and a must see,"I love this beach, incredible views and authentic Cali beauty. Get there to see the sunset. Beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tessalovestravel
50,Amazing Views,"El Matador State Beach has amazing rock formations. Walking down to the beach from the parking lot is not that hard, although it does involve walking down several steps. The place is serene and picturesque. There were many professional photo shoots going on when we visited and there was a painting class in progress on the beach - which in other words means the breathtaking views are attracting artists as well. Not crowded but not secluded either. Access to parking lot is very very easy from the highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuccessMatters
50,Amazing whale watching,Visited in March and we were able to see the whale migration. Beautiful place to spend an afternoon and wait for sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMFANDME
50,Breathtaking views!,"I was in awe of the picturesque beauty of this beach! The sand, the water the rocks, they were simply gorgeous. The beach wasn't crowded at all and was a great place to bring a packed lunch and enjoy the crashing waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763bethb
40,Great afternoon el matador beach,This was a wonderful visit and beautiful setting this afternoon with mid 70 temps. Be careful with long path down the since many places have heavy erosion. Looks like a great spot for youth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanP175
50,Beautiful Sunset!,I got there around 4.30pm and still have time to laying under beautiful sunshine til sunset. Nice everyone should visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/honey_hazeThailand
50,Get here!,"The beach is awesome with all these rocks. It's a great picturesque beach. You can explore the rocks formation/small caverns. If you want to see a different beach, go! A lot of stairs, maybe not recommended for everyone but the view from the parking lot is also incredible. Small parking lot. You can't park on the highway, I got a warning!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/484rb
40,"Unique beach, but get there early!","Loved this beach and the rocks along the coastline! After a short hike down the side of the cliff you're greeted by a picturesque, but small, beach. From the cliff's wall to the water was maybe 50ft and shrinking when we arrived, so I can see how on a weekend or holiday you may not find much room of you don't get there early!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RodgersWithaD
50,Good Beach feels secluded!,I feel like this is one of the most secluded public beaches in malibu. The rock formations are really cool for taking pictures. And i heard sometimes the waves get good down here for surfing...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanes526
50,YES!! GET HERE & FORGET ABOUT PARADISE COVE!!,"Well...after the ""average"" and possibly costly visit to Paradise Cove Pier & beach (not for me), I explored beaches NORTH of it and found THIS BEACH!!What a GREAT FIND... Park in the lot (nominal fee). Walk down the path. It's uneven and can be a little unstable. I'm 65 and made it down. and I saw 2 girls holding their grandmothers hands to guide HER down & she looked in her 80's!! But, flip-flops & sandals may NOT be good unless you're 21 and FIT!.But got to the bottom and was SO HAPPY to see this place. Wonderful beach. And the rocks to the RIGHT were just the BEST...For a long stay, bring water/drinks & food. It was January 2016 and the cool water felt SO GOOD to walk in. LUCKY to live in So. California!I't nice to have a review that ony has to say....""GO HERE AND ENJOY THE BEST CHOICE YOU COULD MAKE!!""My pictures are below...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lagreek1
50,Absolutely beautiful,"Nice beach with beautiful rock formations. Great place to spend an afternoon picnicing and lying in the sun. Lots of steps to get down to the water, but definitely worth the trek. Be aware of the tide times as a lot of the beach goes underwater at high time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tasteslikehappy
50,Beautiful!,The beach was beautiful but hard to get to. A lot of steep stairs and part of the trail to the beach was starting to wash away. It was worth the trip down to see the beach. Just be prepared to climb stairs and walk on a rocky beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reeselmt
50,Love Malibu!,This beach is gorgeous! Parking can be hard to find and there are lots of stairs to climb.The view is one of the best. You can beat a Malibu view! The beach is nice and great for photography!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderlustSydney123
40,"Beautiful place, a different kind of beach...","El Matador State Beach is a beautiful place but it is different than other beaches. This beach is further north and is cut out of the rocks and cliffs. It's not a huge beach and you wouldn't go here to swim or surf, but it's really cool to see the rock formations and how the ocean has smoothed and cut it's way through. There are some nifty (small) caves and lots of birds. Be prepared for a serious climb down and back up on the steep stairs. Also, these steps are worn down by the sand and all the foot traffic. If you have big feet you may find yourself slipping a bit (I did!). Also, the trail down was in bad shape due to the recent big storms, heavy rain and wind. I'm hoping they'll repair this because it was literally quite dangerous. If you're in the area, definitely plan to stop. Pay the parking fee at the top, local law enforcement does check!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulaM8871ZO
50,Most Amazing Beach,Words cannot even begin to express how amazing this beach is. The hike down to this beach alone would keep most people away from here. You need to be in relatively good shape to be able to traverse the stairs own to the beach. It's a long tough haul but well worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DisneyF4
50,Beautiful,"One of the prettiest beaches I have been to, although not the place you'd go for a tan. You're going to want to see this and explore the rocks and the shoreline. Awesome way to spend an afternoon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshh784
40,Worth the effort to climb the steps to reach the beach,A lovely beach on Pacific Coast highway. We reached here early morning. It was scenic and he entire stretch is awesome. It's fun family joint. It also has great photo opp that one could exploreOne could just laze around with a book and enjoy he sound of gushing waves. Must visitWord of caution : the stairs to reach down the beach could pose difficulty for some people and senior citizen as they are steep,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/montoojain
40,Sea stacks and golden sandstone cliffs line the shore,"We chose El Matador State Beach park because it was a more off-the-beaten-path location along the Malibu coast. There's a steep hilly, dry embankment that leads to steep wooden steps. You must be nimble and have good balance. Gorgeously blue sea and sky blended together as flocks of pelicans flew past, dive bombing into the surf before and emerging with strong beaks full of salty breakfast. We watched lazily from a cliff top on the way down, cross-legged on our perch. We spent a few lovely hours leaving footprints along the fine golden sand shoreline, chasing waves, exploring little caves. We watched sand pipers scurry in and out with the tide, picking for food and listened to the waves crashing around hollowed out arches and sea stacks. Go early in the morning to avoid tourists and meet real locals. That's what we did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Veritas-of-Avalon
50,Malibu Mornings...,Wonderful beach. Parking was easy and uber cheap. Good for intimate moments when you're with someone. Especially on one of the cliffs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B6166ENrobertb
50,Stunning!,"I ran across this beach from a post on Instagram, but it took me a couple of years to finally make it out there. Boy am I glad I did! This place is beautiful and very unique! We went just before sunset and there weren't a lot of people. Apparently there are a lot of photo shoots at this location. This beach is really something you should go out of your way to see! Beware: PARKING! We found a spot close to the beach, but there are cops giving tickets all day long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spendacone
50,Beautiful!,Definitely worth a visit! Remember to pack some food and a beach towel and you're good to go. Lovely views in a reasonably secluded spot depending on time of the day/year,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nkfeng
50,Beautiful a must stop along PCH,We really enjoyed taking pictures at El Matador State Beach. It is a must stop along Pacific Coast Highway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clandry2015
50,Photographers delight,We visited here at sunset. If the place is beautiful in the day it's amazing at Sunset. We had had to park across the street and the trek down would was a little rough (don't attempt if you have any walking or balance issues) but it's fine for most people. This is totally worth a drive and if you are a photographer it's a must!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/masongal
50,Amazing,"Although this is a little bit of a drive from Los Angeles, it's so well worth it. This beach is amazing. It's truly a hidden gym. It has a long nice beach, with rock cliffs which makes for beautiful scenery. There's parking available for 8$ a day, or you can park along the road and walk down to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soheil_Travelling
50,Great nature,This beach is a pure nature and has great sight seeing of the ocean and some amazing rocks. If the weather is sunny the view would be even better. You can also climb the rocks to have a better view. But it is not recommended due to safety reasons.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kianae2014
50,Breathtaking,"An absolute must if you are in the Malibu Area, I was there at Sunset and so worth the trek down. There is a trail and stairs to get to the beach. So worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lyssaf26
50,Great sunset views,"This place is stunning. The views, especially during sunset, are breathtaking. It is very romantic. I highly recommend going here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agokhfeld
50,Amazing Beach!,"The cliffs and rock formations are stunning. It's a great beach to go exploring and relax. The hike down can be steep for some, but is totally worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilyrkillian
50,"Caves, Caverns and Sea Life","It's a bit challenging to get there (moderate downhill walk with stairs) however, we'll worth it! The cliffs are breathtaking views abound and it feels like you're inside a beautiful postcard. Go when tide is lower so you can access the caves, Caverns and go under the rock tunnel. Climb, explore and be prepared to take tons of pictures. We spent 2 hours exploring, climbing and just enjoying the beauty. The cliffs are weathered with so many beautiful designs from wind and waves it's just breathtaking. The weather was perfect we were there around 3pm the light was just amazing we took so many pictures we will enjoy the memories we made that day for a lifetime. Truly one of daughters favorite stops to just run, climb, learn and explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosieh785
50,Stunning beach!,The beach is simply outstanding. You cannot belive your very eyes. You are able to see California in all its beautifulness.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andrea_Sciarrone
50,Stunning views,"Steep gravel path mixed with stairway, but worth the trip for incredible views. Great spot for watching sunset or taking photos. Saw several professional photo shoots during our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ncuff01
50,Beautiful views!,Amazing views and a photographer's dream. Make sure you know when low and high tide is. A must visit if you're in the area for sure and plan for sunset of possible!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferg827
50,Little piece of heaven,"Stunning beach. Lots of stairs. Lots of bikini photo sessions. The natural formation is very pretty but it does get very busy. There are areas you have to be careful because of the rocks but it is really a beautiful walk with stunning views. The ocean is clean but due to a high tide it was difficult to swim in but the waves were fun to jump in. Make sure you go to the gym and get a ""pre-tan"" before you visit this beach. The people watching is phenomenal and there is lots of eye candy to look at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KamiK747
50,Photographer's Dream,"I didn't have time to check out the other beaches that are part of Robert H. Meyer State Beach (La Piedra and El Pescador) for comparison, but this was definitely worth the stop. Parking is quite limited and if you have to park up on the road (no cost, but also limited) be aware of your safety, especially if you have small children as you will be parking on the side of a multilane highway. This section of the road is also on a hill, making it challenging to parallel park. The shoulder is also pretty narrow so even if you're parked as far as possible off the road, your open car door will be on the highway.The stairs down to the beach are plentiful (remember you're going to have to walk back up them!), but worth it. No food or drink are available on site, however there are washrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnAnotherJourney
50,Beautiful!,"Definitely not a hidden gem, as it was packed when we visited on a sunny day in November. Great beach though, with arches, caves breaking waves. Lots of little spots for a semi-private picnic or sunbathing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmGlasbey
40,"Good, if you can climb stairs","This is a nice beach for a walk and to admire rock formations, but there really isn't anything else here, like cafes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambersea
40,Pretty beach near Malibu,This is a lovely beach with some fun rock formations. It's a bit of a hike down (and back up!) but those in good shape should be fine. Go at low tide; you'll get more beach to explore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dax892
50,Best part of our Malibu visit,"This place was amazing and so unique. I have never seen the west coast or Pacific Ocean before so this was honestly just incredible.Anyone interested in photography, this is a wonderful location.The parking is $8 for the day.For anyone who may not be the best in shape-- The small hiking trail is steep with no hand rails and there are several stairs... If you can handle that, make it a point to stop here. It is the most unique part of that drive up the pacific coast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meghanm672
50,Great Beach area with plenty of scenery!,El Matador is a very neat place. The rocks and formations make this area different than other places along the coast. It was fun to climb and navigate on the rocks as the water is crashing nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troym960
50,Beautiful Rocky Beach in Malibu,"I was studying in Pepperdine 13 years ago, but I've never been to this beach once, even though it's only 15 miles away from the campus. I was looking for something to do in LA on this hot late October weekend, and accidentally spot this beach on Trip Advisor. How could I have missed it after living in Southern CA for such a long time. However, this is something exciting about Southern CA, you can never claim that you've known it so well, because you will be surprised from time to time. The beach is gorgeous because of all the amazingly shaped rocks. There is this rock, in the attached picture 3, most people think it's like an elephant, but I'm amused that I actually saw the King Kong chasing the boat when the people were leaving the island, it feels so lonely as the sun goes down behind it. Picture 4 is like a bull, rushing toward the endless waves. I suddenly realized why the beach is called El Matador. Another thing that's amazing is the water, it's warm, unlike the OC beaches!!! I hope it's not just that day. It's a picture-perfect place for family portrait and wedding pictures. We should've stayed for the sunset. This beach is worth coming for another day-trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmbS_13
50,The best beach in So Cal,"What feels like it was once a good kept secret is, alas, no more. But this beach really is great-- great tide-pooling, easy access, simple beach. This is a don't miss it beach. Wonderful at sunset as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAlysonZ
50,Sublime destination,"This is one of the most spectacular places on the planet. Come her month after month for ever changing view of the pacific. Watch sunsets, moonrises here, it is the spot to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/834emada
50,Nice views!,You won't be able to see the Sunrise in this beach as they open it after 8:00 am however you will be able to have a nice morning taking sunbaths at the sand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eapelaez80
50,I love the place and its caves,Went there for a day trip on a Tuesday. It felt safe and peaceful. Caves are fun to explore and hang out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mayeta1
50,First time,This was a very nice view of the coast bit of a walk down but worth it..Very nice rocks and blue water to see up close,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffj801
40,Beautiful Beach!,"Trying to go somewhere other that Venice and Santa Monica we ended up at El Matador after reading reviews, we were pleasantly surprise! Beautiful Beach, the water was cleaner and warmer than Venice Beach and Santa Monica, it is a Beautiful location to take pictures, you see a lot of couples and pregnant women with their photographers, the only down side is the parking, very few spaces to park and if you just leave your car on the PCH you will get a ticket as we did! :( Also, there are two sets of stairs to go down to the beach, that could be hard for some people. Other than that I totally recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NFA05
50,Excellent SoCal Beach,"Fantastic views from upper cliff, huge hike to get down to the beach, gorgeous coast views and full SoCal beach experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94121travel
50,Good beach,Awesome beach but busy on a Saturday. Best to check the tides to make sure you are there at low tide so there is more beach which makes it feel less crowded,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickpohl
50,Absolutely Beautiful,This was by far my favorite place visited on our California trip. It has some of the most breathtaking views. The tide was up while we were there so it was quite the experience on the beach area. The rock formations offer outstanding spots for photographs to be taken. The waves were up high so it was fun to take in the waves while trying to get to the next rock formation. I enjoyed every moment we spent here. A must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/258donnac
40,Awesome place for pictures,I went there specifically to take pictures. There isn't much of a beach but the landscape is beautiful. There is a dirt parking lot that you need to pay. It is pretty small so finding a space may be difficult in the summer. You have to take an uneven steep dirt path and then stairs to get to the beach but once you get there it's very picturesque. If you are out of shape getting back up to the parking lot can get you winded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3969GZcharless
50,One of the Most Beautiful Beaches in California,"This is one of the most beautiful beaches in California. There are several large rock formations that sit along the beach. Bring your camera - there are so many amazing photo ops. This is also a great place to get a portrait taken.Beware, the walk down from the parking lot is not wheelchair accessible and can be difficult for people who are not stable on their feet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SirTravelLover
50,Simplistic Natural Beauty,"If you are driving highway 1 along the West Coast, I beg you to stop here. This was a last minute decision to stop here, but was exactly what I sat out to experience. The natural beauty is astounding! There is an $8.00 parking fee if you use their lot and a bit of a hike, but is worth every effort!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ansilva12
50,Ocean and stone beauty,"This is a stunningly interesting beach. Though the beach area is small, there are plenty of places to place a towel and sit and view these amazing stones that pop out of the water. We visited during the week and it was pretty empty which added to the beauty of the place. Great for photo ops too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0libbyt
10,Awful! Disgusting!,"Graffiti on cliffs, steep staircases not for young children, and flies everywhere. How this stretch was rated so highly is beyond comprehension to me! Zuma down the road is more palatable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffreyW_Wu
50,Big Sur-style Cliffs plus Caves to Explore,"El Matador is one of Malibu's most visually stunning settings, but the cliff is rather high, so beach must be reached by a steep set of stairs. (Word has it the county has a plan in the works for an easier footpath route.) Once you reach the sand, you'll find hidden coves, tiny caves, and all sorts of tide pool creatures. Very busy on weekends and holidays, with very limited parking in lot. Dreamy on a misty weekday morning or sunset hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuRoo
50,The best beach,"While on my trip to California between Aug 13-Aug 14, I had the pleasure of visiting El Matador State Beach, Venice Beach, and Santa Monica. I googled top beaches of Southern California and El Matador State Beach was ranked as the top 10 beaches, so i had to check it out myself. The beach was exactly how the pictures show it as. There is parking along the highway, or you can pay for self-parkingin the parking lot of the beach. The walk to the beach is a stunning view, walk down several sets of stairs. If you continue to walk along the beach, underneath all the rocks, towards the end you will a hidden cave which had a breath-taking view of the ocean. The one thing that stood out about the beach were the locals, they are very prideful of their beach and there were a group of guys sitting next to us who were smoking a cigarette and one of the locals told him to stop smoking because it'll kill their animals. I thought it was awesome that somebody stood up for their home. LOVED THIS BEACH, will definitely be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marisolr241
50,Fantastic photo spot,"Not all beaches are the same, and El Matador beach is famous in its own rights, having seen its share of photoshoots and celebrities. Sports Illustrated shoots there as well as many others. It's absolutely worth the time to go there, but use caution with the stairs!My daughter was prepared and shot her senior pictures there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phdedieu
40,Beautiful beach,"Beautiful beach. Not mobbed but not secluded either. Lots of areas to explore, but the actual beach is prey near row at high tide. Parking lot is small, but we parked along the highway without problems. Traffic is moving quickly on the four lane highway so if I had small kids I would try to park so as not to cross the highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeuTeam
50,Lots of stairs,"This beach is really beautiful. I didn't even know it was there. You have to go up and down a lot of stairs. I just tlooked from the top. It is worth seeing. Next time, I'm going to do the stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Putzcat
50,Beautiful Beach!,"Beautiful beach, great waves, beautiful scenery, cool water --> Perfect recipe for a hot summer day! The beach is in Malibu so it was crowded and it took time to get there, mostly because of traffic jam. However, it worth the time.There is a small parking lot after you turn into the state beach but it is always full. There are more parking along the street. Be aware of the no parking signs or you may get tickets from traffic police officer. I especially loved the sand (so smooth) and the beautiful waves. The kids had a lot of fun exploring the caves, challenging the big waves, digging tunnels in the sand, making natural bath tubes. There were so much things you could do. Love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IheartZephyr
50,Gorgeous,This is one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. No wonder so many photoshoots are being held here. It's a little bit colder when you go when the sun is setting but the view won't be disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynnV94
50,A truly gorgeous place...,"This beach is breathtakingly beautiful! Per Trip Advisor, I visited this beach in July and highly recommend...with a few disclaimers. First, parking is a bit tough and you must pay for it. I lucked into a spot, but parking is tight. The climb down to the beach is tremendously steep and a bit treacherous. There are many steps as well. If you have any trouble walking or with steps, this is not the climb for you. For everyone else, it's worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katies94
50,Beautiful Beach,"Get here early as it fills up quick, the views are amazing and I could wave watch all day, today was a sunny, breezy, and not to hot and the waves and views were amazing. It was l little hard to find, but worth the search. The wave crashed today over the rocks creating some amazing photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharieN_13
40,Nice beach that is a little hard to reach,"On our last day in California we headed from Westwood down the PCH to this state park. We went on a Sunday morning, arriving around 9 am. There were still a good number of parking spaces. By time we left there were cars lining up looking for spaces. However, I believe you are permitted to park across the PCH and walk in. The entrance is close to the road.The park cost $8. $7 for seniors, to print a slip for your dashboard. There is a collection of about 6 porta-potties, but no other facilities or even water.There are no signs or maps that I could find but just followed the well worn path to the left which leads down a heavily eroded path. Wear shoes. This path leads to another level with a set of steep stairs leading the to beach. There is a long drop to the beach from the last step so be careful. This beach is impossible for anyone with mobility issues or wheelchairs to reach.There was a marine layer creating cloudy conditions but the beach was still beautiful. There was a string of young women getting their picture under the famous rock arch. We also stumbled upon a topless photo shoot, but I missed most of it--Shoot. There were lots of families lounging and enjoying the water. The total beach area is not that long so it doesn't take long to see it all.After about an hour of strolling we returned to our car glad we made the visit. On a side note, when leaving instead of turning right back to Malibu we went left and then onto Decker Canyon Road for a twisty fun drive back to CA 101. It offers totally different views and a different ecosystem from the beach. Highly recommended if you like to drive on mountainous twisting roads.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brent-RN
50,Beautiful hidden place,"beautiful secluded beach. if you didn't know this hidden secret existed, you'd probably just drive by on PCH1. this is a must stop/visit.Beautiful beaches with large rock formations and cave type passages you can walk thru/under. Excellent backdrop for photography.If low tide, you can wander a tad further north to some more hidden secluded beaches.Pay the $8 parking fee. if you take the chance parking up top on the highway thats a gamble with getting a parking ticket.It is a hike down. quite steep too. be safe. help elderly down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/digdeep0169
50,Fantastic beach with rocks,I wanted to try out some long exposure photography and lot of folks here on TripAdvisor suggested this beach. I was looking for a beach with rocks / pilings so that I could set focus on that.This beach is just awesome as it is just littered with rocks which leads to beautiful scenes around sunset.Parking is available near the beach. Parking is on the cliff so you park and climb down to the beach. There are a couple of benches near the parking lot and the view from there is also very good.We have been to this beach twice and it is beautiful during sunset. Am not sure if one can be there for sunrise as it opens around 8AM.We will try to visit the beach again in October when the sun would actually set behind the giant rocks on the beach for a nice picture.Just check the tide chart before going there - http://tides.willyweather.com/ca/los-angeles-county/el-matador-state-beach.html. I always do that so that the waves are not hitting the cliff as that would leave less room for me to take pictures.Here are some of the pictures we took during our 2 visits - https://flic.kr/s/aHskfCmN14,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arnkrishn
50,Beautiful beach,"This beach is beautiful, especially for those of us who are not used to seeing beaches with rock formations. There were lots of people there taking pictures, including some professionals. Be prepared to hike down and back up some moderate terrain to get to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLeahy2015
40,Costal Caves and Rock Formations,"Cool caves and rock formations. Parking is difficult in the later part of the day but if you can manage, this is an interesting place to spend some time in nature. If you are planning to bring things with you to the beach, it is kind of a long walk down a mildly treacherous path, so I recommend leaving the cooler at the car. Quite an adventure though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steevvoh
40,"Amazing, but a bit of a hike in & out.","This beach is like a sic-fi movie set. Amazing, towering rock formations. I'm sure it would be used as a movie set (like all the neighboring beaches) too - except for the fact that the pathway getting down & back up from Matador is steep and a bit challenging for those with bad ankles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smokeythecat
50,One of the most beautiful beaches in Malibu.,"Beach Overview: El Matador is the most beautiful of the three beaches (El Pescador, La Piedra, El Matador) that make up this section of the Malibu coast. The scenic beauty is enough that every time I have been there, there has been a photo shoot of some kind going on in the secluded cove in between the two main portions of the beach. El Matador is also the most crowded of the three beaches, but if you get there early (9-10) you will likely have the beach almost to yourself for an hour or so, until the crowds kick in (and they do).Suitable for: Almost everyone. For the mobility impaired , it will be a challenge climbing down to the beach. It is NOT wheelchair accessible. Otherwise, I would recommend this beach for anyone.Parking: Parking lot is small and like others have said, costs $8 at an automated machine that accepts cash and credit cards. Free parking is available on the road, across the street, if you feel like playing Frogger on the PCH (parking on the PCH, beach side is forbidden, and could result in a ticket, unless you go up about a quarter mile).Getting to the down to the beach: This beach is not stroller friendly. Trail is combination of stairs and partially eroded path. Hold the hands of your little ones as there are no railings along the path, and the drop is steep. It is not a bad climb though. La Piedra is probably the worst.Facilities: Porta Potties are located at the parking lot, high above the beach ‚Äì make sure you go before descending to the beach. There are a decent number, so finding one open is never a problem. No changing rooms; however there is one larger wheelchair accessible porta potty that can serve as one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhiteZB
50,Beautiful beach,"Beautiful beach, it's great for shoots or different events. I love the caves on the water and the view is amazing. Definitely a must when in Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Missellen1
50,A gem of a hidden spot in L.A.,As someone who's lived in Los Angeles for 20+ years I'm surprised I've just discovered this coveted beautiful spot recently. I've taken my family from out of town there and it seems like everyone really enjoy it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beaxplorer
50,Awesome beach!,"This is a great beach. Parking is $8. It's a little bit of hike down to the beach on dirt and stairs but so worth it! The ""caves"" are cool for kids and there are little tide pools! We loved it here!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TXRanney76
40,Intricate Rock Formations,"It's a beautiful beach, smaller than expected, but the rock formations are beautiful. The water was a good temp, a little too seaweed filled, but great for going in overall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stroodel93
40,not your typical beach experience.,very unique beach with nice beautiful rock formations...you will run into numerous photoshoots here. swimming would be ok here but be careful for rocks. the beach doesn't get overcrowded since there is limited parking. $8 for parking but the machine was out of order when we went.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baopham316
50,Probably the best scenic beach in Southern California,Great swimming but you will probably swim into a lot of kelp. There are very nice rock formations and a sea cave at the West end of the beach. A lifeguard patrols infrequently and there are a few rocks in the water to watch for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom734
50,Great place to stop along coast!,Beautiful and great place to see the beach and rocks! Good stop along pacific coast highway! Day was a little overcast but still beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgirlie24
40,Best Place to view sunset in Malibu,It is a secluded beach and not many people know about it. It is probable the best place to view the sunset in Malibu. A must visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJS227
50,Beautiful slice of the California Coast,"Beautiful beach along Malibu's north shore, with caves to explore and relatively calm water for boogie boarding. It tends to get busier later in the day, so arrive early (before 10 a.m.) to try to snag one of the designated parking spots. Otherwise, you park on the street, on the Pacific Coast Highway. To access the beach, you need to go down a somewhat steep path and about 60 - 70 steps on a narrow staircase. But it's well worth the trouble!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bomnycsfo
40,Scenic beach with interesting rock formations,"the kids liked to run through the ""cave"" in between the swells. the beach started getting crowded with couples and not just families so we left by mid afternoon. life guard not always on duty so swim at your own risk. worth checking out at low tide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/157madeleined
50,Amazing place to climb on the rocks and get great pictures,"We were there about 11 a.m. on a weekday and there were about 2 dozen people there. It was definitely getting busier as time went by. Great picture-taking amongst the huge rocks and crashing surf. We drove about 1 1/2 hours north and this was the only spot we found worth stopping to climb the rocks. Lots of other areas for surfing or just enjoying the beach but were very very busy, even on a weekday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheilaoc
50,Amazing view,"This is an amazing beach , take pictures or just seat and relax, or play with the kids the view is breath taking , I recommend to visit if you are planning to go to CA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ritajalca
50,El Matador Beach in Malibu,Very beautiful beach with gorgeous rock cliffs all around. A bit of a climb down the dirt trail and steps but go slow and you will be fine and is worth getting to the beach.There is a self pay parking fee if you park in the parking lot (and the rangers do come around often to see if you have the parking ticket on your dashboard) or you can park for free along the PCH.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/268se
30,Very nice natural beach,"My family enjoyed the beach more than I did. We were unfortunately there during June gloom, so the weather was a little chilly and we were experiencing a light mist of rain throughout the morning. We were visiting on a weekend, so we arrived early (9 AM ish) and there was plenty of parking. The cost of the parking was $8. There's a machine you pay that accepts cash and credit cards and you put the receipt in your windshield. The hike down to the beach can be challenging for some, but the views are wonderful. There are some great rock formations to see and explore. Unfortunately there was some graffiti on some of the steps and rocks that was pretty disappointing. I was surprised someone would deface such a beautiful place. Probably not the best place to swim as well due to the rocks, but, again, wonderful scenery. Facilities are lacking a bit as well as they only have port-a-potties and no showers to rinse off the sand. I'm glad I saw it once, but probably would not put in the effort to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/661edq
50,Beautiful Natural Beach Location,Matador is a beautiful beach. Really cool rock formations make for terrific photographic opportunities. Be careful with the kids I've stumbled upon a nudist shoot before!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smackie66
40,One of Malibu's Best,"The Skinny-Parking: small dirt lot, more parking on the highwayFee: $8Sand: softWater: pretty clear this far northShade: not much, bring your ownBathrooms: porto pottiesFood: none for saleThis is a small but delightful beach located 23 miles North of Santa Monica. The parking lot is at the top of the bluff and there is a dirt path and stairs to negotiate your way down to the beach. My 72yr old Uncle struggled going down and coming back up so be advised it is not easy. The views are terrific and the water was cold. I love the rock formations that will give young children a fabulous natural playground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melobeam
40,Great place to photograph even during June gloom,"I visited the beach with my camera after seeing some of the amazing pictures of it online. If you want to photograph the beach and rocks I would recommend arriving before 10 AM when most people show up. It is a nice private place and offers incredible views. Getting to the beach requires A bit of hiking and dissent down several flights of stairs. It would be tough for elderly or handicapped people to get there. However, I am glad I went because the scenery is epic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMLove226
30,Great beach,WARNING. Good chance your car will be broken into. While you enjoy yourself at the bottom of the bluff they are taking your stuff up at the top where you park. Locking your car does no good. Great beach but do not have any valuables in car,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malibugalMalibu_Ca_
50,Very nice Beach!!,"Climb down the 150 foot staircase to the beach and your in for a real special place and incredible experience. Its different from other So Cal Beach experiences. I took my boys with me and played in the surf and enjoyed body surfing. there are alot of rocky outcrops that made for a real fun adventure. We enjoyed looking for finding Crabs in the rocks and cliff edges, also shells and interesting little critters in the sand, we did happen upon a dead seal cub ( poor guy). Wonderful place, could be romantic too. We had no problems parking. Not too many people either. there was a professional photo shoot while we were there.( no problem though ) and many people taking selfies amongst the unique and picturesque backdrops",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaronn410
20,Crowded,The scenery was beautiful. But the beach was so crowded and dirty it was disgusting. Hoards of people everywhere. Would never recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/turczyns15
40,An amazing place,"An amazing place, we've been to several beaches in Southern California, but this beach is way different. The rock formations are amazing, so glad we took the time to visit. A photo shoot on the beach while we were there, but otherwise it was pretty deserted. I expect that's not the case on weekends and holidays, but was glad that we had to beach mostly to ourselves. There is a fee for parking, and a fair amount of steps down to the beach but we did feel happy that we took the time to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palmercase
20,Overrated,Title says it all - Hollywood led me to believe this was a romantic beach. No nookie with all the kids around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P-Dawgy-Dawg
40,Cool spot,Very picturesque! We spent an hour or so touring the beach. It was a it windy and cool so no swimming. We took some great pictures and loved stopping here. Great for tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffMc807
40,Get Away Spot,Beautiful spot off the beaten path. Great place to sit quietly. Beautiful picture spot. Go in the AM for a particularly peaceful experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisA738
50,get there before noon,"Loved the beach! I advise getting there on the early side (before noon) to ensure a good parking spot. the views are spectacular and the rock formations are super cool. it's a really neat place to walk around and explore, ducking into different little caves and climbing on rocks. This was definitely a very memorable stop on our road trip and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is traveling through the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ally0ops
40,Spectacular!,"A great place to stop whilst driving the Pacific Coast Highway - the sand is fine, the sea clear and the little rock formations make for great pictures as the tide swirls amongst them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheMcGonigals
40,Pretty but not that amazing,We came here after reading reviews and we were disappointed. It's just like any other beach. Secluded yes but not worth the drive. It was super windy when we came and cold. Maybe it's better in the summer but I wouldn't make the drive. Nice hike down but that's about it. Might as well just go to a beach closer to our hotel- same experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happybbbb
50,Beautiful and relaxing,Clean beach with fantastic views and scenery. Wish I had more time to spend the entire day there. Scenic drive to get there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_VictoriaRob88
50,Beautiful!,"Little bit of a hike down but really not bad. Make sure you're prepared to go down, and have everything with you so you don't have the hike up & down. Lovely rock formations but still plenty of sand to enjoy frisbee, catch, whatever. You get to see plenty of tidal life when the water is low if you investigate the rocks. Didn't care for the charge to park, but if you stay the day it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/defiantone
50,An oasis of natural beauty not far from the big city,"This beach was just what the doctor ordered after 3 days in Disneyland. The family loved it - natural, quiet, tide pools, rock formations, etc. The antithesis of Santa Monica beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tizmania
50,Take a camera!,"Some of the most beautiful sights at El Matador were quite hard to find as you had to almost hike down the hills.. but once you reach the beach scenery, the views are astonishing. I'd definitely recommend taking a camera as all i had was my iPhone and i wish i took some better photos. Definitely put aside around an hour to chill here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6518KPgeorgeb
50,Very nice,"Great place to pull off Pacific Coast Highway and take a stroll. Very pretty. There were several areas available for day parking. Great place to stop and take pictures. The beach was not crowded at all, very nice place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveleyesok
40,Good spot for photos,There is a unique rock formation at this beach which makes a nice backdrop for photos. Best to go at low tide. We also saw a baby seal sunning on a rock. There is a fee to park in the lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/family0f6traveler
50,So beautiful and pleasant,This is one of the most beautiful and quiet beaches around LA. The scenery is gorgeous and it is quite clean. The beach is small but it is not crowded and the sound of waves drown all the noise so it is a great place just to go and relax. Excellent for couples but good for friends as well.Just know that the public temporary bathroom is not so clean so just be warned.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pureumk
50,Beautiful gem,"This beach was amazing! Beautiful rock formations, on site parking (for a small fee) or park on the road and walk down. Very quiet and if you're lucky you'll see whales and dolphins! Only negative is the outhouses smell so bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaL693
20,Choose another beach,"My husband and I were looking for a nice beach north of LA where we could walk/hike & take in the scenery. We are not from the area & based on the trip advisor reviews, we chose El Matador. While the water splashing against the rocks are pretty, the beach itself was crowded & not big at all. We walked as far as we could and round trip was less than a mile. For a state park, requiring a $8 parking fee, I expected the facilities to be maintained. However, both the restroom facilities (Porta potties) were completely full of toilet paper and had not been emptied in quite some time. Yuck! All in all, I would choose another spot along the coast. This one was disappointing. :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/66amyb66
50,Best beach in Malibu,LA has various beaches and this one is spectacular and adventurous. A good scenic spot for beautiful pictures. Do not miss to take the camera with you. Kids will definitely love the place as they can play hide and seek in the cliffs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/896gayathrin
50,You must go,"If you only have 1 hour to spend in Malibu go here! You pay for parking and walk down a crazy Hill and some stairs but it's remarkable. The caves, the boulders, the birds... So amazing. It's hard to describe the beauty. Make time to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gtrochelman
50,Cool beach!,My mother and I stopped here because I had seen some pictures of the beautiful rock formations. This beach was prettier than the pictures. We went around sunset. It was a warm day and we were able to get many beautiful pictures of the rock formations. Well worth the visit if you like cool places. Parking fee was $8 at a machine and we saw a ranger checking on cars to make sure that they had a ticket as we were leaving. some cars did not pay the parking fee and received a ticket from the ranger. Thankfully we had paid for our ticket and didn't have to worry about such things.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/66bobcat
50,Beautiful Beach,Beautiful beach to just sit and enjoy the ocean and rocks. Went on a cool day and still Very highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KERRIAU
40,Get There Early,"Near Primative small CA State provided parking lot well above beach on dirt drive from PCH. Pay parking machine crude, unruly and tortuous to operate (8). So get there early and have a CA State park pass on your dash. Beyond that, the long well-worn staircase takes you to the most dramatic of beaches. Off-shore kelp beds. Big surf rolls out onto the rocky coastline punctuated with towering rock formations. Walk westward (right from base of staircase) along beach. Natural tunnels allow passage out about 1/4 mile. It's a small beach. Geology indicates a major rock formation once protruded directly south from here into the ocean. Now eroded and degraded beautiful remnants remain. Beach stones are of all size. shapes, colors and compositon.Again, get there early. The locals bring beach gear and set up camp in special shaded spots and cliff caves. Bring your frisbee, water and sunscreen. The water is fridgid and rocks make for dangerous surf zones. No lifeguard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReddiTugo
50,Gorgeous beach with rock formations!,"This is a beautiful beach in itself. It has great rock formations coming off of the cliffs going into the water. In the rock formations, there are little tunnels that the waves crash into and through. This is a really awesome beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jvalliant
40,Tunnels and More,"I used a program to determine where a nice spot near Malibu for a sunset photo would be and El Matador fit the bill. A beach with a cliff to walk down and rocks in the water. Funny, the girlfriend found that place as well through reviews. Well, it was crowded with photographers and models or engagement photo shoots. However, it was nice and the tunnels during low tide were accessible. Make sure you go during low tide. Dolphins swam by and there were the usual water fowl. Nice but crowded on a Saturday evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scigris
40,Lots of steps to access beach,"This is definitely a beautiful beach and well worth visiting, however you need to be aware of the trail and large amount of steps you have to take in order to reach it. We saw several sets of people walk towards the descent and then see how hard it was to get there (1 had a cane and another had high heels on) and then turn around and go back to their cars.There is a small parking lot at the top that requires $8 per car... and we saw the park people come around and ticket those that had not paid... so word to the wise. And the only bathrooms are 2 port a potties at the top.Once you get down to the beach it is just beautiful... clean sand, rock formations and cave areas. Fabulous place to take pictures. I actually saw whales from the beach (probably several miles out)... definitely worth going to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elphie1162
50,Great beach for walking,This is my favorite beach in Malibu for exploring. Many stairs to get down to the beach but well worth it. Bring your camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K2075BPmichaelr
50,The most beautiful place On earth,The view is so beautiful! I'd like to go back!! Loved it!!! Parking was 8$ I thought it was expensive but when I saw the beach I thought it was totally worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andreitausa
40,Go At Sunset,"If you are in Malibu (e.g., visiting the Getty Villa, Pepperdine or other beaches), it is definitely worthwhile to stop by El Matador Beach to take some great pictures; particularly at sunset. Cool rock formations. $8 to park in the small parking lot; free parking a little farther away on Pacific Coast Highway. Be prepared to walk down a few sets of stairs and an uneven walking trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msipple919
50,Things to do in Los Angeles,"If you are from a city or country that does not have great beaches or a coast line, then you should not miss El Matador beach which is north of Malibu.There is a parking lot and also street parking. You can access the beach by gong thru the parking lot to steep stairs that will take you to a pristine beach called Broadbeach. Your can walk south, on the sandy beach, for several miles passing million dollar homes or just spread a towel and soak up the California.sun.When leaving the beach, if you head south on Pacific Coast Highway (CA.1), there is a great place to eat called Malibu Seafood--order a fresh seafood dinner and when they call your number, take the food to their outdoor picnic area and enjoy a great reasonable priced meal. I like to pick up a bottle of wine at the Trancas Vintage Market and enjoy if with the seafood dinner (tip--buy a wine with a screw cap if you don't have a cork puller with you). I guarantee if the weather is sunny, this will be a memorable day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmahler
50,El Matador State Beach,Amazing beach on the coast of Malibu. Less crowded than other beaches. It is different from other local beaches. There are beautiful rocks around which gives it a different look.Parking is easy. Paid parking is available inside the beach compound. One can park for free outside on the road as well.Absolutely recommended for anyone visiting SoCal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/284ushak
50,Really Beautiful and Romantic,"Very beautiful, not crowded, best place to spend some good time with your loved one. Sure there is a small hike to get down to the beach but it‚Äôs worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/869prasadu
50,One of the most beautiful places I've been,"This was a little deep into Malibu (almost an hour drive from near LAX) but it was so worth it. And it's not like a drive up the pacific coast highway sucks anyway. Once we got to the beach there was an okay amount of parking. We paid 7 bucks to park and then went on a little mini hike to get down to the beach. Definitely not the most accessible place if you have small children, elderly, or handicapped folks with you. But if you're up for a small trek, it'll totally be worth it! The views here are spectacular. The jutting rocks, the beach caves, etc. So perfect and serene. Not a crowded beach...even on a Saturday afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kate169
40,"Not crowded, romantic, beautiful",Spent a few hours here on my birthday enjoying the serene beauty of the rocks and sea. We lucked out and some guy who was leaving gave us his parking pass - normally it's $8 to park. It's a great place for photo opps and to just enjoy the natural beauty. I do not recommend it for anyone who has trouble walking up or down steep hills. Where you park is not where the beach is - you have to walk down the hill to get to the sand and shoreline.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimsy151
50,Great short-term beach visit,"There is no doubt that this beach is a great place for family pictures. It's nice to let the kids play in the sand and in some of the small pools along the beach, but it isn't a place to stay more than a couple hours. I rate this beach highly because it is such a beautiful place to see at any time of day. You won't regret the drive up to this beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisdmcguire
50,Beautiful Romantic Beach,has limited parking.but the beach is very scenic.a lot of people come here for professional photography.the sunsets are magnificent.must visit if you are visiting CA.i live here so i make it a point to visit one new beach every weekend and this one is definitely a treasure.Enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alik457
20,Don't make a day out of it...,"The beach is very beautiful, but it is not a place to get a tan or to swim. We went there on a sunday and was not a fun experience at all because it was crowded and dirty.If you want to go, go just to take nice pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolPrado
50,Beautiful stretch of beach and lovely views,Its a very small and intimate beach. The views are gorgeous and the rocks are cool to explore. There are a lot of stairs and parking can be a test.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BGarbus
30,"steep walk to get to the beach, very little sand at high tide",We parked on the side of the road rather than pay the carparks fee. There is a steep descent and plenty of steps to reach the beach here. We arrived at high tide and there was very little sand to sit on. We'd recommend Zuma beach if you like sand and sea :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2803BOsarahc
50,Awesome Place,Its very beautiful and not so crowded...you can easily spend hours.. the views are awesome....parking can be tough with limited spaces and charged around 8$,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abhi611
40,Hidden little beach,"I LOVE this beach! It is quite small so it can get very crowded during mid day. We went from about 8:30 to 12 and it was perfect. I would probably avoid this during the peak afternoon hours of summer because it would be too crowded to really enjoy. There is quite a bit of rock formations to explore. A fantastic place to take pictures!But..The parking lot is small and rocky and you have to pay (I think around $8) and the machine was broken and an attendant had to sit there all day taking money. It seemed fishy to me.The bathrooms were the absolute WORST I have ever seen in my life! There were three port a potty's and they were all full to the lid! I didn't know that was even possible, it was disgusting! The state of California should be highly ashamed of this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahS587
40,Amazing views!,The view from the top of the cliff is unique !It's different comparing to the large sandy beaches of LA.For those who enjoy hidden small beaches with cliffs this is the place to go !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annasB7969AQ
40,Beautiful views at a cost!,Stopped off here for some last minutes pics before traveling home (10 mins at most!). The Park officer thought by just putting a sticky on my windshield with a warning that was enough to issue a ticket ($180 later)!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmatt64
50,Awesome rocks,This beach is great! there isnt but maybe 3 feet of sand when the tide is in and comes almost all the way up to the cliff face. You have to walk down some pretty steep stairs to get down to the beach but its worth it when the tide is out you can walk under a rock arch and in a tiny little cave on the beach. The water is some areas can be pretty dangerous because of all the rocks but its awesome to go and relax and explore on the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bward27
40,Niced secluded beach,A bit of a hike down (and back up) from the paid parking lot but a nice small secluded beach and an interesting not overly long drive up from Malibu. Good place to relax and read a book. We stayed for about an hour but decided to leave when the wind picked up and the sand started blowing around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/674JohnL674
40,love this beach!,"love the different rock formations. narrow path and narrow staircase, but part of the adventure. only drawback is small parking lot, lot full because of holiday weekend. we got ticket for parking out on PCH - with a hundred other vehicles doing the same thing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolynchase13
20,Average,"The views on top of the cliffs were amazing, but the beach was very small and extremely crowded. If you are looking for a relaxing quiet beach, I would recommend going somewhere else. It wasn't quite what I expected from all of the hype...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lclosner8
40,Check the tide tables before you go,"We went during high tide and found a dirty, narrow, crowded strip of sand. The rocks, water, and cliffs were still beautiful, but I can see where it would be a totally different experience at low tide. Parking is limited; be prepared to parallel park on the highway. Definitely go to the bathroom before you get there. Overall, a fun stop, even at high tide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ramsfan93a
40,Views are breath taking,Beach was a little dirty; but the views....... The port a potties were absolutely disgusting. A bit dangerous getting down to the beach but worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heatherc417
50,Favorite spot in Cali,"Out of all the beaches in the area.. even to laguna to santa monica, Malibu was our favorite. el matador beach is where you gotta visit. Its peaceful scenic and clean. Beautiful for great photos! I favor this one <3",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelvajz123
50,Very scenic & unique,"Loved this beach- very rocky and reminded me more of the Pacific Northwest beaches. It's secluded and small. Perfect for couples who want privacy and to simply relax. There are many photo ops here too!! We actually saw an episode of the Biggest Loser being filmed in this location the morning we were there. Highly recommend for a unique beach experience!! Be careful though, there is a climb, although a pretty easy one, down and back up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaseballFan5
40,"Gorgeous, rocky beach","Loved this secluded little gem of a beach. Be prepared to do a bit of hiking to get to it. There are lots of stairs and a couple of steep hills. Absolutely worth it, though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcdlau
30,Ehhhh.....,"Well, I didn't see what all the hype was about. The beach is extremely narrow, full of driftwood and seaweed and people's lost shoes and clothing, etc. Parking lot is not large - you pay at the small kiosk located right next to the Port-a-Potties - and yes, it smells really bad. The walk from the parking lot is not for the weary - a steep walk through a runoff area, then a sand/eroding cement walkway(narrow and no rails) down to an eroding concrete/metal staircase - then more sand - then another staircase. Beach was not really one for sitting on/sunning - most people were there set up to read or have a little picnic. You cannot walk very far to the north - there is another staircase but it is private - don't think you can get back up that way - depending on the tide, you have to swim to it anyway. We did not walk to the south, so I cannot comment on that. There were much nice beaches as we approached El Matador (from the south) - wide, lots of parking, and even had bathhouses. It was nice to see the rock formations, but it was truly something not worth the trek down. Maybe I'm biased because I am partial to Maui beaches, I guess for CA this was good, but certainly not a beach to catch some rays/go swimming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrvlnRoundUS
50,Amazing beach,"This is a must do while in the LA area. Access to it is from the top of a cliff, so the amazing views of the ocean from this high vantage point make it well worth the trip. The beach itself is beautiful but small, with rock formations in back of it under which you can find shade to avoid the sun. When we went there were quite a few people, so for such a small beach it was a bit crowded, but we still really enjoyed it immensely for it's stunning beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691sharons
40,Peaceful and relaxed beach,"What a great beach, not really good for swimming though, because of the undercurrents. But it was so peaceful here after a disapponting Zuma Beach experience.Just a few people, pelicans in the air, rocks, tunnels, caves. Bring your own food and water and please leave this beach as unspoilt as you have found it when you got there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Watching_the_River
50,Picturesque beach,"Sand was excellent and the scenery was fabulous. Found it very hard to leave. Wind off the water sometimes blew the sand onto us, but this was a minor inconvenience. We parked off to the side of the highway without any problem at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sshifton
50,A little known hidden GEM,"Living in Pt. Mugu for three years (25 years ago), I drove past El Matador Beach probably 20 times and never stopped. This time I stopped and enjoyed the beautiful scenery at EMB. Take a picnic basket, your camera and sun screen and spend the day. We saw a documentary being shot and a photo shoot as well on our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrkbd13
30,A nice beach but by no means an amazing one.,"Stopped here whilst driving down Pacific Coast Highway 1 for about an hour and it is a lovely beach but nothing 'amazing'... I have been to plenty more amazing beaches around the world.It has some nice sand, some interesting rock formations and their are some nice vista's as you take the short, but steep, walk down to the beach from the El Matador State Beach Car Park, (Cost to park is US$8.00 for the day).Beware (especially if with children) as their are strong rip currents at this location. Also unless there is another access, which I don't think their is this beach is not suitable for wheelchairs, those who walk with aid of crutches and baby buggies that you don't want to fold down for the descent!It was a bit overcast during my visit and I am sure at different times of the day with different lighting conditions this beach may be more stunning than the impression it made on me on this cloudy day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roberts69
50,Awesome beach for hanging out,"This was a wonderful beach to hang out with my soul mate. We were really impressed by the rock structures throughout the beach area and the nice sand for sunbathing. Note that this is not a beach where one would want to swim or surf due to the reef and how the waves break too close to shore. Regardless, it's a beautiful beach and one I'll have cherished memories of visiting. Make sure to have all you need when going down to the beach as it's quite the trek from the parking lot to the beach. Also, pack efficiently for this! Make sure to go early as this is a popular beach and the parking fills up quickly. Can save money by parking on the highway across from the beach access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epi007
50,Beautiful photo opportunities#,"The beach is quiet, secluded and beautiful. Great place to take pictures and relax. Parking is $8 for all day or park on the hyway and walk an extra 50 yards. Either way, well worth the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rayzorboy
50,Secluded and gorgeous,We parked on the highway and walked down the dirt path to the beach. It is secluded and absolutely beautiful. It got busier the longer we were there but was still pretty private considering the beach down the highway. Highly recommend this beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahsukanykuhl
50,Stunning,"Beautiful beach. If you are able to you can park on road, then walking through car park (pay for) and down to beach. It is a steep walk, but it's well worth it. The views are stunning and there are huge sea birds than fly along in formation. If yon can, don't use the portaloos are top of steps, not a pleasant experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineO313
50,Beautiful Beach,"Skip the hustle and bustle of Zuma and head straight to El Matador. Breathtaking scenery and location. Very romantic and secluded. You have walk down some stairs to the beach. Small, but beautiful and less crowded than most beaches along the coast. You can park for $7 then walk down the cliff side (dirt path and some stairs) to the strip of beach. All kinds of strange and beautiful rock formations make for some great photo opps! Birds everywhere including on the rocks. The only downside is the sea kelp and seaweed that gathers in the water and on the beach. Other than that, its SoCal perfection!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljc5055
50,Beautiful,Such a beautiful view and drive to this beach!!! Highly recommend it!!! Long drive from the freeway but it is worth it!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Validykai
50,"PERFECTION, the definition of southern California","Wow. I don't have the words to describe this gorgeous place!! My husband and I found this place on Trip Advisor initially and decided to check it out for the first time when we were in town last week. Parking is $8 but so worth it to see this place. Very semi-private, secluded, not busy and crowded beach. We walked the entire stretch of the beach and enjoyed tons of pictures with the big rocks and gorgeous skyline. This place truly defines southern California - clean beach, beautiful rock formations and tons of places to take pictures. My pictures don't do this place justice AT ALL but it's my new favorite place in California. The perfect place to admire God's creation and beauty. You have to visit this beach if you're in Malibu!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKC324
50,Gorgeous Totally worth the hour+ drive out of LA,"There is a steep walk to the bottom If able I highly recommend doing it, if not there are wonderful views just looking out dont let that stop you from visiting this place. The only not so great thing was the parking very small lot. I saw they did offer street parking but when there is a tow truck also parked along the street we were a little leery of parking so we waited until some one left the parking lot",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gategirl
50,"Beautiful, Scenic beach. No Crowds.","This is a really unique, secluded beach that looks like it came right off a travel brochure. Huge boulders, white sand, blue water right up to the beach. Perfect for strolling, there were only a few other users there when we visited. The parking lot is quite small and required a significant fee. We were forced to park on the highway nearby-which was OK as it saved us some bucks and the walk was easy. There is a bit of a hike down the bluff to the beach, but the views along the way were outstanding. The cold water and cool sea breeze seemed strange to those of us used to the Gulf Coast in Summer but the visuals can't be beat! Loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/txyz
40,Cool but can't decide if it was worth the parking price,This break is nice and gave us a nice short walk during our drive. It looked just like the pictures and was a very unique and beautiful beach. I thought 8 bucks for parking for twenty minutes was a little steep when we were one of two cars in the lot. I am glad I saw it but won't be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megs0607
40,Watch Out Where You Park!,"This a wonderful beach to visit. There is a reason why so many photo shoots take place here. There are lots of rocks to play around and the beach is pretty clean. There is a steep cliff to travel down before you reach the beach. If you cannot climb stairs, this is not the beach for you. Also, READ THE PARKING SIGNS! I saw the sheriff give out over 40 parking tickets one day. Just because you saw everyone else park on the street, doesn't mean you should. You actually can park for free across the highway if the lot is full (which you have to pay for). It totally makes sense to have everyone park across the street, then have them cross a highway where traffic is going 55+ mph, and no crosswalk.... Don't park on the beach side. That's my advice! Oh and there are only portapotties (ew!) Other than those 2 things, I think it's still worth a visit and a picture or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Expertpacker87
50,Just like the picture,"There are a lot of people who go here to take pics. It is a pretty neat, out of the way place. It is a bit of a walk down, but fun to do. It is worth it to park on PCH and walk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jims875
50,Unbelievable hidden gem for photographers and couples!,"When I discovered this place just by accident, my jaw dropped when I saw the beautiful rock formations on the beach. THE PLACE for portrait photography at the beach, and to get the most beautiful sunset/sunset shots, AND if you really are into it; milkyway night sky shots. The beach is cleaner than most I've been to in south california. It is a popular destination so try to not come during the weekend when many bring their kids and it is generally more populated. If you are going to come on the weekend, go very early. Don't forget, if you are going to park, you have to pay a $8 fee. Don't put a $20 bill in there because it will eat it and not give you any change as I learned the hard way.This is also a very beautiful destination for couples to just enjoy the sound of the waves and take long walks. There is also a nice little cave like carve in a huge stone that you can go inside and relax. Overall one of my favorite beaches to go to any time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sevani2013
50,Rocky natural coastline,"Stairs descending the cliff 100 or more feet to the beach are for the fleet of foot. Once arrived, there are natural wonders in abundance. At low tide, we have seen hundreds of starfish and other tidal pool creatures. Birds fan and dry on the monoliths. If other bathers are there, enough nooks and crannies exist to make one feel private. There is something strangely wild about Matador with the huge city of LA so near yet so far from consciousness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/301charlottew
50,great place for photographs,The drive along the coast through Malibu is full of beautiful views around every curve in the road. There are lots of places along the way to stop and enjoy the view and many spectacular views without ever leaving your car. this is one that is definitly worth stopping for. Its a little bit of a hike down to the beach but you wont be disapointed if you do it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rlp66
40,Lovely Beach,"My husband and I got engaged on this beach, almost 6 years ago! We love this beach. It used to be a hidden gem, but now is getting more crowded due to it recently being on the Bachelor TV show and other shows. Go early in the morning to get a good spot on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccap176
50,Beautiful Beach With Cool Rock Formations and Wild Houses,Matador is a schlep and it is $8.00 to park in the state lot (You can park above on the PCH for free) but is spectacular. Cool rock formations abound and if you are beach walker it brings you into proximity to some wild homes. No amenities other than bathroom so bring your own chairs etc,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuffleScruffle
40,Amazing Beach... spoilt by filming,"First of all this beach is stunning, there's no getting around that fact and you really should come and take a look!FREE PARKING - The beach has it's own parking but charges $8, which i thought was a bit much, however you can just park on the Pacific Coast Highway (on opposite side of road to the sea) for free!I came here on a Monday evening after work expecting to find the beach very quiet. I was quite wrong with it almost being taken over by filming and model photo shoots! This was quite tiresome as you couldn't just walk along the public beach, you were stopped and asked to wait, fine, one or two minutes never hurt anyone, but 5 minutes later i'm still waiting with no sign of them stopping. In the end i just continued walking - it's a public beach!Apart from that inconvenience the beach is lovely, the rock formations are stunning. I would recommend coming here at low tide, as high tide means there's little beach to walk along which is probably what condensed the issues with the ""pro"" filmers - but hey it's near LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstevens
40,Astounding view,"It is a bit of a hike to get there, that's true. And you won't find bars, food or sports complex there. It's ok. You don't want them. Just leave your car, take the steep steps down to the beach, sit down and relax. Admire the rocks and their weird shapes. Feel the wind as pelicans and seagulls fly above you. Maybe take a dip in the ocean. Maybe later. Relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A_Ciri
50,Get there early for a great spot,"My wife and I visited on April 7- got there early about 9:30AM, and found a great spot- up against the cliff where there was a little cave for shade. Hung out until about 12N when the crowd started shoing up...gave our parking ticket to a young couple who looked like they could use it...beauty of a beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dano72
50,"Wonderful Family Spot, especially at low tide.",Check the local tide charts and take your kids to visit at Low Tide. You will see a healthy seascape with lots of interesting sea creatures. A bit of a hike from parking but well worth it. Very lovely coastal setting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
50,Spectacular! !!,"We recently visited this spot during our southern California trip. Parking is limited but you can park on the road. The beach is little bit far from the parking spot, but it's worth to go down the beach specially during sunset!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanzir26
50,Breathtaking!,It's a bit of hike to get all the way to the beach but it's worth it! Absolutely beautiful. The reason it's called El Matador beach is because one of the rock formations resembles a bull!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/threepowells
50,Breathtakingly amazingly beautiful,"I had researched before our trip, and this was supposed to be so gorgeous, so I put it on our to-do list ... I hope it is on yours! STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS. Quite simply, one of the prettiest scenes I've ever seen. EVER. I think we all ran out of battery power trying to take photos here. So beautiful. We were there on a Monday afternoon in March, so there wasn't any problem finding parking, nor was the beach busy at all. I can't remember what the parking charge was - after a week on a road trip in Southern California, we spent tons on parking so I stopped keeping track! Doesn't matter, it was worth it whatever it was. I don't get the sense this is a ""swimming"" beach - not with the rocks, but what a wonderful place to walk in the water, soak up the sun, relax in the sand, and just enjoy nature's beauty. Most definitely a trip highlight for us. I think my husband's first words upon his first view were ""are you freakin' kidding me?"" (because of how wonderful it looked). I can't imagine being lucky enough to leave near here to be able to spend time there on a regular basis!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clamc40
50,Amazing,"After seeing reviews on tripadvisor my girlfriend and I decided to check it out. I'm so glad we did. It was awesome! There's a small parking lot you pull into and you have to pay a small fee like $3 or $6 I think. As soon as you start walking down the trail you just go ""wow"". The view is breath taking. And there was a total of about 8 people on the WHOLE BEACH when I was there. Well worth visiting if your in California. And the views driving there were amazing too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dejaentendu247
50,Gorgeous,"This is one scenic beach. Perfect for great pics or to relax and take in the beauty of the place. It was a bit exhausting to get back up to the car afterwards, but worth the sweat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulissaLirio
50,Beautiful Beach,"This was the highlight of out trip pictures. Got so many beautiful rock formations. Its a non crowded small beach. Parking space is limited, we had to park our car on the road side. Got many superb shots of birds flying. Before visiting I read many reviews saying its the best Romantic beach. So true! Totally worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SumyVinod
50,Hidden Gem,My wife read about this beach on Tripadvisor and it confirmed why we think this site is so valuable. The beach is unlike the others of the area. The rock formations on the beach are beautiful and very romantic. There is all day parking for $8.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenwM8672IM
50,The most beautiful place on earth,"Matador Beach is magnificent. To see it is to believe it. There are magnificent boulders, huge boulders jetting out from the ocean with beautiful soft sand. It is a very romantic beach. I recommend a visit when in LA. It is north of Malibu Beach on the Pacific Coast Highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ak715
40,"Beautiful place, but ....","This is an awesome beach for the romantically inclined. Fine sand, dramatic cliffs, and the whisper of the ocean. Ideal location for shooting that special video. It is very common to see lots of couples or artists of any kind enjoying the beauty of this place.Unfortunately the beach is also under extremely frequent inspection of the state rangers. I have seen so many cases where they were giving fines to guys that had a bottle of beer in their bags or to girls with a ""wardrobe malfunction"". So, be careful, do not believe in those Hollywood movies where you can share a bottle of wine with your loved one on the beach, by a fire.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveller_12
50,Hidden Paradise,"This beach is not very big but extremely picturesque. They film tons of music videos and have fashion shoot here. Most days I see at least a couple of photographers and models. It's usually not crowded here. You can park on PCH for free and walk 50 extra yards or pay the $8 for parking. You still have to go down about 3 minutes or so to get to the beach itself. Beautiful sea caves and arches, tide pools with cool sea creatures, pelicans and seagulls, and I always seem to see dolphins here. Quite a drive from LA but not too far from the west valley. Probably the most beautiful and romantic beach in all of SoCal. Bring your significant other and have a picnic and enjoy the beauty of this awesome Malibu treasures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonK935
50,Worth the stop!,We had to park on the road and when doing so I thought to myself- is this really worth it. It was a bit of a hike to the bottom and I thought- is this really worth it. My answer- YES YES YES. I wish I had a day to spend. The locals were laying and sunning and playing kickball. Photo shoots were being had. Amazing place. Sooooo glad we stopped. And when you think you can't go anymore- duck under a rock and there will be more on the other side.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shereet5
50,Spectacular Views,"This is one beach you don't want to miss in Malibu. Rock formations and changing tides create an illusion of being on a private and secluded spot on the Pacific. Parking is not free at any of the beaches along the coast but this one is definitely worth it. Yes, you will have some hiking along a path and stairs with more than average step numbers, but for anyone of reasonable fitness, it is doable. We did see some people doing it in flip-flops and don't recommend them. Once you're down, you can spend the entire day if you want. It's a photographer's paradise with views changing with sun, clouds and tides. Picnic tables and portable toilet are back up top. Don't miss this one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmpoz
40,Not a lot of people,Enjoyed a nice sunset walk on the beach. Low tide is the best time to go as a previous person mentioned. Great time reflecting on the beautiful scenery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RLCampbell
50,Thankful for El Matador,"Flew in to LAX for Thanksgiving week. Decided to drive up coast on our way to Moorpark & find El Matador as a recommended attraction from TA. First stop was Gladstone's restaurant in Malibu recommended by family - very good food, friendly staff & great view of beach on outdoor deck. Clear & balmy day. From the parking lot to El Matador beach was a short & do-able hike for a couple of ""mature"" adults -will not use term senior citizen unless a discount is involved. You should wear comfortable shoes & walk with some care. At mid day, weather was perfect. Scenery of rock formations, beach & beautiful homes was such a welcomed sight after a long flight. Beach was populated by a handful of families & visitors. Pay for parking machine was not working, so our short stay was free. Port-a-potty on site for restrooms. Would visit again when more time is available to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GtownGinger
50,Wonderful almost deserted beach,"El Matador lived up to its name and reputation.Once you make the hike down the cliff/stairs, you are treated to a wonderful combination of sandy beach with interesting rock outcrops, and the cliffs (& beautiful homes) above. Makes for great photo opportunities.Just pay attention to others warnings about terrible toilets, and bring your own food & drinks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BogeyPeter
40,Low tide only,"We live in Malibu and go here occasionally with our kids. It is particularly beautiful here, and throughout Malibu, this time of year (November, December) as the frequent Santa Ana winds make for clear skies with views of the offshore islands and very little crowds. One very important tip for El Matador beach is that it should be done during a very low tide and nice weather. These low tides occur during full moon and new moon periods, and often reach their lowest around sunset during the winter (check tide charts online). This makes for a beautiful sunset walk through many caves (not approachable during high tides) and amazing tide pools. For us the only drawback is that photographers frequent the beach bringing equipment, reflectors, tripods, and usually scantily dressed girls draping themselves in kelp hoping to be the next seductive swimsuit model. This can detract from the natural beauty of the place, but this is usually centered near the bottom of the path down to the beach and it's a big beach with plenty of room for all. Hope this tip helps; enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agentmoldy
40,Not every beach needs sunny day,"went there on a cloudy day and close to sunset time. this place is a little different from the other beaches, famous for its rocks which makes it more interesting for kids. and it's a little cold at this time of year, but witnessed a belly dancer shooting some propaganda film, very gorgeous, hah",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562yingl
50,Photographer's Paradise,"Best beach in Southern California for photography. I go there often to take pics of the settings. The rocks and cliffs are stunning. During the fall and winter months, the beach is almost empty, and you have most of the beach to yourself. I would recommend anyone that visits Southern California to head to this paradise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/281craigr
40,Great view but no conveniences,This beach had an amazing view. It cost $8 per day parking. On the day I visited there was a parking lot attendant verifying parking payments.The view was great but it was a challenge to get down from the parking lot to sand. There wasn't any place to buy food so pack all that you need and don't forget anything in your car or you may regret making multiple trips up and down the cliff side. There is only one portable toilet that I could see. I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone who finds walking or climbing long distances hard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UHcougarBdaygirl
50,Beautiful spot,"I had a few hours to myself on a Thursday afternoon, so I looked to Trip Advisor to help me find a great spot.. and once again... TA came through. This spot is a gem. Very different that many of the beaches to the North and South. The rock formations are beautiful, and while I was there, there were only a handful of other people scattered around. I grabbed a book and listened to the sound of the waves, with the sun on my face, and watched the Long-Billed Curlew poke around in the sand ... it was ahhhhhhh..... I could feel the stress of the work week drain out of me.I forgot to pay the parking machine, but the attendant there just put a post-it on my car to remind me. So when I got back to my car, I paid, and he crossed my car off the list. Nice Guy.. I suppose if I had stayed down there on the beach until after he left for the day, I probably would have gotten a ticket. He was very nice to give me a reminder and a chance to pay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amy_n_Joe
50,My favorite beach in Los Angeles county!,"I discovered El Matador beach more than 15 years ago before I Moved to L. A. And it has been my favorite stretch of sand ever since day one. You approach it from a cliff hiking down rather steep and high ""stairs"" molded into the hillside from the top. Do NOT forget to pay for parking, tickets here can get expensive! After a hike downhill that is definitely not wheelchair access proof you do get rewarded big time with solitude, beautiful rock formations and a backdrop worthy of a Hollywood movie shoot. Often times around sunset you may run into photographers or videographers and their models utilizing magic hour, another hint: remember to take your camera or cellphone with camera, the urge to take a gazillion pictures is pretty much unavoidable! ;-) Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skinmeister
50,This is an amazing beach!,"I found this beach on TripAdvisor and decided to go check it out while recently in LA. It was stunning!!! There were probably 3 or 4 different photographers out when I visited taking pictures. I can see why people would want to have their photos taken at El Matador. Simply, beautiful!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mommylovin2
50,Not Your Typical Beach,"We have visited many California beaches over the last decade or so, and were not expecting much variation from the others when we visited El Matador. We were pleasantly surprised with the change of pace. Getting to the sand is not easy task - I think we counted 87 stairs and a fair amount of additional sloped walking...but the cool rock formations, cave-like areas and beautiful bluffs topped with magnificent homes made for a very enjoyable visit. Thanks to Trip Advisor one more time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A_and_B_from_PA
50,Beautiful !,"It's a bit tricky to find, use a GPS. drive down to the parking area and walk down the path to one of the most beautiful small beaches in Malibu. The backdrop is gorgeous rocky hillside.There is no lifeguard station so be careful. No amenities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nili99
50,Most beautiful beach I've ever seen!,"I've seen beautiful beaches in the Florida panhandles, Hawaii and all along California's coast; and El Matador is hand's down the most beautiful beach I've ever seen. There are unique rock formations that create a breathtaking vista and (for some reason) the lighting there is absolutely perfect for photos, especially at sunrise and sunset. You do have to walk down fairly rugged terrain to get there so, unfortunately, this is not a beach you can access if you have any mobility issues. But if you are fairly sure footed, El Matador is worth the drive - I've never seen anything like it - takes my breath away...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaHill_inLA
50,Mother Nature's beauty in all her glory-worth every stair step down,"I just returned from my first CA visit and did a ton of research prior to on the best beaches. I was not interested in the typical flat, wide sandy beach, but more of one with a rocky coast line and beautiful scenery for picture taking. This beach is just north of Zuma Beach, so when you see that sign be on the lookout for the brown and white sign on the right reading ‚ÄòEl Matador State Beach ¬º mi‚Äô. The entrance, of course, will be on the left hand side. The parking lot was a tad small, but we arrived around 1230pm on a Sunday afternoon and found several spots available. The fee is $8 and you put your money into a machine to get a ticket to place on your dash. There was a park service attendant monitoring the cars. I had read about the challenges involved getting down to the beach at El Matador due to dirt paths and a great number of stairs. We found that this was true, but for the extra effort, the beauty of the beach before our eyes was well worth it. The walk down the path and stairs was relatively easy for us, but for those with mobility issues, a fear of heights, non secure shoes or those hauling loads of beach gear it would/could be a difficult task and for some impossible. As we headed down the path/stairs we had two young girls in front of us toting a large Igloo cooler with wheels. The wheels were no good as the path was too uneven and carrying it down the stairs was an immense struggle for them. We jokingly said it'd be easier for them to leave it at the top and come back up when they needed whatever was in it. Once we were on the beach there were a good number of people/families, but it never felt crowded. The sight of the large rock formations with the sea flowing in between the crevices was a gift from Mother Nature and I was able to capture beautiful images with my camera. I was amazed to see so many people in bathing suits and in the water; coming from the Mid-Atlantic, the air/water temperature was far too cool for me. Don‚Äôt come here expecting a perfectly manicured beach, vegetation from the sea was strewn along the sand, but added to the beauty. I felt I couldn‚Äôt have picked a better beach; it was all I hoped it would be. The only negative, and a huge one at that, was the Porta-Potties. I had read about how disgusting they were and figured that most are, so no big deal. Boy was I ever wrong! I‚Äôve traveled extensively and have never seen such gag inducing toilets in my entire life. I opened the door to each of the two available and the swarms of flies indicated how horrible they were. Both were filled to the top with thick black nastiness that almost caused my earlier breakfast to appear on the ground below me. Shame on the California Department of Parks and Recreation! If you are charging $8 per car this should bring in enough money to have these serviced/cleaned often. The filth I saw looked like it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in months. With the large number of families visiting, I wondered where the parents took their kids to use the toilet. If you are able to steer clear of the Porta-Potties your visit to El Matador should not disappoint; it‚Äôs a beautiful gem of a beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kribbean
50,Stunning beach and views,"Read about this on vrbo and the reviews were spot on. This is a stunning, very private-feeling beach, although we went on a late Tuesday morning. 3 things to be aware of: port-o-pottys are the only bathroom option here and they're at the top by the parking lot way above the beach; parking is tight, maybe 40 spots unpaved, but you can always park on the PCH; parking is $8.Once you leave the parking lot and head toward the water, you're met by a gorgeous view of the ocean and you're about 10+ stories above the beach and ocean! There's a path that takes you to several sets of stairs to get down to the beach. Once you get to the beach, it is so worth the trip. Beautiful, huge rocks, some where you can walk or sit under, especially at low tide. A nice, deep beach that is very clean and protected by the sandstone cliffs.Bring a garbage bag and take your trash with you; it's too nice to spoil for others. We've been to several beaches and sightseeing spots in Malibu, but we'll definitely return for a longer stay. Bonus is that you burn some calories going up and down the paths and stairs but not too much for seniors. Love this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WarrenB07481
40,Gorgeous sunset,"This was the last beach we stopped at in Malbu. It is very pretty with the rock formations. There were two photoshoots going on while we were there. There is a lot of seaweek on the beach and sandflies so it can be a little annoying laying out. Also, they are very serious about the no alcohol policy. We saw a ranger give out tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentTraveler1986
50,B R E A T H T A K I N G!!!!!,"So gorgeous its worth the drive and the hike. This is without a doubt one of California's most beautiful beaches, small and scenic. Its situated on an angle so that you get a breeze and not gale force winds, super nice. Take a picnic and blanket and prepare to relax, sort of. The Downsides, in anticipation of getting there you may think you're lost or you missed it, you didn't keep driving. *THE HILL* in order to get to the beach you have to walk down a serious flight of stairs, but before you reach that you have to walk down a steep and treacherous hill that this not for the faint of heart and difficult to do in flip flops! Its very scenic and the day we were there, there were a lot of photographers trying to shoot engagement shots and bikini models, they may ACT like they own the place, they don't! IGNORE THEM enjoy yourself and let your kids play and explore. You can tell by the pics this beach is a tourist spot, so don't expect to be alone, you won't be. Its more like ""guest towels"" look at them, like decoration, but don't expect to really be able to use it.You will be leaving shortly. There is parking, its unpaved and there are porta potties at the THE TOP of the hill. Bring your camera, wear a cute outfit, sit in front of the rocks, take a picture of the sunset, leave. All good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FonnyGirl
50,Most Beautiful Beach I've Ever Seen!,"I Love Beaches. I've been to many along both California and Florida coasts, as well as some Atlantic and Mediterranean. El Matador is my all-time favorite because it combines amazing rock formations and gorgeous purple-blue waters. Before the descent, most of which is staired, we even enjoyed a picnic at provided tables. If the parking lot is full, there is street-side parking. Los Angelenos are so lucky to have such natural gems in their backyard!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visuality
30,Over-Crowded,We just drove down to the parking lot to find it full. It is very small and not paved. I would think that if you are going to have to pay to park you would get paved parking and real toilets. We left without seeing the beach to many people. They need a sign out on the road indicating they are full.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChurchMouse2010
40,Another great beach in SCal,"We went there in July on a day when the surf was quite high and the seaweeds swamped the tiny little beach, attracting tons of flies. Still we enjoyed the beach for its beautiful rock formations and nice scenery. Just bear in mind it gets really crowded on weekends. We went in the early morning and left by 11am when the crowds started to build up. The small parking lot gets full pretty much by 11am on weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snorkelingJim
50,Most Beautiful Beach in the World!,"We have been to many different beaches in the past several years, including Florida, East Coast, and Caribbean. El Matador Beach was one of the most beautiful and by far the most unique! It is pretty hard to reach... lots of steep steps... but it is worth the walk. There are many cool rock structures and anemones along the beach. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susikay
50,Quiet Retreat,It was peaceful and secluded. You can find a quiet spot away from others. Absolutely beautiful and kids love exploring the caves.Two things to know:Portable toilets onlyIt is a hike and there are stairsFee for parking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Naomi_Taylor
50,Awesome for pics and ok for beach don't go on weekend.,Awesome for pics beach is a little small. but the scenic view is so awesome great for pics. BE AWARE OF THE TRAFFIC ON WEEKENDS!!!! NIGHTMARE we went on a Saturday on our last day in Anaheim gps stated 52 miles we were like yes perfect for our last day to get pics. Don't suggest you do this on weekend took us 3 hours in traffic to get there and about 2 hours to get back. Nice for the pics but don't know if its worth the headache on the weekend. Go during the week early or after rush hour. or you might be in traffic forever. last day of our trip and 5 hours in traffic nice but laguna beach was just as nice and not as much headache to get there. Be aware step stairs to get down small children need to be held and handicap could not access this area. Be sure you pay for the parking and display on dash saw a guy giving tons of citations out to people that did not pay.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandmandallas
50,Hidden gem,"If you are looking for a picturesque beach in Malibu, look no further. You might think you are in Big Sur once you make the sojourn down the steps. From the highway or even the parking lot you cannot see the beauty that lies below. Be aware, however - no lifeguard, no facilities, no easy access for seniors or strollers, etc. And definitely not a surfing beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardGibbs
50,Not so secret anymore,This is an amazing beach! There are quite a few flights of stairs to get up and down but is well worth it! Beautiful scenic views and generally a quieter beach then other bigger beaches. There are caves and sandy cliffs which are perfect for holiday photographs. Love this place!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baconisgoodforme
40,Great beach for pics and play.,"El Matador Beach is rather small, and has rather small parking. However, it is worth going doing the week when the crowds are smaller and parking is possible. The path down needs some care if you are in flip flops. Fashion photogs can be a bit of an annoyance, but just ignore them and do your own thing.The north side of the beach has a few caves and some good sea life as the waves break through the rocks. It is very close to both Ventura / Oxnard and for Malibu / Topanga visitors. We were staying by Malibu pier and had great beaches by the lagoon, but this was still a fun trip and gave us some fantastic pics. Go earlier in the day or during the week. Looks like it could be a bit packed on the weekends with the LA crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KansaTraveller
50,Breathtaking,We had a few hours to kill before our flight left and decided to drive down the coast. We were amazed at what we found waiting for us at El Matador Beach in Malibu. The large waves were crashing against the towering rocks. There are caves and cut outs which offer the perfect background for photographs. This is a true gem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KentuckyOnthego
40,Beautiful! Must see in Malibu!,"I loved this beach! Unlike other beaches I have visited, this beach lies at the base of a sandy cliff amidst a bunch of towering rocks. You can enjoy the scenery, yet still relax in the sand and likely enjoy the photogs shooting an engagement session or music video (both were occurring on our visit). Several other groups of photographers and their subjects were our only company on the beach. It was beautiful. Check out the pics, you won't want to miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahH628
50,WOW,"From the time you start walking down the stairs, you will be amazed. I'm an outdoor person to begin with, but the views and scenery on this beach are wonderful. It is quite a hike to get down to the actual beach, but it is well worth it. My friends and I came back to this beach almost every night to relax and watch the amazing sunsets. Make sure you have your camera ready!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/578LaurenM
50,Amazing beach,"This beach is very nice! A little bit crowded maybe because we went on the weekend. The parking is really hard to find, so be prepare to walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/opalka90
40,Nice scenic views,Great little beach if you are willing to take hike. Getting down to beach was a little difficult due to rough terrain (2 sets of steep stairs and a narrow winding pathway thru the side of mountain) but well worth it for the views. The beachfront itself was not very big and got smaller with high tide but the kids loved playing on rocks and running thru all the tunnels. Self parking lot had limited spaces but there was parking off main road. Not your typical beach but definitely a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simbadusty
50,Awsome place to go visit.,I went with my girlfriend today and it was pretty nice and fun btw Demi lavato was there :o so thats pretty cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justbeeh
50,Beautiful!,"We took our 5 small kids to this beach in February. It was the highlight of our trip to SoCal! The walk down made mom a bit nervous, but we just went slow with the little ones. We took some awesome pics and played in the caves/ sand. It was way too cold to get wet at that time of year. Germany skipped the hike and enjoyed seeing a huge pod of dolphins and the sea lions while relaxing at the picnic table at the top of the cliff. We did a bit of birding and added a few life birds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaronc989
50,"Beautiful beach, lots of photo shoots taking over","Beautiful beach, pretty crowded though and the photo shoots seemed to take over because you didn't want to ruin their shots. We went on Memorial Day though, it was definitely worth it to try again on a nonholiday",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bellajuliet
50,Amazing Beach!,"If you are anywhere near Malibu, I suggest taking at least hour to explore this beach. We rented a convertible and drove up the PCH to El Matador.When you pull into the parking lot you can't see the beach at all, don't let that discourage you. You only need to get to the top of the stairs to be glad you went. The view from the top of the cliff is almost worth it in itself. We then climbed down the staircase and walked down the beach and back. The water was still freezing, but the weather was beautiful and the beach was clean. There are rock formations and caves all along the beach. I think we walked about .5 miles and turned around. You will need a camera or two, the photo opportunities are endless. There were actually 2 professional photo shoots going on while we were there, thankfully they were nice about letting us pass through. I definitely recommend El Matador.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maxcat1220
40,Beautiful Beach!,"This was a half hour drive out of Santa Monica on the Pacific Coast Highway (half hour, depending on traffic).It was easy to find, and after a walk down the cliff-stairs were adequate and felt safe-we were treated to an amazing beach with ancient rock formations.Lovely place to see the sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprilstein
40,Gorgeous landscape,"We visited in February, and it sadly wasn't warm enough to really lay out in the sun, let alone go swimming, but we really enjoyed our time here. There is a spacious parking lot (the fee is, as I recall, $8 for the day), but since we were really only driving through on our way to Santa Monica, we parked along the highway. It's not impossible, especially if you're only staying 1-3 hours, but pay close attention to the signs. You have to walk down quite a bunch of stairs, so it might not be the best choice if visiting with elderly people.It's a beautiful little beach with great views and stunning landscape and lots of hidden caves. There's a lot of different birds who were quite fun to watch, and beautiful rock formations, which made for some really great pictures. I hope to be back someday!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TanyaR697
50,Beautiful!,Beautiful beach with stunning views. Great for photography and stunning landscape! A treasure to visit and we cannot wait to one day visit again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadelineS784
50,Wind and waves made the day,"We took pictures of the waves crashing into the rocks at El Matador Beach just before sunset. It was the perfect time to see the full effect of the sea against the shore. The light at dusk adds a unique dimension to the cave-like rock formations. To get a good clear view of the sunset over the ocean this time of year you need to go about 4 miles north to Town Line Beach, but the sunlight against the rock formations was beautiful. The walk down to the beach is not too bad if you take your time and back up there are places to stop and look over the ocean. the fee is $8.00. Since the wind was up the waves provided a spectacular show. A great way to end the day. Bathrooms are not a prize. Hint go when the wind is up and near sunset...you will love the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998JamesH998
40,Wonderful views and coves,"Wonderful little, quiet find in the Malibu area. The hike down and up is a little taxing especially if you have young children or are elderly but it is doable. The little caves and coves are really fun to see, almost like a mini Oregon coast. Nice birding area, too. It is $8.00 to park but it was worth it. There are bathrooms there but they aren't clean. Forget the little details and go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fwmaggie_12
50,Gorgeous,The hike down and up from the parking lot is significant compared to other beaches (but nothing like the hikes we take in Colorado). The view is breathtaking! The waves also crashed in a manner that I had never heard before. This stop made our whole California trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCRogers76

50,Breathtaking Beach!,"This beach is unlike any other I have visited. The beach is surrounded by cliffs and jagged rocks but there is still a nice sandy shoreline so you can walk up and down and take in the scenery. There was plenty of parking (we paid $12 for all day parking at any of the state beaches). You take a path down to the stairs and then you can access the beach. During the cooler months I would say 1-2 hrs for a visit but during warmer months it would be a great spot to spend the whole day. There was everything from families, fishing to photo shoots going on during my visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chels0816
50,Breathtaking!,"Hidden from view until you walk down from the carpark, the spectacular sight of the rock formations on the beach will take your breath away! There is an dirt path incline and two sets of stairs to climb down, however, it's not that strenous and is definitely worth it! If you are with older folk, it may take about 10 minutes to climb down - however it is doable. The beach is beautiful and picturesque. You have to pay for parking. If you are going to visit one beach in Malibu, this is definitely the one to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RP_traveller_2013
50,Worth the hike down!,"Really beautiful, rugged beach with stone arches, shady spots, and tons of wildlife/birds. It's a hike down to the beach (steps and rough, steep path), so be mindful if you're traveling with elderly or super-young kids.Be sure to pay for parking. If you park on the street, park ACROSS the street. The side that's nearest the beach looked like an inviting place to park; we and everyone else got a $71 ticket. The cars across the street were ticket-less (though the parking signs don't differ).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IslandGirlNYC
40,spectacular views of sunset,The views of the sunset is gorgeous. I took the pain of reaching the vantage point along with my toddler and it is worth..please note no strollers can be used..the hike back to the parking lot is slightly challenging.. also you can park along pch and save some money..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sgmkjsekar

50,Beautiful beach,"There is not just the municipal beach in Malibu! This is a beautiful creek, not very ""touristy"" except for professional photographers. A lovely experience - don't forget to pay the car park! - with the lovely restaurant Naptune's Net just across the National Highway.It's not a big hike. The car park is just above, you just have to go down the stairs. Not possible for the handicapped/old people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathrynV217
40,pretty cool beach,i enjoyed walking along the beach and looking at the different rock formations. that was fun. and it wasn't really a hike at all. it was a pretty simple walk to these stairs that led right onto the beach. i would definitely go here again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1shst1kz
50,Beautiful beach. Beautiful sunset.,Wow! What a great find! Beautiful secluded beach. I was there for the sunset and it was beautiful. It is a bit of hike down but you do get to some stairs. I have gone on several hikes before...which I have slipped and fallen. This was not difficult walk. It was very nice. There are some parts where you need to be careful. This is a must see. I believe that parking was $8 but I parked on the PCH. It was also chilly when I was there. So bring a sweater if you're going in November!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/832SarahN

40,Hollywood in its natural form!,"Beautiful little strip of beach with rock formations and a cave. It is a very popular beach especially during sunset. We visited this beach two evenings in a row. First evening we saw a swimsuit shoot and many family portraits being taken. The second evening there was a car commercial being filmed, a naughty wear session and a stunt men all being filmed. We were at the beach in the mid-week. It was pretty cool to see how families and Hollywood could both use this strip of beach. Yes, the sunset is spectacular. Note that the beach requests for money to park in its not paved lot and there are stairs to get down to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulalovesfood
50,Beautiful beach worth the hike,"Daniel Baldwin told me about this place when he shared his table with us at Tranca's Market over hot dogs. I had driven by this beach hundreds of times and didn't know it existed. It's a beautiful, clean beach with rock formations. There is a long stairway down to the beach and it's not easy for families with small children or elderly. Pack light and explore the many alcoves. Beware, topless bathers are not uncommon in the less crowded areas farther away from the stair access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wuvhawaii
50,El Matador Beach..Definitely worth a look,If you go to Malibu El Matador beach is worth taking a look at. A beautiful (but small) beach with amazing rock formations and caves. This is a great place to go to take some pictures. If it looks familiar...that's because a whole lot of movies and TV shows have filmed scenes here. You might want to check the tide table before going because at high tide there is not much room to move around on the beach. Other people have complained about the walk from the parking lot to the beach (i.e. the steep stairs) but it really is not that bad. Took us about 10 minutes from our car to the beach.Take a look...you will be glad you did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigjt12
50,Worth the trip!,"The wife and I saw the reviews on T.A. and decided it would be a good day trip. We only had a few days in LA so hoped it would be worth our time. The road trip was fantastic and when we arrived, the beach was a great get a way. The trek down was a little scary but well worth it! A beautiful, quiet beach that left me wanting more of California but at the same time, it left a great lasting impression. One word of caution, if you bring food, beware of the birds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MMJones09
50,My favorite beach in Malibu,"Of all the beaches I know, this one is the most beautiful--a geologist's dream of eroded sandstone formations. The only problem (which could be a plus for some) is that it is frequently used for location shoots. I always love coming here, but be prepared for a walk and a lot of stairs. Also, there's a really awful port-a-san if you need to go to the bathroom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hopeanderson09
50,Love this beach!,"Secluded piece of the Pacific... it's a little farther out, but worth the drive. The path down to the beach is steep, but has steps and a handrail, and it's easy to get down to the sand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stephanie1214
50,"Lovely Beach, not too crowded, beautiful scenery","I chose this beach over others on the PCH due to the scenery and dramatic cliffs unlike any other beach in the area(not we also visited Zuma Beach for a more traditional experience). We parked across the street (no fee) from the beach ran across the street and took the small hike down to the beach. The beach was fairly empty on the Sunday that we went, we pretty muched stopped here to walk the beach take photos and enjoy the scenery for a short time before moving on with our day. There were several couples and groups that had set up shop on the beach with chairs a little music and blankets. The beach itself is nearly as wide or long as say a Zuma Beach but it is different, very romantic and overall worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alaska1986

50,underrated Gem !,"Every visitor to US who comes to Los Angeles, knows about Santa Monica Beach, courtesy 'Baywatch'. But 25 minutes drive onwards is this hidden gem of a beach at Malibu, called El Matador Beach. It is easy to miss, as this beach is not much visible from Road and you have to walk down a trail through picnic tables and stairs to reach this beach. It is small and not much crowded.There are rock formations on the beach which have been eroded at the bottom by the sea. It is a photographer's delight ! If you are coming with family, better bring your own water and foodstuff as nothing much is available here. This beach is also not very accessible for the elderly and handicapped persons. Kids are gonna love it !!! This is a fantastic location to spend a half day picnic and to get some lovely pictures !!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shasidpra
40,Cool rock formations but no sunset,We read the reviews about great sunsets so we headed down there about an hour before sunset. We got to the beach and the sun was behind the mountains. I'm not sure what people were talking about. It was still a unique beach with all the rock formations which is why I still rate it well. Just don't go expecting to see a sunset!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieW229

50,"The ""Secret"" Beach","Love this place. Been coming for years. Poorly marked with a small parking area and lots of steps to get to the small secluded beach below. Sort of a secret place but not to locals and definitely not for photographers. The stone arches and other formations are really great spots for many kinds of photography.Not a place I go for my typical ""Beach Day"", Zuma Beach, just a little North of here, is for that. No real place to put a blanket and when the tide comes in one can't even walk and stay dry. This place is for artist, lovers and maybe people who want to climb stairs by the Sea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat

50,Beach with fun features,"Don't go to the boring beaches. Go to El Matador! My three sons (ages 17-24) declared this the best beach ever. Sure, the water was cold in June, but they had a blast trying to run through the natural arches or trying to run out onto the rocks before the waves came crashing in. ""This is the best beach ever. It has features,"" my oldest son said. The large rocks make for beautiful scenery. A photo shoot of a girl in a bikini was going on while we were there. Don't worry about walk down the hill. It's not so bad. There is an $8 parking fee. Look for a small sign on the road pointing to the parking lot on PCH. It's beaufitul!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the72fish
50,Beautiful Beach,"A trail and stairs will take you down to a pleasant surprise. Not the typical beach found in So. Cal. It reminds me of the Oregon coast with rock formations. Not too many people here. Pack light as the trip down makes it hard to take much, but so worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinr735
50,Refreshing & Great for Photos!,"This was my first visit to the Pacific ocean, and I was just thrilled with this beach! I went in the evening (when the sun was setting), and that was incredible. I had never seen the sun set behind the ocean horizon like that. You have a perfect view of the sunset, and if you like taking pictures, this is the place for you. There are cliffs, and giant rocks with little tunnels/arches. There is a long walk down to the beach, but it isn't too difficult, and I rather enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelanieL425
40,Good Beach for Sunsets,"This beach is well situated for sunsets and lots of photographers were there. I like the beach a lot. It is all sand and rock. With a sea lion in the water if you watch. You can walk through the arch if it is low tide.Ok here is my idea that I have. When you park at the top of the beach access, you come to the trail where you walk down. If you go and look over the cliff at that point. You will see a wide expanse of beach framed nicely by some rocks. My idea is that if you wanted to propose to someone. You could write ""Will you marry me so and so"" in the sand and if you went to sunset with the tide going out you would have a very scenic and memorable proposal. You would probably have to get a friend to help you write your message in the sand and protect it from others while you arrive with your intended It might take a tad of planning. But it would be cool. That is just a bonus idea for anyone who might want to go to El Matador Beach. It is still nice for everyone else as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BradleyBurr
50,"AMAZING sunsets, geology and geography. Mussels and movie stars!","I loved everything about Malibu. Being a geology-lover, I especially loved the rock formations from ancient volcano activity, was transformed by the power of Mother Nature herself. The cliffs open to hide-a-way foot paths to a golden beach bathed in orange and purple hues from the setting sun. A professional photo shoot was happening, with a model dressed as a bride with the ocean and sunset in the background. The ocean creatures hardened to the rocks and the sand between my toes is the best feeling in the world. Simply breathtaking. What a perfect place to practice yoga! It's truly a Zen kind of experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanMitchell2003
50,best beach i've ever been to!,"This beach is amazing!! It was easy to find, however, make sure you wear tennis shoes because there is a hike to get down to the sand from the parking lot! Tons of hidden caverns and beautiful rock formations! We drove here from redondo beach and it was well worth the drive, can't wait to come visit again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennp514
50,The best beach we visited in Malibu,"This beach is very beautiful. You have walk down some stairs to the beach. It's wasn't crowded at all. All kinds of strange and beautiful rock formations. Birds everywhere including on the rocks. A small fee is required, but well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/regularjoe
50,Best California Beach!,"This was, by far, the highlight of our California trip. Malibu itself isn't as crammed with people as other parts of LA. Our friends took us to El Matador Beach; people, it was incredible. I've been to several California beaches, and El Matador blows all of them out of the water (no pun intended). To walk up the beach (in the northerly direction), you encounter all sorts of tide pools, beautiful (and clean) sand, and several water-carved caves. We'll let the pictures below speak for themselves.ConsThe only cons we can see is that you have to walk down several flights of wooden stairs to get from your car down to the beach - a foreseeable problem for handicapped people. Also, we ran into several movie shoots (apparently, they're always filming down there). The crew waves you through between takes. However, depending on your outlook, this might be a pro!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shortandhat
40,Spectacular uncrowded Malibu Beach location.,This is a gem. Must be mobile with steps and path down to hidden beach site. There is a parking fee (self-honor pay). Secluded. Lots of photo shoots happening. Can be crowded late afternoons weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skyavari
40,OMG!,"Skip the hustle and bustle of Zuma and head straight to El Matador. Breathtaking scenery and location. Very romantic and secluded.The only downside is the sea kelp and seaweed that gathers in the water and on the beach. Other than that, perfection!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelPoo
