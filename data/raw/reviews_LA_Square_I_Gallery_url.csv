40,A refreshing Gallery that displays the owners Point of View,"I do confess that I have exhibited with Marodeen in the past, however, I have also viewed other exhibits over the years that confirm his professional attitude towards art display, sales and, if needed, framing. He is a dedicated art lover and conveys that feeling in dealing with the works displayed in his gallery over the more than two decades he has been in business in Claremont. He also takes part in the First Saturday event each month when all the galleries in Claremont open their doors in the evening for a leiserly art event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Artisteyes
