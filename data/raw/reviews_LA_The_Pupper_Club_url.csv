50,Second Home For My 2 Fur Babies!,"Shiloh and Monkey love spending time with all of their pals at the Pupper Club! We don’t live in DTLA, but visit when we can for work and socially and are so excited to have found this gem of a facility that’s so centrally located. Having small pups, one being a senior, we worry that over stimulation and noise in a bigger facility may stress them out. Pupper Club feels more like home care, which is important to us because we feel like they’re getting personalized one on one attention. The staff is super friendly and there is always someone near the dogs! The parks are small and homey feeling and with 2 floors, our older boy can spend time upstairs in the more quiet area, where he can just chill out and watch TV. I love love this place and highly recommend it to anyone who really wants a special experience for their small pup.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/14MelissaR
