50,FANTASTIC PARK AREA TO WANDER AND RELAX,"While the memorial is pretty under-stated the whole area is so well done. They have fixed up the surrounding park lands and made it special. The chance to look up close at one of the 16 inch artillery shells from the old battleship days is something, especially with the USS Iowa right around the corner sporting 9 of them. Hard to believe they could toss a 'volkswagen' 25+ miles.",SenorGancho
