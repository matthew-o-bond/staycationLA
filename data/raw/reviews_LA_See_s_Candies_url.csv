50,"See's Candies at The Grove, Los Angeles","Note:This is a review for See's Candies at The Grove, Los Angeles - I couldn't find it listed and so am posting it here.See’s Candies take pride in their illustrious heritage. The matriarch Mary See is credited with developing her own homemade candy recipes. Mary had three children – after her husband’s passing, her only son Charles suggested that she move to California with him and his wife, where he could set up a candy company using his mother’s signature recipes. Given the success of the candy stores over the last one hundred (that’s right one hundred!) years, this was a truly inspired move.Their first candy store in Los Angeles came up in 1921, and it was supplied by the candies Mary made in the kitchen of their bungalow in Pasadena. See’s claim that some of their products such as the Victoria toffee, the chocolate walnut fudge, hand-dipped bonbons and peanut brittle continue to be made exactly as per Mary See’s original recipes! Mary See continues to be the face you see on every box of See’s Candies.The turning point for the big time came when Berkshire Hathaway bought See’s Candies in 1972 – apparently the legendary Warren Buffet has a discerning sweet tooth which marked out See’s from the rest. He is on record that See’s Candies is a “dream business”.A few years ago, See’s was named by Fortune as one of America’s greatest brands. See’s today has over two hundred shops across the USA, plus an online presence as well.Just go into See’s and see for yourself – this is one store where you can have fun - sample their stuff, look at it, inhale its flavour – truly heavenly. And while you’re there get yourself a box of See’s Famous Old Time Candies – Mary See is on the box smiling at you, knowing you’re in for a real treat!",TMenon

20,Tradition gone,"It is sad when you go into a Sees Candy Store that would make Mary Sees upset by the quality of service in this store, We purchased a can of candy and requested Traditional Sees wrap. and we were told no. They would give us the wrap but not wrap the can. Very sad when you can not provide a wrapped gift to bring to friends Sees has always offered to wrap but I guess in Pasadena the staff is to good for this The product itself can not be matched but the sales person should consider the Sees image next time before saying no. After all the store had only one customer, me",Steven A

30,Tasty,"Good service here. Its a small shop, but easy to get to and move around inside. I did not like the sample they gave me but, they were happy to get me a different one. I love the mint white chocolate- but its seasonal.",Lrwheel12
40,Nostalgic Candy Shop,"One of the better locations of this chain: small, but never crowded store with helpful friendly staff. And of course, you get a free sample just for walking in the door!",Ray Q
50,Chocolate store that makes you feel like family.,"I think it's time to give a review to my favorite See's Candies store located here in South Pasadena. It's always fun to come and get my chocolate fix here. I would also like to give a big thanks to Jeri who makes me feel genuinely at home every time I come in for some chocolate. The whole staff is quite friendly but in my opinion she stands out. They also give out free samples for you to try out from their nice display and selection. If you're in South Pasadena come by and visit. I'm pretty sure you won't leave empty handed. Prices are very reasonable, about 20 dollars for a pound and you get to hand pick your selection.",prothean
