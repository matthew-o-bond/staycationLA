50,Banning House - OMG,Went there with my watercolors and settled in to paint. Had gotten something to eat from the breakfast offerings and suddenly there is a BUFFALO about 25 feet from the window grazing! This place is full of history and intrigue. Very quiet place and gorgeous views from every window!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/41sherryr
10,"Two Harbors, you should have been there 5 years ago!","I'm little disappointed with Two Harbors town. Food has fallen off over the years, drinks are smaller (smaller cups for buffalo milk??), choice on menu are limited, and nothing healthy, all deep fried junk for most part. Even an order of fires is very small and expensive now It went from an amazing charming town to what now resembles a Disneyland-like tourist trap. There is now with a speed boat from Avalon to stock the town with day tourists, so they charge for over priced lounges and cabanas (started in 2017?) that Avalon tourist are use to. They removed the beloved though sketchy/rocky volleyball courts just to make room to grind out a few more bucks from ocean front Seems as though a new douche-y freshly minted MBA/CFO has come in from the main office to generate more revenue at the expense of the charm that was once associated with Two Harbors. This was the spot to get with nature and good people, and both of which still are there, but it has been cheapened with this money grab with no added real benefit to the consumer. If you had been coming for years you recognize this, but if you are new to Two Harbors, then it is just another tourist trap. Talking with others, they all feel the same - what used to be a multi-trip summer to Two Harbors is now just one weekend at most. Not one cabana is rented by anyone who came to stay at Two Harbors for a weekend or longer, this is for the day boat tourists from Avalon, and it has ruined the charm of the town. I am saddened to see this, and what is coming next to suck a few more dollars out of Two Harbors... BTW - The Banning house is very nice and still holds the original charm of this part off the island. It would be great if they started offering more food choices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricW19671
40,Quieter side of the Island,"Perfect place to sit by the beach with a good read or dip in the water a few steps away , and just do nothing under the ""Palapa"" Restaurant is a few steps away. It's nice that they have a laundry room close to the shower and restrooms.Wish we had time to look into the Banning house - ah well- that's for the next tripWe took the ""cyclone"" ride - $30 roundtrip; bring a light jacket as it could get a bit cold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meldyc2018
50,Another port of Santa Catalina,My wife and I took the Cyclone Ferry up the coast on a 45 minute cruise to see Two Harbors. We were surprised at how close the other harbor was on the West side of the island. There were many more trail hiking opportunities on this end of the island. We ate at the restaurant for lunch in between hikes. On the way back to Avalon the ferry pilot found hundreds of dolphins breaking water and slowed the ferry so we could enjoy the sight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardcC2349VO
50,Beautiful relaxed place to hang out with great hiking. Wonderful day trip from Avalon,"We took the 9:45am boat from Avalon, getting to Two Harbors around 10:30. We then hiked the 6.2 mile Water Tank Road Goat Whiskers trail loop toward the west. There is a long fairly steep climb to start but you are rewarded with fantastic views of the whole west half of the island and all the way to San Pedro and beyond. Gorgeous! The trail comes down on along the leeward side and back to Two Harbors. We were back by 2:00pm and had 1.5 hours to hang out at the beach and pavilion with lunch and beers before heading back on the 3:45pm Cyclone to Avalon. A fantastic day trip for anyone that likes to sightsee and hike --highly recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beebaly
40,Relaxing Day at Harbor Sands at Two Harbors,"This was our 5th trip to Catalina in the last 3 years so we were looking for something a bit different to do. We had briefly visited Two Harbors last year on a jeep tour, but decided to give the new Harbor Sands beach resort a try as a day trip. We traveled from Avalon to Two Harbors on the Cyclone speed boat, which was an experience unto itself (please see my review on Cyclone Boat for more info and recommendations).It was my birthday, so we splurged and rented a Palapa in advance. The palapas are stylish and very comfortable and come with plenty of nice beach towels. We had a great server who checked on us regularly to make sure we had all the drinks and food we wanted. It was totally chill. The palapa provided shade but we could pull the chairs and ottoman out onto the sand to enjoy the sun. We had planned on kayaking, but ended-up just enjoying watching the activity on the beach and in the harbor, eating and drinking. My husband went out on the pier and enjoyed shooting some video with his drone. I have to say it was an amazingly relaxing day!Harbor Sands is a private beach where you either rent a palapa or lounge chairs. The public beach is just below and you need to cross the public beach to access the water. My only complaint is that they should have steps going down to the public beach. The Harbor Sands beach is about 2 feet above the public beach, separated by a raised stone wall. If you are a bit older, hopping down to the beach and then trying to climb back up is challenging and potentially dangerous.We will definitely go back and next time plan on not being quite so mellow. Maybe some kayak time and a bit of snorkeling. I definitely recommend the trip. It is a totally different vibe from Avalon or the Descanso Beach Club and well worth the visit. We took the 10 am boat from Avalon and returned on the 4 pm boat which was just right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martik2014
10,No speed limit for Harbor Master boats in Marina,I had a mooring August 25 at two harbors and had Harbor Master boat #2 speed through open moorings and take short cuts all day. The marina has a no wake zone and speed limit of 5 mph or less but the Harbor master boats go as fast as they like and put out a foot and half wake. Very Dangerous situation as my wife hurt her toe trying to launch our dingy as one of their boat passed ours. I think they have a contest to see who can pick up the most passengers or make the most tips. Boat # 2 was definitely the winner.At around 9:30 pm a boat hit ours and left a scuff mark on the starboard side of the boat. It must have been the Harbor Masters boat since he was taking that short cut all day and night. I called the Harbor Master and said next time we will move you to another mooring. I told her it would of been fine if the would obey the speed limit that is posted on their website.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevejavelin
10,no speed limit for Harbor Masters boats,"I had a mooring August 25 for two harbors and witnessed the harbor masters boat #2 speed and leave a foot and half wake all day Saturday. It seems they do not have to obey their own rule of no wake or less than 5 mph in the Marina. It seemed they were having a contest to see who can pick up the most passengers or see who can make the most money for their service. They were cutting across moorings and taking short cuts through the open spaces all day. We tried to launch our dingy and we had to wait till those boats passed. They actually made it dangerous, wife hurt her toe when one Harbor Master boat passed by and made a large wake.At 9:30pm-10:00pm a boat hit ours and left in a hurry, I could not get up fast enough to see who it was but I would guess it was a Harbor boat since he was going throw an open mooring slip all day.I called Harbor Master and she said she never gets complaints about the speed and tells me she will put me away from the pier. I told her it should not make a difference if her boats stop breaking their own speed limit rule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjb047
50,Cyclone water shuttle on Catalina Island,"We have been coming to Two Harbors and Avalon for many, many years first with our small sailboat, then a larger sailboat, now our 36' powerboat, we stay on the boat in Cherry Cove and go ashore to two harbors using our dinghy or the shoreboat. If coming on your own boat, it is best to make reservations online before heading across the channel unless you have a mooring or one reserved from the owner. Yes, the moorings are owned by private individuals in Avalon, and private leases at the Isthmus, Cherry Cove and 4th of July cove, Cat Harbor and Emerald Bay. (Perhaps more). There is a new way to and from Avalon and two harbors and we were excited to try it last weekend. The new high speed yellow Cyclone boat. A fast and fun ride to Avalon and back, especially helpful if you need something that is not available in the smaller store at the Isthmus. If you want something fun to do try the Cyclone ride to see the more rural coastline part of the island, perhaps dolphins, deer and buffalo. From Avalon, spend a few hours in Two Harbors and return, be sure to purchase a round trip as there are very limited options for spending the night unless it is planned in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnawE8182XR

You leave at 1030 am from the green pier for the 45 min trip to Two Harbors and return leaving Two Harbors at 5 pm. The town isn't much of a town really. There's a restaurant and bar and nice clean restrooms. The beach is much like Avalon city beach; not a lot of beach and loads of anchored boats. There are plenty of lounge chairs and cabanas to rent set back from the beach on sand. There are kayak rentals and other boat rentals available to explore caves and beaches along the nearby coast.As it's name states, Two Harbors is the nThere are hikes in rugged terrain and many people who hike long treks across the island.arrowest part of catalina. You have a harbor on each side of the island just within 1/2 mile of each other. It's an easy flat walk.

50,"A Great Relaxing Get Away for a day, weekend or Longer.","Two harbors, via the Catalina Express, Personal power or sail boat or Helicopter, is a great relaxing day, weekend or longer trip. They offer camping, some lodging at the historic Banning House and a two houses you can rent. The sandy beach is great for kids, Adults and even dogs. The water is crystal clear and very refreshing on a hot day. They offer a variety of rental gear such as Kayaks, Paddle Boards, Scuba Gear and much more. They have a few dining options: The Harbor Reef Restaurant (upscale dinning but casual attire $$$) The outdoor Café and bar with sit down service (burgers, sandwiches, salads & appetizers and the walk up café offering breakfast and Lunch to eat at a table or to go for the beach. All of the food is excellent. They also have a general store with a wide variety of food, camping accessories, fishing gear, spirits and souvenirs. For those that do not want to relax on the beach there are many hiking or mountain biking options as well. I can’t say enough about this wonderful place.

50,A slice of paradise just twenty-some miles from southern California,"Two Harbors is primarily a boater and camper destination, but it does have one small (eleven unit) lodge, plus a couple of vacation homes.For boaters in southern California, there is no better destination, period! Twelve pristine coves with boat moorings, and a total of seven-hundred and twenty individual moorings, provide recreational boaters with the security of a mooring, and the scenic backdrop of a gorgeous offshore island.Campers have their choice of several terrific campgrounds, the favorite and most popular being the Two Harbors Campground located on a hill above Little Fisherman's Cove. With campsites and tent cabins (tents on a wooden platform with cots and tables included) for up to 400 campers, this campground is a true getaway.Catalina is surrounded by some of the absolute finest snorkeling, fishing, diving, and overall boating activities found anywhere.If you have not discovered Catalina Island, or Two Harbors, you are missing out in one of the greatest places on planet earth!There are several books available on Amazon about Catalina Island. Perhaps the best for Two Harbors visitors is 'Between Two Harbors, Reflections of a Catalina Island Harbormaster'. It offers great insight into life on the Island, and contains dozens of colorful and exciting stories about Island life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougoudin
50,Super family friendly peaceful respite just far enough from the mainland!,"A perfect visit and camp trip. Every staff member we met were pleasant, friendly and in great moods. They were happy. They made us feel welcome and happy as well. Yes it was Hot!, Yes, the Hornets were a hassle! I got stung...but we worked out that you had to get all your cooking and dish cleaning done before the sun got hot, the wasps/bees stayed away while it was cool. To spend your days swimming, snorkeling, scuba diving, paddling, you name it...we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Shuttle to Avalon is just way too expensive and the cost did not make sense to me. Especially since we are spending dollars in Avalon. Seems there could be a less expensive way to transport folks there and back for day trips? By the end of our week, we felt like locals. I will return and plan to pack a bit lighter. Thank you to all the hard working folks that truly made for an enjoyable week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeaweedSara

The place was empty, just the way we liked it. Paddled boarded along the outer harbor. Saw all kinds of fish, seals and birds, even a small Nurse Shark. Dinner on shore was wonderful (another review to come) and we got to watch some campers put on a play!Not sure what this place looks like in high season but it was uncrowded and perfect for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/riverpeople
40,"Quiet, small village with superb views","Stayed here in December at the Banning House. I chose this spot because I wanted a quiet environment where I didn’t have to interact with many people, a place my wife and I could just relax and enjoy the scenery. There are really two areas on the entire island people can stay, unless of course you are visiting for camping and hiking only- Two Harbors or Avalon are the choices, and in December there is a stark contrast between the two.Two Harbors is the quiet village in the countryside, while Avalon would be the busy town-life. The village of Two Harbors is a bit touristy; the place was dead during our visit due to the cold weather and off-year for the place. Heard rave reviews about the Reef Restaurant, but nobody was there during our visit and we brought in our own food, anyway.People are friendly and like to know about their guests' home. I think we must have been the first persons from Indiana there, they seemed to take a liking to us.So about the bison. These guys hang out all over the place. I never saw one in town, though, but was told sometimes they also go into the harbor and sit in the water during high tide in the summer. That would be a sight. We didn’t have any trouble with the bison. They just did their thing at a distance and we let’em do it. The island has many other animals, including rattlesnakes. I would have liked to have seen one in the wild (at a safe distance, of course) but I saw none. It was probably too chilly for them to venture out. We spotted deer while hiking and the Island has many foxes. I got into a close encounter with a fox one night. I was simply standing outside listening to the silence and looking at the dark sky lit up with stars when I noticed something moving. I looked down and a short-legged fox was just walking by. He didn’t even know I was there. He must have felt my eyes on him because he stopped dead and turned to look at me, then scampered away. There are many large birds, including ravens (or crows) and osprey. Several times we saw osprey with fish in their claws winging around looking for a dining spot. We also saw little tuna crab, thousands of them, on the beach. Unfortunately, they were getting stranded and dying on the beach because they don’t walk- they swim. Literally thousands were washing up, it is a bit sad. Just google tuna crab and you’ll see they are being affected by climate change.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adcjones
50,Camping Catalina in March,"It was our first visit this year and we decided then it wouldn't be our last. We were there 5 days and in 5 days we saw maybe 15 people the whole time. We felt like we had the whole island to ourselves, very romantic and beautiful. There is one store, one restaurant/diner & bar in all in one open at different times. Everyone was very pleasant and welcoming. We hiked during the day, enjoyed the scenery and at night we looked at the stars & listened to the waves crash. This has to be Catalina's best kept secret. Saw buffalo which was a bit scary yet exciting at the same time. We ate in the restaurant once since we took all our food and to my surprise it was Delish! Next year I plan on staying in the little cabins and eating at the restaurant/diner and won't take so much food. I highly recommend Winter Camping",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1980Sightseer

30,"Tourist dollars are not being reinvested, appeal is declining.","We have vacationed and scuba dived in Two Harbors every other year for the last 12 years. Two years ago when visiting there were no lockers for storage as there had been in the past. Since we always stay in the campground we would use the lockers for our scuba gear so that we didn't need to hike it up the hill. We were told the lockers were on order. Fast forward two years, still no lockers for storage. The lockers were pay for use, I am not sure why they were not replaced with the money people paid to use them. When we stay we generally reserve one of the tent cabins. In the past the campground has been clean and the tent cabins in good repair. Not this time. There was garbage littered around our campsite, not toilet paper In the porta potty for two days, and the tent cabin had an 6ft rip at the seam in the roof. None of the window flaps had straps to secure the flaps up for ventilation or down to stop them from flapping at night. As we looked at other tent cabins we noticed they also had tears, and missing components. The campground was significantly deteriorated from previous visits. Again, these a fee based amenities, why is the upkeep so poor? Lastly, the scuba rental gear and kayaks were also in poor shape. The kayaks were missing straps for gear and the hulls were full of dirty stinky water. The scuba gear was in very poor shape. The first day one of our regulators was not working properly at depth and I had to switch to my second for the rest of the day. The second day we had to wait 45 minutes for them to replace orings as they had no other functioning gear available. Two Harbors and the Dive Shop have always been great places. They just seem to be run down, and no longer aimed to customer satisfaction. For these reasons we have discussed finding a different place to go for family vacations. On the brighter side, the food at the restaurant and bar was very good. A bit salty but that is a personal preference as others thought it was perfect. Justin the bar tender is awesome and has reliably served us great drinks for many years now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love2travelPHX
10,"If you don't enjoy seeing animals stabbed to death, then don't come here!","t was very disappointing this year at Two Harbors Campground. If you do not enjoy seeing animals get stabbed to death, then do not come here. We've been coming here every summer for years, and we have never liked the spear fishing, but this time it was really out of hand and we will never return. It's bad enough that last summer drunk people went in the water at the most crowded swimming beach with their spear guns, endangering so many people including children, but this year we sadly saw so many people killing small kelp fish with their spears. These fish were obviously too small to eat. What is the point of that? Just killing for the sake of killing, killing for fun. These people remind me of the hunter who killed Cecil the lion. Also, I couldn't believe there were people casting their fishing lines into the water again at the most crowded spot on the beach and with people swimming and snorkeling in the water nearby where they were casting their hooks! But the violent spear fishing is definitely the worst. Fish feel pain and I can't imagine being stabbed to death like that! I cried on the way home; I can't take the senseless killing of the beautiful fish. I'm so sad that we brought kids with us and that they too had to witness people gleefully harming our precious marine life. I really wish Two Harbors would wise up and ban fishing, especially those stupid spear guns that only idiots use! My husband and I vow to never go back, instead we will only visit the islands that have MPA's (Marine Protected Areas) where no killing of our marine animals is allowed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/y0gachick

The views are peaceful and nice on both sides of the isthmus but plan to stay only a few days because there is not much to do other than drink (if your a boater) or hike!The restaurant, ate only one night the entire week in the dinning room, should have done more, the calamari steak was done very nicely, great flavor, good presentation, and large serving, my friend had the Pork Chop, stole a piece, it to was very tasty. Prices for two about $60 - 75The bar, it is where most spend their morning, the midday and then the evening! good service, price a little higher than they should be, but the company has figured they are the only game in town... so either load up the boat or ruck sack or be prepared to shell about $9.00 per mixed (well) $6.00 for 12oz beer. The signature drink Buffalo Milk $9.75 (really a $6.00 drink, but remember only game in town) be prepared to share with the NON Aggressive bees, more annoying than anything else!Snack bar food, usually very good and a little cheaper ($10 hamburger with fries) than the bar or the restaurant, but made in the same kitchen just, matters where you are sitting and if you get it your self.The ladies in the snack bar had no challenge in going the extra step to fix my coffee 1/2 hot water 1/2 coffee room for creamer and a splash of hazelnut creamer.Shower and bathrooms for camper and boaters alike during the day very clean, at night, well humans can be real pigs and that is an insult to the pigs, they really need to have someone go in about 10PM on Friday and Saturday, as one can imagine the bathroom gets gamey!Staff, when all else fails, they were there to pick up the pieces, very polite and very willing to please.Now I really want you to pay attention here, the staff live on the island, so they have a vested interest in keeping it clean, so please do really try and pickup after your self for Christ sake, I am sure you do not leave you dinning room or kitchen table looking like a war zone and you don't throw your wrappers on the living room floor!One last thing, the wages are not top notch, so tip, does not need to break the bank, but they do earn so much less than most of the people visiting!Due to water shortage 6 gallons of water for $1.00 per boat (from dock hose) per day, fuel about $7.80 per gallon self serve, the joke from the pier is self serve that is why it is so cheap!Hot Shower $2.00 per 2 min 30 sec for men, I was told the women get 3 min, bring your towel, soap, shampoo and sandalsSo have a great time!Cheers",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/522vh

A more rustic and tranquil alternative to the overdeveloped touristville of Avalon, Two Harbors has fantastic camping, hiking, swimming, fishing and other outdoor activities. I'm always impressed by the service of the TH Visitors crew who are always willing to help in any way needed.The ""town"" isn't much more than the Visitor's Center, dive shop, general store and a cafe/bar/restaurant. If you're camping, it's nice to be able to walk in and grab a bite or, if need be, supplies at the store. Be warned, there are no bargains here and everything is as overpriced as you'd expect. The beach at the far end by the campsites is great and have spent many a relaxing day there. Be sure to take the walk to the backside and check out Cat Harbor (the 2nd of the Two Harbors)!The place gets full during the Summer months and I highly recommend going mid-week, off-season and you'll have the place to yourself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffreyp919
50,Great place to visit off season.,"We took 50 Boy Scouts camping at the campground last weekend and had a blast. We usually have the whole place to our selves but this year we booked the same weekend as the Catalina marathon. The campground and town are a fantastic get away form Los Angeles. Outstanding views from the campsite of the harbor and the coast of California. It is a nice easy walk to the campground from the landing with a small uphill section. Walking to the other side of the island is easy from the campground and there is plenty of wildlife to view throughout the area. We saw foxes and bison frequently. The cost of food is a little higher on the island but we were never disappointed in the quality of what we got. The campground Ranger will deliver gear to your campsite and firewood if you don't want to carry it. The boat trip out was direct from the Port of San Pedro and not badly priced. It is well worth it to book for a three day weekend. We saw dolphins, whales and flying fish on the boat trip out. The water quality in Two Harbors is incredible and looked great for snorkeling and diving. The pier has an equipment rental place that will rent you kayaks, dive gear and tons of beach stuff. Highly recommend to everyone. Loved our stay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timg742

40,"""Sea"" a different side of Southern California","Have been coming by boat since the early '80's...I would recommend at least a day ferry trip for foreign visitors to Los Angeles. It's a chance to experience something about CA that is quite different from the freeways, the densely populated hip spots, and Disneyland. You will visit with friendly people, those that live and work on the island, and the boaters and their dogs. I can't believe that people complain about the dogs. I wouldn't come here if I couldn't bring my dog! This will be taken care of in a separate letter to the Island Company. To continue, you don't have to bring anything with you. Anything you need you can buy here at the well stocked store- for a price. There is a cafe and a restaurant. You can even rent camping equipment should you wish to stay. All types of water sports are available for rent as well. There are many hikes to take, most with wonderful views, and, for the last several years, there have been two buffalo that are always around...keep your distance! The local drink is called ""Buffalo Milk""...now you know why. There are just enough services to satisfy one's basic needs and nothing more. I would say that it is a ""rural"" environment and experience without being terribly uncomfortable, just dusty. Children of all ages seem to love it here and are often in abundance during the summer months. There is also a beach & free wifi on the island by the main area...well, I haven't checked recently but it used to be free. It costs if you are out on the water. It is very dark at night (be warned if you are walking) and the stars are terrific!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristiAnn818
40,Slow and easy go it.,"If you want a total down time vacation then Two harbors Catalina island is the place to be. No cars, one B&B a few camps sites and lost of boats. One place to eat and drink, your choices is inside or outside, fast food or sit down service. There is a ton of water actives to do here. Slow down and enjoy life here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nissan1515
50,a special place....,"this spot is pretty special, in my book...great water activities, fishing, diving, etc...trams and transportation to the airport and Avalon...come here on a boat for a few days hanging on a mooring....check out the night sky's and abundance of stars .......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richbonilla
40,Excellent Rustic Harbor for Sailors (and campers),"The beauty of this harbor is that it isn't overrun by tourists and day trippers. It appeals mostly to sail and motor boats and also a few campers (good camp sites.) There is one restaurant which calls itself the ""Best Restaurant in Town."" There is one small grocery. You can't bar hop because there is only one bar. I like this simplicity. If you want a more complex party scene, go to Avalon. If you want to ""hang"" with serious boat people, go to Two Harbors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joelgeyer
10,Beautiful Place to Get Ripped Off,"Two Harbors is still a low key & beautiful spot on Catalina but over the last 1 1/2 years the Catalina Island Company is doing everything it can to ripe it's guests, boy scouts & employees off. We've been visiting the island for over 23 years but ""greed"" has infested the operators. We understand supplies must be shipped in but it's not coming in from thousand of miles!! Here's an example: Plain house salad is $6.95, 1 scoop of Thrifty ice cream is $3.50, bag of ice $7, glass of beer $9, Buffalo Milk (island drink) $10, & gas was $7.30 a gallon. Then to add insult to injury on every purchase you make, they add a 4.5% fee that they disguise as a island conservancy. Yet when asked, where is the accountability of the fee, no one knows. Really, that's money they're lining their pockets with. On this last visit, I was talking to a couple who've been long time boaters that frequent the island. They said that in the past, many boaters would frequent the bar and had many meals on shore. But because it's gotten so expensive, boaters have cut way back on supporting the island mercantile. WOW! It's a shame the Catalina Island Co has forced people to limit visits & spending at the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LMC9359
30,Quietest harbour in California on a Tuesday?,"We travelled by wooden boat from Avalon, Catalina Island to Two Harbors as ""something to do"" away from Avalon (read separate review on the tour company trip). On our next trip we will take the ferry from the mainland (or fly in to the island airport - 1600 feet up) and stay in Two Harbors for the SCUBA diving that is available.Only one ""hotel"" - B&B and one restaurant the ""Harbor Reef Restaurant"" (both rated #1 in Two Harbors) to go to. The restaurant was good (see separate review) and the B&B well spoken of.Two Harbors is exactly that - one harbor called ""Two Harbors"" on one side of the island and about half a mile walk to the other side of Catalina Island is ""Isthmus Cove"" - another sheltered mooring harbour for vessels on the windward side of the island.Beside the two harbours, there is a large USC marine facility, the general store, a disc golf course, camping areas and most importantly the SCUBA shop. There sign says that they can rent SCUBA divers aa complete system for under $100. There is great diving around the island and NOT having to haul ALL your heavy diving gear is great.There were not many people around Two Harbours and only a handful anywhere near Isthmus Cove so if you want a quiet place to moor your boat towards the west end of Catalina Island or a unique trip from Avalon - try visiting Two Harbors you probably will not be overwhelmed by the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dive_ability
50,wine Festival,Great times at the 13th Annual Two Harbors Wine Festival! The vintners and food are great. It wasn't crowded and the attendees were friendly and happy. There should be a food only ticket option for non drinkers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/441deidres

50,23 Miles to a Million Miles Away!,"Most visitors to Catalina Island go to Avalon - it's a city, with hotels and attractions. If you want to see the quiet side, visit Two Harbors - there's a campground, General Store, Bar, Restaurant, Snack Bar, Beaches...hike, rent SUPs, kayaks, scuba dive kelp forests! It feels like a million miles away from the megalopolis of LA County! You can take the Catalina Express to get there and back in a day, or camp or make reservations at the Banning House.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/215LisaF
50,Bahia Azul Campsite,"The campsite is expensive, but well worth the price if you can rally enough people to fill it. Comes with firepit, Weber gas grille, semi private beach, 4 kayaks, two scenic balconies and multiple areas to set up tents.A perfect place to bring a group that's not experienced with camping, as you're not exactly roughing it. Secluded from the rest of the campsites for additional privacy, but close to the main village where there are showers, bar/restaurant and the dive/recreation center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/424NickB424
30,"They are conflicted, dog friendly or not?","On the one hand they have a dog friendly policy letting the dogs on the beach and they have a dog show once a year that is very popular but there are signs all over ""no dogs"" it's seems the catalina Island Co can not figure out if they are dog friendly?As a boater I'm confused why they offered a reservation system for the last two years and then change back to first-come, this really really makes it difficult if you trying to plan ahead at all.Last this being the only boating location on the West Coast of California, a destination with facilities mooring, they have captive audience and it feels that way sometimes. they could make a much bigger effort with offering services and upgrading the facilities and aesthetically it really looks like a trailer camp it doesn't seem like they're trying very hard.On the plus side food aok and the staff is very very helpful and accommodating.Note: It is illegal to count dogs and outdoor patios in the County of Los Angeles as of last year so they cannot make the argument anymore that was their position previously it's an elected decision by management and ownership to up be dog friendly or not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeaLarsGo
10,A Bad End to a Good Time,"Great stay until we wanted to get on the boat home. We stood a little out of line and a harbor department employee scolded us. When one of our party questioned her, she told us she was off duty and called the Sheriff on us. We tried to communicate with a superior and they refused to find us anyone to communicate our concerns to. Beautiful place horribly managed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/666DaveR
50,Sailing to Two Harbors,"Two Harbors is a great place for a weekend trip. Its mostly undeveloped, but there is are a couple places to eat and a bar with a DJ and dancing that attracts everyone on Friday and Saturday. You can camp, but why not just charter and boat with some friends and sleep aboard. You can fill you days with swimming, snorkeling, and hiking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brad_________DD
50,Highlight of My Year,Every year I come to Two Harbors with a group of my closest friends and it is hands down my favorite memory. You feel as though you're in the Mediterranean with the perfect amount of laid back and non-business without leaving behind the comfort of civilization. Much better than the crowded and over rated Avalon. Could easily stay my entire summer here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OliverS650

40,Banning House at Two Harbors Catalina Island,When I go for a fun trip of scuba diving from the Los Angeles Area this is where I stay.It has cool surroundings with a glob of old western History thrown inthe main lodge takes you back in time and allows great views of windward and lee sides of CatalinaThe diving and snorkeling is excellent on this side of the islandyou do need to plan ahead because there are not a lot of services on the west end of the islandone resturaunt one dive shop and irregular ferry service,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollywoodivers
30,Great ocean view at a clean camp site,"Just spent the weekend at Two-Harbors for a kayaking / camping trip around Catalina Island. Stayed at the Two-Harbors where you make your own camp site with your tent. We stayed at location ""O"" at site #2. Site #2 is near the edge of the cliff that overlooks the Two-Harbor cove. Very awesome view. The camp site was clean with a fire pit, wooden bench, and wooden overhang. The area was flat, but the ground was extremely hard so be sure to have bed padding or use an inflatable mattress to make your overnight stay more comfortable. The portable johns were about 30 yards away, which was close enough for convenience and far enough to avoid any stench. Be prepared for a small hike to the showers, which is about 1/2 mile or more away. Showers cost 50-cents for 90-seconds, so be quick. Camp management was helpful. They transport your gear from the dock to the camp site. Based on its location and price, its worth staying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationFamilyGuy
30,"A good day trip to Catalina Island, California","The town of Avalon is quaint and quiet, usually. Lots of shops carrying beach and island gear, souveniers, and interesting restaurants. A visit to the Casino building is a must, but you must plan ahead to get inside by taking one of the tours. There is a sandy beach, lots of beautiful boats in the bay, and plenty of opportunities to people watch. Go up into the hills for the Botanical Gardens. Since I live iin the area, I have not stayed overnight very many times. As the island develops more hotels and condo rentals, we are hoping to plan a weekend trip with the kids. The most commong transpertation is by boat, the Catalina Express, taking just about an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love4CentralAmerica
40,More rural than Avalon and more relaxing,"Two Harbors at the isthmus is a great place to visit, only 26 miles from LA but in a world of it's own. Lots of history about Catalina Island and Two Harbors gets you into the rural unspoiled areas away from the crowds. You can swim, bike, hike and see wonderful sites at every turn. Moore your boat, stay in a cabin, camp or visit a 1st class spa - all possible at Two Harbors. The Two Harbors Reef Restaurant serves great food and the staff is great. You can reach Two Harbors by express ferries from Long Beach, San Pedro or Marina del Ray. We rented a sailboat at MDR and sailed over and moored in the harbor. Water taxis will pick you up and take you ashore. What a great relaxing get-away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RM30139
50,Amazing place,"Decided to go to Two Harbors in stead of Avalon because it seemed like less touristy place. Catalina Express from San Pedro works fine, walk to campground is easy even with backpacks (and they provide towing for heavy stuff). Pretty much all campsites have ocean view. Toilettes are decent, showers too. There is a store in the village and one restaurant. No need to drag all the water and supplies from home.Hikes are fantastic, nice views, bisons, eagles; Pacific and LA can be seen from the same peak. Kayaking is good too. Very relaxed place, relaxed people, most of them came purposely to enjoy beatiful coves and less crowd. Water is clear, temperature the same as LA/SD.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Le_Chiffre
50,Elderhostel at the USC Wrigley Institute,"The USC Wrigley Institute in Two Harbors on Catalina Island offers a wonderful Elderhostel programs throughout the year; I attended in the spring (I don't think the island is always this green!) and found it an immensely enjoyable way to rediscover a place I had visited many times before.Exploring the ""West End"" of the Island was a totally different experience than my previous visits to Avalon; day trips to Two Harbors and through the interior offered a glimpse of the island I had never seen. Activities ""on campus"" explored marine biology, geology, and the history of the island. Accommodations are simple but comfortable, and the buffet style food (although not 5-star cuisine) was satisfying ""comfort food""...really just a neat trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoundtheworldGrannie
50,Awesome! Much better than Avalon!,"Forget the tourist trap of Avalon, and go to Two Harbors (not too many of you though, it is still a secret =). I had been to Avalon several times, and I though it was a very nice place- until I went to Two Harbors. I'll put it this way: Our wedding was set for Avalon, and once we were intorduced to Two Harbors, the wedding moved there! The Banning House for lodging is just a joy, and we like to visit often. There isn't the shopping and large array of restaurants like Avalon, but what they have is perfect. Check out the websites, and see if it is more your style: Laid back, private, relaxing, affordable, beautiful, and just a great place to enjoy nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_Twosome619
50,a great place,Great place to enjoy the water. Cafe food is very good. Bar had a band outside and enjoyed the music with a nice cold beer. Bathrooms were clean. Store had plenty supplies and gifts items. I nice place to enjoy the day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodean
