50,Santa Cruz Island - truly a unique destination -,"I have been going to Santa Cruz island most of my adult life. The island is truly a wonder, with hidden waterfalls, grassy plains, sandy and rocky beaches, amazing Sea Caves. You can get there on the ferry however this will limit you to exploring one of two destinations Scorpion Anchorage or Prisoners. The majority of the island is not part of the NPS and must be visited by private vessel or chartered vessel. I recommend calling Channel Islands Charter if you wish to charter a private vessel to explore the island outside of the the two destinations serviced by Island Packers.",Sean Q
50,Beautiful and Fascinating Spot to Explore,"We took the ""ferry"" from Ventura Harbor out to Santa Cruz, and added a side trip to Painted Cave. It was amazing - we even saw 2 bald eagles! Back on the island, we were able to see the endemic Channel Islands fox and scrub jay, too.",Perthenia
50,Hiking Santa Cruz Island,"Trails on Santa Cruz Island provide expansive views of the channel, or out to the open ocean! Depending on the season, you'll see wonderful wild flowers along the trails. If you plan ahead, you can also camp on the island and make it a multi-day hike. Likely to be foggy in the summer - sometimes the fall offers the mildest weather.",CLwriter
50,96 square miles,The two hour boat ride from Ventura is worth the trip. The island is enormous. The water blue. Walk around. Kayak. Enjoy the waves hitting the shore. This is an incredible national park.,barkus1968
50,A world away from Los Angeles,"We enjoyed a day trip to Santa Cruz Island in February. One anchorage was closed, so we went to Prisoners Harbor - it's about an hour and 20 minutes on the boat from Ventura. We hiked the Nature Conservancy trail to Pelican Bay and really enjoyed the chance to have some peace and quiet in nature. The guide from Island Packers was very informative, and I was excited to see two of the native species: the Island Fox and the Island Scrub Jay. The islands are beautiful and have beautiful views, and it was nice to spend a day enjoying nature. In February the temperature was mild (mid-60's) so we wore long sleeves but didn't need a coat. Overall the trip lasted from 9 AM through return about 5 PM, and although we had to get up early to leave our hotel near Anaheim, it was well worth it!",SnowyShasta
50,Day trip to wild paradise island,"Took the Island Packers boat trip from Ventura to Scorpion Harbor on Santa Cruz Island. 1 hour each way. Saw at least 100 common dolphins on the boat ride. Then did a hike from Scorpion to Potato Harbor, a moderate trail along the cliff. Though only 5 miles round trip, we took 2.5 hrs to enjoy the absolutely breathtaking scenery the whole way. The island looks like Jurassic Park. We spotted even more dolphins and a grey whale off the coast. The island foxes run around like squirrels. There is no civilization except an old abandoned ranch. Pit toilets are reasonably clean, no running water, not even trash cans.",Tobias Bear
50,"Beautiful Island, well worth the time and money",Absolutely beautiful island. The view from Cavern Point reminded us of Ireland when we saw the Cliffs of Moher. Breathtaking. Very windy and cool the day we went.,Rob H
50,Almost A Paradise Island,"A gem of a trip on a nice day. But check operations at the island before you decide because there will be a period of closure for the Scorpion landing in the winter season. That means you might have to settle for the Prisoner's Harbor site. The island is part of the U.S. National Park Service as are the other associated Channel Islands. The Nature Conservancy owns and operates the area near Prisoner's Harbor. if you travel via Island Packers, not to worry, they will handle the details. But if you sail on your own, make the proper arrangements first. You can camp at Scorpion and do loads of hiking over, say, a weekend. Some day trippers swim and snorkel. No fishing near Scorpion. Day hiking is excellent, with great views along the ridge line; but you need to be back to the boat dock for the later afternoon sail back. Volunteer leaders are available to orient you and take you on short guided hikes. Birders should search for the Scrub Jay and wildlife enthusiasts will find the Island Fox snoozing and sniffing near the picnic tables. Remember, sometimes sea winds are very strong and rain often falls from late December through early February. So you might want to monitor the weather and alter your plans if necessary.",Zoom_Gotti
50,Santa Cruz,See what the California mainland looked like 100 years ago. Santa Cruz Island has overnight camping and fresh water available. Bring your own food and pack out the trash. The channel islands are a national park and part is also owned by the Nature Conservancy. Be sure to reserve camping permission before you go.,Phil B
40,Santa Cruz daytrip,"Once in a lifetime experience, definitely worth it. Don’t expect a paradise island w soft sandy beach and tropical fish though. It’s rugged California ! Still beautiful charming and somewhat adventurous. I was worried about safety but felt very safe as there are rangers and kayaking/ snorkeling company personelle there. I was there mainly to kayak and for the scenery for a day.",Devotraveler
50,Perfect Weekend!,"This was just a perfect little getaway! Plenty of beautiful hikes to choose from and not crowded at all. I would recommend taking the guided sunset hike, the guide was awesome and we learned a lot, and obviously the harbor looked amazing with the sunset. We also did a kayak tour through the caves and snorkled. Our camp spot was huge but just make sure to have a rain fly or something because it rained all night in the middle of summer. For sure coming back.",800dash
50,Beautiful views and great docent tour,"Reserved boat ahead of time with Island Packers. Be careful where you sit on the lower level as you can get soaked (seas can be rough). Landed on Scorpion Anchorage and took the initial walking tour with the National Park docent...she was great and very interesting. It is only about a mile up the path and then you have the rest of the time to explore other areas. You definitely need to bring your own water and lunch (we all had small backpacks) although you can refill on the island. There is the option to kayak, but you probably don't have time to do both (hike and kayak). Definitely worth the trip. There are some campgrounds with tables as well as a museum of the island history (in case there is anyone in your party who doesn't hike). Limited or no cell service.",machoopes
50,Simply awesome,We booked a cruise from Island Packers to see Cueva Valdez and Painted Cave at Santa Cruz and we were amazed at all of the natural beauty. The shoreline was amazing and the hills were beautiful green. This place is pure magic and was certainly one of the best days trips I have been on in quite a while.,Michael W
40,Get away from the crowds,"We came in on the 9:30 am boat, and landed at Scorpion anchorage at about 11 am. First thing to note is that a bunch of the passengers immediately went for the bathrooms- four vault toilets just off the beach. The lines were long and moved slowly, so you might want to save time by using the bathroom on the boat or using the vault toilets at the campground instead. On arrival, we decided to take the guided hike, which was interesting and informative, and not difficult at all. The hike goes through the campground and then up Cavern Point Loop Trail clockwise, which is easier than hiking the trail counterclockwise. It ended at Cavern Point at about 1 pm, which was later than we expected. From there, we hiked along the bluff towards Potato Harbor and enjoyed gorgeous coastal views with our packed lunch. Coming back down Cavern Point trail, we could see Anacapa Island in the distance. I think this hike is an obvious and easy must-do, in part because of the views but also because it lets you experience the island without a lot of other people around you.Back down at Scorpion Anchorage, we checked out the visitor center- very small, with 2 rooms containing exhibits about ranching and wild life on the island. We then hung out on the beach, which was a very different experience: it’s beautiful, but crowded with people and kids, kayaks and snorkelers. The beach itself is made up of rocks, not sand, so bring water sandals if you plan on swimming.I enjoyed the island, but wish we’d had a little more hiking time. My advice would be to plan your time before arriving, pack a lunch, and bring a jacket because it can be cold in the morning. There’s a faucet with potable water at the campground, and changing rooms next to the four vault toilets. And definitely bring a camera! The views are beautiful, and the tiny Santa Cruz Island fox is fearless and easy to find.",travelerfromsj
50,Wonderful hikes and views with no crowds,"We took the day trip to Santa Cruz with Island Packers (reservations needed in advance usually). I would recommend going to the National Park Visitors center in Ventura Harbor the day before for a good overview and recommendations. The 8a boat trip arrived around 920a. We left a bag with some snacks and extra water in a fox box by the information center and bathroom. Make sure to take the guided tour around the back half of the Cavern Point Loop trail - 20 minutes after arrival. Linda was a wealth of information and gave us much more appreciation for the island. There were plenty of island foxes, ravens, flora and even a few scrub jays. We then hiked to Potato Harbor, where we had lunch with a view. We then hiked back via road with a canyon view. After using the pit toilets, take a brief tour of the visitor center and replenishing our water, we then hiked up the other side of the Cavern Point Loop trail. The morning had been shrouded in marine layer while in the afternoon was mostly clear with a view towards Anacapa. We hiked back down the same way with a view arriving back at 415p in plenty of time for the 5p boat back to the mainland. Bring layers of clothing as the morning was cool with a breeze and the marine layer blocking the sun. The afternoon warmed up at Scorpion Anchorage with plenty of sun - make sure to bring sunscreen. You also need to bring water (there are a couple of water spigots at the campgrounds) and your own food. The boat has some snacks, but I recommend getting something from the grocery store or cafe before the boat trip. You can also rent snorkel gear or go on a kayak tour (reservations recommended) - we did not have time to do this but other visitors recommend both through Santa Barbara Adventures. If you have waited to late to book Island Packers, try looking again right before the cancellation period (72 hrs in the summer) and you may luck up. You can also get on their waitlist. We will definitely be back.",gm4pack
50,We circumnavigated Santa Cruz Island!,"We circumnavigated Santa Cruz Island! Our plan was to take the Island Packers boat to Santa Rosa Island. But on the way we needed to drop off 80 campers on Santa Cruz Island. After dropping them off, plus a great deal of deck space, the boat went around the backside of Santa Cruz. Wonderful opportunity to view the coves and beaches and hillsides.After our visit to Santa Rosa Island we were able to view the other side of Santa Cruz.An amazing adventure on our circumnavigation of Santa Cruz Island was entering the Painted Cave! Perhaps the highlight of the entireSanta Cruz Island was beautiful, cragged with water caves and beautiful coves and beaches.",Cavydad
50,California as it once was,I doubt many So Cal Visitors will make this a priority but we all should. Just 1 hour boat ride from Ventura harbor with Island Packers.,Michael M
40,Unique Experience,"We visited Santa Cruz Island and it takes almost two hours to get to the island from Ventura another about 45 minutes for PC Cave. Please do carry a lot of warm clothes, specially if it is a chilly day. We were luck to see Whale. Dolphins, sea lions etc. If you are not camping on the island take cruise PC Harbour and PC Cave. On way back you will get about two hours at PC Harbour, enjoy a half mile walk up the hill you get to Cavern Point. The view of the ocean is beautiful from up there. PC Cave is excellent.",sorabh
40,Had to Visit--Wish We Had Been Better Prepared,"Santa Cruz was a ""must see"" for us, and we had read in advance that there were no services on the island but neglected to plan for a long day on the island. We did not make arrangements for taking a lunch and only had one water bottle between the two of us when we boarded the boat. Thankfully there was a gally that we were able to purchase a couple of additional waters and two granola bars. That boat ride was wonderful, and the crew slowed down to point out playful dolphins--it took about an hour to travel the 25 miles to the island. We arrived around 10 and had to be back at the dock at 3:00 for our 3:30 departure. There are a number of trails to explore, but, sadly my husband had a bum knee, and we were only able to walk a limited amount and unable to explore as most were. After our short hour walk about and no lunch to consume our time, we just waited and waited for the boat to take us back to Ventura. If circumstances would have been different, this would have been an amazing adventure.",Linda F
50,Unique,We took a day trip on the boat out of Ventura. The day was pretty foggy and overcast. I suggest heading out towards the campground (right). At campsite 22 head out towards Potato Harbor. As you come back loop towards the Cavern Point (much easier going down than up to Cavern Pt). This will give you a nice hike all along the water. We had lunch out at Potato Harbor and then headed back. If you have extra time walk the beach. Keep your eyes open for cute island foxes.,Rachel J
50,Trip of a lifetime!,"I did not know the Channel Islands existed until we bought a National Parks board game. Once I knew it jumped to the top of my bucket list and I am so glad it did! First of all we used Island Packers Outfitters and they were great. I would suggest booking your trip as soon as you can as there is limited space and you must reserve the ferry for each leg of your trip. Also be sure to return in plenty of time to board the boat as there may not be a space for you on the following trip.We hiked 5 miles during out day on the island and enjoyed every single second.Here are a few things that may help you:1. Bring tissue, wipes and hand sanitizer because the only restrooms on the island are out houses.2. Wear layers, the ride on the boat was chilly but the day warmed by the afternoon on the island.3. Bring food and water for the day. We brought healthy snacks and bottles of water and it was perfect.4. Bring a trash bag, you will carry out your trash with you. Keep this in mind when you pack your food choices.5. Look over the trail map and make a plan for the day when you first arrive. The ranger will give you an overview of smart suggestions when you first get off of the ferry.6. You MUST secure your belongings. We watched a fox dig through a duffel that was dropped and grab a bag and take it into the underbrush. They are skilled! The ravens are too, by the way!7. Consider bringing a blanket to sit on. I used the blanket to keep warm on the ferry and then we sat on it along the cliff of Potato Harbor to eat lunch. I was glad I did because there were small thorns in the grass that did not end up on my clothing.8. Take a ton of pictures- the beauty will leave you in awe.",Melaney68
40,Rigorous Hikes in Peaceful Setting,"I most enjoyed the peace of the island since the ferry only brought a limited number of people here a day. We spent most of our day on hikes that had no one else on the trail. However, the landscape never truly changes and there is no shade from the sun. The trails are all mostly up or downhill so it can become strenuous. I'm not certain it was worth the cost of the private ferry to get there, but something to see if you are in the area and love national parks.",ThomasTSF
50,A Pleasant Surprise,"I spent a day on Santa Cruz and I really enjoyed it. On the boat ride there, I saw tons of pelicans, grebes, cormorants, bottlenose dolphins, and a humpback whale. Once on the island, I started hiking. There were many wildflowers along the path at Smugglers Cove. I could see Arch Rock and the Lighthouse at Anacapa from the trail. There were many ravens on the trail. The Scorpion Canyon Trail is really amazing. There are many unique plants and the trail is like that of Shenandoah National Park. I did see an island scrub jay. On the Cavern Point trail, I saw wonderful ocean cliffs that looked like Ireland's Cliffs of Moher. I also saw 3 Island foxes on the trail. As the tide lowered, I could see kelp. On the boat ride back, I saw Dall's porpoises, a sea lion, and a harbor seal.",Eric F
50,So pristine and so close to Los Angeles!,"We had a wonderful day trip and hike to Santa Cruz. We saw many plants and birds and even a few foxes. The views from the hills are just beautiful and the best part is the lack of amenities - all food and drink must be brought in and all trash removed. Even though other people were also hiking, we rarely ran across them on the trails, making it feel more secluded and special. This is definitely an experience worth repeating. Next time I would like to camp and kayak!",Movinup
50,Gorgeous and peaceful,"We took a catamaran with Packers Island, a national park concessionaire 1 1/2 hours to one of the Channel Islands, Santa Cruz. The trip through the marine sanctuary was lovely with sighting of dolphins. The park has fantastic opportunities for hiking, camping, kayaking, and snorkeling. The views from the trails along the coast are breathtaking. This is one of the nicest of the 60 national parks and should be on everyone's list to visit. You really feel like you've gotten away when you're here.",John M
30,Worth one visit,"We visited Santa Cruz Island yesterday. It takes almost an hour to get to the island from Ventura. It is cold on the boat so take a lot of warm clothes. Once you get there, after a half mile walk up the hill you get to Cavern Point. The view of of the ocean is beautiful from up there. It is a nice quiet island with foxes, and ravens. We were warned about tickes. Will I return? No! I will not return because I have seen way more spectacular ocean views and much nicer camping areas in Big Sur and Monteray. Also, I found the sea trip boring. Imagine staring at the ocean for a long time while you are cold and sea sick.",RoP
50,For food on Channel Islands check out Channel Island Provisioners,"Channel Island Provisioners has its own page on Trip Advisor - made our trip so easy!! Neal will deliver a cooler to the Island Packers boat dock filled with delicious, high quality food for your trip. The menu is flexible.",LightningSpeed
50,Beautiful and Serene,I loved coming to Santa Cruz with our infant. I loved hiking around and seeing the foxes. We saw a baby harp seal as we were leaving. It was a wonderful day. Make sure to bring all the food and water you will need! There are no amenities available except for a water spout at the campground. Enjoy your day “away from it all”. I found some sea glass at Smuggler’s Cove which was pretty fun. Leave what you find for others to enjoy! I can’t wait to go back with my other children.,cecilyJ
50,Really really nice park/island!,"We did the regular day trip to Santa Cruz island and had plenty of time to hike around 7 or 8 miles. We hiked along side the cliffs, and then some interior trails. We saw probably 4 or 5 of the island foxes.",502bbb
50,another gorgeous National Park,"enjoy the scenery, the peace and quiet that seems a million miles removed from civilization. It's here that we saw the endangered Santa Cruz Island fox for the first time. In fact, there were quite a few and they didn't seem to be disturbed by our presence. There is so much to do here: hiking (various level of ability), like one to the Torrey Pines forest - the world's rarest pines and only one of two naturally groves occurring in the world. The coast line is rugged and the ground is mostly dry (virtually no rain has fallen) but interesting plants/flowers abound. Wear good hiking shoes. Bring water, sun protection and a hat. You are in a wonderful place that offers everything from tide-pooling to you name it.",Marion W
40,"Channel Island National Park-Santa Cruz Island - Beautiful island, interesting history and hikes","We took a boat from Ventura, California which was a beautiful and short ride (about 1 hr) to Santa Cruz eastern section. This section has more services and easy hikes.When we got there we took the hike with the naturalist and it was easy and we had gorgeous views the entire time in addition to learning about the island and geography. Make sure you bring some lunch and water as there is no place to buy any food. You can find water faucets in the campground which is very close to where the boat docks though.",mlevison1
50,Beautiful,"This is a U.S. national park. It will cost you $80 for the boat ride ovet with Island Packers. The ships are clean, new and run on time. The island is clean and uncrowded. Campground is in a eucalyptus grove; easy walk from the dock. Watch out for the foxes; they will rob you blind.",HmanSacto
50,Chinashop53,"Make sure you book boat trip first, avoid possible disappointment if you walk in and everything is booked. Ship ride out was very rough, high swells, loved it however several people ended up seasick. Small tip if you are susceptible dont eat before you board. Island nice great vegetation, and cute fox endemic to Island. Nice hike to see some pretty views. Had good fortune of coming across large pod of dolphins to view and a Humpback whale on return ride back to Ventura Harbor",John H
50,A true adventure!,"Phenomenal experience right from the hour-long crossing from Ventura Harbor to Santa Cruz Island. Once there, we were instantly smitten with the landscape and the realization we were so far offshore on such a pristine island that might just as easily been confused with a mainland mountain experience :)",EasyE61
50,Lots of hiking on a day trip,"Went out to Santa Cruz Island on Island Packers for a cloudless day of hiking. The temperature was perfect, the trip out was a little rough however once were on shore and got our briefing from the volunteer, I did about four hours of hiking along the trails. I had brought all of my food and water with me because there is none of that available on the island. There was lots of sun so you have to be aware of taking precautions. Saw lots of foxes and ravens on my hikes.",NationalParksTrails
30,Same day trip... Great for first timers..not so much for the others,"If you have hiked trails bordering beaches, then you you will be disappointed.Very similar to the Wilder state Ranch trail in California. I would give rate Wilder State Ranch higher, in terms of awesomeness.If you are first timer, this is a very nice place. Beautiful location. Great Kayaking and some kid snorkelling fun.We landed at Scorpion landing and it has a very small rocky beach. We saw couple of snorkelers and they were not that excited.While we did not do the kayak cave tour, one of my friends did and they enjoyed the experience.We did the Caravan point trail and continued to the Potato Harbour trail point. Tad disappointed as we have been to similar hikes elsewhere that were better.Some tips.- There is no trees or any hade whatsoever on the trails, so it gets very uncomfortable during hot days. Need to emphasise, NO SHADE.The hike itself was easy, maybe moderately hard in patches, but again, feels harder because there is no shade.we started our hike at around 9:30 AM, completed both the hikes around 1 PM at a very leisurely pace and returned to the landing beach aorund 1 PM. Lazed around for couple of hours and left at 4PM for the boat ride back to Ventura.There are basic restrooms at the starting point and NONE on the trails. Since there is no trees or big shrubs, it might be tricky for ladies to take a bio break anywhere on the trail.Wildlife:The biggest animal is the Fox that is no bigger than a small dog. The ravens look bigger than the fox. We saw couple of lizards, ravens, a lone fox..While this island is called the Galapagos of California, the comparison is kind of lame for the ordinary tourist. Maybe this is good stuff for the serious researcher who will be excited at some plants.the boat ride was uneventful. we did not see a single dolphin or whale in the entire journey. We had taken the 8 AM Dep and returned back at 4 PM.Some boat seating tips.Avoid sitting on the top deck in the open, unless you want a bad sun tan.Will I go back? not for the trials, but maybe for the sea caves kayaking, but I am sure there are other alternate spots that are logistically easier.Food:there is NO food, some water (available in the campgrounds). So I highly recommend pack your food and water for the entire trip.",crajiv
50,Step into another world right off the coast of LA/Ventura,"We took the Island Packer Ferry, booked through Channel Islands Adventure Company, to Scorpion, Santa Cruz Island. I can highly recommend both of these companies. You need to arrive an hour before your boat leaves, and by time you unpack your things, check in, go to the restroom, etc most of that time is used up. You board the boat and the ride takes a little over an hour. If the captain or crew spot wildlife, they slow down and explain. We saw sea lions and flying fish on our trip over. Once docked, workers meet you on the island. Those who plan to kayak join one group and those hiking, another. During the talk, the wildlife and other important information related to the island is explained. For example, no food should be left out as the foxes and ravens will eat it. The ravens can even unzip backpack zippers to steal food and shiny objects such as car keys. Once the explanation is over, you can then hike, kayak or snorkel for example. There are quite a few hiking trails that are rather simple with great views of the cliffs and ocean. You can hike on your own or join a tour. We went on our own, and it was easy enough. My husband then went snorkeling and saw quite a few fish and several rays. One of the highlights was the kayak tour. During our tour, there were literally thousands of bright red crabs in the ocean, near the surface (and a huge flock of seagulls having the time of their lives). It was pretty amazing. Even without the crabs, kayaking in and out of the sea caves was very interesting. Another highlight was the little, cute foxes that were quite comfortable around people. They just did their thing regardless of who was around. When going to the island, be sure to bring everything you need for the day, such as water, lunch, sun tan lotion, sun hat, glasses, etc. There is a little store run by Channel Island Adventure Company, but there is no food sold. They do have water in large containers that you can drink, but we brought our own water, just in case. There are toilets, but no flush toilets. There is also a little visitor’s center which is worth a quick stop inside to learn about the history. There is also a campsite for those who want to camp overnight. At the end of the day, you board the boat for the ride back over.",tinaNtravel
50,Gotta See This Island Before you Die - Its AMAZING!!,"You can certainly do a day trip, but if you do, you'll be disappointed. Plan on staying over for a few nights and really exploring this natural wonder - you'll be glad you did!",Greg L
50,Great National Park,I am a self proclaimed National Park junkie so I take every chance I can to visit all of these national treasures that I can. We took the 8 AM ferry out to the island and got to see lots of wildlife on the boat ride out thanks to the awesome job by Island Packers. We also did the sea kayaking an loved it. We also hiked the Cavern Point loop trail. It was a moderate hike for us but beautiful views.,BRIDGET B
50,BETTER THAN I IMAGINED,"Island Packer Ferry gets you there, from two locations, Oxnard and Ventura. Just go to the website and pick a day and time, at least a week in advance increases your choices, $60 round trip per person. You must be at the ferry dock an hour in advance. You can go for several hours, the day or camp overnight. I rented a kayak from Channel Islands Kayak center , which is located next door at both locations. (They have doubles and singles, a double was $55 for the day and includes all gear.) Before renting the kayak, you must ensure that there is space for it on the ferry by calling the number on the ferry website. A single kayak space is $19, a double is $29. As soon as you arrive at the ferry, go next door to the kayak center to fill out paperwork. Then you must carry your gear to the midship and the kayak to the back of the ferry, where staff will load it on. Once you reach the island, staff will unload your kayak and bring to shore (A tag on the bow of the kayaks has renters' names.), and will put your gear at top of the pier where you disembark. Your initials will be duck taped to the gear. It does add up to be quite an expensive venture, but is very worth it to explore the sea caves around the island. Be very careful in the caves- even as an experienced kayaker, I came close to getting into trouble a couple of times and definitely wear your helmet- a swell or wave can quickly lift you up and bash your head into the ceiling or wall of the cave. There are guided tours which I would highly recommend if you are not an experienced paddler. There is snorkeling, very cool and beautiful hikes.. A small and informative museum, pit restrooms and picnic tables. We were met by the island's full time ranger as we disembarked. The entire place was very well kept and clean, kayaks and gear are safe on shore while you go hike. There are birds and foxes that like to steal food, keep this in mind. There are metal ""lockers"" to store food and other small items while you are out and about exploring. No locks, and we didn't seem to need them. Pack a big lunch, snacks and water, and take water with you if you kayak. It can be a fight against the wind, especially in the afternoon. Sooooo amazing, a dream come true.",Katrina M
50,Half day well spent,"We decided on a half day trip out to Santa Cruz Island. We reserved a round trip boat ride there with Island Packers. They delivered the promised services, were on time going in both directions, and the ride was bumpier going out than coming back in to the mainland (we were on two different boats). Only disappointment was that we saw no sea animals going in either direction. The time on the island itself was fascinating, especially since we were able to join a small group going on a hike with a volunteer National Park ranger. She was able to tell us about the history of the island and what has happened since the National Park Service took over the operation of much of Santa Cruz about 20 years ago. We had a good hike up from the Scorpion landing site so that we could get great views of both the island and the surrounding Pacific ocean.",Donald K
50,Beautiful Island!,"We had great experience with Island Packer Cruises. We went to Santa Cruz Island on Sunday. The boats were full at 8 am and 9 am. The staff were friendly and helpful. The procedures boarding the boats were easy and professional. The boats were well maintained. The captains showed us the dolphins on the way to Channel Islands National Park and back. The harbor is beautiful.The one way boat trip is about 1 hour and 15 minutes. There are food for sale on the boat and at the beach. The restrooms are on the boat and at the Scorpion Beach.At Scorpion Beach, the pier is good. The beach is rocky. The water is cold in summer. We stayed in shade by the cliff to wait for the boat. You could swim, kayak, and snorkeling at the beach.It is about 0.5 mile one way on the moderate trail from the Scorpion Beach to the Cavern Point. The views are beautiful. We had lunch near the Cavern Point.We didn’t have time and energy to hike to the Potato Harbor.To hike on the long trails on the island, you could book the first boat at 8 am to the island and return with the last boat at 5 pm to Ventura.",BangkokSachse
50,Gorgeous Place,What an incredible gorgeous place and this is in my backyard! The hike and the views are worth coming back again.,guzmanbe2
50,Untouched nature is a ferry ride away,"We caught the Island Packers ferry out of Ventura - a short drive from LA. It was over an hour on the boat and it was choppy and we felt a little sick in the closed deck so we stood out on the deck which helped a lot. Once there, there's great hiking and amazing views of the untouched coast. No stores. No hotels. The island has wild foxes who will steal your snacks if you aren't aware. So cute - but so sneaky. We took a guided ocean kayak tour with Santa Barbara Adventure company. It was the highlight of our trip to CA - it even beat the lovely side trip to the redwood forest.",Rebecca R
50,Perfectly Remote but Conveniently Close,"I've visited many National Parks, but my stay at Santa Cruz Island in Channel Islands National Park was quite spectacular. It feels very much like California, but because the number of people on the island is limited by the number of people who can make the boat trip out and by the number of campsites, you can quickly find solitude and unique scenery once you're out on the trail.Because I am not much of a backpacker, I opted to stay in the Scorpion Campground, where potable water is available. The facilities were pretty rustic but very adequate, and over the course of two days, I had an amazing time with my best friend. We hiked up to El Montanon to get 360 degree panoramas of the island's splendor, watched a spectacular sunset at Potato Harbor (I recommend taking the coastal road to enjoy amazing vistas along your way), enjoyed camping with phenomenal views of Venus in a starry sky, learned a lot about the island's history in the visitor center, and had up close encounters with foxes, birds, lizards, and seal pups during our excursions on the island and on a kayak tour of the sea caves around it.The weather can be a little foggy in the mornings, but this usually burns off by the afternoon. The fog is actually nice since most hiking trails are fully exposed!",via_the_bee
50,Wonderful,"This was our first trip to Ventura and Channel Islands National Park. There are 5 islands that you can visit. Each island will take 1 day to visit. We picked Santa Cruz Island. There are 2 piers that you can choose from, Scorpion Anchorage and Prisoners Harbor. The Scorpion Anchorage locates on the tip of the island and Prisoners Harbor locates in the middle shore line.Santa Cruz is the largest island, it is about 97 square miles. There are camp grounds, dug in ground toilet and water. When you visit the island, you will need to bring your own foods and anything else that you might need. The islands is Federal Wide Life Preserve. You are not allow to feed animal, take away anything from the island. Santa Cruz has numerous hiking trails for all physical fitness. The only way to enter all the islands is through Island Packers. They have scheduled boat rides to and from the islands. Upon arrival at the Scorpion Anchorage, you will need to climb up a ladder of 3 steps to go up to the pier. The boat crews were well trained and assisted you to climb the ladder.Any one with physical challenge, might have a difficult time doing so, but we were told that they have assisted the wheelchair passenger up to the pier.You soon will notice fresh air, and wonderful scenics. The temperature was cooler on the island than the main land. Park ranger recommended you dress in layers. There was a brief orientation at the pier of do and don't then we were on our own. We were offered to hike the guided trail with the volunteers but we preferred to be on all own. You can rent kayak and snorkel equipments on the island. The services are provided by the Island Packers. Reservations for the activities are recommended.We saw several island foxes, and was told that they are the largest animal on the island. They only weight 5 pounds. We were on 10 am departure time from main land, and return time of 4.30. We are not much of the hikers therefore 6 hours were plenty of time for us to enjoy the island. We definitely will be back to explore the remaining of the islands.",d2s1c2j
50,Hike Prisoners to Scorpion,"I took a one-way ferry to Prisoners and hiked to the little backcountry spot called Del Norte Campground. There's tables and not much else. A kinda-private outdoor pit toilet set away from the camp ground. I decided to actually keep going the first day and ended up just sleeping on the trail. I wasnt trying to cook anything etc., so I just need to sleep and did not need a campground per se. The rest of the hike to Scorpions was fairly easy in my opinion, even though some trail maps say its ""strenuous."" I guess its a relative term, so maybe its hard for people out of shape or not used to hiking. The one little kind hard spot is the last ten minutes up to the peak of the trail where some basic experience hiking on loose rocks helps. The descent down to Scorpions is easy in my opinion.",Jackson S
50,"Beautiful views, relaxing hike",Spent a wonderful day with my dad hiking out to Potato Harbor and finished with an hour or so on the beach. Can't wait to go back and do some kayaking!,Lac0220
50,"Highly unusual place, unique animals, beautiful scenery","Go here if you get the chance. No place to stay over, camping or day trip only. Island Packers books the boat trips over, taking an hour to cross. Seas can get rough so take 2 Dramamine if you get queasy at sea. On-board snack bar and beer and wine at reasonable prices. They take the time to pause if there are whales or dolphins of porpoises on the way-- we saw maybe 1000+ as far as you could see. Historic ranch buildings. Unique miniature island foxes, almost went extinct and now recovering, do not feed them but take lots of pictures.",ANonyMouse45
40,Went sea kayaking and hiking here.,"I went sea kayaking and hiking here after book a full-day outing with Channel Island Adventures. On the ferry ride out and back, you can see sea-life such as sea lions and dolphins, and the boat slows down so that you can get a better look. There are few amenities on the island and you need to bring your own food and water and carry all your refuse out. By hiking the cliffs, you get a good view of the island. The native foxes wander throughout the island and since they and the ravens are adept at getting to the food in your back pack, you need to use special animal proof lockers.",Howard S
50,Great place to hike,"Book your trip in advance with Island Packers. Pack a yummy lunch and take plenty of water. Be prepared for a beautiful day filled with photo opportunities. If your lucky, I'll see Island foxes.",KP_travel_focus_shoot
50,Beautiful!,"The kids (13 & 16 years old) and I took the boat to Scorpion Anchorage on Santa Cruz with Island Packers leaving Ventura Harbor at 10AM and returned on the 3:30 boat. I was worried this wouldn't be enough time on the island, but it was perfect! On the trip out we saw a whale, which the boat captain pointed out and stopped for viewing.Once on the island, we quickly broke away from the other 100 people arriving and hiked to Potato Harbor where we sat in the grass and enjoyed our lunch. The views are incredible! We saw several island foxes --cute! We then hiked along the ridge (I think it's the Cavern Point Trail) to Cavern Point and then back to the ranch. We made it back in plenty of time to look around the historic ranch and walk on the beach before boarding the boat back.This was such a great day! Nice to get away from all the traffic, people and theme parks!**There is a ladder to climb to get from the boat to the pier and the beginning of each hike is uphill.",claytravisamy
50,Beautiful island with a lot of endemic species,"The island is unique with a lot of endemic species like the island fox. It was great to cut off from the day-to-day hustle and unwind on this beautiful island which has a lot to offer in terms of sea activities as well as trails to hike.Everyone, day travellers and campers alike are required to undergo an orientation where the ranger explains the to-dos and not-to-dos.We had the Discovery kayaking tour booked right after to explore the amazing sea caves. The sea caves, ocean kelp, harbor seal, clear water with purple urchins were simply brilliant.We set up our tents and then took an hour-long loop to the potato harbor and back to the coast. Unfortunately, the day turned out to be very misty and we missed the ocean colors. Mist has it's own beauty nonetheless.Beware of the island foxes while cooking and also when you're not around your stuff. Make sure everything, especially food, is locked in the bear box and the tent is zipped upwards. The foxes and ravens are known to be a nuisance.Foxes are super cute, though - they are native to these islands and aren't found anywhere else. Please avoid feeding them or any other animals on the island.",Dhwani Parekh
50,The Galapagos of North America!,"We visited Santa Cruz Island and Channel Islands National Park for a day trip from Ventura Harbor on a boat from Island Packers. We left Ventura at 9:00am and returned from Santa Cruz Island at 4:00pm. We pre-purchased our tickets online for about $60 round-trip. Flying via charter plane or sailing via private boat are the other ways to make it here. The boat ride is between 1-1/5 hours line.Once you dock on Santa Cruz, each passenger must climb up a 4-step ladder to reach the dock at Scorpion Anchorage. Once on ground, there is a short orientation by a National Park Service volunteer. Then you are free to explore or join a naturalist lead hike. We joined the guided hike to Cavern Point to learn more about the Channel Islands. From Cavern Point, we followed the beautiful north bluff trail to Potato Bay, which was stunning. We saw lots of island foxes and other wild life along the way, plus amazing coastal views. I imagine Santa Cruz Island looks like California used to be like. Wild, beautiful, and serene.The island has campgrounds with potable water and composting toilets. There are picnic tables and lockers available. There are no concessions or trash bins, so bring all that you need, and then take everything away with you.There is also an adventure company on site, offering kayak rentals and guided tours. We went swimming in a kelp forest without a guide—but the water was a frosty 58 degrees!",Susie1028
30,"Beautiful Island, but Some Things I would have Like to Known Before Going","The Channel Islands are beautiful and we love hiking and exploring. Santa Cruz was very interesting in terms of the history of the Island and the glorious vistas along the Cliffside trails. The trails were easy to navigate and many offer some amazing vistas. A couple things to consider when going to the Islands. You can get there by boat or plane. It takes about an hour by boat to get to and from Santa Cruz and the day trip departed at 9AM and we got back around 5PM. It will cost you over $50 a person for the round trip. If you are going for the day, you have to pick an island and there is a more to do in terms of trails on Santa Cruz as compared to Anacapa. We really enjoyed the whale watching tour, which included some great views around Anacapa the day before our Santa Cruz day trip. Our biggest problem with the Santa Cruz day trip was that the water was very choppy with high winds and so many of the passengers (including myself) were feeling pretty sick by the time we arrived. It was a very rough ride out there and honestly if I knew it was going to be that bad (whitecaps and all), I would not have gone. In fairness I have to say the Captain did an amazing job on the return trip riding the big waves back in (we were dreading another boat ride after the trip out)! The crew from Island Packers was very kind and helpful. There was only one boat out there and one boat back each day, so you are tied to those times with a 9AM departure and return onto the boat to head back to Ventura at 3:30PM (which we thought was more than enough time to explore the island). There is no food or drink on the Island (only water to refill your bottles), so pack a lunch and bring plenty of water. The toilets were outhouse style, of course, but clean. We went in winter and so the Island was mostly very dry and brown. There were a few things in bloom, but not much. We were also very disappointed at the very high price of the one type of kayak tour they offered to see the sea caves (about $150 a person). I didn't see anyone do the kayak tour the day we went and the kayaks were all just sitting there unused. I just want to pass along some information I wish I had known prior to going. Pros: The National Parks, including these islands are a gift from our forefathers to all of us! Cons: It is not cheap and it is not always fun to get to and from the islands (unless you love a wild ride and some people do). Pack and take your motion sickness medicine if you remotely think you can get sea sick. We did love the whale tour with Island Packers the day before where we saw amazing fin whales, great views of Anacapa and also hundreds of dolphins.",JeffnJulie
50,Beautiful!,"This was an unexpected highlight to our long weekend in Santa Barbara! It felt like you were in another world- so far removed from civilization. The views were breathtaking, the hikes fantastic and the quiet, amazing. I would recommend this island to anyone- especially when going with Island Packers. We would go back to try the kayaking, and maybe even camp for the night. Loved it!",821sanderson
50,"Feels like another world, some tips","It's amazing to see so much wild life so close to LA. We saw whales, dolphins, foxes, sea lions, fish. The scenery is breathtaking looks great on photos.Actually, I would't say the island look prehistoric. Actually, there are sings of humans everywhere - clearly not native Australian eucalyptus trees, non-native grass etc. And if you remember some history, that was the place of the 3rd largest oil spill in the US history. So that island has seen and still shows signs of a lot of human activity, but it's still very beautiful place to visit.There are a few things to keep in mind.The most important is weather. It includes weather on the island and how rough the sea is. It's over an hour each way boat ride and some people do get sick. Also, the weather can go from mild and sunny to windy, rainy and cold, so dress accordingly.Another thing is a day trip vs overnight. If you arrive in the morning and leave in the afternoon - you'll have just enough time to hike to Potato bay and maybe have a lunch. But if you stay overnight - consider kayaking. Snorkeling is possible but water normally stays below 70F so you'd need to have a wet suite.If you decide to camp, the island has restrooms and tap water. But everything else you need to bring in (and take back out). Also, there are plenty of very smart birds and foxes and they will try to find any food you bring in, so make sure all edible stuff is well packed.",heckfy
50,Prehistoric,"Well, almost. If you want to see what CA looked like before it turned into palm trees and freeways, this is a good place. Super trails, awesome vistas, and quiet spaces; lots of them!",Robert B
50,Step back in time!,"We went from Ventura Harbor, on the 8:00AM boat. Incredible one hour trip! At one point, we were surrounded by about 1000 dolphins! The captain slowed, so all could witness this amazing sight.Upon stepping onto the Island, an orientation is given, then you are free to roam, or join the docent led hike, which I recommend. The campground is beautiful and serene, potable water is available.It is easily accessed from the dock.Many historical buildings, and visitor center. Composing toilets, and many tables to picnic. Just be very certain not to leave your pack! The ravens and foxes are quite skilled at opening zippers.There is also an adventure company on island, for kayak rentals and guided tours. Bring your own food and drink, and pack out all garbage, there are no garbage cans. The Island is clean and you are encouraged to leave no trace.Next time I would like to camp on Santa Rosa, in late October.Go, explore, and be amazed.",Susan R
50,Beyond amazing!!,"This was one of several spots on a 2 week trip to the southwest. This was a great location with great views and peaceful tranquility. FYI, there are not bathrooms on the island, just outhouses. Make sure to take plenty of food if you are doing a day trip as well. The island foxes are cute, but very clever and tricky! There are a lot of opportunities to explore areas and a little bit of something for almost everybody. I am not the most adventurous person, but this was an amazing stop! We saw whales and dolphins on our ride over as well. Well worth the admission!",ryanls82
50,Stupendous and memorable,"We went to the island for a day, landing at Prisoners Harbor, where fewer people--at least on our boat--were headed. It was a glorious day, with sun and no wind. We hiked to the top of the island where we got views of both sides. We were delighted to find that we were alone nearly all the time. On the way down, an Island Fox crossed in front of us. Not only was the island experience wonderful, but the boat ride out and back was marvelous. On the return, pods of Common Dolphin swam alongside the boat. Island Packers is the outfitter--the staff does a terrific job.",Judith D
50,A Great Day Visit,We had a very nice hike around certain areas of the island. We were able to observe outstanding view of the coastline from the above hiking paths. The water was very clear where you can view several feet down into the ocean. We hiked along the old river bed and enjoyed the walk. The island foxes will eventually provide you with an opportunity to take many pictures.,kansas_traveler38815
50,Breathtaking views,"We took the Island Packers boat ride from Ventura harbor to Santa Cruz island. Just a day trip. We took a naturalist guided hike. You can camp overnight, kayak, snorkel. However need to bring your own water and food in and take your garbage out with you. Views are spectacular.",ellie2newjersey
40,Isolated and Fascinating!,"We were on a road-trip to see five of California's National Parks. So, we headed to Channel Islands National Park. Neat experience.First, visit the Visitor Center in Ventura. It's a must! Good video and better than average displays. It really set the tone for our trip.So, onto the trip. We chose Santa Cruz island since it was the closest and seemed to have good hiking. We were ferried to the island by Island Packers, the only company with ships to the island. Several notes: first, get in line early. We didn't realize that there was a line and were at the tail end and got what was left for seating on the boat. And take rain parkas. On the day we went, the weather was a bit blustery. Not rainy, but misty with wind. We were sitting at the back of the boat, out in the open. The wind occasionally drove waves across the boat. We had several ponchos which we draped over us. Even so, we were drenched when we got to the island.The island is pretty neat with rolling hills and quite a bit of history. We went on a guided hike with one of the Island Packers guides. Great idea. We gained so much more information about the island from Laurie. Was very windy. So much so that we abbreviated our second hike.Great place to visit. But be ready for the weather.",MikeB1952
40,Hike the Hills,Serious hikers would rate this somewhat higher than I would. Visiting Santa Cruz in the fall means you see mostly hillsides covered in brown grass as you hike up the hills to view out over the ocean. We did not try the kayak's but it did not appear they made it very far out of the harbor where we landed. The entire visit was made worthwhile by the free tour given by a park ranger. It was very informative and she answered all of the questions the small group threw at her. Be prepared for pit toilets and packing out everything you bring in. We lucked out on the boat ride to the island when humpback whales started to breach. Island Packers did a great job of pausing the boat trip to the island so everyone could enjoy the whales and dolphins feeding in close proximity to the boat.,golfusa2012
50,Beautiful island,"We came here for the afternoon. Time is a bit tight from the Island Packers cruise to Scorpion Anchorage, so be ready to get out and go. We took the guided hike on the Cavern Point Loop with the conservationist which was really interesting. The view from the top was amazing and so calm! We loved the seclusion on the island. After the hike we waded in the water a bit until the boat returned and it was time to go back. A great national park experience!",Philip B
40,Great day trip,"Drove from Phoenix to Ventura during Labor day weekend specifically for Santa Cruz Island. Book the ferry online in advance on Island Packers website for $59.00 round trip ferry. There is plentiful free safe parking at the ferry dock. You have to go into the building to get your laminated ferry pass. Get there early to park and get your pass as the ferry leaves right on time. In my case it left at 7:55AM 5 minutes early! There is only two ferry departures one at 8:00AM and one at 9:00AM and only two departures leaving the island one at 4:00PM and one at 5:00PM. I recommend taking the 9:00AM departure and 4:00PM coming back because 7 hours is more than enough time on the island unless you are going to camp overnight. The ferry ride takes 1 1/2 hours which includes the time for passengers to embark and disembark. The island has NOTHING ... you need to bring a gallon of water, sunscreen, small towel (mop the sweat) and beef jerky or energy bars. The circle hike takes about 2 hours and is somewhat strenuous. The ferry ride itself was as enjoyable as the island as the Captain stops so you can see sea lions and porpoises. After the 2 hour hike I just sat around for 5 hours waiting for the ferry. They will not let you get on the earlier ferry if it is booked. I recommend booking the guided Kayak tour as that will kill some time. The kayaks are provided but people can bring their own kayaks with prior planning. If you want to snorkel bring your own gear and change in the two bathrooms on the island.",Yoipitydafool67
40,"amazing fauna, super nice trip","Island Packers was amazing. The captain of the ship (jimmy) was very knowledgeable about sea life, and went out of his way to stay watching many many dolphins, he explained everything we needed to know while on board, with funny comments such as ""we only retrieve hats when they are worn""... or ""no king of the world please""... service was prompt and very good. There was a guide on the island, he was a retired volunteer, Brent, also very friendly. The kayak experience was well worth the time. Really, amazing trip. There is on land (at the office), a board with all the marine sightings of whales, shatks, dolphins and so on which was astounding by the numbers given. If I am ever back here, definitely, will use this service again. Restrooms are horrendous as there is no water service nor sewer... but such is natural conservation.",claudia v
50,Fantastic day trip,"We were in Santa Barbara in August and decided to take a day trip to the Channel Islands. We picked Santa Cruz Island as it seemed to be the most popular with the most to do. We took the boat ride from Island Packers, and we saw more dolphins on the way to the island than I had seen in my entire life previous to that. Once we got to the island we met our guide for our kayak cave tour with Santa Barbara Adventure Company. This was definitely the highlight of the trip. My husband and I shared a dual kayak (this is the default unless you request a single). Our guide gave us a quick kayak lesson, then took us through several impressive caves. After that we rented snorkel gear and snorkeled for a half hour or so. This part was just ok because the water was really cold (even with wetsuit) and there wasn't much to see. However it was really hot that day, so it was probably a lot better than hiking would have been! Anyway, after that we got on the boat back, (which left on time to the minute, so make sure you get there ahead of time!). It was a great ride back, and they serve snacks and drinks on the boat in case you get hungry. All in all it was a great day!",Margaret Y
50,Well worth the effort,"If you are in need of an escape from the frantic pace of the LA area...this is the perfect antidote.We travelled in winter...so the boat ride was a bit bumpy...but the crew is great. Once at the island, we hiked and had a picnic at the height of the trail with a fabulous view. A very interesting place, with lots of history, and a wonderful natural setting",Karl S
40,Best Day Trip,"My family and I have heard so much about the Channel Islands, specially the Santa Cruz Island, we decided to go check it out first before committing to a full on camping trip. This place is just beautiful! We took the boat ride from Island Packers, where we were greeted by dolphins. When we got to the Island we were amazed on how wonderful and beautiful it is. I am so glad to see that we still have people who are willing to respect nature - no trash anywhere :). We went for a short hike, which was amazing, then enjoyed the beach at Scorpion Anchorage. It was our mistake not to research more because the it was a rock beach, so make sure you bring water shoes.Snorkeling wasn't as good as we had expected but the water was beautiful.We plan to visit again - just a day trip, next spring as I want to see all the foliage.",mbayoneta81
50,2 separate day trips to Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa,"Over Labor Day, we took two day trips to Channel Islands National Park. Both were with Island Packers. Day 1 to Santa Cruz, captain Jimmy stopped to show us dolphins and other sea animals on the way. Once on Santa Cruz, we took the Cavern Point hike with volunteer Linda who did an awesome job. She was super friendly, even stopping to talk to us at the end of the day on her way to dinner. We enjoyed the island foxes, and the breath taking scenery. The only ""bad"" thing was the excessive heat.Day 2 we has Captain David who did an awesome job finding dolphins again and also three humpback whales. He also stopped several times to pick up sea trash.Once again we took the guide hike on the Cherry Canyon trail. While the hike was scenic,it might as well been unguided. The Island Packer naturalist Jackie led the hike but was unenthusiastic as she preferred to go with her ship mates to San Miguel Island rather than lead our tour. She gave very little instruction and was so far ahead of us, if she did explain anything we certainly did not hear it. Luckily, Linda had done a fantastic job the day before and we had learned some of the facts through doing the Junior Ranger books. On the return trip, Captain David took us along the coast of Santa Cruz so we could look at all the sea caves. He even took us into the Painted Cave.Both islands were amazing. Try to get a tour with a volunteer as they are much more passionate about the islands than the paid naturalists. Island Packers are very professional at what they do, and move an large number of people to and from the islands efficiently each day and they make it look easy. I would definitely travel with them again.",dmbakerphd
50,Day trip with family,"We went on a day trip to Santa Cruz Island with our children. We took Island Packers which provided excellent services. The crew was professional and attentive. Not only they slowed down to show us pod after pod of dolphins, they stopped multiple times to pick up trash like balloons from the ocean.We went to Vons not far from the marina the night before to get some sandwiches and fruits to pack in our cooler for the day trip.The island was beautiful. There is no shade beyond the camp grounds so plan your activities accordingly. We used one of the bins for storing our cooler and aqua shoes before setting out on our hike. Regrettably we didn't see any animals on the island. We were really looking forward to seeing some Island Foxes but maybe it was just too hot for them to come out.",TravelBug128
50,A highlight of our California Coast Road Trip,"We visited Santa Cruz Island during our California Coast Road Trip. We booked the day trip though the vendor Island Packers a few months in advance. We stayed in a motel in Ventura Harbor, literally minutes from the Island Packers dock and the Channel Islands National Park Visitors Center. The Visitors Center is a great place to prepare for your island visit, although the NPS website is also very informative.Our trip to Santa Cruz was very smooth. The crew was professional and efficient. Web saw a pod of dolphins and a blue whale on the way to the island.We chose to disembark at Prisoner's Harbor and participate in the guided hike into the Nature Conservancy. The majority of people on our trip got off at the other stop, Scorpion. There were fewer than 10 of us at Prisoner's Harbor. It was like having the island to ourselves. We really enjoyed hiking in the unspoiled forest with amazing views of the coastline. We had the opportunity to see the Island Fox and the Scrub Jay. After the hike we had time to eat our packed lunch and relax before boarding the boat to return to Ventura. It was a great time. I highly recommend this trip!",Kiamom
50,"5 star for caving & snorkeling, 3 star for hiking & camping","Whether you do a day trip or a camping trip, you're going to need to bring a kayak (rent in Ventura), snorkel gear, and a wetsuit. With the kayak, bring a PFD & helmet; also neoprene gloves for narrow sharp cave walls, and booties are helpful. And a headlamp.Campground reservations need to be made months in advance (for summer weekends), boat reservations need to be made a couple weeks in advance, esp. if you're bringing a kayak. The snorkeling is really really good, and the caves will blow your socks (booties) off. A kayak rental will allow exploring, which is more fun than a group tour.The hiking is fine, but there is good hiking on the mainland too. There is nothing like the snorkeling or caving on the mainland.The camping is OK. Foxes are *really* annoying & can enter tents. Campground can get windy.",MarinS22
50,Real gem among our national parks!,"This was a great day trip from Ventura. You definitely have to plan ahead during the summer to ensure you secure tickets on the ferry (Island Packers). We also booked a cave kayaking tour through SB Adventure Company, which was fantastic. Lastly you need to pack in all food and drinks. The waters are pristine, and the views from the hikes are amazing - we went to Cavern Pt and part way to Potato Harbor. We we blessed with a gorgeous, warm but not too hot August day with good visibility and calm seas - couldn't have been more perfect! Very cool to see the island foxes, which are all around the campgrounds and picnic areas.",Patricia S
50,The best national park,"You feel like you need a passport to visit Santa Cruz Island in the Channel Islands National Park. You leave the mainland and civilization behind and rugged, beautiful nature awaits you. You can get there by boat from several ports in California. I always see sea lions, dolphins, and whales on the way out. You can camp, but you can also make a day trip out of it. I have visited Scorpion Bay many times. I never get over the views of stunning cliffs and coves. The services are limited to restrooms so bring what you need and take all out with you. I recently visited Prisoner’s Harbor and hiked with permission on Nature Conservancy land. This is a really special place with views and wildlife you will only find on the Channel Islands. (I saw six endangered island foxes on my last visit.) You will never forget your visit, and I can’t wait to come back as often as I can. I have lots of pics. Check them out!",David B
50,Planning Makes Perfect!,"The main visitor center for the Channel Islands is located in Ventura harbor. On our way to the visitor center, we passed Island Packers, where we would catch our ferry to the islands the next morning. We stopped at the visitor center, took photos in front of the park sign, talked to the rangers, got maps, watched a video about the islands, and visited a 2nd story viewing deck where we could see the islands off in the distance. Having done our “homework” for the next day’s adventure, we spent the evening grabbing dinner and wandering through the many shops located at the marina area.Channel Islands National Park -This park is located about 20 miles off the cost of Ventura. To visit these islands, you really must plan ahead. Be considerate of the predicted weather, and remember that it’s much cooler and windier than on the mainland, so dress in layers and come prepared. The only way to get there is via Island Packers which will ferry you to/from the island of your choice. The islands are very remote and do not offer any sort of conveniences meaning you must take everything with you, including food.If you don’t have time or don’t want to pack your own food, you can pre-order a boxed lunch & snack from Channel Islands Provisioners. Knowing that our 1st day would be hectic, we chose to do this which turned out to be a fantastic decision! There are several options to choose from, but ours contained a sandwich, fresh fruit, dessert, high protein snack mix, and water. The caterer was waiting for us at the ferry landing to deliver our order prior to departure. Our food was perfectly packed in re-usable containers and placed in an insulated bag. The best part is that both the food quality and presentation were fantastic!The ferry drop off & pick up times are pre-set, so plan to spend the entire day on the island of choice. We chose to do a 1-day trip to Santa Cruz Island – Prisoners Landing. Our ferry left the harbor at 9am and returned at 6pm. The trip requires about 1hr each way, plus extra time in case of marine animal sightings. If you are prone to motion sickness, make sure to eat breakfast, take some preventative medication 1hr prior to departure, and sit in the back of the boat, outside. Our ride out was quite choppy and there were a lot of sick folks who sat inside, towards the front of the boat. Our 15yo chose to ride the bow, of course, and had a blast!Upon arrival, the ferry docked at a single pier. We had to climb up 4-5 rungs of a metal ladder from the boat to the main pier. Once on land, kayakers go to the left to begin their adventure. Everyone else goes the opposite way where a park volunteer provides some basic information about the island. My husband and son booked a 4hr sea cave adventure kayaking tour with Santa Barbara Adventures which included our ferry tickets. I am not a huge fan of ocean kayaking, but I was still able to purchase just the ferry ticket through SBA. Santa Cruz has a small visitors center and historical farm, plenty of picnic tables to sit and relax or read a book, and a nice campground (primitive only). The island has a multitude of lockers in and around the visitor center and at each picnic table. The lockers are free, and very large. You can easily store coolers, daypacks, etc. Using lockers is important to protect your food from the crafty island fox, who is a worthy opponent to any zipper or distracted human.I wasn’t sure what I was going to do by myself for 4hrs on a remote island, but as it turned out, I didn’t have enough time. During the summer, a park volunteer offers the opportunity to join a 2hr guided hike to one of the overlooks at a nearby peak. This is an easy, gradually uphill hike, that has a fantastic payoff at the end. Once there, you have the option to continue on another basically flat trail that follows the peak of the island where you can view the ocean on both sides, or return to the visitors center. I took advantage of the guided hike and did a bit on my own before returning to the visitor center to tour the old farmhouse & homestead. Afterwards, I headed down to the beach and waited for my family to return from their kayaking adventure, and took a few photos of them as they paddled back to shore.Based on our experience, planning the length of your visit depends on what you want to do while you’re there. This is where hind sight comes in. If you join a kayak tour, there is very little time to enjoy much of the island itself. If you want to do both, then you need to plan to camp overnight.Day Trip – Plan ahead.Are you kayaking, hiking, or snorkeling?Snorkeling is very popular at Prisoners Landing due to the expansive kelp forests teaming with sea life. During our visit, there were sea lions, rays, turtles, and many types of fish. If you want to snorkel, bring your own equipment. The beach and harbor is very rocky, so bring appropriate water shoes to protect you feet. There are no lifeguards, so be cautious.Hikers have plenty of time to explore some of the trails. Stop at the visitor center located in Ventura Harbor to pick up hiking maps and other information prior to your day of departure. There is a variety of trails for everyone, but most of the trails near Prisoners Landing are pretty easy and open. There are no predators on the island, so there is little concern whether hiking alone or in groups. Hikers do need to be aware of their own safety while at/near cliff edges, some of which are unstable. Remain at least 10 feet back from the edge.Kayakers spend between 2hrs - 4hrs on the water depending on the tour. Taking the longer “adventure” tour to the sea caves will only leave about 2 hrs to eat lunch and hike/snorkel. You can’t go very far by foot though. If you miss the return ferry, you spend the night without any gear or food.Overnight Trip – Really plan ahead.• Overnight guests arrive on the morning ferry and return on the next day’s morning ferry.• You can bring your own gear or rent gear through a local outfitter.• For obvious reasons, no campfires are allowed. For safety reasons, fuel canisters must be handed over to the crew when boarding the ferry, and then will be returned when you depart at the island.• The best campsites are #1-#22 because they are in the main camping area near the visitor center and don’t require hiking uphill to the additional sites.• Bring enough food & water, prepare for potential weather & temperature fluctuations, medications & first aid supplies.",ScarletAndGrey
40,Beautiful views and delicious ocean water,"It's funny, I guess when you live in Los Angeles like I do, you think of Catalina Island, but when you live in Oxnard or Ventura, you think of the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands just weren't on my radar, but that was a loss that I am thankful I finally corrected. I definitely recommend that people who are interested in hiking, swimming, and kayaking, and feeling like they are in a different world, take a day trip to over to Santa Cruz island, or if you want to camp, make it a longer time.The hour-long Island Packers Boat Ride out to Santa Cruz island was enjoyable and I made sure to take a Bonine so I wouldn't have the slightest hint of seasickness, but I can't speak of what would have happened if I didn't. This is just a habit of mine that has made things nice and easy for me.You can check on the Island Packers website the different times boats go out there. I did this on a Monday in July and the only times over were 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM, and there was only one return time, 4:00 PM. This might be considered a negative if you might not happen to want to be there that long, but I found enough to do so it wasn't a problem for me, even though I was worried that it might be.On that journey across, you WILL see dolphins, LOTS of them, so that is a real treat. You will also see Sea Lions vying for space on a buoy. The island and surrounding water has over a hundred species that only live in that ecosystem. Also you will definitely see several cute small brown foxes that are indigenous to that island and live nowhere else.I admit that my trip was a more ""bare bones"" trip...I was only there to hike and snorkel. I regret that I didn't sign up for kayaking, or even camping for one night, but in no way am I pooh-pooing just a day trip; in fact, mine has led me to want to go back there for a longer stay.You must bring whatever food and water you will need. There are no food facilities on the island. Pumped well water is supposed to be available for filling water bottles in the campground, but when I was there, the two spigots I found were hosting yellowjacket swarms, so I opted out of getting involved with them. Fortunately, I had plenty of water with me anyway. Anything you bring in, you must also take out with you, as there is no garbage collection there and it is a beautiful National Park that you wouldn't want to defile.The views are spectacular, as shown by the photos here. I also enjoyed snorkeling at the beach where the boat drops you off, but I warn you, there are lots of ROCKS and GRAVEL on the beach that are almost impossible to walk on barefoot without much pain, and even in the water the rocks are still painfully there until the depth drops off. That was a serious negative to me, so next time, I would wear something on me feet into the water. However, the water, itself, felt delicious and I enjoyed being in it.I decided to not bring my heavy scuba diving swim fins, because I didn't want to carry them around all day. However, what I hadn't known before, the island has metal boxes where people can stash stuff. It isn't human thieves that the boxes are for, but animal thieves, looking for food. Also the Park Ranger told us that some of the birds are attracted to shiny things, and he saw a bird flying away with somebody's car keys in its mouth! So I could have put my fins in one of the boxes; it would have made snorkeling so much better if I had brought them.I am not a huge fan of kelp forests and I am spoiled by snorkeling in clear tropical waters. Still, in the kelp forest you can see some interesting and unique underwater life even though visibility is not all that great. You can nevertheless see some worthwhile things so the kelp forest there is an asset.For my next trip over, I want to hike across the island to a beach on the other side that seems to have a sandy shore instead of a rocky one. Even from my simple one day experience, I realized that Santa Cruz Island is well worth repeat trips.",thomasdosborneii
50,Great national park,Didn't even know this place existed - so glad someone recommended it to us. Feels like you're outside of the US but luckily this is one of our country's protected national parks!,mgerber18
50,Wonderful Day Trip for Hiking,"The Santa Cruz Islands has hiking trails of many levels and lengths, although one should be in fairly good condition to get the most out of it. You have to bring your own water and food and take all of your trash off of the island. There are wonderful trails with great views. We took a five mile hike to Potato Harbor. Fantastic views of the ocean along the cliffs. It was a beautiful sunny day and carrying along two bottles of water was essential since there is little to shade you from the open sun. A lot of plants and small red foxes which are found only on the channel islands. Truly a haven from the densely populated areas of So. California. A lot of the other visitors to the island were either campers or kayakers. There are very few amenities other than some campground type toilets. Bring a windbreaker since the choppy waters can make it bone chilling boat ride. Although whale and dolphin sightings are common we did not see any this trip.",ciaran11
50,Beautiful Island,"Great hiking and time to be unplugged. We saw blue, fin and humpback whales on our channel crossings-was a wonderful trip!",jnewell23
50,Sea caving at the Galapagos of North America,"We went sea kayaking on our own and if you have even a basic level of competence in the water and on a kayak or canoe, you don't need a tour company. It was very easy to find all the caves - you just have to go in them and explore. It didn't take very long (about 3 hours) and we were able to go all the way west just past the Laguna beach and then back east to the Scorpion cave area too.We had to tow in a couple on a double kayak on a SB tour. Their policy is to leave people in distress and then tow them in on the way back but the man was vomiting a lot and we're both trained in first aid so between the 4 of us, we agreed we would bring them in. On the way back to harbour, we encountered a very rude guide who wasn't willing to tow his own customers in but a second guide closer to the harbour came up to us, paddled them in the remainder of the way and was very thankful.We rented from Channel Island Kayakers 2 days in advance for a Sunday trip. I highly recommend them as they give you good safety tips and it was $55 for a double kayak for the day incl helmets and life jackets (vs. $300 for the two of us if we were to take a tour). However, do try and see them in person a few days in advance as they were sold out of single kayaks already for the weekend even 2 days in advance. I tried calling but that didn't work so we just went in person as we were driving into Venture on Friday.The ferry had some food and pretty decent coffee. On the weekends, the ferry is fully booked so it's important to do it well in advance also. Dry bag if kayaking and water shoes are essential due to the rocky shores at both the pier and Laguna Beach area.We were 15 feet away from harbour seals who kept popping up to warn us away from the fish filled sea caves, as well as pelicans, cormorants, sea lions and lots and lots of kelp. Amazing experience.",CCLS
50,A must visit when in LA,"Loved this island. we did the kayaking tour with SB adventures and loved it. The sea caves were so cool. The hikes and the views from the top are stunning. Would highly recommend this island. You take out what you bring in, so you have to take your trash out. You take a packed lunch as there are no restaurants on the island.",rgarg_23
40,Day trip with family,"I planned a family trip to Santa Cruz Island. It was a great trip. My parents are in their 60s and are not that mobile. But, we survived and had a great time.We took a morning ferry around 9:30 am and afternoon ferry (3:30 pm) back to Ventura Harbor. It was enough time to hike to Cavern Point, eat lunch, relax under a tree, and head back. We took a while to hike the short Cavern Point because our parents needed to make multiple stops.We stayed the Friday night at Ventura Harbor so we do not have to rush to make the ferry. It is non-refundable if you miss it. We stayed Saturday night as well. We do not want to drive back after a warm day at Santa Cruz Island. I would definitely go back.",nettie2006
50,Lovely Island Day Trip,"We took the Island Packers boat out to the Island (booked online a week ahead), and saw a pod of dolphins swimming with us along the way. The boat trip was pretty smooth, although I preferred to stand out in the fresh air to minimize motion sickness. I was surprised at how many people came with us to the island, especially all the kids. We went to Scorpion anchorage, where there was a sandy/river-rock beach with lots of kayakers, a small information center, some old ranching buildings and picnic tables, basic bathrooms, water tap, (but no food) a quiet campground, and a few adorable island foxes wandering around looking for food (but don't feed them!) A friendly and knowledgeable volunteer docent (Mike) took our small group (5 of us) on a guided tour to Cavern Point, and then on to lunch (we packed them with us) high above Potato Harbor. The weather alternated between hot sun and refreshingly cool ocean breezes as we hiked along the trails. The coastline views were spectacular! By the end of the day, we were exhausted but happy. There's a plant restoration program in progress at the islands, and plenty of Chumash history to make this island a must-see for anyone who wants to learn more about native California. Don't forget to visit the National Parks Visitor Center back at Ventura Harbor to see a short film about the Channel Islands and maybe pick up a souvenir of your trip! Next time, we plan to book a kayaking tour to visit the cool caves around the island.",Alma M
50,Beautiful escape not far from LA!,"Checked off another national park on this latest trip and found that this is one I would visit again and again. Beautiful, remote, and perfect for an afternoon of hiking or kayaking. I arrived via Island Packers' boat and stayed until the last boat left. This is not a place for folks who enjoy glamping or want an eat at an island cafe. There are no amenities offered but some latrines and a small visitor center. Bring food and water - pack in and pack out! The hiking trails lead to breathtaking vistas. Don't forget a camera!",Naturespeak
50,Great hiking trails,"Great place to go hiking and so close to the LA area. The Park has wildlife and flora endemic to the area, Great views of the Santa Barbara Channel and you see whales, dolphins, sea lions and seals in the Ocean. Also the fox is endemic to the island. Great day trip",Carl Franklin
50,Nature Haven off California's populated coast!,"I recently visited Santa Cruz Island, which is the biggest island of the Channel Islands chain. The first day, we sailed on a private yacht and anchored off a cove on the southwestern side of the island far away from traffic of daily island visitors. We had the place entirely to ourselves, except for an occasional curious dolphin or two that ventured by. The next day, I went back again, but this time took the park's Island Packers boat transport, which docked on the island allowing the passengers to go on terra firma. The ride from Ventura Harbor to the dock on Santa Cruz Island was pleasant. We saw harbor seals and several pods of dolphin fishing. The boat trip lasted 75 min. Once on the island, you can elect to hike and explore flora and fauna, or for a fee, you can go sea kayaking and explore some of the nearby sea caves close to the dock and the sandy beach. I did both! I loved the kayaking experience! Once again, we saw seals and other marine life, and going into the sea caves was really cool! Our guides were knowledgeable and went at a reasonable pace to keep the group together. Later, back on land, we explored some of the trails that led to stunning scenery and beautiful pictures! One thing to beware of.....the island is riddled with very cute little foxes that have learned that humans bring food! While these little guys are cute as can be and will get close enough to let you take their picture, if you turn your back on your picnic basket or backpack for more than 2 seconds, your entire picnic will be GONE! I admit being out-foxed out of my lunch! But overall, it was a wonderful day out in nature!",Mayra R
50,Fantastic experience - already planning a return trip,"I found this national park on the list of US parks, and had planned to check it out all year. It did not disappoint. We took the 0900 boat out with Island Packers for around $80 for two people (outbound ticket and return ticket). During that hour and a half (give or take) boat ride you also get to look for marine wildlife, and they will stop for whales and pods of dolphins. We saw a pod of over 50 dolphins on the way out and the way back. We traveled over to Prisoner's Harbor, downside is you have to wait for Scorpion Anchorage to disembark (about 85% of the people), plus side is you get to explore without large groups of people at your Harbor. At Prisoner's Harbor about a mile out is a shipwreck area you can snorkel around, miles of paths to cover, and a decent campground - which you'll likely only be sharing with one or two other groups of people. We hiked Del Norte for 6.5 mile loop, if you went another 3 miles down the trail there is a wonderful span of beach front that houses sea lions. Overall we saw a fox (native to the island), red crabs that looked like squids, sea lions, manta rays, dolphins, and on the way home a humpback whale. Well worth the trip, next time we're camping out for a few days.",Mandy W
50,Backpack to get the best experience!,"For my first ever overnight backpacking trip, we spent a Saturday night on Santa Cruz Island. We had such a wonderful time! The visitor's center is so neat and we easily spent 20+ minutes reading about all the history on the island. We spent nearly 2 full days and hikes our buns off! Hiking in either direction from Scorpion's Harbor is definitely recommended. Potato Harbor was a delight as well as Scorpion rock. I can't wait to go back for another trip! Such a fun little excursion for a SoCal local. The foxes are ADORABLE!",HoneyLea
50,"Whales, dolphins and island foxes","We took the morning Island Packers trip to Santa Cruz Island at Scorpion. The hike up the trail to Cavern Point was quite steep at the beginning, but worth the effort. It has some steps and switch backs in the first 15 minutes, then evens out to some beautiful views. June in southern California can be rather gloomy and chilly near the water, and this trip was no exception. But the gloom lifted mid-day. To avoid ravens and foxes pulling open zippers on back packs, try using the free communal bear safes near the first bunch of picnic tables you come to, before the visitor's center. The walk back into Scorpion Canyon is relatively flat and interesting, but at this time of year the grassy hills are golden brown. Getting on and off the boat at the island can be a little tricky for seniors (I'm 72). It's a ladder, like getting out of a swimming pool. But there is an Island Packer person above and below to help and I felt perfectly safe. On the trip out to the island we saw a ""pod"" of dolphins probably 200 strong. An awesome sight. Plenty of humpback whales, too. One whale breached underneath a dolphin. That dolphin got quite a ride on the back of the whale. On the way back we saw a blue whale, the largest mammal on the earth. It's head came out of the water, then turned downward. It took a long time to go down since it was about 100 feet long, and then its full flukes straight up out of the water like it was standing on its head. This was an amazing trip.",Genie K
50,Trip to Santa Cruz Island,"We only had three days to visit the Channel Islands. I wanted to go to Anacapa, Santa Cruz, and Santa Rosa. Unfortunately Island Packers who has a Complete Monopoly on the Ferry Business to the Channel Islands National Park had nothing going to Anacapa during my window of opportunity. We did get to go out to Santa Cruz where we were able to see about six or seven of the Island Fox. That alone made it worth the trip. Folks, it is a MUST SEE to go out to the Channel Islands!! Why would you NOT want to do this?",rebusinessforms
40,Unique National Park Experience,"Channel Islands is the 12th U.S. National Park I've visited; despite its proximity to Los Angeles, chances are most U.S. citizens are not even aware of this park. A visit to one of the 5 islands (Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, Anacapa, the small Santa Barbara, and remote San Miguel) requires a ferry of various durations from nearby harbors in Oxnard/Ventura.We settled on Santa Cruz Island, the largest and, by far, most visited island due to its distance (~1 hour trip each way) and numerous possibilities for hikes of various lengths and necessary skill levels, kayaking, camping, and other water-based activities. As these are isolated islands which require some advanced careful planning in order to enjoy at their fullest, visiting Channel Islands N.P. is not for everybody.Initially, we planned on doing an overnight camping excursion , but decided against it due to the mainland return times. Depending on the season, there will be a couple ferries departing at 8:00 and 9:00 A.M. Return times can be a bit more complicated - during the week, the only return option is 4:00 P.M.; on the weekend, there are 10:00 A.M. and 12:00 P.M. departures from the island. As our camping would take place during the weekday, 2 full days on the island seemed excessive. And I think we made the right choice.Part of the fun of going to one of the Channel Islands is the journey there. The main concessionaire is Island Packers and they perform an excellent and professional service from the ease of booking, to loading equipment, to the actual ride to the island. During the boat ride, wildlife sightings are pointed out and some time will be dedicated to getting closer views of sea lions, dolphins, and, if lucky, whales. Warning: the waters can be rather choppy, so those prone to motion sickness should be prepared accordingly.Egress from the boat is handled with safety in mind as a short ladder needs to be climbed to reach the pier of Scorpion Anchorage. Once on dry land, a park ranger greeted those staying for the day for an orientation process; though the ranger was thorough and very pleasant, I found this orientation process to be a bit too lengthy - chances are (at least, it should be the case), you've done some research on the island and understand that amenities are very limited.The biggest appeal of Santa Cruz Island (and the Channel Islands, in general) is how you seem to have crossed to a separate world of its own. Apart from some National Park buildings and a campground, the island has basically returned to a state of wilderness. The only potable fresh water at Scorpion Anchorage is at the campground, so water, food, and other resources need to be brought on the boat.Once on the island, there are several hiking possibilities; we settled on the 7.5-8 mile round trip trail to Smugglers Cove; there is an initial ascent for nearly 1 mile from the pier before the trail levels out, providing spectacular views of the ocean and nearby Anacapa Island. As there are few trees on the island, shade is virtually non-existent, so sunscreen is a must. After 2+ miles, there is a steep descent to Smugglers Cove which ultimately is a little cove with a rocky beach. This is a good point for a packed lunch before heading back towards the pier; those visiting for the day should be able to do this hike with plenty of time to spare. Other trails include a 5 mile roundtrip hike to Potato Harbor, as well as longer excursions deeper into the island (more suitable for those camping overnight).As the National Park service doesn't actually own the entire island, there is a limit on how much of it can be explored; personally, 2 days should be sufficient to hike most of the major trails with plenty of opportunity to spot island wildlife like the small, charming, yet potentially aggressive (when food is spotted) island fox and various bird species; since the island is so exposed to sunlight, the island vegetation is not quite as lush as one would expect.Conditions on the island can range from very sunny yet windy; one moment, you can like you're baking under the midday sun and, the next, a cool ocean breeze is sending a shiver down your back. I could imagine nighttime conditions would tend towards cold, even in mid-May (another reason I'm glad we passed on the camping). Those looking to kayak and spend time in the water should also be prepared for windy conditions and cold coastal waters.Overall, the experience on Channel Islands National Park was a good one; there are enough spectacular views and great beauty to be found on the island to make it deserving of its National Park status. However, due to natural limitations, the experience does diminish somewhat the more time that is spent. I would not be surprised to see those deciding to spend a few days here becoming a bit bored. While Channel Islands doesn't match the grandeur of its more famous National Parks brethren, the journey to them and relative isolation from everyday life does make it a worthy stop for any nature lover.",Panda_Bear_Will
40,Kayaking around the island,"We did a ocean kayaking day trip to Santa Cruz Island. The kayaking company, Santa Barbara adventure company, was informational and adventurous. They provided necessary gear for the weather. We were on the water about 3 hours exploring the wildlife, marine life and the sea caves. Our guide, Billy, knew a lot about the island and the ocean. The wind was very strong that day so kayaking against the wind and current proved difficult at times. Overall great experience. The boat ride over wasn't too bad, about an hour ride or so, rougher on the way back. We unfortunately didn't have much time to hike the island, guess I'll have to make other trip back.",Cecelia W
50,Family adventure,"What a gorgeous island. Our kids are 7 and 12 and had no problem doing this hike. We hiked to Smugglers cove. Absolutely breath taking. We felt like we were in Ireland with the rolling hills of grass. It is not a difficult hike. Took us 2 hours to hike there and 1.5 hours back. GORGEOUS! saw so many little fox - adorable. They are native to the island and very friendly. On the boat ride over saw dolphin and whales. There is nothing on the island so pack your own food and water. Truly beautiful and very worth the trip. Highly recommend. We have hiked, Nepal, Indian, Iceland, Norway, South Africa, Cambodia and Thailand and ranked this little island in the US as one of our top 5 hikes!",Seirshalove727
40,Really good natural place for hiking,"Santa Cruz ISland is a really interesting island, were to hike in the middle of nature, but is not that paradise that the website says. It offers really nice views, but is not spectacular. And its nature is definitely not uncontaminated by mankind, since it was a farm for sheeps and pigs until 1997.The Park Service, although, is doing a great job in giving back to the place its original shape, and the free guides offers a tour with a lot of interesting explanations about Life on the island(s).You must book in advance (at least two days) the tickets for the boat that go on the island, and it takes 1 hour or more to go there, so if you are planning to stay only one day (people can camp overnight on the island too) take into account that you will not have so much time.",Filippo C
40,Lovely escape into nature,"If you like the outdoors this is a great place to be. It's isolated and you can see for miles over the Rollinghills. We have been to visit during a time where they had received some rain and the hills were very green and lush. We hiked multiple trails including the one out potato harbor and cavern point Loop, and finally the one to smugglers cove. Happen to be very windy while we were there so it's cold in the boat ride over on the first day was quite rough with waves of 9 feet high. Luckily they did not cancel the boat ride. The next two days were very calm, we went kayaking along the shore and it was beautiful. Saw many birds and harbor seals. You have to book the boat ride, campsites, and kayak trips all in advance as there is no way to book these while on the island that I'm aware of. he did national Park Rangers warnings about keeping your food at protected and use the boxes provided at the picnic sites. The foxes and crows are very very clever and won't hesitate if you look away for a couple seconds to try and swoop in.",Koalatastic
50,Wish we had camped,Beautiful island about an hour boat ride from the mainland. Wish we would have booked an overnight camping trip but it was windy. The campsites on Santa Cruz were beautiful. Ranger was fabulous and great with the kids. Some great hikes though most of them were a bit long for our seven and nine year old. We started down one and just turned around and came back. There is one trail that's a mile long. Toilets and water on this island which is nice. A great experience.,Ashley G
50,Another Great National Park,"Took the Island Packer boat to Santa Cruz, Scorpion Anchorage, at 10 am. It was sunny and warm, a perfect day. Seas were a little choppy but not bad. People were surfing the waves by hanging onto the bow rails as we dipped and climbed and sprayed our way to Santa Cruz. Saw a grey whale on the way out and common dolphins on the way back at 4 pm. Did the short 2 mile hike to the top of the cliffs, lunched and napped along the trail, and then spent an hour and half touring the old ranch and beach down below. We wished we had taken the kayak guided tour. A beautiful day and well worth exploring another great national park.",cavebearagain
50,I need to go back to this place.,"We took the Island Packers boat to Santa Cruz Island from Ventura Harbor. On the ride out we saw three gray whales and hundreds of dolphins. Santa Cruz Island was green and muddy, so at least in Feb 17 the drought is over. The hike was awesome despite mud that make impressive ankle weights and somewhat slippery on uphill climbs. We saw several island foxes, many birds including two ravens that can open zippers on a backpack and pull stuff out. They apparently don't like menthol cough drops but are interested in empty sandwich & corn chip bags. The boat leaves at 9 am and gets back about 4:30 pm. May get back later if whales or dolphins are sighted on the way back. Next time we will go when it is warmer and try kayaking along the shore. Very uncrowded in February.",T9175ZNrogerm

50,Tranquility on a quiet island,"This island is part of the Channel Islands National Park. It is only accessible by ferry boat from Island Backpackers or by private boat. There are a few small tent campgrounds. They were even in use in January when I visited. The island has no human residents except a few National Park Rangers. There is no food available on the island; so, bring your own. There are many Island Foxes. Some come quite close to humans; so, keep your food in one of the many free ""fox-proof"" boxes. There are several trails in varying difficulty that head out from the dock. The western side of the island is closed to most visitors, since it is maintained as a preserve.",ROTIP

50,BEST PART OF TRIP-A MUST,"Hands down best part of our trip. Even if you just go for the day, it's well worth it and you will have plenty of time for a good hike. We took the Mountain Ridge trail and were able to see the mainland, and well as other peaks from other islands in the chain. BRING SUNSCREEN-very little tree cover. Camping is also available for $15 a night per spot, or you can just do a day trip (around 6 hours)",Rach-SavoringSimple
50,Great place for hiking adventure,"Took Island Packer's 8 AM ferry to Santa Cruz island from Ventura. 59$ per head.As the landing dock is out of order (since last 11 months), it will be a wet landing to the rocky beach. And these people (from Island packer's) are doing a great job with extra care (taking 6 people at a time in a rubber boat to the beach with lot of risk to their lives). I wish they fix the landing station ASAP.Anyway on the way to the island we saw plenty of dolphins and whales (2). It was really good.The Island has no food. You have to carry food and water. Only basic restroom is available in the island.There are several trails. We took the cavern point trail and went all the way to the potato harbor road. The view of pacific from the mountain cliff are superb. You can also see sea caves from top. Nov weather was cool and sunny, but you much check the weather before booking. As there is no shade (or trees) in the island, i hope summer will be tough for hiking.You have to come back to the beach (landing zone) in time to catch the ferry to Ventura (3 or 4 PM).I will visit again for another trail/island for sure.",Pritam Mukherjee
50,Fabulous hiking,We spent the day on Santa Cruz Island and had a great day of hiking. The views are stunning and the wildlife is wonderful. The Santa Cruz Island fox is so beautiful.

40,A decent place to hike and explore for a family outing,"We visited the island on October 27, 2016. The hiking trail to Potato Harbor Road was well worth it.

The day trip to the island is a great way for a family outing.",chocobo128
50,All should go,"Great place to visit. I expected a flush area due to the ocean setting, but very desert like and dry, but still beautiful. All of us need to share our national parks.",joedvet
30,Santa Cruz Island,"I visited for 3 days in October. I've read the other reviews and mostly agree. It's a desert island that's dry and dusty in the fall. Hiking is fun but it's hot with practically no shade on the trails so bring lots of water from Scorpion Anchorage. But the main attraction are the ocean activities, so do some kayaking or snorkeling. The campground was nice as there's lots of space between sites. My only complaint was the abundance of flies on the island. Maybe it was just me who was bothered as not many other reviews mention the flies. Anyways it wasn't too bad as I'd rather deal with hordes of flies instead of hordes of mosquitos. I would visit here again.",Tanner78
50,A superquick hike with some planning,"I was fascinated by the idea of visiting the Channel Islands ever since I read about it in a travel magazine. Wasn't sure how much to expect since there was a 4 year old involved and since the boats seemed to be docking a mile from shore. Safety, energy and food were concerns. So here's what we did to smoothen out our experience:- Booked tickets in advance and gave ourselves a whole day at the island.- Didn't keep expectations too high: maybe the kid throws up and we have to carry him all day - who knows?- Bought a huge Dennys' burger and pizza to feed us on the island (this is a moot point because it was annoying carrying the trash around and back - but it was worth not-being hungry).The hike was wonderful - we docked at Prisoner's harbor and we loved the idea of hiking up the mountain to see miles of ocean. It felt like the Big Sur route. The kid held up pretty well and that was a relief. There were huge ravens everywhere and too few bathrooms - some of the drawbacks - but we did a pretty short route, stayed hydrated and spent some glorious time doing nothing but catching bubbles. All in all - quality family time and a good hike! I didn't believe all the pics I saw - probably why I didn't come away feeling disappointed at the gray vegetation and lack of facilities. :)",Raje M
40,Easy hikes for amazing views,"Not rated at the top of my National Park list, but still an adventure. Fairly easy hikes for a day trip, really about 4-5 hrs once you get off the boat and back in time to reboard. Landed at Scorpion Ranch and had a hour tour with a Ranger which ended at Cavern Point, to learn about the history, plants and animals of the island, some only found on Santa Cruz and the wonderful progress made with getting the island back to it's original state before the ranchers came in, including getting the island fox off the endangered list. Then took the moderate hike (pretty flat most of the way) to the Potato Harbor overlook which was worth it. The view was breathtaking, even included a beautiful sailboat anchored in the harbor! The only negative comment was that it was warmer than the weather report I checked in the morning before we left and there is no shade at all along the hikes...the only shade is in the camping area. We had hoped for a foggy day and it ended up about 70 degrees and sunny. Would go back and snorkel and/or kayak and would go to another island also as am told that each one is so different and unique.",mdemler57
50,Awesome Natural Park So Close to LA,"Santa Cruz was amazing. We took a kayak tour with Aquasports and ventured through some magnificent sea caves which reminded me of parts of Kauai's Napali Coast. The water visibility was about 20 feet where you could see schools of fish. We saw a lot of sea lions and marine birds as well. The island offers some good hiking, too. It is pretty rustic and not at all crowded. We will definitely go back to snorkel (in a full wetsuit since the water is freezing). The kelp beds serve as a great feeding ground for marine life. It is a full day excursion requiring advance boat tickets from Island Packers but it definitely is worth the time and expense. I am surprised that more people in the LA area have not visited this great natural park which is so close.",Y_Kathy
20,Boring!,"Sites at Scorpion Ranch campground are very close together & quiet time is not enforced. Rangers should do rounds after dark. I slept very little due to some people at the next site. They ranted for hours, then again at 12:30 am, then again at 2:30 am....Very little to do at Santa Cruz. I hiked 16 miles, took a swim and it was 2:30 pm. Now what?",Backpacker
50,Island is Beautiful!,"Seriously folks, go visit this place. The number of people are limited on the island so it won't be crowded like Yellowstone or Yosemite. The air is so clean and crisp. Everyone we encountered was really nice. The little grey foxes are everywhere so you are sure to spot at least one. The weather was amazing. It wasn't hot or cold. Just perfect.You take a ferry over (unless you have your own boat) from Island Packers Adventure and that is a lot of fun. If you get motion sickness, definitely bring Dramamine. They sell snacks on the boat. Make sure you bring lunch because there is nothing to buy on the island. There are easy hikes and more strenuous hikes on this island.We did a kayak trip with Santa Barbara Adventure Company. It was amazing! There were two other companies that did kayak trips, but I highly recommend this one. Kayaking is a must if you visit this place. The water is so clear and the caves that you can explore are quite brilliant.",Yvonne1999
40,"Very good, but not astounding.","Took a day trip via Island Packers (Ventura Harbor) to Santa Cruz on a Saturday morning with my 15 y.o. son. The only practical way to the island is to take the Island Packers ferry, which takes about an hour.We reserved our ferry ticket online a few weeks before the trip and the 5:00 p.m. return sailing was already sold out and we secured some of the last available seats on the 9:00 a.m. ferry out. Reservations are a must and if you plan on bringing a sea kayak (and a number of people do), that must be reserved as well. The boat is rather sizable and includes a small galley (with a smaller bar) as well as a john and while the ride is a little choppy, it was by no means problematic on this relatively calm day.The staff is pleasant, but the boarding process was a little disorganized and some additional signage or announcements would have been helpful. During the boat trip, we were introduced to a National Park Service naturalist who works at the island and guides a walk and was generally available to answer questions during the day. However, accommodations at the island are spartan, with port-a-potties, a water fountain and sheltered picnic tables with ""honor"" animal-proof lockers the only amenities, along with a small outdoor museum concerning the history of the island. It is very good advice to bring your own food and water, since there is nothing for sale, literally, on the island.In retrospect, I wish that I was a little more prepared and that their was a little more information available as to what to do and where to go. There are no useful trail maps available and there clearly should be. You need to have an idea where you want to go before you get there. We were unaware of the lockers (and, yes, I did do research) and would have packed differently knowing that we had a place to store things; I would have brought a medium-sized cooler with ice and our provisions and left it in the rather sizable locker, knowing that I would not have to haul it around on our hike.This is a full day trip, although you can camp on the island and a number of people were doing that. It is also not a trip for the physically unfit. The hikes range from moderate to very difficult and some visitors were struggling. With hiking boots are not a necessity, they would help and good sneakers are the least you should wear.Also, I would absolutely spring for the extra money and sea kayak. While the hiking around the island is impressive, the access that you have by kayak is so much more and would have added to our trip immensely. The water was cold and there is next to no beach, so if you plan to snorkel or kayak, I would bring a wetsuit.On this pleasant Saturday, the crossing was uneventful and took us past some oil rigs, but no wildlife, unfortunately. We had to land by skiff, since Scorpion Pier is closed indefinitely and I would strongly advise either going barefoot or wearing something you will not be hiking in to land. While you will not get soaked, your feet will almost assuredly get wet. You should bring a light jacket (at least in the Summer) for the boat trip out, but it gets very hot on the island, which offers very little shelter, so layers are the way to go.The Channel Islands have been called the Galapagos of the United States and while that may be true in some ways, having been to the Galapagos, there is really no comparison. The Channel Islands are neat, the Galapagos are incredible. This is some wildlife (the foxes are ubiquitous), but it is the scenery that is is the main attraction here.In all, I am happy that we went, but if I had a chance to redo the trip, would I do it again? The answer is a definite maybe.",World17
40,"Our oldest daughter has a goal to hike all of the U.S. National Parks, so a trip to LA included Santa Cruz Island.","Very calm, pleasant ferry ride from Ventura to the island. Island Packers did a great job getting us off the boat and to the shore on the skiffs. Very rustic island, this is not Catalina! Hiking and views were wonderful. We took Potato Harbor Road and were able to see the beautiful, serene landscape of the island. I'm not a camper, but would have enjoyed staying overnight in the campground surrounded by eucalyptus trees. This is not an easy hike, as you climb you need to be aware of uneven surfaces, holes and scattered rocks. We reached the top and were rewarded with gorgeous ocean and cliff views. We came back along the North Bluff Trail and Cavern Point Loop, which follow the shoreline. We did not get to do any kayaking, but will be sure to do that on a return trip!",Sandra R
50,Great trip,"An amazing day of kayaking, snorkeling and hiking. The views are breathtaking. Our guide was wonderful and the boat crew were really nice. If you're looking for a fun day this is the thing to do. Great for beginners too",Rita S
50,Kayak Heaven,"Santa Cruz Island was beautiful, had taken a day cruse some 20 years ago -- island at that time still decimated by feral sheep and pigs -- what a difference the National Park service and Nature Conservancy have made there. Camped 3 days, kayaked in the caves (guided by SBAdventure, who also setup the camp site and provided infrastructure as well as travel -- you absolutely need an up to date guide to explore the caves!). Used Channel Island Provisioners (Neal) to provide food as had a party of 8 with several coming in from airport. Food was outstanding, (e.g. brased lamb shanks for second dinner, greek yogurt with local fruit (figs, berries and stone fruit) for breakfast -- Everything worked and things we forgot were a question away. Snorkeling at scorpion bay had 70-80' visibility in the water. Saw Osprey, Peregrine Falcons, Pelicans, Brant's Cormorants, Oyster Catchers, Seals, Sea Lions variety of crabs, gulls and even kelp. Guide was very knowledgeable, and always kept the tour and cave choices safe and within our varied capabilities. Hiking the island was simply beautiful, and a good counterpoint to the kayaking. Out of cell range for data was a bonus too... T-mobile voice did work on land-facing higher ground. Water temperature high enough that kayak jacket was more than enough, snorkeling without wetsuit although fitted ones were available. Honestly couldn't have made better arrangements. Only thing I missed was a shower. Campers were very quiet and friendly, windy evenings, but quiet later (usually exceptionally clear late nights) and marine-layer mornings much like Santa Barbara Coast.",Forrest B
50,Unbelievably accessible must-go experience,"I already reviewed the island elsewhere. Whether you're a camper or a day visitor, treat yourself and visit this island in the Channel Islands National Park.",Daniel C
50,"Beautiful Island, Worlds Away","Santa Cruz is absolutely gorgeous! There is a lot to do there - from kayaking to hiking to snorkeling. I wish we stayed overnight, camping there would have been amazing. The island itself is stunning. The water surrounding it and the wildlife that lives there made me feel like I was worlds away from California. It's dry there and there aren't many resources so you have to pack everything for your trip. But if you're prepared, everything is great. The boat ride out wasn't bad either!Not many people go to the Channel Islands, even if they live close, so it's definitely one of the coolest trips you can do if you're in the area!",Kate O
50,Stay overnight,"In order to do this right, camp overnight. once you get there, you will want to stay longer. It is also a bit of a process to get there, so take advantage and stay awhile. The hikes and views (especially sunset) are amazing. My favorite part is the channel island foxes. These are cute small golden colored foxes which you wish you could take home w you. Unlike Anacapa, this island is worth staying on for a long time. There are lots of trails, vegetation, and the foxes keep the birds off the island, so it's a very different experience.",Sondra W
40,Fun Island Trip One Hour Away,"We took the Island Packers boat trip out to the Santa Cruz Island (Scorpion) for the first time. We sat upstairs until my husband started not feeling too well. The crew was very friendly and efficient and instructed him to go downstairs and sit outside in the air. It helped. It was kind of fun going ashore on a skiff, but the rocky beach was not fun. We checked out the visitor's center and decided on a hiking trail. We went to Potato Harbor. The view was spectacular. Then to return we took the Cavern Pt Loop. While the distance is not far, it is a slow hike, even for being considered a moderate hike. It was an enjoyable day. The boat ride was around an hour, but it took a bit to get people transported ashore, six people at a time. Even the island fox were interesting to see. They were not afraid of people and were not aggressive. It was a fun trip.",Carol G
40,The Underwater Views are the Best,"We planned to spend a full day at Santa Cruz Island. We took the 9 a.m. cruise and arrived about 1 1/2 hours later. The pier at the island was damaged so we were unable to dock there, but instead we were transported by skiffs to the island. It took over 30 min to get to the island, but once we landed, we hiked to Potato Harbor, which is about a 5 mile roundtrip. Our elderly parents (in their 70s) walked with us to Cavern Point, but stopped there as we continued on. I don't recommend the Potato Harbor hike for seniors unless they are in good physical shape. The views of the ocean from the vantage points were beautiful, but there is not much to see of the island itself. After we returned, we ate lunch at the picnic table and got to see the island foxes, which were much smaller than I expected, about the size of a small dog or a cat. After lunch we had about 45 min to snorkel before getting on the skiff back to the boat. We had a 4 p.m. departure, but had to be back at the beach by 3 p.m. to board. I feel like we didn't have quite enough time to do everything we wanted and should have taken the 5 p.m. boat back. The snorkeling really made the trip. The kelp forests were amazing and the visibility was very good. We were comfortable without wetsuits and were able to stay in the water for 45 min. We saw sea hares and a ray, along with many fish. I could have easily spent another hour or two snorkeling. The other people in our group that didn't snorkel were not as impressed with the island, I think you need to be on the water to fully appreciate the island. The kayaking also looked like fun. I will definitely go again and devote more time to snorkeling.",KMTW
40,Great hiking with beautiful views,"It is a beautiful island! The ride to and from is amazing. The trip over was very foggy but returning we saw a large pod of dolphin, sea lions and a whale. It is primitive, no place to purchase things you may have forgotten, so be sure to take what you need, water, snacks, long sleeve/ short sleeve shirt... It started out foggy and cool and ended sunny and hot. We stayed 5 hours and there were still areas we didn't see. It was a great break from technology and an incredible day!",bhpy
50,What a beautiful place!,"This is a great place to hike! The ocean views are incredible! There is no food so you have to pack a lunch/snacks/water. But, you can put your lunch and gear, etc. in bear lockers after you get off the boat. No locks, though. Everything was safe, though. The island foxes are found at the campgrounds. They are the ugly kind that are so ugly, they are cute! There are no places to sit around like a regular beach. It's rocky. The boat ride was great. Saw lots of dolphins. A very beautiful jewel and worth the trip!",Dale987
50,One night camping and a day hike,"We did a one night camping and a day hike in the lower loop of Santa Cruz island. The camping was great and we got to see a lot of island foxes.We were a group of 4 people, and took the hiking trail from the scorpion anchorage to potato harbor hiking trail,which is decent with a little bit of climbing and mostly a flat long walk. It got pretty cloudy and so we could not see any views of the ocean which was disappointing. But while returning back to our camp,we took a chance towards the cavern point loop. The clouds had cleared by then and the views were simply breathtaking. We waited there until the sunset and the experience is unexplainable. The hike back to scorpion anchorage was steep downhill but the panoramic pacific views made it easy to walk back. It was a lovely experience.",CHUMKI C
50,Cool Island!!,Loved hiking around the island....so beautiful!! Trail maps are available on the island and there are a variety of hikes available.,Jody D
50,Best place to unplug,"We took the 8am ferry from Ventura harbor and got to scorpion cove in an hour. There were big swells and the boat dock was closed due to damage from an earlier storm and so it took a while for the crew to get us from boat to land using skiffs. They were as efficient as could be and really worked hard.Once on the Island, is amazing!! The campground is clean. We just setup camp and started our hike down to Smugglers cove and onto yellowbanks. This made for almost 11 miles that day. It was so worth it. The views were amazing, the sound of the water washing against the beautiful rocks at smugglers cove was just so relaxing. After coming back to camp and resting a bit, we hiked to potato harbor for Sunset. Given no camp fires are allowed at the campsites and no cell phone reception, we went to bed early and we felt that was the best sleep we had in a long time. It was a blessing to be unplugged as we are so addicted to our busy routines and our gadgets. We broke camp the following morning, left our stuff by the harbors and hiked another 5 miles to potato harbor again via Cavern point. Once on the ferry and on our way back, we were treated to a feeding frenzy mid-ocean. Whales, dolphins, seals and birds all working on a school of fish. It was a special treat and we loved that the Island Packers crew stopped for us to enjoy this.I can not wait to go back in the spring when the hills are green. It is dry this time of year but still beautiful!! I highly recommend this park.",Martha G
50,Sea caves adventure,"An hour away from ventura harbor to be in pristine waters. Clear. Clean. Beautiful. Very relaxing island to visit. You can hike, snorkle, kayak, nap, swim... the activities are endless. Just bring your sense of adventure and lots of water/snacks etc. Plastic bags are banned on the island for obvious reasons. Do not feed the wild foxes. Respect nature. Have a great time and don't forget to put sunblock on. Santa Cruz is one island I'll be visiting again and again.",Offthebeatenroads
50,Beautiful and peaceful,"We took day trips to both Santa Cruz Scorpion Bay and Anacapa islands. They are completely different. Santa Cruz is very peaceful, very beautiful. Although there was no park service person to give a guided hike, maps and guides are provided, and we went on the Cavern Point Loop. The views are wonderful at the top. We had lunch at the picnic area in a grove of trees. We saw many of the Island Foxes. They are really cute. The visitor center has some really interesting displays on the history of the island.",Chuck Brooks
50,Special place,Its like going back in time. Truly a beautiful place. Definitely worth the hour plus boat ride. Place is almost untouched. Getting to the see the endangered channel island fox was very special.,JimmyJackk
40,Getting There Is Part Of The Fun,"Definitely enjoyed visiting the island via Island Packers. On the ride to the island and on the ride back, we saw several dolphins. We didn't really expect it in early June, but my daughter was thrilled.Before you get off the boat, they warn you about ravens that can unzip your backpack to steal your food. They aren't kidding - it happened to us! A raven stole our bread. What smart birds!The island is scenic but not breathtaking. We enjoyed hiking a loop during our day visit. Very good visit overall. Really the only (mild) negative was being asked for a tip (money) for the crew near the end of the trip.",Ken
50,"Nice hike, loads of dolphins",Took a day trip to the island. Saw whales on the way out and dolphins on the way back. Took a picnic lunch and ate at a picnic table on a hill in the middle of the trail. Great views. Challenging hike.,Ellalady
50,"Nature, History, Quiet and Peaceful + the Boat Ride!","This was our second trip to Santa Cruz. Our first was to Prisoner's Harbor, which we enjoyed. This time we went to Scorpion Ranch.Transport to the island is by Island Packers boat. Can't say enough good about the crew- friendly, knowledgable, helpful and always professional about safety. They work so hard!Cruise out- about an hour- both our trips was full of sightings of marine life; this time huge schools of dolphins, and distant sightings of whale spouts.Landing at Scorpion is by skiff or zodiac currently, since a storm wrecked the pier. We had low wave action at the beach so with the help of the crew we got onto shore and back on the zodiacs with for the most part dry feet.We took the free tour with a volunteer naturalist, which gave us the history, from the geology, to the Chumash indians, through the ranching years, up to the efforts to restore the environment, while having a nice walk around and getting some great views. Highly recommend!The little museum in the harbor is outstanding-- allow at least a half hour to listen to all the presentations.At this landing there are both portable toilets and drinking water, and picnic tables.Have to mention the Island Foxes. Cute as can be, a great ecology story, and an even better environmental recovery story.It is a full day - but a well-worthwhile one.",dewitthouse
40,Get ready for an adventure,"If you are the adventuring sort, and like to explore new places, and are up to some challenging terrain, look no further.We took a camping trip here with our family of 7 (kids ages 3-14). While it was a bit of a challenge, as all gear had to be hiked into a campground almost a mile inland, it was a neat experience.The ferry ride from Island Packers was great, and the zodiac landing on the beach a bit of an adventure. We spent a lot of time hiking and exploring this beautiful place.One trail we took was the one to smugglers cove. It was a bit of a challenge. 3.5 miles long, raising in altitude about 700 feet along the way. There were a couple quite strenuous inclines, that I wouldn't recommend unless you are in somewhat decent shape. All told, we took thew whole family along, and even the 3 1/2 year old did OK (although we ended up carrying him back the last couple miles).It was a beautiful place that most of the family was sorry to leave when it was time to go.",iamquestar
40,Choose Santa Cruz over Anacapa. Plenty of hikes and sights.,"We took the Island Packers day trip to Santa Cruz. In addition to humpback whale and dolphin sightings in the inbound trip, the hiking was excellent. From the Scorpion Anchorage we visited the historic ranch and visitors center, hiked to Cavern Point, and then along the North Bluff Trail to Potato Harbor. On our way back to the anchorage we cut through the campground, which seemed to be the best place to see the island fox, although we did see three on the other trails as well. We also went to Anacapa on a day trip, and Santa Cruz was the better of the two, hands down. Additionally, at least for our trip, our Island Packers boat was larger for the Santa Cruz trip, which made for a more enjoyable experience. The hikes we did were generally pretty easy, more of a walk. You might want to plan on eating your lunch at the anchorage, visitor center area, or the campground, as we couldn't even find a big rock to sit on along the North Bluff Trail, and since we had on and off rain, we ended up standing up to eat. Also, if you are hiking with young children you will not be able to get to a whole lot of the sights with the available time on a one day excursion",parksvisitor

50,Otherworldly,"It's hard to believe that 18.6 million people live on the greater Los Angeles area and many can see the Channel Islands National Park, but few ever visit.That's a shame because it's an otherworldly experience that awaits anyone who ventures out to the islands.Santa Cruz at 96 square miles is the largest and the easiest to get to. Island Packers, based in Ventura Harbor, have been taking people out to the islands for fifty years. The cost is $59.00 for a return trip, a little more if you are bringing camping gear. The trip out and back doubles as a whale watching cruise with the chance to see a half dozen different types of whales plus lots of dolphins and sea birds. On the day I went there were two fin whales and a very acrobatic hump-backed whale.There are two places to land - Prisoner's Harbor and Scorpion Ranch. I recommend the latter for a fairly easy, but very rewarding hike and excellent sea kayaking into the sea caves of Cavern Point.For birders there is the chance to spot one of the rarest birds in the world, the island scrub jay which is only found on Santa Cruz. Also of interest is the ridiculously cute island foxes that frequent the campgrounds.Add in beautiful wildflowers, sea cliffs that reminded me of the Cliffs of Moher in Ireland and great snorkelling and you've got a recipe for a great day trip or even better an overnight camping trip.Enjoy the pictures.",maritimeexplorer
50,Camping on Santa Cruz,"We loved our experience on Santa Cruz and the small foxes are adorable. We camped out in April and it was still pretty chilly so bring wind-resistant fabrics if you're going to go in shoulder season! Our group of 3 were one of 3 other campers on the the entire island after all the day-trippers left. It was such a relaxing and fun experience. We'd kayak to the sea caves in the daytime or do light hiking throughout the easy trails. No campfires allowed of course, so don't forget your stove!",Priscilla G
50,Lots of Wild Flowers,"Island Packers in Ventura Harbor is where our island adventure began. Our boat pulled out about 9:15 in the morning. The ocean journey took about ninety minutes. Along the way we viewed many porpoises, harbor seals, sea lions, and humpback whales. Once on the 96 square mile island there are many activities including, guided hikes with a naturalist, beach combing, kayaking, camping, etc. You can explore a national park, or hike the Nature Conservancy with a guide. The return boat leaves at 4:00 PM and again you see marine animals.",Gopher04
50,Out to see island,"The boat trip out is very interesting. Saw whales, dolphins, and other marine and bird life. Hiking on the island is very relaxing and some great views. Saw two of the foxes(four legged types) and that was a bonus. Flowers were in bloom and that was a treat. Overall, an excellent trip. Another salute to the National Parks. Anyone interested in seeing some of the protected California would enjoy this trip. Go in the spring.",TacomaNorthshore
40,Isolated and beautiful,"Went to Santa Cruz island last weekend for a day trip. Landed at Prisoner's pier, the Scorpion landing was only accessible by a skiff boat and we wanted a proper landing. The Prisoner's is a quite lush green, gravel and stone beach. there are 2 restrooms, no water though. You can relax on the few tables under the shadow of Eucalyptus trees or take a hike. The Island packers had arranged for guided tour, one was fast paced and the other was slow. We took the slow one as it was more informative and not strenuous. However, both follow the same route and it can be challenging if you are not wearing comfortable sneakers/hiking shoes. If you dont wish to follow your guides then also there is one more marked trail that you can go to or relax on pier.The island is beautiful, lots of birds and the native fox is there to amuse you. We saw dolphins which going and whale while coming back.Advise to take lots of water, especially if its sunny, a cap and something to spread on the ground to lie down if you plan to (donot lie down on the grass/mud, there is some virus as was told by the island packers). Overall a good place to spend your day. We are not too much into hiking, then too we enjoyed a lot.",vibsulabh
50,Sweet Summer Sailing,"My favorite anchorages here, in no particular order, and definitely depending on whatever the current conditions: Coches Prietos, Cueva Valdez, Pelican Bay, Smugglers Cove and Yellowbanks.Wildlife surprises are abundant. In Cueva Valdez I'd been swimming for a little while, put on a face mask, then realized the ocean floor below was teaming with bat rays! Seeing an island fox an was a special island walk moment from Coches Prietos. Such an overall amazing place!Make advanced preparations for the Nature Conservancy landing permit, and be prepared for wind, swell and surf.",808_AnnaJoy_808
50,"Remote, quiet and a great hike with sweeping ocean views","After a 1.5 hr boat ride, where we saw grey whales, hundreds of dolphins, and dozens of pelicans, we hopped off on shore at Prisoner's Harbor and a (strenuous) hike up to the Del Norte backcountry campground. Amazing views, and once you're off the pretty exposed Navy Road, the trail becomes this lovely carpet of grass that winds up and over a bunch of ridges.",Zach H
50,"Camp, Hike, Snorkel, Kayak","Great island to spend weekend at with kids as you venture into backpacking. Kayak tour is great, but expensive, but definitely highly recommend. Snorkeling in Scorpion Anchorage is great for kids, just be sure to have a wetsuit.",607flyr
50,Like Stepping Back in Time,Easy day trip from Ventura Harbor. Do the hike to Potato Harbor and sit and enjoy a snack or lunch. Breathtaking views and moderate hike.,CAbeachLover
50,My first (and definitely not last) trip to Santa Cruz Island,"Took Island Packers (cannot recommend them enough) to Santa Cruz Island, landed at Scorpion Pier (although you have to skiff over to the island at this anchorage, due to some questions about the pier's structural integrity following a recent storm). Not to worry, besides a little inconvenience, the skiff trip was fun and all my stuff and I arrived dry and in tact, in spite of relatively choppy waters. I camped two nights solo at lower Scorpion Campground. Plenty of water, nearby toilets, plenty of shade, fantastic hiking, beautiful weather, beautiful sunsets. Just a perfect time. Oh, I was THE ONLY PERSON on the ENTIRE island besides one man, Brent, a National Park Service guy that made my trip even more pleasant. Super safe, the biggest predators on the island are the foxes, they weight like nothing and they're about as big as your kitty cat. They're remarkably cute, SUPER pesky, unafraid of people, and TERRIFIC thieves, so watch your stuff, and I don't just mean your food. (I learned this the hard way, twice!!) Really nice to not have to worry about bears or cougars or rattlesnakes while hiking and camping alone. Also took side trips to Potato Harbor, Smugglers Cove and Prisoners Harbor. ALL worthwhile. I can't wait to go back. Again and again.",alessandrabackpacks
50,Scorpion anchorage,"Great for hiking, we went during June and saw a lot of campers so there are campgrounds available. Also, the kayaking is one of the most fun of all.",Alma R
50,Great Way to Spend a Day,"We finally made the trip to Santa Cruz island and we are glad we did. The day was perfect, the seas relatively calm, and we saw at least 50 dolphins on the one hour cruise over to the island. Once at Scorpian Cove, you can either hike out to Smuggler's Cove (7.5 miles round trip), or do the Cavern Point/Potato Harbor loop (6 round trip miles), or rent a kayak and enjoy the ocean. We chose to hike with the docent to Cavern Point and then continued on to Potato a Harbor, which had unbelievable vistas. We did see two of the native foxes and a number of the - only to be found on this island - blue thrushes. You have the option of taking the cruise to Pirate Cove, but there is more hiking possibilities at Scorpion Cove. This was a well spent $50/person. Next time we will check out one of the other islands.",pfefmeister
50,Potato Harbor...Priceless!,We traveled to Santa Cruz Island on the spur of the moment. Island Packers was excellent. Highly recommend using this company. The day on the island was fun. Some tips...wouldn't recommend this trip to any that are not avid hikers or those traveling with young kids that are not in to hiking. Relatively few shade trees. Trails are all open to the elements (wind and/or sun). There are outhouses in the Visitor's Center area and camping area. Clean and well maintained. The negative to us all was the miscommunication by the volunteer guide when you arrive on the island. They offer a 1 hour narrative hike. What wasn't communicated is its 1 hour walk/hike to a point (Cavern Point) and then its over. It's not a loop. So all our food and water are back at the lockers. Not a deal breaker but a bit annoying. We would have brought our snacks and more water with us since going back to the lockers wasn't convenient to where we were 'left' at that point.We really did enjoy the beauty of the island. Hiked to Potato Harbor and enjoyed a gorgeous view of kayakers and sailboats in this picturesque bay.We wrapped up our day by cooling our feet in the cool waters at Scorpion Anchorage waiting for our boat to take us back home.,IslandSunSeekers
50,Hiking and Backpacking on Santa Cruz Island,"Hikes and Backpacking on SantaCruz Island.The is a remote mostly back country island. Safe. Part National Park, Part Nature Conservancy. Many hiking options. Backpacking in Park is limited, officially, to only Del Norte ):AccessFrom the mainland by charter boat from Ventura or Channel island Harbor. Private sailboat charters are available too. I like best the privately owned boat charter route spending multiple days at the island including backpacking, hiking, camping, SCUBA, kayaking.BackpackingFrom Scorpion to Del Norte is a long strenuous hike with lots of up and down. From Prisoners to del Norte is much easier, fairly short, but still moderately difficult. The views are vast and beautiful. There's no water. Little foxes everywhere. Terrian on the entire island is sandstone, scrub oak, grass. A few pigs and sheep are possible.The views of across the channel are the best. You can see the mainland too. Cell coverage possible.Recommend -Our fav hike on SC is Prisioners to Pelican Anchorage. Second would be staying at A Prisioners and doing day hikes from there. Scorpion is day tourist, lots of people during summer.The hike From Scopion to Smugglers and one of the peaks is the best choice for a day trip leaving on first boat from mainland and returning on last boat back.Check with the nature conservency on the island for options they have.Weather - check before you go! Usually perfect, but... can be very windy +50 knots and very wet, or very dry and hot - winter, summer. Spring and fall are perfect. Lots of flowers and green in spring, dry and brown in fall. Can be very wet and muddy in places in winter.Have fun!Take it easy.",kennybeal
50,A Trip NOT To Be Missed!,"We have lived in the area for 22 years and always wanted to go to the Channel Islands, but somehow it had not happened. UNTIL NOW. Oh my gosh what a great and grand adventure! I will admit the reason for the delay is that I am sensitive to motion, so I did go to my doctor and get a motion patch which was a good idea. I also checked with the transport company (Island Packers) ahead of time to check on the expected sea condition. They were very nice when I called and told me the expected wave height and length of time between waves. As I got on the boat they told me to stay on the main (lowest) deck and to sit in the middle of the back of the boat for the least motion, and to focus my eyes out to the far horizon. Do not look at the waves near the boat. It all worked! And the boat ride to and from the island was definitely was a big part of the adventure! We saw dolphins both ways and a whale on our way back to shore! We have always looked out to the islands as well as seen them flying over in airplanes and had a dreamy sense of their beauty. It was truly enhanced by actually going there. The boat trip takes about an hour each way. We landed at Scorpion Bay and disembarked for a brief presentation by a ranger about the logistics of our stay. Then we were free to explore! Our friends had prearranged for a half day kayak tour which included visits to sea caves. One can also kayak on your own but again, this must be prearranged through Island Packers (they will direct you to the kayak company). We joined a National Park Service volunteer named Gail for a hike which was fabulous. She was extremely personable and knowledgeable and we learned so much about this unique island -- and the views were to die for! There are several historical buildings on the island near the boat landing which are set up as historical museums which are most interesting and really helped us learn the history of the Chumash (and their ancestors) who had come several thousand years before as well as more recent sheep ranchers. There are picnic tables in this same area and storage lockers. YOU MUST BRING ALL FOOD AND WATER YOU NEED FOR THE DAY! There is food and water available on the boat but none on the island. There are restrooms in this area as well. There is a curving beach near the dock which is half sand, half rocks and can be used for swimming and snorkeling, tho the ocean floor is rocky so some sort of water shoes may make it more comfortable for you. There is a campground not more than a half mile (maybe less) from where one gets off the boat. Absolutely no fires are permitted, but it looked like a very nice place to camp. Everyone we spoke with who had camped there said they really enjoyed it. It was a really interesting sensation to be on this island and look back at shore. From the vantage point of the island the mainland appeared totally uninhabited, while in reality of course it is the island that is uninhabited (save for one Ranger house). This is an activity that should not be missed! It will remain unforgettable to us for years to come and we know you will feel the same!",travelgirl93463
50,Beautiful!,"Great day trip. Pack a lunch and water, there's none on the island. Also bring a jacket, the ride out gets chilly.",denniscC4624YG
50,Amazing coastal views!!,"My friend and I decided to take a trip with Island Packers to Santa Cruz Island particularly to Scorpion Anchorage. We took the 9am boat and arrived at 10am. On the way there, we saw a group of dolphins and we slowed down to admire them and take pictures. The island overall is just beautiful! We decided to do the moderate hike on Cavern Point Trail which we started by Scorpion Ranch. We passed by the campgrounds where we saw an awesome island fox! Then continued hiking until we got higher up to see the amazing coastal views... a landscape photographer's dream! After the hike, we cooled down by snorkeling through the kelp forests. I even saw a spotted gray seal underwater, but it took off so fast I couldn't get a pic of it! We ate lunch around 3 pm and by 3:45 it was time to board our 4pm boat back to Ventura. We didn't want to leave!!! Definitely will be back to stay for the whole day and camp overnight next time! It is a trip you should definitely take, especially if you are fond of nature and the ocean.",Annemae B
40,Hike,"We took the ferry to this island and because the weather was unseasonably warm the ferries booked up fast so recommend doing that in advance of your trip. We were lucky to get tickets the day before and this island was the only option as ferries to the others were sold out. We wanted to do a guided kayak/snorkel tour but those were also all sold out so look into and book in advance. We didn't realize you could rent kayaks on the island.This is a great place for a vigorous hike but anyone going needs to realize there are limited amenities. There is only water available where the ferries drop you off, nowhere else on the island. You also need to take with you any garbage because there are no facilities for that ie. garbage cans. This is rugged terrain and we were admittedly not very prepared but managed not to sprain any ankles. Definitely wear hiking or running shoes - some of the trails are very uneven/gravelly so it's easy to slip and there are some steep climbs. If it's hot weather, wear a hat because there is no coverage - you are totally exposed. We did the Smugglers Cove hike which was about 8 miles round trip. Took longer than expected becasue of the terrain. We basically got to the cove with just enough time to eat our packed lunch and sit for 30 mins or so, then had to turn around to make it back for the ferry, so not much time to relax/chill out. The beach at Smugglers is all rocks and very difficult to enter/swim in which was disappointing because it was 30+ degrees the day we were there. But we are glad we did it, we enjoyed the ferry ride there and treated it as a really good work out!",Morlechta
50,California's largest island,"On our mission to see all the national parks, this was #55 of 59. We spent two days here, taking the ferry out of Ventura. We are in our 60's and don't camp any more, but that really is the way to see the Channel islands. An overnight gives you the opportunity to hike, do the sea cave kayak tour, and simply enjoy the beauty of an island 21 miles off the coast and away from the California hustle and bustle.",Ted O
40,Half-day visit to Santa Cruz,"My husband and I spent 3 hours on Santa Cruz Island in September of 2015. The island is quiet and has beauty in its simplicity. But the vistas are breathtaking! I don't think a lovelier view of L.A. exists.The amenities are limited: a few port-a-johns, and a few water spigots (the closest of which is about 1/2 mile from the beach)-- so make sure to bring plenty of water and sunscreen! The beach at Scorpion Ranch is small and rocky, but also quiet and relaxing. The Visitor Center at Scorpion Ranch is small, but interesting. I took a guided hike with a NPS volunteer which was very informative and highlighted the history and natural history of the islands. I highly recommend taking a guided hike.As beautiful as the island is, I think that my husband and I enjoyed the voyage to the island as much as the time spent on the island. As we crossed the channel, we found our boat in the midst of a huge pod of dolphins-- the crew estimated about 2,000. Watching them jump and play all around us was a phenomenal sight. The crew changed course so we could spend more time observing the common dolphins, which was much appreciated. As serene as the island is, I think the excitement of being surrounded by dolphins was the highlight of our day.",Cathy Sandiego W
50,Only the tip of the iceberg (no actual icebergs),"After three days and two nights on the island I feel as if we only scratched the surface of such an interesting place.One must take a boat out to the island and planning for this adventure can take some time. The trip was set up for us by a friend, so it was made very easy for us. We chose the farthest campsites (#s 24 & 25) for our little adventure that included two children. The sites were great with a view that is hard to beat. The trade-off for these great campsites is the trek to and from the boat dock and main beach. This was my first time on the island, so I had not idea what to expect. I'd say if you can try to pack lightly that will make your experience a little less work. There is water available at a few locations in the campsites, but nothing more than that.One of the highlights of the trip for me was a package adventure of a 1/2 day of snorkeling and sea kayaking. Our guide, Ben, was great and the snorkeling blew my mind. I didn't realize the kelp forests were so amazing. All I wanted to do for the rest of the trip was stick my face in the beautiful water and follow fish around. Alas, I had to spend time in a sea kayak exploring sea caves and learning about the formation of the island. All amazing stuff. We also managed a hike to Smuggler's Cove and back. It was not an easy hike and quite hot on the day we did it. Bring lots of water for both directions. The beach was alright that day, but I was happy to get back to the main beach where the water was clear and inviting.I recommend shoes for water and sand because there are a lot of rocky conditions in and around the water.",Mariah W
40,Boat Ride was the Highlight of the Trip,"On the boat ride to Santa Cruz Island, we saw many, many dolphins. The boat wasn't too crowded, so there was lots of freedom and space to move around. We spent the majority of the trip (4 hour trip) on the rocky beach. It was SUPER rocky - even under the water. The water was a little chilly, but didn't take long to get used to. It was too windy to kayak, but there were several kayaks in the water from earlier in the day. We started walking along the loop trail and saw 4 foxes along the way. :) Other than that, there wasn't a whole lot to do on the island. There are no trashcans on the island, so you do have to take everything with you. There are port-a-potty type bathrooms and a couple of changing rooms. The boat ride back was really crowded, but we saw thousands of dolphins (mega pod), 1 Blue Whale, 1 Thin Whale, and 3 Humpback Whales, and several sea lions.",Amanda L
50,Camping at Santa Cruz Island,I took my daughter camping on Santa Cruz Island over Labor Day weekend. Great place. Super clean. Snorkling and kayaking were great. Highly recommend this for a family trip.,Erik L
50,Good hiking,A hour boat ride - we saw lots of dolphins. Great hiking and views from the top of cliffs around the island. Most of the island is not open for hiking though. Educational - early ranching & native American culture.,UofA1
40,amazing!,"we spent a wonderful 2 days here. we pitched a tent, hiked and snorkeled in some of the most wonderful waters i have seen. the ferry ride over was so amazing - we saw hundreds of dolphins and even a whale, while from a distance - it was still a whale breaching! if you have little ones or not - this trip is for everyone!",Sy S
30,Great for one day...,"My wife and I have lived in SoCal our whole lives and she wanted to go to the Channel Islands, other than Catalina Island - Two Harbors (again), so she chose Santa Cruz Island. She booked 3 days in the Scorpion Ranch - Lower Loop Campground.What a nice campground that was completely nestled in the eucalyptus trees for shade with ample wind breaks from the 10' high bushes surrounding most of the sites.Even with all that said we left after one full day and one night.I am not sure whether we have just grown in-tolerant of loud inconsiderate people or have just been spoiled from other nature adventures. Like I said, the campground was fine, the spacing between campsites was fair..the foxes were not a bother nor were the crafty ravens. It was the yahoo's screaming and yelling like they were the ONLY people on the planet that sucked. Ya want a mid-day nap? - forget it. Sleeping-in in the morning - totally forget it!The trails were well marked, the visitors center was cool, the old machinery was interesting trying to figure out what they were used for...overall it was a nice place - good snorkeling (Saw a HUGE Bat Ray - AWESOME!)For our GREAT ranger staff just one little thing that may help knock some of the noise down is to put rubber bumpers inside of the Fox Boxes to limit the ""BANG"" sound that happens EVERY TIME a person closes their food lockers. Ya may may not be able to stop the inconsiderate people noise but the those lockers are annoying.Will we ever go again? Maybe so but it would be for the day only - early boat in - last boat out would be perfect!",Vin S
50,Awesome hiking!,"We has a great time hiking, the views were awesome. We took the Cavern Paint loop tail. And followed it along the North Bluff Trail up too Potato Harbor. The views we amazing. We made lunch and enjoyed the view. There is not a lot of shade while you are hiking so remember your sun protection. The big thing to remember is hand sanitizer! Our next trip there we want to do the kayaking, it looks so fun!",Azgirl18_11
40,Not Your Typical Island Resort,"I have lived in Southern California my entire life and had never visited this island until recently. It is under the supervision of the National Park Service and The Nature Conservancy, so it is largely undeveloped and left in its natural state.Visitors come to the island on day trips or for a camping experience. Either way, you need to pack your own provisions and pack them and your trash out when you leave. There is a limited water supply, but conservation of this resource cannot be stressed enough. There are non-flush toilets at the camp sites.Interested in water activities, snorkeling and kayaking are on the top of the list. You can bring your own equipment, but there is a limited amount of kayaks available, but I would check prior to departure.The beaches near the pier offer easy access. The day we visited, the water was extremely clear and smooth. The water was warm for Southern California standards.The island has a colorful history and there are relics left from the days when the island served as a ranch and home for an immigrant family. It does not take a lot of time to tour and is an interesting look at how life used to be.About the only way to explore the island is on foot. There are a number of trails. Some take you inland, others along the coast. Some parts of the trails can be steep and you need to be mindful of your footing.If you are not familiar with the history, flora or wildlife on the island, I would suggest a guided tour. Visit the website or the island carrier for details and times.During my visit, I chose to take the coastal trail. The the trail takes you by the campground and the ranch house before turning up onto the trail that splits area between two hillsides. The trail can be a bit narrow and steep, but when you reach the top you are near the cliff side that over looks one of the many coves located on the island.The cliffside rises over 300 ft. above the water and there is no safe way down to the water, so enjoy vista which includes extended coastline views.You can continue along the coast trail about another 1.5 miles to another cove. The trail has its ups and downs. Part of the trail is an unpaved road, so it is wider, but still not paved. It periodically offers coastal views and cove over looks.We used Island Packers for our trip over and back. The boat was clean and offered seating inside and out. There was limited food and beverage service. They do allow camping equipment and kayaks. This can be a popular trip so I suggest making your reservations earlier rather than later.Overall, this trip offers an all day experience unlike most. Keep in mind to pack provisions that will need to be carried out, water and sunscreen.",LifesaSnap
30,Beautiful Scenery just outside of LA,"We camped overnight at Santa Cruz island. The camp was not as ideal as we thought it would be, lots of kids and family during summer time so it was really loud during the day and very few privacy. I wouldn't suggest it if you want a more intimate camping experience.The hikes were great, and a great little sandy beach for snorkling. The ride to the island is a bit expensive, but it's worth it for a weekend getaway that's not far from home. I would also suggest you go for the overnight camp since you get to do sunrise and sunset on the island. BEAUTIFUL!",Kathryn L
30,Kayak and snorkling,The place was really nice and lots of fantastic things to look at however our guides seemed a little less than able we had a hard time reminding them we came to snorkel and they seem to cut it pretty quick with no snorkeling guidance another camp guide had to help us the offered it but really only offered a kayak trip that was a bit disappointing,Beth H
50,A beautiful island!,This was a beautiful island! My husband and I only spent the day here but really enjoyed it. There are picnic tables right on the beach and we enjoyed eating our lunch there. It was basically a private beach!,Musicgirl515
50,A Must Visit!!!,"This review is for Santa Cruz Island attractions.My boyfriend and I did four hikes. We visited on July 4th weekend.1. Cavern Point trail- Short hike from the lower loop campground. This is a great short hike after arriving from an afternoon boat.Note that after 2pm, it gets really windy and the breeze is cool. So, I suggest bring a jacket.2. Harbor & Beach Canyon loopWe only planned to do the cavern point trail but we saw a sign that it will only take.0.5 miles to hit the harbor and beach (starting point where the boat drops you off). So, we decided to finish the loop since these was still up. For this visit, the sun was out until 8pm.The sky was too cloudy to see any stars. Therefore for this trip, we didn't get to stargaze.3. Smuggler's Cove (7miles Round-trip)Tip is to bring lots of water and snacks. Trust! My boyfriend and I only brought 2 liters to share and we ran out. Good thing the Park Rangers drove through the trail and checked up on people. Note that they only pass through once. We didn't check our water pack and denied the water. So, please check your water pack before saying ""No."" The trail is dirt and easy to follow. The trail is mostly open. No shade. There are two steep mountains to climb on the way back. That's when you'll need your water the most. There is a resting area and rocky beach access when you hit Smuggler's Cove. There are two tables but no lockers. There is a pit toilet. No drinking water. The view is worth it.4. Yellowbank overlook (+1.7 miles from Smuggler's Cove) and Yellowbank Bach (+ 0.3 miles from Yellowbank overlook)The Yellowbank overview is crap! The Yellowbank beach is hella worth it. The beach water is super light blue and some parts whitish. The trail from the overlook to the beach is narrow but no cliff and easy to follow. The trail to the beach is very steep but overall safe. Once you get to the beach, there are no sand. It was all rocks but we were able to get our bodies wet by sitting on the rocks. The Wave breaks are huge so we didn't attempt to swim instead we observed the safest spot to sit and let the few waves get on our feet. No lifeguard and no Rangers go out to this point so, swim at your own risk.Overall, Yellowbank beach was the highlight of the trip!",Tinplee
50,Beautiful,We took the Island Packers tour out to the island and it was a blast. We had a great time hiking and sightseeing. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes nature and beauty.,Drea1755
50,Beautiful Natural Setting,"We took the Island Packers boat to Santa Cruz Island last weekend. If you get seasick it is best to sit outside on the lower level. But, it was not very bumpy at all.The island is full of natural beauty, from the ocean vistas to the cute island foxes.There are many various length trails to fit any level of fitness.The water is crystal clear, but a bit cold if you are used to swimming in the tropics.At one point on the boat ride back to Ventura, we were surrounded by whales, dolphins, sea lions and sea birds. It was amazing! The captain stopped for awhile. My husband is Australian, and has been scuba diving all over the world. He said he has never seen anything like it!! It was one of those unforgettable life moments!",Sundancer93003
40,Awesome Hike and Lunch on the Island,"You have to take a boat to get to the Channel Islands, we went with the Island Packers company out of Ventura, CA. The boat ride was said to be an hour long; however on the way out we came across 7 or so whales and took time to see them come up several times. I'd seen whales a couple times before, but this time 2 of them breached out of the water, it was extreme awesome to see. Then maybe 15 minutes before we got to the Island we came upon a tremendous number of dolphins, rather the dolphins came upon us and we went with them for a while. There must have been close to 1,000 maybe more, no joke it was incredible. At one point I looked out from the side of the boat toward the front and saw over 100 dolphins jumping out of the water at once. The dolphins stretched in a line moving through the water and many birds were flying around diving into the water all around the dolphins. I have never seen so many dolphins in my entire life, it was an experience we'll never forget. Someone told me that the abundance of sea creatures in the area was a result of the el nino effect going on this year. We made it to the island and hiked up to Cavern Point a little over a mile or so. From up there you get an awesome view of the Pacific Ocean, can't really see the caverns below you but probably an awesome place to kayak. The day we went the ocean was very calm. We had packed a lunch that we picked up just before leaving and enjoyed it as we took in the beautiful scenery God had created. My 6 year old boy did an awesome job with the hike, but really wanted to get back down to the beach area. He is a little too young to really appreciate the beauty of standing there looking out over the ocean. It was a beautiful day with the sun shining, we had been blessed with incredible weather. Along the hike we saw many birds and some of the island foxes that only live on the Channel Islands they are really neat to see. A good stretch of our hike was along the cliff over looking the ocean we saw some dolphins swimming near the island. Closer to the campground areas and the beach the foxes are not as shy and tend to look for a bite to eat from the tourists. When we hiked back to the beach area my wife and I sat at a picnic table for a bit while my 6 year old played on the beach. The water is cold being the Pacific so not much swimming going on. We saw a large black raven and an island fox both going for the same scrap of food. The fox called in re-forcements and the raven flew off. It was very entertaining for my 15.5 month old daughter, she loves birds and dogs and probably viewed the little foxes as dogs not knowing the difference at her age. If you are wondering we had a light weight child carrier with us so I could carry my daughter either on my back like a backpack or in front. She tended to like riding in front the best; however carrying her on my back was more comfortable for me. We split the time 50/50 both ways. The island was pretty primitive no place to buy anything, no cell service, and only basic bathroom facilities. If our children were a little older we probably would have stayed in a campground there for a night or 2. We boarded the last boat back to the main land around 4:30 pm or so. Again we ran into some whales on the way back, no dolphins this time; though we did see a seal of some sort. It was a great day. Our daughter was free so we just had to pay for myself, my wife, and our 6 year old. Our 6 year old's fee was a little cheaper then the fee for myself and my wife. I thought it was a little expensive when buying the tickets, but after the experience it was well worth it. If the weather had been bad and if we hadn't seen as much wildlife I might not feel that way. The 2 previous times I had been on boats in the ocean multiple people had gotten sea sick, on this trip I didn't see anyone getting sea sick. On the boat ride you need a jacket it gets a little cold, the boat did have some inside seating but you have a much better view outside. The boat also sold snacks and beverages at okay prices and had restrooms. Everyone in the family loved the trip and the island, when the kids are older we'll probably go back and spend a couple nights there and do some kayaking around the island. This is probably not a good destination for anyone that has problems getting around.",Joseph J
50,Place for Natural Outdoor Water Lover,"It was cloudy in Ventura but beautiful on Santa Cruz Island. Take a Dramamine if you get sea sick. With our inflatable kayaks (you can rent and join a tour group), lunch and kayaking/beach clothing, we took an Island Packers boat to get to Santa Cruz Island. The crossing is around 1 hour and we were traveling along with a school of common dolphins. The island is big so you will only see a part of it. The rangers were very helpful and informative. The restrooms were clean and storage lockers are available. The ocean is very clear with healthy vegetation and sea life. We kayaked for 2 hours and went into various caves. Sea lions, bats, birds, fish, and jellyfish were out in the ocean. After kayaking and eating, some of us went hiking while others swam (water is cold so bring a wetsuit) and laid in the sand. The local fox (only found on this island) were out and about. On the way back to the mainland we saw a blue whale, more common dolphins and migrating brids from New Zealand. Worth the time to enjoy and visit.",Stella E
50,Hike and scenery worth the long boat trip,"Took the guided hike out of Prisoner's Landing (Bay) and immediately saw the first of many Santa Cruz Island foxes (indigenous). From the boat the island looks barren and foreboding with steep cliffs and high mountains. Dropped off hikers/campers at Scorpion Bay and headed north for another 20 or so minutes to Prisoners Landing. The guided hike goes into Nature Conservancy land and follows a ridge line climbing high above the deep blue waters. Coastal oaks gave a bit of a canopy. We crossed two canyons and the vistas of distant sail boats, islands, fishing boats, and seascapes and landscapes gave a another perspective to the California coast. The 4 year drought and ending spring meant we just missed flowering gold stars, morning glories, succulents etc. Bird watching is also good with many sea birds, jays,and song birds. We arrived at 1030am and left at 330pm which was plenty of time to make the guided hike to Pelican Bay. I would have preferred a non guided hike but the Conservancy does not allow unoccupied hikes. To that point i wish the whole island was in the NPS domain. Great hike.",RandolphWolf
50,"National Treasure, this National Park is so underrated.","Such a beautiful experience. We left Ventura on Island Packers Cruise for a day trip. We had about 4 hours to explore the island. We took the trail toward campground first and then uphill toward Potato Harbor. Bit of a steep climb for a bit but first views of ocean at the top are truly breath taking. The interior of island is rolling meadows that resemble Scotland and then you come up on the cliffs at the ocean. There are no real facilities on this island except for enclosed pit toilets so bring everything you need with you. Walking out to Potato Harbor and then back along Cavern Point makes for an excellent hike of about 5 miles. Can't think of a better place for a picnic lunch then overlooking Potato Harbor. Not only is the view so amazing but the sounds of the waves crashing on the rocks are just as enjoyable. The boat ride is also so enjoyable. Boat left harbor at 9:00AM and returned at 4:30PM. We saw so many birds, dolphins, seals, a whale and the very rare Island Fox. Such a great day trip.",Johnplatinum
50,Fantastic!,"We have lived in California all our lives and finally took the boat out to hike on Santa Cruz Island in Channel Islands National Park! Such a beautiful place! We hiked the Cavern Point Loop and then hiked the Potato Harbor trail! Beautiful views no matter which direction you look! Canyons, ocean, cliffs, and sea Caves!!!! Next time we will hike the Scorpion Canyon Loop and maybe kayak into the sea caves! Also we now need to see the other islands! Bring plenty of water and a picnic lunch! It is so worth the boat ride out there!!!!",Richard N
50,Beautiful and fun!,"To get there I took Island Packers Cruises. They bring people from the mainland to 5 of the Channel Islands. I went to Santa Cruz this time, and had a great day. There are many miles of hiking, camping, bird and animal watching, kayaking, or many other outdoor things you'd like to do. It is a wilderness that's just across an ocean channel to the mainland with millions of people. There are no stores or things to buy there, just wilderness and lots and lots of trails, which is what me and my friend did. We landed at Scorpion Anchorage, which was a beautiful beach with cobblestone and sand. The water was crystal clear so that you can see the fish swimming around and the giant kelp beds. There were kayakers getting into the water to visit the nearby sea caves. I want to do that sometime soon too. We chose to hike to Potato Harbor which was about 5 miles, round trip. It went around the coastline of the island and was just breathtaking! Along the way we saw many things, like butterflies, hummingbirds and Island Foxes. The little foxes were so cute! They're about the size of a house cat and walked along the trail ahead of us, looking for things to pounce on in the tall grass that lined the trails. Along the way back, we took a loop that brought us through flower lined trails and rolling, grassy hills in the background. We came upon the camping area which was so nice, with trees shading every tent, and wish that I had come to stay for a few days. We sat at the beach to wait for the boat to come back to bring us back to the mainland, and watched children playing in the water, and talked about our wonderful day!",Donna L H
50,Breathtaking views in a pristine environment are like stepping back to another era,"Santa Cruz, the largest island in the Channel Island National Park, offers so many activities for those who love unspoiled beauty. A day trip to the island offers a number of easy, moderate and more difficult hiking trails from Scorpion Ranch. Primitive camping is available for individuals and larger groups.During my day trip experience, I witnessed people hiking, picnicking, snorkeling, kayaking, camping, and lounging. Our ferry both dropped off groups of longer-term campers and picked up other groups who had been camping for a few days or a week.The toilets are pit toilets, i.e., an outhouse-like facility with no running water. Hand sanitizer is available inside each of the 2 toilets.There is a self-guiding visitor's center, a relief map of the island, and various abandoned farming implements that are relics of the days when this island was privately owned and used for farming and ranching near the picnic tables in the flat area a short walk from the pier.The real appeal, at least to me, was the hiking. After a rapid ascent (300 ft.) near the boat landing, hikers enjoy spectacular views of the harbor below. That same trail loops around the higher elevations of the island at this point and offers a taste of unspoiled beauty only about an hour's boat ride from the congested Southern California Coast.Several varieties of plants and animals found only on the islands await your exploration. My group saw lizards, ravens, gulls, butterflies, insects, and the Island Fox.The island is ecologically sensitive, so please do not litter or feed the animals. You will get these instructions during your orientation.I recommend the following if you are planning to hike: a hat (broad-brimmed that ties is best), water, sunscreen, a day pack, binoculars, camera or other device w/camera included, hand sanitizer or sanitizing wipes, hiking shoes or boots, and food/snacks for longer hikes.It is very windy, and the temperature varies depending on where you hike. Dressing in layers is very helpful.If you are unsteady on your feet or not an experienced hiker, hiking poles are very helpful for negotiating the steep inclines and wooden/rock steps.The ferry ride may be smooth and easy, or quite choppy. Be sure to check on the weather conditions and plan accordingly if you tend to become seasick, and even if you usually don't.A stop at the Channel Islands Visitor's Center at the Ventura Harbor is highly recommended to give you the background information that will greatly enhance the island experience.",capitollover

50,Unreal...,"As my wife and I were planning a four night anniversary getaway we decided on CA and stumbled on the Channel Islands as an idea. As I began researching it looked like something worth checking out so we booked our boat ride and the anticipation built. But our anticipation could never prepare us for how beautiful this place actually is. We were floored and in awe throughout our hike, wishing we could have a few extra hours. It's our new favorite place that we've been in 13 years of marriage.It started with a great boat ride out with Island Packers. We saw a bit of wildlife and had some good laughs listening to the captain. The day we went was a short day on the island, 4.5 hours (allot about 30 min for ranger talk and getting back early). Wish it was 6 or 7, we felt a little rushed. But the following day was only 3.5 hours so we chose the longer of the two.We ended up hiking 8 miles (Smuggler's Road-Scorpion Canyon Loop-Potato Harbor Road-North Bluff Trail) and we saw everything we wanted to. But we hiked pretty fast and took few breaks other than photo ops. It was a nice day, about 55-65 degrees while we were there. Between the two of us we drank about a gallon of water. We started off going up the Smugglers' Road. It's the big switch back on the left when you arrive. Right away the views were astounding. It's a two lane trail that climbs steadily to about 1000 ft I'm guessing. There were no crazy hands on your knees climbing this way, just steady uphill. We then took at right, then another right onto Scorpion Canyon Loop trail. This is the highest point on the hike, about 2 miles in, and like everywhere, had amazing views. The trail descended very rapidly for about .5-1 mile down to the campground. I felt that we picked the right direction since the counter-clockwise route would have been much steeper (quad blaster on the way down!). We saw 5-6 little foxes just hanging out in the campground. They are very tame and you can walk right up to them and they'll pretty much ignore you. There is a restroom here in the campground. We're about 3 miles in at this point. At the end of the campground we turned left (and uphill again) to Potato Harbor. This mile stretch was my least favorite. Compared to the rest of the hiking, it was slightly dull. But WOW, once you get to Potato Harbor, it's all worth it! The view here is the prettiest I've ever seen. If time allows, allot about an hour to just soak it up and explore a little bit. We were rushed to get back so we had to go. From here it was 2.5 miles back to the boat and we had about 55 minutes to do it in. Heading back we hopped on the North Bluff Trail and took the most direct route down. We skipped Cavern Point, wish we would've hit it, but my wife was ready to be back and we were cutting it close. I figured it would have added about 3/4 of a mile to our hike back. Oh well, something for next time.The boat crew had a roster when we climbed aboard and we pushed off early. Guess we had everyone accounted for! We ran into a huge group of dolphins that swam with us which was really cool. The ride back was relaxing while we sat inside the galley and looked at pictures, snacked and had a drink. If you're going to CA you NEED to do this day trip. You won't regret it!",Ben K
50,Excellent Day Outing with Lots of Wildlife,"We took Island Packers out of Ventura to visit Santa Cruz Island. On the way over to the island we saw California Grey Whales and Pacific Grey Whales (though I couldn't tell the difference). We followed them for a bit and watched them coming up for air. On the island we saw lots of birds and many foxes. We hiked over to Potato Harbor which was beautiful. On the way back to Ventura we saw two pods of dolphin and that was amazing! We also saw sea lions playing in the water. The boat crew was very knowledgeable about the marine life and narrated during our encounters with the wildlife during our one-hour crossings. A few things to remember: it's chilly in the morning aboard the boat so wear layers. There are unlocking ""lockers"" on the island that you can use to put overcoats and stuff you think you won't need. Also, you need to bring lots of food and water. There is NOTHING to buy on the island. You pack everything you'll need, and pack out your trash, too. Wear comfortable shoes. The ground is uneven.",zoofamily
50,Beautiful escape from civilization,"Pure nature just a short one hour boat ride away. Lots of hiking trails and picturesque views. This was the first time I went when I wasn't scuba diving and it really blew me away. Really felt like we were away from civilization, very relaxing. Almost no amenities outside of composting toilets so bring a pack with food and water. Island Packers has very nice and clean boats to get you there.",Steve O
50,Beautiful island; whale migration; unique animals,"Santa Cruz Island is gorgeous! The islands remain pristine. Winter is migration season for the gray whales, and there were plenty to see. The island is also home to some species that exist nowhere else. The island scrub jay can only be found on the island. The island fox is also unique to the islands, with each island having its own subspecies. The trip over by Island Packers is relaxing and scenic. They also offer hikes to parts of the island that are usually closed to the public.",Jeffrey F
50,Beautiful island; We saw humpback whales on our way there and back,"Great day trip with the Island Packers cruise. We were very lucky to encounter humpback whales both on the way to the island and coming back (October 31). The boat crew made a detour and allowed 15-20 minutes for us to admire the whales while providing some useful information. While on the island we did the classic Cavern Point loop trail which is a must, accompanied by a park volunteer.I'm told that doing a guided kayak tour is a must to. Maybe next time..",FrequentTraveler2810
50,Santa Cruz Island - Day Trip,"Took my 8 yr old son for his birthday. The boat ride over by Island Packers was great. Apparently, the weather and water were perfect for early January. Very calm seas and not a lot of wind.On the way to the island, the boat captain detoured to view dolphins, whales and sea lions giving some cool facts about them, too.I can't recommend this trip enough as a day trip or even an overnight camping adventure. The campgrounds looked clean and the rangers were very friendly and helpful. Pit toilets, no showers, but there was drinking water in the campgrounds. Scenic views and great memories.",Jason W
50,Splendid day out,"What a great way to spend the day - whale & dolphin watching, walking the trails, spying the pygmy fox. If I were to go again, I would avoid going on a weekend, there were a few rent-a-mob types there, en mass, travelling in the proverbial pack, making a lot of noise and that bit was not conducive to the nature experience (in my opinion). But if you walk fast (in the opposite direction, preferably!) you should be able to enjoy the tranquility that is so lovely there. Take a picnic (pack in, pack out, don't leave scrap of anything that wildlife may accidentally ingest) and take in all that lovely - quite spare - beautiful coastline & the paths that circumnavigate the perimeter.",YR R
50,Nice day trip,"We took Island Packers to Santa Cruz Island, Scorpion landing. Either spend the day on the island on a sea cave kayak tour (use Channel Island Outfitters) or hike to the top of the bluffs for great views of the ocean or stay and camp there for a night. We took a guided hike with a naturalist who came over on the Island Packers boat. You can do some snorkeling; the water is very clear. The island is beautiful with green grass covering it in the winter; I bet all of that turns brown later in the year.",James L
50,Absolutely worth it.,"We enjoyed a beautiful day at this park as we hiked about 8-10 miles. As others have noted, the views are amazing but there is also that wonderful sense of going back in time. We landed at Scorpion. My wife and I believed it lived up to its claim as ""the Galapagos of California"" as it is remote and stark in its beauty. We were also impressed with the marine life visible from the boat on the way out and back. Hundreds of common dolphins and quite a few gray whales too. We hope to go back some day to see more of the islands and also to see the progress of the revegetation efforts. Fascinating and beautiful place.",Jonathan Z
40,Great Day Trip from LA!,I loved the boat ride over to the island. I wish we had gone during a season where the chances of more marine life being seen in the channel but we will go back again. Great for a day trip from LA and the biggest compliment is that our teenager enjoyed it too!,Arye B
50,Fabulous day trip,"This day trip to Santa Cruz Island exceeded all expectations. The boat ride with pretty, with hundreds of dolphins swimming around the boat. The trails on the island were numerous and worked well for several hours of hiking. The views were stunning. Next time I'm out in CA I'll do another trip to Anacapa Island.",Susan B
50,Paradise,"Chartered a sail boat for 2 days and spent our time in a little cove on the west side of the island. What can I say, maybe we just hit the perfect weekend here but the weather was 80, water temp 70 degrees, glassy and very clear. We spent our time spear fishing, cruising around in the dingy, and hiking. Saw over 100 dolphins, seals, a whale, foxes, bald eagles, and hundreds of fish. It was a truly amazing experience I would recommns to anyone. I think September and October are good due to weather and lack of fog.",Matty778899
50,Santa Cruz island - expensive but worth the day trip,"Went on a Tuesday and the boat was packed with people. The boat ride to the island takes an hour so prepare yourself if you are prone to sea sickness. Also you must ring back everything you take, so take trash bags if you plan on eating a lot. And bring plenty of water, especially if it is going to be warm. Check the weather.If you plan on hiking and doing the kayak try to get things started early. Apparently the winds change direction and you are advised to kayak certain parts at certain time.The cave point hike was awesome. It is basically a trail along the bluff. With clear blue skies and cool strong pacific wind, the hike was fantastic.",highlandertx
40,Fun day trip near Santa Barbara,Our son attends UCSB and we have wanted to make a trip to the Channel Islands nearby for some time. We booked a long weekend and took a day trip to Santa Cruz Island. The boat trip over was a highlight with schools of dolphin swimming and jumping around us several times. We took a kayak trip upon arrival (booked in advance) and loved the sea caves. Would have been more fun if the groups had been loosely organized by ability. We are pretty experienced and fit. One couple really struggled to keep up and held us all back.The island is pretty desolate with little shade so take a hat! The hikes have some incredible views so well worth it.,Fifistravels
50,Beautiful!,"My husband and I spent the day here and it was amazing! We went on two hikes with great views. Make sure to take your lunch, snacks and plenty of water since there is nothing for purchase on the island. One of the park rangers mentioned that the only place to refill your water is at one of the campgrounds. The boat ride was nice too. We saw 6 humpback whales and dolphins. Overall it was a lovely day. Can't wait to go back. I'd like to snorkel next time.",Nubia0807
50,fun safe camping trip,"Took my grandkids to on the ferry to Santa Cruz Island. We camped for 2 days. It was so much fun! Kids enjoyed roughing it and having the foxes in our camp each day was great. We ate wild lemonade berries, hiked to smugglers cove and just enjoyed being together.",lsdourte
50,Santa Barbara Adventure Company - Santa Cruz Island Kayaking,"My wife and I recently had an amazing adventure. We did the Santa Barbara Adventure Company's Santa Cruz Island - Sea Caves Kayaking trip over the Labor Day weekend (8-30-14). We had done another previous kayaking trip in the past, and on a different island with them, and....they never fail to deliver a pleasant, enjoyable and memorable experience. We still cannot believe that these islands are so beautiful and the waters so Blue right here in our own backyard. We have lived here in Southern California our whole lives and although we have always kayaked a lot, we did not even know until recently about Santa Barbara Adventure Company and / or their excellent kayaking boat trip's that were within 2 1/2 hours of where we lived. All of their guides are well educated, well trained in what you do, they are personable and the trips are always consistently instructed, supervised, and safe. Last time we had Kenji Webb as our kayaking guide with them and this time we had Adam Sachs, and they both delivered!! What a great well run and organized company. We plan on doing other trips (biking, kayaking, and hiking) with them.Robert & Theresa Gaouette - Foothill Ranch, CARobert & Theresa Gaouette - Foothill Ranch, CA",Bob G
40,"Put This on Your ""To Do"" List","Take the ferry to Santa Cruz Island and it's your for the day. They go through great lengths to keep the Channel Islands in its natural condition. You can snorkel in the cleanest, clearest water in California (although it is a bit chilly), hike, or sign up with Channel Island Outfitters and kayak in the sea caves for a totally different experience. Go check out this national treasure.",IslandLovinTwosome
50,wow,"Why have I never heard of this place! Amazing! Short trip 1 hour boat ride, its not at all what I expected it to be. Everything is easy from the time you book (online) to the minute you step on the island. We camped at Scorpion for 3 days and we hiked and snorkeled all day long. The ocean is beautiful, we took our underwater camera and caught rays, urchins, large fish and sea lions!!! Already planning our trip back. Take all you need because there are no stores on site. Be prepared to walk wherever you need to go. Loved it!",mnmfum
50,Great Snorkeling but it is cold,"we went in July and the waters were fantastic. pristine kelp forests, shallow waters, not too many people. I saw different types of fish, a leopard shark, a rare blue shark, an eel, a large crab and lobster, seals, and other underwater animals. the water is clear(great for photography). The only issue is that the water was in th lower 50's and I didn't have a wetsuit, so I got very cold, very quick. Bring a wetsuit!!!!",Bubbles72000
40,excellent family adventure,"I wanted to take my teenaged grandkids on an adventure that didn't involve electronics, and asked my son to come along for the paddle. I chose to do some sea kayaking in the Channel Islands, and I'm so glad that I did! We camped overnight because I was unsure of the timing on the kayaking and the boat back to Ventura. You can easily make a day trip of this; the kayak guides get you back onshore at 2ish and the boat leaves at 4, but the camping and second day of paddling is worth the stay. The campground has about 20 sites spread out over a smallish valley, so you have plenty of room.There is a lot of hiking to be done over lovely, uncrowded, countryside. The sea caves are impressive, and offered enough adventure to keep all of us excited about the trip. We used Aquasports for the trip; they provide the guide (Jim was great), kayaks, safety gear, a wheelbarrow to haul your gear to and from the dock, and the ""kitchen"" for your campsite. The kitchen is a medium plastic tub with everything you need to prep your meals, a propane stove, and the fuel.The campsite has a bear box to protect your food from the tiny, but ubiquitous, island foxes. The only downside of the whole trip is the smell of the pit toilets, if the other visitors fail to close the lid after use.I would recommend the trip to anyone without small kids, and with the physical abilities to climb a short ladder and hike. My 34 year old son, 15 year old grandson, and 14 year old granddaughter enjoyed it very much, and I loved it.",BarbZoo
50,Gorgeous for hiking,"I've wanted to go to the Channel Islands for years now, and we finally made the trip. We took a ferry with Island Packers from Ventura. I love boats and being on the water, so the ride over there was really fun. We saw Risso's dolphins, and evidently that's really rare for this area.One thing I'll do differently next time is bring a knit beanie and a warmer jacket. I underestimated how chilly I would get. It was a fairly warm day (July), but I stood out on the bow where I had no shelter from the wind. (Great views, though). I got pretty cold, and it took quite some time to warm up even after we got to the island.Once we got to the island we took an interpretive hike with a volunteer who described a lot of history about our surroundings. We then went on a hike on our own, and ate the lunch we had brought with us. The views of the ocean are gorgeous from the bluffs.The campground is really nice, and we plan to camp there another time.Here are a few basic facts about visiting the island:There is no food for purchase (nor anything else for purchase)There is a visitor center, but it's not staffed. It has some informational pictures and videos.There are a couple of restrooms - one near the visitor center and one or more in the campground.There are wastebaskets in the restrooms, but those are meant just for paper towels. You need to pack out all the waste that you bring in.The beach is pretty rocky.There were several kids playing in the water, so evidently it's not terribly cold (in the summer).If you want to kayak, you have two options: 1) bring your own kayak on the boat (the Island Packers ferries have special racks to hold them) or 2) Go out there with a kayaking outfitterThe hiking is pretty much all on big, wide trails. There are some that are narrow and steep, but for the most part, just about anyone of any fitness level could hike there.",LosAngelesTravelBug
40,Beautiful views but bare landscape and little wildlife,The boatride was wonderful with views of both the mainland and islands. On the island we had an hour guided hike with one if the parks very nice and knowledgeable volunteers. The island itself was very bare which made the hike less interesting. We did see wild fox on the island and dolphins from the boat.,Felizia
50,A Unique National Treasure,"To get a campsite on the Channel Islands, go to www.recreation.gov then arrange your ferry trip through Island Packers. We departed Ventura at 8 am and our return ferry was at 4pm. It is an easy walk from the pier to the campsites but there are a few handcarts if you must bring lots of gear. Sites are in a treed area with flat, hard dirt sites for tents.The Smugglers Cove hike was great but do not expect a sandy beach. We enjoyed the solitude. We also enjoyed the hike to Potato Cove lookout; the views of the shoreline were beautiful. Kayak in the morning when it is calm. The wind picks up in the afternoon. The NP visitors center is small but has interesting displays.",babobear1
40,Great views!,"This was a great island to see! We did the hike to potato harbour and it was perfect. There are breathtaking views along the way. This whole hike was along the coast . Just a heads up, once you go up, there are zero trees. So make sure you are well protected from the sun and have enough water!",sindujasreshta
50,Awesome adventure island,"Loved this island. We kayaked, swam, snorkeled, and hiked. The campground is fantastic but they have pit toilets only :(The foxes are little buggers and will get into everything so bring your items in storage bins or coolers that can lock. Throughly recommend Channel Island Outfitters ( J.D. the guide) for the kayaking and snorkeling.",sarahlevitt
50,Beautiful and unspoiled,"I'm so glad we visited Santa Cruz Island. We took the boat out from Ventura Harbor and had a fairly smooth crossing (glad I took Bonine, though), highlighted by sighting a pod of dolphins! Once at Scorpion Bay, we stowed our lunch in the ""fox-proof"" lockers and took off for a hike to Potato Harbor (gorgeous!) and Cavern Point - about 5 miles round trip and mostly flat. We started at the back of the campground near space 22. Then we came back and had a picnic, while watching a curious island fox seeking leftovers! My husband and daughter donned wetsuits and snorkeled out to a sea cave. They reported seeing about 7 kinds of fish and lots of kelp. This island is mostly undeveloped, though there are historical buildings from the ranching era. The visitor center has a nice interpretive exhibit on the history of the island. Overall it's quiet, beautiful, and unspoiled, and a lovely way to spend a day. Highly recommended!",Jeanette1
50,Peaceful Place,"It's a little different being on an island that's isolated! But we spent 2 nights at Scorpion Ranch campground in late June and it was beautiful! No campfires meant we all (2 leaders, 6 Girl Scouts) went to sleep early! We hiked to Potato Harbor, and to Cavern Point - both beautiful spots! The wind kicks up a bit, especially in the afternoon and it got a little chilly. We kayaked on Saturday (Aquasports was THE BEST!!) and it was a not-to-be-missed outing!",cwgiraffe
40,Following a rain storm,"It was a bit muddy on the trails and the path from the dock in was underwater, but we enjoyed learning about the history and the restoration, saw one of the small foxes that are on the island, enjoyed the views from up high and the boat ride, with dolphins coming across (couple whales in the distance too). The mainland centre was informative as well.",Donald F
50,Group Camping,"I've been group camping on Santa Cruz Island twice and thoroughly enjoyed both times!We were ferried to the island, both times, by Island Packers out of Ventura Harbor. They allowed us to bring our camping gear as well as kayaks.On the island there are no campfires allowed. There are pit restrooms provided.Use the food lockers provided or the Island Foxes will destroy your camp. They are not afraid of humans and will come raiding before you even get to sleep. They look beautiful and you'll want photos.We used our kayaks to explore the shoreline and the sea caves there. They're magnificent!And there are hiking trails that provide breathtaking views of the other islands from mountaintops.",Bobbyodawg
50,Hike with the Nature Conservancy--Splendid,"Book your ferry transport with Island Packers ($54 for ages 55+ and $59 for other adults) and prepare for both a pleasant and wildlife-packed trip to Santa Cruz island. The ferry docks first at Scorpion Anchorage, and then 30 minutes later at Prisoners. Bring all food and water. There are fly-infested (but completely usable) toilets and rectangular lockers (sans locks) to store extra gear you don't want to haul around on the 4 mile r/t ramble with a Nature Conservancy guide.The ferry trip with Captain Jason was spectacular in both directions in mid May. We saw both blue and humpback whales and dozens of Common Dolphins on the trip out, and we were greeted with a fantastic pod of hundreds of dolphins chasing a school of anchovies on the way back. Utterly fabulous and somewhat unexpected because the majority of the whales have already migrated.We arrived at Prisoners on Santa Cruz Island in the midst of a 100 degree heat wave, and it was certainly hotter than the hinges of hades on the hike. There is some, but limited shade, but the views of the ocean and the other islands along with the extraordinary flora made for a memorable if sweaty hike. Wear trail shoes or hiking boots.The Channel Islands are fabulous; don't miss them.",GJS
50,Amazing Views,"I have wanted to come here for a very long time so I had high hopes....Let's just say I was not let down. If you enjoy hiking like I do this is a must do experience for you. The terrain is varied and beautiful on the coast you can see lot's of craggily cliffs, caves, the interior has fields of wild flowers. Apparently the beaches are really nice as well. My husband and I saw lizards, pelicans, and other birds. On our boat ride back we watched a Feeding Frenzy with hundreds of dolphins, sea lions, a couple of whales. This experience was a once of a life time kind of event. If I was to do this again I would take dramamine before taking the ferry the ride was extremely choppy. Remember to bring your lunch and water with you there are lot's of perfect picnic areas.",KRL32
50,An Amazing and Varied Experience,"Our trip with Aquasports allowed us to do a few amazing things in one day. On the boat ride over and back we saw humpback whales. They were very close and we saw a couple of breaches (when they jump out of the water).The best part of the trip was kayaking into the sea caves. There are many where you can kayak right through narrow passages and exit in a different spot. I have kayaked in many spots around the world and this was by far my favorite and most interesting day of paddling. Our guide Andy, of Aquasports, was a real pro and a lot of fun to paddle with.After kayaking, we hiked up the hill above Potato Harbor. The wildflowers were in bloom, and the views around to the other islands were extraordinary.",Darren R
50,Nice hike and beautiful view,"We went for a day trip to the island on our kids' spring break. The 1.5 hour boat to the island was pretty bumpy, and my 5 year old son had a tough time, but the hike after that was great. We hiked to potato harbor from scorpion ranch, coming back the coast trail. The weather was perfect and the view was beautiful! The homeward boat to Ventura was better than the outward.",Ryua
50,California Galapagos,"Like stepping back in time 100 years. See how coastal California looked before the introduction of exotic plants. Great place for kayaking, sea caves and rocky inlets abound; check the weather before going. Take an Island Packers boat out of Ventura Harbor. They also rent the kayaks. Pack a picnic lunch and take a hike on the beautiful coastline. Summer and late Fall are the best times to visit.",frqentravlr
40,Outdoor Adventure,"It's NOT Catalina Island so please don't go if you can't handle a desolate island.Trip out: You must make reservations with Island Packers who has a monopoly on public boating transportation services to the channel islands. On the way out, Captain Dave took a 10-15 minute detour so the passengers could see gray whales, dolphins and seals which was pretty cool.THERE: Bring EVERYTHING you may need in a day's journey: water, food, layer clothing for all types of weather, etc...there is a place to keep personal stuff so animals won't get to it but no lockers.On the island it's just the great outdoors and nothing more!!!!!!Pros:PeacefulnessSolitudeHikingKayakingCampingFishingSnorkeling & DivingAnimal watchingRelaxing!!!!Cons:The price of transportation and kayak tourKayaking: My suggestion is Aquasports out of Ventura. I saw the other tours with 10+ people while Aquasports tour group was my husband and I with another couple. I'm not saying that this will always be the case, but check it out first. Our tour guide, Tony, had a lot of experience (kayak and rescue) and knowledge (life and education). It felt like a private customized-tour instead of being with heaps of people. I felt safe while exploring caves and being exposed to the open sea.",Gonzowuz
40,Fun day trip,Went out to the Scorpion entrance in the morning and spent the day hiking before the boat ride back to the mainland. You must take all your own food and drinks. The views are beautiful. We hiked out to potato cove; good view from the top. Saw lots of dolphins on the ride there and back. The only disappointment was how brown everything was due to the drought. Hope for rain soon.,Boston59_10
50,Absolutley Breathtaking Views,"We had such a great time. The ride over was a little choppy, but didn't bother us. The weather was beautiful for Valentine's day. We took the carvern point trail clockwise. There is a moderate grade in the begining, but then it is flat or downhill. The views from the cliffs and the beach were beautiful. So serene and unspoiled. The ranch has a bit of interesting history. You can bring a book and read in the wilderness or explore the trails.There is no running water or flushing toilets and you need to pack in your food/drinks and pack out your trash. It is well worth it.",Joanne1187
50,A day trip was beautiful and breathtaking,"We went for an afternoon of hiking and drinking in the scenery. We weren't disappointed! We arrived in the Scorpion entrance. The 'ranch' was a little disappointing but the views were the reason we were there and it was beautiful. We took the Cavern Point hike with a volunteer guide named Carol. She was enthusiastic and informative and gave us a lot of great information. She also waited patiently for the slower members of our party (including me with a bad ankle!). She led us clockwise on the hike which was definitely the way to go! At Cavern Point the views were spectacular and people could go on to Potato Harbor if we had more time. The services including restroom and water are limited but available, but there is no food service so be sure to bring your own. Highly recommended and a true getaway from the daily grind of Southern California.",NorthOCTraveler
50,the first of many visits to an incredible nature preserve,"I have wanted to visit the Channel Islands for years. This August I finally made it. And now, I know I have to go back. We did an all-day trip to Santa Cruz Island via the Channel Island outfitters concession (which runs very smoothly). On the boat ride out, we saw seals hanging out on buoys, jostling each other for spots on the limited real estate that a buoy has to offer. The back right side of the boat got a little wet from spray, so sit further front if you want to stay dry.We took a tour with one of the naturalists, which was a wonderful idea. You will learn things you wouldn't otherwise. When the tour ended up at the top of the bluffs, we hiked further west and had lunch on another bluff overlooking an isolated bay, and listened to seals somewhere nearby. It was magical. I took tons of photos despite not being much of a photographer.On the hike back, we saw one of the Channel Island foxes. It was poking around the picnic tables, snagging food that people had dropped. these foxes are much smaller than the gray foxes on the mainland. One of the species that gives the Channel Islands the name, The Galapagos of California.The information center was interesting too. One of the old buildings from the ranch, it had photos, displays of the typical supplies in the ranch pantry, and interesting historical facts.These islands also offer kayaking, camping, and a lot more.",Bonnie B
50,Not for the faint of heart,"This is a very unique and isolated national park. The only way on any of the islands is by a park concession. This turned out to be a great experience. The boat was modern and run by a five-person crew who made themselves available to answer questions and help with any problems.This trip included a sixth-grade group (52!) that really worried us since the trip was well over an hour long. No problem. The crew kept all the kids on the lower deck and only adults were allowed on the upper deck. Actually it was fun to watch how excited the students were.On the way over we saw seals, and coming back from the islands we saw dolphins and four whales, and November was out of season for the whales. The crew circled several times to let everyone see. Very exciting.The Islands were quite different. We landed on Santa Cruz at a pier that was at the headquarters of the park. It is very much unimproved, and we considered that a good thing. The Rangers and volunteer interpreter were on hand to help us and to act as guides on the numerous trails.Hiking is the only real activity, and there only one “easy” trek. The rest were “moderate” (and were quite difficult) or “strenuous.”If you like to hike, this is a great park. Be warned, however. There is no shade and the temperature and sun make hikes very hot. This is exactly opposite to the boat trip. That was very cold and windy. There is also no water or food—bring your own.The Park Service is letting the park stay natural. That’s a good thing, but it’s not a park for folks who like their conveniences.",Dixie M
40,Half-day trip barely scratched the surface,"I'd long meant to visit the Channel Islands, and so when I was going to be in the area, I made a point of going. Sadly, I could only go for half a day (boat left at noon, and I returned at 5), but that was enough time to get a general impression. I followed a loop to Potato Harbor and back, joining a park volunteer for the first leg of the trail, who was very helpful about selecting an itinerary for the day, and providing information about the island and the Park as a whole. The inland views on this hike lack a bit of variety, but the coastal views are amazing, and each cove you pass seems to have a different personality, and provided more than enough to see to keep the hike interesting. And while I wished I had more time on the island, the truth is I was pretty wore out by the end of the hike (though taking a more leisurely pace, had I had more time, probably would have helped).I do think the island might be over-sold at times, with claims of ""Galapagos of the U.S."" which might set expectations a tad high. But I did enjoy myself, and would like to come back and see more of the island. Even the boat ride over, while a bit rough, was fun, and I saw lots of wildlife (more than I saw on the island, actually, where mainly all I saw were crows).",Mike M
40,America's Galapagos Islands - best kept secret,"I only recently learned about the Channel Islands. I've visited the Galapagos and, though their are similarities, it does not have the varied wildlife I had hoped to see. What it does have, and this is extremely important, are initiatives to return it to its previous natural state. Much of this effort is done with the help of the Nature Conservancy who owns about half of this island. While there are beautiful views of the ocean by the trails, only a couple are easy enough for the non-hiker. From what I saw, the big draw is the water sports; e.g., kayaking, snorkeling. There are camping sites available, though you must bring your own water and supplies. There are out houses. The Islands are meant to remain pristine, though this will be a challenge as more people hear about this park.There was a Native American ceremony in progress while I was there. It honored several of the indigenous tribal people with songs and drumming while awaiting the traditional wooden vessels to arrive. It was an unexpected and thoroughly enjoyable event.The National Park Service is the best source of info about the various islands.",LeeB13
50,Snorkeling around scorpion bay,"We did a hiking/snorkeling day trip to Santa Cruz and it was amazing. We rented the snorkeling gear from Ventura Dive and Sport for the day which was just down the boardwalk from Island Packers. For $35 you receive a complete wetsuit, hood, booties, snorkel, mask and fins for the day which we carried on the ferry with us. We went in early September and the water was still pretty chilly so going with a full wetsuit is really the only way to go. We went out on the 8:00 am ferry and came back on the 4:00 ferry and that gave us plenty of time for a nice hike to get warmed up and then a 2 hour snorkel to cool down. (If you go on the early ferry you'll need to rent the snorkel gear the night before and the dive shop closes at 6) We hiked to Potato Harbor and back which was a very nice hike with great views but if we did it again we may have only gone as far as cavern point and then spent more time snorkeling. We went in the water right where the ferry dropped us off and saw some great marine life. We saw several stingrays, crabs, schools of exotic fish and even had a pair of seals swim right past us underwater. Exploring the kelp forests and sea caves was fascinating and we were glad that we opted for the snorkel instead of the kayaking as we wouldn't have been able to see all the underwater marine wildlife from the kayaks. It's a great day trip but I'm not sure that we would want to spend much more than that out there on the island.",hanzgruber
40,beautiful!,"We took a day trip to the island for my husband's birthday. We planned a day of hiking, picnicking, and relaxing on the beach. The boat ride over (with Island Packers) was spectacular! We saw lots of dolphins, sea lions, and birds. Once on the island, we saw very little wildlife besides birds and insects (disappointing, as I was hoping to see one of the foxes!) The hiking was great! We went to Potato Harbor, which was a fairly easy walk along the cliffs facing the mainland. Most of the people who came on the boat with us went kayaking, so for the first few hours we felt as though we were the only ones on the island! It was such a surreal and wonderful feeling. The views from the cliffs were spectacular! It was very warm and there is very little shade to be found, so come prepared with sunscreen and hats. We were on the island from 9 AM to 5PM, which was plenty of time to do all the hiking we wanted. Next time, we are looking forward to going kayaking and snorkeling! The water is a beautiful, clear blue-green. I also enjoyed going into the small visitor center, where we learned about the Chumash Native Americans and the ranch family who owned the island in the past.Overall, highly recommended!",uclatraveler9
50,Painted Cave Kayaking Day Trip,"We went on a day trip to the West end of Santa Cruz island to kayak Painted Cave and several other caves along that part of the island.Painted Cave is one of the largest sea caves in the world. Our guide said by volume, it is the largest in the world. It is a very amazing cave on an island which is a kayaking lovers paradise.We left Santa Barbara on a chartered boat (The Truth from Truth Aquatics) at 8:00AM, arrived at the island about 10:30AM, kayaked for 2-3 hours and then headed back about 3pm and arrived in SB Harbor about 5:30pm.The weather was beautiful, clear skies, good visibility, calm channel to cross and great conditions for kayaking.The boat dropped us off at Emerald Cove - we launched from back of boat - and then picked us up a couple of miles down the coast at Quail Rock.On our kayaking trip, we went to the following caves and coves:- Fern Grotto Cove- Landslide Cave- Boomers Cave- Seal Secret- Painted Cave- Tunnel CaveIt was a great trip.On the boat ride over, we saw two small pods of common dolphin. On the Truth we had a nice breakfast with coffee and after kayaking they made a great pasta lunch with fresh cookies for dessert.Of course we had a few beers after getting back to celebrate a great day.",Craig-World-Travelle
40,Nice Day Trip!,"Overall, I quite enjoyed the day trip to Santa Cruz Island. Our boat left with Island Packers at 9am and took about an hour to get to the island. On the way over we were able to see a bunch of sea lions and dolphins. Pretty cool.When we finally got to the island at Scorpion Bay we had 6 hours to do what ever we wanted. We ended up using that time to do the lengthier Scorpion Canyon hike which went through the canyon, up the side of it, and ended with views of the island and the neighboring Anacapa Island. And during that entire work we only ran into 2 other people walking it in the opposite direction. After that hike we did an Outlook hike (don't remember the real name) but it was short and gave us beautiful ocean views of views of Santa Cruz' cliffs. This one had a lot more people (probably since it was easy and short).After the 2 hikes we checked out the little visitor's center (where unfortunately most of the displays were not working) and watched a family of 3 island foxes playing until the boat came back at 4. The foxes are adorable and are only found in the islands.It was a nice day trip and my first trip out to the Channel Islands. While not the best National Park that I've ever been to, it is well worth it at least once.",hilo88
50,Oasis to reset the mind/body/soul,"I'm in love with nature. It allows for uninterrupted meditation time; it is the only freedom from all the stress that we human beings are going through. I'm glad we have a National Parks governing agency that is having and expressing the attitude of respect for nature. Such a beautiful place to simply just BE. You must come to experience this for oneself to realize the magnificence that this Earth is.""Wilderness complements and completes civilization. . . . Any society that feels itself too poor to afford the preservation of wilderness is not worthy of the name of civilization."" ~ Edward Abbey",Ambiguous420
50,A unique NP experience,"If you love our National Parks, this place is a must see and will not disappoint. My in-laws were told to check out Anacapa a few years back and they ran out of ways to complain about being stuck on that rock for 8 hours. I wish they had been able to experience Santa Cruz instead. What an amazing place this is! First of all, it's the biggest island off the west coast of the US. I was shocked to see how high the peaks of the mountains were when the ferry was getting close. This island has a lot to offer. If you plan ahead and make sure to bring enough food and other comforts, you can have a very nice and safe day trip or camping experience. There are really no dangerous animals and without any vehicles or roads, you don't need to worry about getting run over. My son and I camped here for three nights and once the day-trippers left each afternoon, we felt like we had the island to ourselves.",CSNBR
50,Truly one of the BEST day trips from Los Angeles area.,"Just did this mini vacation trip July 2013. Really one of the best day / short trips from Los Angeles Area. Would absolutely recommend this trip for anyone out of town who loves outdoors and maritime activities. True adventure if you include the sea cave kayaking or diving.Would recommend booking a kayaking and/or camping trip with any of the tour outfitters that go here. Save you the headache of bringing all the gear, kayaks and arranging the small stuff. Besides they have the boat transportation and it costs about the same to arrange individually. We went with Channel Island Outfitters who were Excellent.Sign up for the early or later Sea Caves Kayak tour and hike the island the other half of the day. There are lots of sea and wildlife. Guaranteed to see plenty of Dolphins, sea lions, seals, and various birds. The island foxes come out early and later day. Take the 8 am or 9am ferry out and 5pm back. Or you can camp on the island overnight. There are great seafood and ethnic restaurants at the dock with a Holiday Inn and Sherraton.Great memorable trip for my two kids 6 and 12. Make sure to bring food, snacks and change of clothes and a jacket. Gets cold on the boat rides and when it is overcast.",edcheung
50,Awesome views!!!!,"This entire island is amazing! we took the earliest boat out and arrived early. The hiking is awesome and the views are spectacular. Yuo can snorkel and kayak, swim and hike, what else could you ask for! Smugglers Cove trail is a bit steep, actually very steep, but well worth the strugglewhenyou get to the top. If you continue downaways you can get some beautiful pictures of the water,cliffs and coves. Actually, all the trails are worth exploring , we did see three channel foxes on the day we were there, that was worth the trip alone. I am definitely going back, and will take the all day kayak tour next. Everyone should go to this gem in California at least once.",Martha B
50,Amazing place,"This is really an amazing way to spend a day. The boat ride over on Island Packers is an hour long - just long to enjoy the great view of the harbor and then that of the island. Dolphins came up to the boat to greet us about half way through the trip to the island. There are bathrooms when you get off the island and several more in the campgrounds which are not much further away. We brought water and some sandwiches we bought at Vons, a grocery store not far from the harbor. We had a great picnic lunch with an incredible view.We hiked up to Cavern Point with a volunteer guide, who gave us a free, one-hour tour. It was very informative and told us some things about the history and restoration of the island we had not read in our research. We then hiked out to Potato Harbor. The island is really beautiful and the views are incredible. We were disappointed that we did not see any foxes, then on the end of our hike, we ran into 2, then 2 more, and then we saw one up in the hills. We saw them near the visitor center on the way back to the boat. A great way to end an incredible day.",YesTravelNow
50,Great Hiking,"We traveled to Santa Cruz Island with Island Packers, and had a great afternoon of hiking. Actually, we were led on our hike by a staff member of the boat. The trip was so much more than we anticipated, and had a great time with ""Paul"". He had great knowledge of the history of the island, and shared so much with us. The vistas of the ocean were glorious, and the trails were fairly well maintained. The movie about the Channel Islands at the visitor's center in Ventura Harbor gave is a good orientation of the islands before we sailed. All of the National Park movies are outstanding. You are truly alone with nature out on the islands. Hard to imagine that not to far away on the mainland of California, millions of people live.",Lucille M
50,Breathtaking!,"Although the boat ride out there was a little pricey, the island was wonderful for a day hike. We climbed the first hill we came to and quickly got to the top of the cliffs overlooking the ocean. We hiked the cliff trail before heading back inland. We also saw one of the foxes that is native to the islands. Despite a little sunburn, we had a great day!",Mike M

50,the best views in California come from the cliffs of Channel islands,"One word: STUNNING! On my tour of the California coast, this was one decision I will never forget. Get the boat from Ventura harbor and reserve beforehand. My boat and the others leaving that day were fully booked. call/ go to: Island packers 1691 Spinnaker Dr #105B Ventura, CA 93001(805) 642-1393. Remember to spend time in the next door visitor center museum and movie theater that are free. The fee to get out there is around $60pp. You will have a good 4-6hrs to explore. I would definately recommend the boat, then hike/explore. Then come out later to kayak. I didnt get sea sick but its a small boat that will feel each wave for those that get the tummy jitters. Theres a chance you will see whales. You will see sea lions and dolphins. If you go on one hike, I would go to cavern point. The cliffs and flowers are spectacular. I then followed the mesmerizing coast to potato point and went back to the harbor look outs, which took all day. Note: the campground is not great and a day should do it for any particular activity. They raved about the birds and fox that only the island has. I saw neither.",kathydurrum
50,Rugged Wild Beauty,"I left from Ventura Harbor, and even the boat ride was great. We saw dolphins and sea lions, and the clouds cleared up when we got to the island. Once on the island, my family and I hiked around the north eastern part of the island. It truly is unique on the island, as it is wetter then the mainland. There are yellow and blue wildflowers dotting the hills, craggy mountains, and best of all, huge sea cliffs by the deep blue pacific. What really surprised me was how clear the water was by the shore. I could see all the rocks and kelp.",slidingsands87
40,Perfect day!,"Took a day trip to Santa Cruz island from Ventura. It was cold and foggy when we left Ventura but was sunny when we reached the island. We took a hiking tour with the naturalists which gave us the history of the island. We then continued our hike to Potato Cove, about 5 miles round trip. We had a great time. Many wildflowers in bloom. On the return trip, the captain took some extra time so we could see some humpbacks in the area. A wonderful bonus. Island Packers were very efficient and personable. We definitely recommend the trip.",Sebilia
40,Great day excursion or camping,"A great way to spend a day! Santa Cruz Island provides a great hiking trail with lots of wild life both off shore and on the island. I was lucky to see a curious Santa Cruz Island fox! The visitors center is close to the harbor where the boat drops you off. Bring your own pic-nic, layer your clothes for comfort and comfortable shoes. You will need to transport out what you bring in, including your own garbage, so pack accordingly...",tracy805
40,Excellent Day Trip,"Santa Cruz is one of the five Islands that together, are the Channel Islands National Park (Four of the five islands are listed here on TripAdvisor).The Island Packers are the sole concessionaires for island transportation. Their dock is not too far from the park's visitor center on the mainland, and it takes about an hour to reach Santa Cruz Island. A pod of common dolphins escorted us on our way out, but sadly no whales. We were surprised, though, to see oil rigs so close to protected waters.In December there were two choices to disembark from the boat, Prisoners Harbor and Scorpions Anchorage. We docked at Scorpions Anchorage, where there are national park exhibits and the last island resident's (private) house. We took a naturalist lead hike up to Cavern Point. It's a steep, one mile trail, but the information we received was interesting. We learned that researchers determined a patch of unassuming dirt was once at the bottom of the ocean.From there we hiked to Potato Harbor on the treeless cliffs, seeing two foxes on the way. We finished the five mile loop back to Scorpions Anchorage by going down through the valley. Amazingly, all this took up most of the time we had on the island and soon enough, we were boarding the catamaran back to the mainland. We saw an additional three foxes as we waited for the boat.Note to remember: you have to pack in your own food and pack out your trash. Water is available near the campground.",NPS_Tumbleweeds
50,The most incredible experience,"Visiting Channel Islands National Park at Santa Cruz island is like escaping into a different world. I find it amazing that only an hour or two from the coast is this completely untouched beautiful island that has such amazing hiking, wild life viewing and fishing. On my last visit an island fox actually came up to us at Smugglers cove and played what appeared to be a game of hide and seek ducking behind a small out building at the old ranch. I recommend everyone visit the island if they can, and leave your cell phones at home!",Sean Q

50,A Great Experience,"Booked a half day trip through Island Packers. The logistics under that company's control went smoothly and professionally. Unfortunalely thr choppy sea was not under their control. Got a little ""green"" going over, but it was well worth it. Recommend taking the included guided tour with a volunteer. We learned a lot about the island's history, ecology and geology. The moderate walk took about two and a half hours. Very little greenery when we went. Apparently there is more vegetation for a short period in the spring. If you are interested in water activities, this is the place in the summer. Remember you have to carry in evrything you will want to use during your stay and carry out all trash. Highly recommend.",GARunner_11

Excellent boat and service. Cost $75/each R/t. Ride over was brilliant. Many dolfins, beautiful view of ocean. Landed at Scipion Harbor, then on to Prisioner Harbor. Nice area with Dock, Swimming Area, and Trees. We Packed on 4 miles to Del Norte, essentially a perch on the side of a mountain. 4 sites with citter boxes. Many redish Foxes, expansive view of coast. Wow! Very much a place of solitude. We brought 3 gallons of water. Just fine. Awesome place to just reflect and enjoy the desolute location. in the 70's f most of the time. Great view of stars. Hike is ""strenous"", up and down alot. should be in fair shape for this jaunt. We took a nice ocean swim when we arrived back at the Harbor. Perfect. Recommend!

50,Fun getaway from the common crowds of summer!,"Took the Island packers ferry from Ventura Harbor to Scorpion Cove on Santa Cruz Island. About an 1 hour trip each way. Plan on packing light as you will have to hoof it all to the campground which is a half mile from the dock/pier. Took a two man tent, hiking gear, camp stove, provisions and my surfboard. Awesome time, clean, pristine, fresh air, bright stars and blue moon too! Hiked to Smugglers Cove on the SE side of the island to go surfing. Quite a hike with all the gear (wetsuit, surfboard, backpack, food but was worth it. About 4 mi each way 800'+ elevation each way steeper shorter incline coming back longer and more drawn out incline on the way to Smugglers. Saw noone else on the hike to Smugglers. Saw only 6 people on the way back. Quite a few boats docked outside Smugglers Cove for Labor Day recreation. Campground has potable water, pit toilets, no fires allowed and a food storage locker. Safe and peaceful. Plan on packing light ie. backpacking type camping. Brought several items that I should have paired down on like my camera tripod, boci ball set (fun but weighs like 10 lbs). Bring binoculars, small compact camera, sunscreen, water booties, clothes line, dry bag if your paddling around the coves to the better surf breaks. Enjoy!!!",714Tombo
50,Do it!,"Just back from two night camping on Santa Cruz Island... our first visit to the Channel Islands.We got in some serious exercise... an eight mile hike that was rarely on flat ground and a couple hours sea kayaking... hello upper body!There are two campsites at the Scorpion Beach location... a lower and upper one. The lower was a very short walk for the ferry and great for family with kids and having to haul a bunch of stuff.We stayed in the best site there, number 25... right on the edge looking out into the valley and the hills. The campsite does have potable water and a ""nice"" outhouse. Other than that, bring everything else you need!Our day hike of eight miles was out to Scorpion Beach. This is not a sandy beach, but it was great to watch the surf come in. Our kayak trip was with Santa Barbata Adventure Company andd they get a big thumbs up. Kayaking along side the sea lions was a real treat.We lucked out on the return ferry ride and spent a few extra minutes following an enormous pod of dolphins... easily numbering in the hundreds with lots of babies (the size of footballs) flying out of the water with their moms (or dads?).It was a very,very dry time of year ther and it would be glorious to see the island when it is really green... Either way, it is a real national treasure and I am glad it is well protected as a national park.",BVinLongBeach
50,love the feeling of being out of this world,the trip over is wonderful; you might spot whales and definitely will spot schools of dolphins who love to swim alongside your boat and look at you. the view from the island is breathtaking and it is wonderful to hike there and take a picnic lunch and spend most of a day there. you feel like you have traveled a thousand miles.,janrichgmr

30,Average Island,"I thought the idea of going to a deserted island an hour off of the mainland filled with hikes and wildlife that are only native to this island would be absolutely amazing. Unfortunately, I think the best experience was the charter boat on the way there and back. I went on two separate hikes with my wife (about 6 miles in total) in the Scorpian's Harbor area of the island and the only wildlife we saw were a couple brown birds and a lizard, not very exotic. In the midst of the hike, looking around, we could have been anywhere since the ocean was not visible at all times. Even when it was, we didn't see any marine life. Someone who kayaked around the island through small caves and waterways told me it was a very unique experience, so if you are going I suggest checking that out (You have to rent a kayak in advance so look into that prior). There were 2 camp sites AND PUBLIC BATHROOMS on the island. They are not the most beautiful...or sanitary things, but then how could they be...you are on a remote island. Having driven down the PCH from San Francisco, and since this excursion took the entire day, there were certainly other nature-related places we would have rather done.",TravelAvity
50,Spectacular Island: A must see,"This island is almost as it was a thousand years ago. The tide pools are amazing the sea caves exciting, the terrain varied. If you want to take yourself back in time this is the place to do it. You can hike and camp and kayak. You can see Island fox and island blue jay as well as flora and fauna unique only to the islands. Painted Cave is the longest sea cave in the world (over 1200 feet) and very very beautiful. Some of the island cruises will enter the cave if the sea is calm. The trip out is great for spotting whales and dolphins.",Inez A S
50,A Great Day Trip,"A day trip to one of the least visited Nation Park, starts at Island Packers in Ventura. It's great boat ride about an hour. If you have motion sickness problem, make sure you take medication. Though return trip is a bit easier. That said, if you want to enjoy boat ride to fullest be on the outside on lower deck, where you will sight the marine life and spray from ocean (wear waterproof jacket at least). On arrival you get orientation from a Ranger. Do take short hike with ranger and learn more about Island in detail. But do take a hike to Potato Harbor on your own. That is one of most beautiful hikes and you are rewarded with a breathtaking view at the end. Best part is you are all by yourself, very peaceful experience. Do take enough food & drink for your hikes. Goal is to take your time and you won't br disappointed. And you might get luvky and see elusive Island fox.",abhay b
50,Galapagos of the North,"You can camp on Santa Cruz Island and experience a very unique place, one that has many species of plants and animals not found elsewhere (cute little foxes the size of cats, bluejays double size). The technical term is ""endemic"". As a horticulturist, it was fascinating. You need to carry your camping gear about 1/4 mile if you stay in the lower campground. We went for a 3 hour guided kayaking trip through some of the 200 sea caves, and spent the rest of the time hiking, tide-pooling and loving the relative isolation. Camp sites are only $15/night, but you must have verified tickets on and off the island (Island Packers has daily boats). We went in February and stayed 3 nights. While it did rain some, it was gorgeous and the campsites were mostly empty. Highly recommended for outdoor lovers.",DevaLuna

50,Wow! Great getaway,"We flew from out of state into LAX. We took the Ventura County Airporter shuttle from LAX to the Holiday Inn Express that is located just around the pier from Island Packers (the boat shuttle to the island). We spent the night in Ventura so we would have time to get provisions for the trip. The next morning, bright and early we set off for the Island Packers pier.Island Packers staff were friendly. The boat ride out to the island was more than a generic ferry - we saw dolphins and sea lions - the captain drove out of the way so that we could get better views. That was great!The island itself was AMAZING. We were the only people with reservations in the upper loop - which made for an a wonderful, private camping experience. Apparently we booked our sites before that loop was closed for the winter. Regardless - I highly recommend spot #24 in the upper loop. Its position amongst the other sites is ideal if you like having your own space in a campground.We hiked to Potato Bay one day and Smuggler's Cove the next. Lots of foxes, a scrub jay, lizard and many birds of prey - along with the scenery - were our rewards.The rangers were great - from the funny ""welcome to the island"" speech - to the general checkins that all was well.",goldfishcastle

The water was cold, but the sun was warm. We went out on the sea for a few hours and then came back and had lunch. We then went for a hike and saw the cliffs and the rolling hills. It was some of the most breathtaking views of nature I've ever seen. (And I just got back from the Cotswolds in England!) I would highly recommend going on the kayaking adventure. However, just going for a hike on the island would be worth it as well. Oh, we also saw a ton of whales on the way over to the island and back. Amazing stuff.",Nina T

We were told by other birders and National Park staff that if we wanted to see jays we should land at Prisoner's. But we hiked up the Scorpion loop and into Scorpion canyon a short distance, and there they were. I guess if you don't like to hike, or aren't fit enough to hike over some rocks, then don't go here to see the jays.Other than that, if you are going to Santa Cruz, you should be prepared and know what to expect. It is hot and dry, and there are hiking trails. There are lovely cliff views, we saw dolphins and grey whales on the boat ride there. Between spending time at the park visitor center, the quest for scrub jays, having a picnic lunch, and more hiking and birding along the cliffs, we accomplished everything we wanted to do in the 4-5 hours we had on the island. The camping areas didn't seem very nice, but do camp if you want to hike farther into the island.There are pit toilets at the landing and campground, and water at the campground. There are also bear boxes if you want to lock your food up against the ravens while you are there.",kwpapers
30,Nice remote park for camping,"My wife and I went to Santa Cruz for two nights at the end of September. The boat ride from Ventura was great, and the captain slowed down for everyone to get good looks at the dolphins playing around us. Once on the island, we stayed in the Scorpion campground.The campground was very clean, and the sites each had a good sturdy table and a box for food/trash storage. Potable water and pit toilets are available, but you have to bring absolutely everything else with you. Make sure to use the boxes, as the birds and island foxes (which are incredibly cute) will steal what you don't lock up. If staying at Scorpion, I'd recommend campsites 1-10, excepting #2. We stayed in #2 and it was very exposed to the wind.On the island itself there's only a few things to do. The short loop trail to Cavern Point and back by way of the anchorage is particularly nice for taking pictures just after dawn or around sunset. We also hiked the Scorpion Canyon loop, which was a good hike but features a very steep climb out of the canyon (if traveling counterclockwise). There are few trees on the island, so the trail is very exposed to whatever the weather may be. On the bright side, you can see for miles throughout most of the hike. If you're up for, there are also kayaking options around the coastline. The simplest way to do this involves arranging a guided tour of the sea caves with one of the outfitters in Ventura.Overall, our visit was pleasant, but not remarkable. It was a nice weekend camping trip, but is unlikely to merit multiple visits.",Michael K
40,Rustic natural beauty and species not seen anywhere else,"Just 19 miles off the coast, Santa Cruz Island is a world away. It gives you the chance to hike, kayak or camp far from civilization. You have to take everything you need with you, including water, and pack everything out. The campgrounds are up a steep hill, so this is not for the debilitated.The island features species not found on the mainland, like the Island Scrub Jay and the Giant Coreopsis flower. You'll also probably see sea lions, dolphins, cormorants, and maybe whales on the way to the island.",Bobette23
50,"Beautiful Island! Very Foggy in morning, but cleared up by afternoon",We visited Santa Cruz Island in early June of 2011. It was extremely foggy first thing when we arrived which was close to 10am. I was very worried that when we hiked to the top of the overlook we wouldn't be able to see anything.Even though it was foggy the hiking was still gorgeous. When we hiked to the top it was still quite foggy but as we ate our picnic lunch it started to lift and we could see more.I just thought this island was breathtaking. I loved the unique trees on the island and we could hear many seals barking in the distance on the rock below. It is not crowded so it is the perfect place to visit and hike if you want to get away from crowds.,Jayciel
30,"Nice to go, nice to come back","We were dropped off for a day trip on the island. I was very glad we brought our picnic lunch as there were no services of any sort.There was an amazing amount of small biting flies. Be sure you bring long sleeves.I have wanted to check out the Channel Islands for years so I'm glad we went. There isn't much to do if you go in the fall, unless you want to hike around. The tour is pretty fast and you need to be in good shape to keep up.My father in law wasn't up to hiking and we didn't want to abandon him.",karenlrite
50,Feels like you're far away!,"Spent 3 days/2nights camping with a group of friends in late September. Even though it's only about an hour from Ventura, it feels like you're a world away. The campsites are primitive, with just water spigots (yes, drinkable) and pit toilets. There are lockers for storing food, just like bear lockers, but these are to prevent Island Foxes and ravens from eating your food. At first it looks a bit barren, but we went on some very nice hikes and some of the views are amazing. Our group brought kayaks, but it was really too windy to go out as much as we wanted. We also went snorkeling in the little bay near the dock. It's not Hawaii, but it was fun and interesting.We travelled there with Island Packers from Ventura Harbor. The folks there were friendly and helpful. Check their website for details, especially the part about gear restrictions! They will not transport anything over 45 lbs, and they have a scale on the dock in Ventura to verify. Don't be like the people ahead of us who had to toss all of the ice from their cooler in order to bring it on board! There is also a limit on the number of items you can bring. This is actually a good thing, since it encourages people to pack light--and you will have to carry it all from the Santa Cruz dock to the campground, about 1/2 to 3/4 mile. They will let you bring a folding luggage cart, but the 3"" wheels on mine kept getting bogged down in dirt & leaves--bigger wheels are better. Best to check with Island Packers to see what type of carts are allowed, if you need one. There is a ranger on the island for emergencies, but no camp store or any place to buy things you forgot. It was a really nice weekend get-away, if you like that type of thing. I believe you need to make the camping reservation first, then reserve the boat trip.",susee
50,"Excellent sea kayaking, sea caves, and proximity to wildlife","My wife and I needed a day-trip getaway from Los Angeles and booked with a Santa Barbara company for three hours of sea kayaking and a round-trip ferry to Santa Cruz in the Channel Islands. While we had done sea-kayaking before, this excursion was a real treat. Despite being relative novices, our guides took us into and through a number of small sea caves, many of which were exhilarating to paddle through (even if occasionally terrifying). We were also pleasantly surprised by the abundant wildlife on the relatively stark and rocky island. On the water, several sea lions swam up near us, and sea birds routinely swept by us when we were on the water. On land, there were tiny, painfully cute foxes (unique to the Channel Islands) that casually wandered about and were easy to photograph. Although we did not hike, snorkel, or camp there, we did meet many folks who were repeat visitors, and raved about those experiences. We'll be coming back here some day.",Leneal
50,So scenic--great for a hike,Wow. The views here are amazing. Great hiking trails. Recommend if you're in the area.,Devon11
20,Boring.,"The hour boat ride was awesome. We saw some dolphins and sea lions. But , when we got to the island, there's nothing out here. Just dried and browned, mountain range. We didn't even see a wildlife as they described in the brochure. There is a public restroom. Other than that, bring your own food, water, and supplies. If you like to kayak, then perhaps, this is one of the places to go. Otherwise, not worth it.",PantheraOnca
50,Great White Sharks,"I took my family for one full week camping here around July 2001. We brought four kayaks with us on Island Packers with our camping gear, and numerous gallon jugs of water and food. We had a fantastic time! We kayaked the sea caves, circled around to the small harbor on the other side of the island (It took a few hours round trip). We hiked the trails as well.It is remote, NOTHING here. There are wheelbarrows available to cary your gear into the campsites. Island Packers is very helpful using a rubber dingy to get everything ashore.We had a few adventures with a wild horse that made it clear that we were visitors, and it was going to eat what it wanted to eat ,and go where it wanted to go. I think the horses are gone now. We had the place to ourselves most of our seven days.Be VERY Aware:1. You need a good first aid kit (not a small hikers version) . We had a few mishaps and needed it. We never saw the Ranger, that I can recall, the whole time we were there.2. If you go in the water, wear quality water shoes that cover your feet.3. Great White Sharks. We came across two great white sharks over 20 feet long attacking seals about 30 minutes west of the campsite. They were about 10 -20 foot offshore in deep water. About 50 -100 harbor seals were screaming like murder (deaths were taking place), and in panic one or two jumping in the water off the rocks. I assume the sharks ate well, the next day we saw a half eaten one washed ashore.I have never been back due to fear and fright. I am a avid outdoorsman and do not frighten easily.We were about 40 feet away coming around a bend when we saw them slicing through the water. the fins were about two foot long.I know that it is rare to see great whites, but keep it in mind. After about ten years I am just now considering going kayaking out there again.",lostmywalletagain
50,Beautiful -- worth a day trip at least,"This island has stunning views. We were supposed to take a guided kayak tour of the sea caves, which got canceled the day prior due to high winds. Because of this we had 5 hours in which to hike the island, which was a good amount for hiking and seeing the basic sites. Trying to do the kayak also would probably have been too much, but we would have made the best of it either way.The boat company does a nice job of providing naturalists. They provided us with some information in the animal life on the boat rides to and from the island. On the island, we were offered a very no-pressure guided walk for about an hour. We opted in and were glad we did. Our guide was named Kathy, and she was great.We had the, ahem, good fortune of taking this trip on the same day as not one but two school groups. As remote as these islands are, we sure saw plenty of people. I longed for more remoteness, but it seems to just depend on the day and the hike you choose.There were not as many unique species of plants and animals to the island as I was expecting, but that did not take away from the overall beautiful setting. Definitely take your motion sickness meds for the boat ride. All in all, a great day! We would go back to explore more islands if we get the chance.",CojackChicago
50,Spring on the Island,Best time to come with all the green and animals! Very windy at times. Avoid the sites next to the creek! But overall beautiful. Smuggler's Cove is a must.,kiquiz
50,Marvel,I visited with my wife and two kids on the 24th . Fantastic location! The company island packers do a great job of ferrying folks to all these islands. We went to Santa Cruz that is about an hour away from Ventura harbor. The pictures we took were straight out of national geographic! Will go again to visit the other islands as well! Not to be missed if you are in southern California.,payani_global
50,Well worth the trip to Santa Cruz Island!,"Though we are land-lubbers and were hesitant about the choppy hour long boat ride, we are delighted we took this trip. You travel to the island with Island Packers Tours http://www.islandpackers.com/santacruz.html , and get to spend time on the island, either on a tour or on your own. We were there in springtime, mid-April, and it was alive, green, lush, with lots of wildflowers. The scenery is spectacular. On our boat ride back, we didn't happen to see whales, but we did have quite a large pad of dolphins joins us for a romp. The boat operator gave us lots of time to enjoy the extra treat. A wonderful day from beginning to end.",leskh
50,AMAZING GETAWAY !,"My husband and I booked a Day Trip with Island Packers about 4-5 days prior to the crossing. (Our kid was away at camp, and we grabbed a weekday getaway!)We drove up from LA on a Monday afternoon stayed overnight in Ventura, and got on the 9am boat. Lovely foggy cool morning gave way to bright sunshine (breeze but not wind) on the island. We chose not to go with a kayak outfitter (we wanted maximum independence for our 1st visit to this island--) instead, we decided to hike and snorkel. I am someone who wants to GET IN the water, almost no matter how cold it is...! We did bring wetsuits, and were glad about it. There are simple changing booths and pretty deep lockers (no locks, but --there's something about the destination that inspires trust and fellowship. Conservation-minded, eco-adventurers, mostly) We heard one of the naturalists advise swim first; hike second. Most people were going kayaking anyway...Although it was rather ordinary in terms of marine life-viewing(sea urchins and orange sea slugs, starfish, a few fish--), we completely enjoyed the clearness of the water and looking thru the curtains of kelp forest.We changed clothes, and were gifted with a visit from the Island Fox, exploring the hillside near the picnic area. Photo op! We set out for the nearer hike (to Cavern Point) OOOooh, what a view! Not only out to the forever horizon, but immediately below, we saw the teeny kayaks making their way aroundthe coastal rock formations. Had a lunch, careful to pack away every bit of trash with us.Made our way back in plenty of time for our 3 pm assigned ferry return. The captain announced ""You're in luck! We're taking a tour around Anacapa Island before we head back to the mainland--"" Why? Who knows? But it was an excellent bonus--and we learned a lot too.Next time, we'll bring along our 10 yr. old, and we'll probably kayak among the sea caves!",mandasand
50,GREAT DAY,"We took our four boys ages 10-19 to Santa Cruz for the day. Great hike. Beautiful, one of a kind views. The staff and volunteers on the Island Packers were outstanding. They had a lot of good information and really took care of us; even when I got alittle sea sick on the hour boat ride over. They detoured so that we could see a large group of dolphin. The trip was full but once we were on the island there were plenty of places where we felt we were the only people there. We left our lunches at the provided lockers not far from dock. After about a 12 mile hike we enjoyed our lunch at one of the several shaded picnic tables. Truely a lovely day.",modelfun
50,best time ever on Santa Cruz Island,"My husband and I went camping with a couple other people from my hiking group last year. I had the best time ever! For those who get sea sick like me, take bonamine or a pill of choice way ahead of time. I took it too late. The trip was worth the pain tho. Saw dolpins on our way there. And way more - at least 100 when we went to Santa Rosa late last month. The Santa Rosa trip first stops at Santa Cruz.The coastal views and peace and quiet during the hike were priceless! Research the smugglers cove hike on Santa Cruz and Cherry Canyon on Santa Rosa. We are hooked on the Channel Islands and are going to Anacapa next. Book with Island Packers. They are a good bunch. They have a professional and caring crew. I know first hand coz I got sea sick both trips! The trick I've learned from passengers and the crew is good old ginger ale and to try to stare at the horizon. These helped me some. I heard that you can fly to Santa Rosa. Something worth looking into. Happy hikes!",dacrux
50,A place to forget everything!!!!!,This is an amazing day trip away from LA. A great place to just hike and forget everything. I used Island Packers and it was a great ride. Bring a hat and lots of sunscreen.,C-Lovr
50,Awesome Coastal Hiking,Took a trip to East Santa Cruz with Island Packers. The crew was fun and light hearted. Saw more than 100 dolphins on the way there. Unbelievable! The trails are moderately difficult with great coastal cliff views. Next time I will take my snorkling gear as I could see a great kelp forest right there at the boat landing that was shallow (10ft). I could see dozens of purple urchins underwater from the pier.,SFtransplant
40,Don't miss out the kayaking trip,"We spent two days at Santa Cruz. The trip started well. We found a group of dolphins, and these guys really know how to put up a show. The boat captain spent some time circling around them so that everybody could have a good look.The first day we went kayaking with Paddle Sports of Santa Barbara. It was very interesting. You must remember these islands are about sea life. This was the beginners' trip, so we did not go far from the harbor. The guides were helpful and they provided all necessary equipment, including wet suits -very important. We went to see five or six caves.On land, we found wind which drove us crazy. Nonstop. It was annoying, and it drove sand into our tent. It seems such wind is not uncommon, but really we were not lucky.There was a very pretty sunset from Cove Point, very close to the campground. But nobody else was watching it.We hiked out to Potato Harbor -which is fairly close- and Smuggler's cove- further out. The island was pretty, in a desolate kind of way. The grass was yellow, and there are almost no trees. We were lucky to see one of the rare native foxes.On the way back, we saw more dolphins.It was a very enjoyable trip, except for the wind. But definitely, don't miss out the kayak if you go.",Rodolfo J
50,Wow! Can't wait to go back and do some more kayaking!,"We (four adults 35-50 years old) just got back from a fantastic overnight stay on Santa Cruz Island / Channel Islands. Before we left, I had some trouble finding information so I wanted to get on here and give some info out for the next folks.First we arranged our camping spot thru parks and recreation. We chose spot 25 on the upper loop. All spots are within 30-75 feet of one another, so seclusion is not an option. Second, we arranged our boat tickets and kayak transportation thru Island Packers to Scorpion Anchorage. Third, we rented our kayaks thru Channel Island Kayak Center. All this came to about $150 pp. You pay the day of departure.We arrived at the Ventura Harbor on Saturday morning right at 7am, where we checked in with the boat company, then the kayak company next door, had a brief orientation. We finished our coffee on the grass next to our packs and waited for them to instruct us to load or packs up to the boat, separating our fuel (for gas stove) and water from everything. We boarded the boat at 7:45 and by 8am we were on our way out of the harbor. We were on the boat with the Tokyo Hiking Group in their 50-60s, about 40 adults. One lady in particular stood out in the Group in her leopard patterned leisure suit, her sparkly black vest, her designer matching hat, her designer gold sunglasses, and full makeup complete with bright red lipstick. We deemed her 'Leopard Lady'.Our one hour boat trip to the island was awesome. We inside at a table, enjoyed our breakfast burritos that we brought with us, and watched the seal and the dolphin display! The sell soft drinks, beer, wine donuts and potato chips on the boat.When we docked at Scorpion Anchorage, most of the passengers formed a line, where we passed all items person to person from the boat down the line, up the dock and onto the path. Some passengers just stood by, waiting for their bags to arrive...possibly a language barrier...or just lazy...not sure?After a brief orientation from the forest ranger we hiked into our spot which was about 1 mile (because we chose the spot the furthest away). The lower loop is only about a 1/2 mile walk. Keep in mind that whatever you bring, you will be hiking in...So pack smart, and if you can, put EVERYTHING into a pack to go on your back. We passed suitcases, coolers, lawn chairs, small bags etc., which I image was not easy to bring up the trail in the morning sun.We assembled our tents, enjoyed the subway sandwiches that we brought (each campsite has a picnic table, benches and lockbox for food and trash to keep away from the animals), and headed to the beach to do some kayaking. It was a gorgeous day, calm water. The couple that we went with had done the tour on their last visit, so they were familiar with the caves and the coastline. The seals were curious and playful. The starfish on the rocks were beautiful and it was refreshing to see all of the healthy kelp. The water was so clear your could easily see the California Garibaldi’s feeding on the kelp (next time we are bringing our snorkels FOR SURE!). The caves were great (even spooky at times), and I was happy that I wore gloves, and croakies on my sunglasses.It felt like we were a world away from LA.After several hours on the water, we headed back to Scorpion Anchorage to beach our kayaks and go back up to our camp spot (you have to bring your paddles, seats, life jackets and helmets back to camp with you). We relaxed at our table with a cup of boxed wine (no glass or cardboard on the island), enjoyed some cheese and bread, THAT’s when the entertainment began. The Tokyo Hiking Group from the boat had the ‘group’ campsites next to us. 'Leopard Lady' began to yell…which lasted for aprox 2 minutes, (in another language), THEN she began punching and kicking a man...he began to punch and kick back, until the ranger (a woman about 5'3 and 120lbs) stepped in. The others in the group did not seem too concerned, but eventually a couple men from the group stepped in too (that poor ranger...geez). Leopard Lady (LL.) began to wale...then retreated to her 'den' (a green and white tent). We later learned from the ranger that the fight was due to the fact that LL wanted to hike and her husband wanted to drink beer. As the night wore on, the group got increasingly louder, playing music, chanting, playing instruments, loud yelling and screaming over card/domino games. We were tuckered from the long, exhausting day, so after heating up some chili (on our camp-stove) for dinner we retired to bed around 9pm (no campfires on the island). But the group was so loud that some of us were unable to sleep…In fact one guy had put his ipod in his ears and could not hear his music over the group next door. He eventually went over there and asked them to quiet down.It did not get too cold at night, as I was in a pair of yoga pants and long sleeve shirt and stayed perfectly comfortable on top of my sleeping bag.On Sunday, we made some instant coffee, juice and bagels, packed up our gear and took it down to the dock. We headed in the other direction for an hour long kayak thru the caves. The rule of thumb is not to travel downwind (with the wind) as you will have to return in the headwind (when you are tired)….better to have the wind at your back on the RETURN.As scheduled, the boat arrived at 11am, we set up another baggage brigade to get all of the supplies and baggage on board…we were relieved that the Tokyo Hiking Club was not on this boat ride.The hour ride back was quiet. We ran upon a school of dolphins, and saw some more seals.Next time I go, I’ll camp in the lower loop and I will leave on a Friday and come back on a Sunday…one night was not enough time to do all of the kayaking that I wish we would have.There is potable running water, and ‘hole-in-the-ground’ bathrooms, that were clean, with hand sanitizer.Can’t wait to go back!",DJ N
50,Kayaking Channel Islands,"I just went Kayaking at Santa Cruz Island with Aquasports and it was the most amazing experience. If you haven't been there, you have to go check it out. Aquasports guides were the best guides I've ever hired. They really go out of their way to give you the most positive experience. You first catch a boat out to Santa Cruz Island, Scorpion Cove and then you can go with them Kayaking in Sea Caves. Unbelievably beautiful. We saw lots of sea lions and birds and fish. I even saw a Sting Ray below in the ocean. Kayaking in and out of the caves will blow your mind. Then we camped out there at the National Park and went hiking on the Island the next day. A ten plus weekend. But make sure you go with Aquasports, which is a great company with great guides. Their guides are so professional and helpful to everyone. I was very impressed.Do not go with any other company such as Paddlesports. I had three really bad experiences with them on the Island. Their guides are extremely rude.",Juliesogroovy
40,Finally saw Santa Cruz Island!,"Years ago, I read an article in National Geographic about the wonder of the Channel Islands National Park. The park is a nature preserve that is compared to the Galapagos Islands. It is sometimes called ""The Galapagos of North America."" It's been my dream to go. Which island to choose? It takes a day to see just one. After learning about the distinct personalities of Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel and Santa Barbara, I chose Santa Cruz, the largest of the chain. I write this travelogue to fellow travelers who share the same yearning that I have had. Remembering the scant information I could find on the net--I offer what I experienced and saw.My family and I ferried from Ventura Harbor to the island via Island Packers, the only travel option. The company crew serving on the high speed catamaran practically doted on the passengers. (The double-decker catamaran seated approx. 60-80 people.)On arrival, the catamaran docks at Scorpion Anchorage pier, the passengers climb a ""pool-ladder"" and cross the dock, stop for a brief island advisement by a park service volunteer, walk over a rock-covered shore and head toward the island's interior. (A guided hike is available after everyone visits the outhouses.)Okay, here's something I want to breeze through. We wanted to kayak in the sea caves. Signed up ahead of time with Paddle Sports of Santa Barbara. Met our kayak guide on the island. Just looked for his red hat and the red kayaks. But with 40 knot winds blowing-- doggedly-difficult paddling was certain and roguish-type waves filling the caves was a possibility. What was I thinking? Kayaking on the sea? I'm not sure that I'd sign up for this part of the adventure again. So, we hiked to ""Potato Harbor"" instead. (For the record, Paddle Sports happily returned our money.)Now, for the sights, sounds and impressions of eastern Santa Cruz. The obvious hits at first. The island feels remote and ""pristine"", and although you're with others, you're ""alone"" (all of you) ...comparatively. I mean compared to the crowdedness we live with everyday. This is the aspect that I loved about Santa Cruz. My family and I walked toward the campground, found a picnic table and ate our lunch. The weather was weird that day and all the locals said so. We arrived to perfect weather but after donning our wetsuits a 40 knot wind kicked up, (at lunch my daughter's eyes were watering from the wind). We hiked and it was cool, then it was warm, then windy, then still. Yet we were enthralled with Potato Harbor. It was beautiful! From the cliff, you're looking a long way down to the ocean. The island is not firm on the edges. You don't stand too close to the edge of the cliff. To fall would mean certain death. We sat for awhile to take it all in. The peacefulness was overwhelming. Lots of brown pelicans were gliding over the surface of the water. (Not long ago, they were endangered.) Suddenly a blanket of fog began rolling in. It was so thick, I wondered if we could find our way back. But then of course, it wasn't too thick!Another point worth telling is this. The island is dry and barren just as my husband told me it would be. Austere is a good word to describe the setting. Austere as in having no adornment or ornamentation. There was little vegetation to add beauty to the land and yet the austerity contrasted with the shining brilliance of the ocean. (At one time, it was not this way; evidently, the expansive vegetation once indigenous to the island has been overrun by non-native grasses and weeds.) For a lusher visit, go in the spring to see the wildflowers.Also disappointing was the veritable lack of land animal species. Here is a complete list of our observation: 2 lizards, 1 squirrel, 2 rabbits, 1 seal, seagulls, brown pelicans, 2 or 3 'thatch' birds, and many handsomely scaled cock-roach type insects hiding in the rock crevices by the shore. In my mind's eye, Galapagos, if not teaming, would at least carry a more diverse crowd of critters. Don't go expecting to see the famous island fox!On the ride home, we were honored with a school of dolphins within the waters of Channel Islands National Park. A great part of the park's acreage is aquatic.A group of artists who had ferried with us in the morning docked at Prisoner's Harbor and hiked to the central valley to camp and paint. I wonder what they saw.",radicalgirl
50,Kayak the Caves on Santa Cruz Island,"The caves on Santa Cruz Island are a world class outdoor adventure. I went a few years ago during an El Nino season when the water was 71 degrees so I spent a lot of time kayaking and snorkling through the caves. One, the Emerald Cavern I think it was called, had sunlight streaming in from below the waterline which gave the cavern an emerald grotto effect worthy of a scene from the Odyssey. The caves are an easy paddle (less than one-half mile from the beach), so the exertion level is fairly minimal. None of the first time kayakers in my group had any problem (when I visited there were no swells or waves). You do need to be comfortable backpacking and sleeping in your own tent, etc. (though the camp is about 1/2 mile from the dock).It is an easy weekend trip from Southern California, using Island Packers out of Oxnard. Kayaks can be rented from the local sporting goods store.",Excursion8545
