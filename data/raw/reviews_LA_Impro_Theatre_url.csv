50,Long form improv at its best!,"A talented troupe of professional actors constantly sharping their skills with unscripted witty 3-act plays. Storytelling at its improvised best. You'll laugh out loud and cry at the stories that seem to come from nowhere. With just a word or two from the audience, these gifted artists unravel heartfelt stories right in front of your eyes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerrygoff78735
50,Incredible improvisational theatre,"Professional (and hilarious!) theatre made up on the spot right in front of your eyes!At this point, I've seen several shows here. They make up incredible plays on the spot based on suggestion. They are so funny, and the stories they make up are brilliant, deep, and even thought provoking!I've see ""Twilight Zone UnScripted"" (they make up two episodes of Twilight Zone), ""Chekhov UnScripted"" (made up play in the style of Chekhov), ""Horror UnScripted"" (80s horror movies!). I've seen ""Star Trek: The Improvised Generation"" complete with full TNG costumes and sound FX (I'm a TNG nerd).I've also seen LATS, which is more like ""Who's Line"", but in a competitive sport sort of way. So fun! Felt like I was at a Basketball game!I know this group also performs at other LA theatres...they've done Jane Austen UnScripted in Pasadena and in Santa Monica (The Broad). And Westerns, Shakespeare plays, and Sondheim musicals!I HIGHLY recommend checking out their site and trying to catch a show while you're in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msmadisong
50,Always great for Friday Night outings!,"LATheatresports is competitive improv! Seriously. Two teams go head to head for a ""champion"" title and it's hilarous. Going to an LATheatresports show is a surefire way to enjoy a Friday night in Los Angeles! Shows are at 10pm every Friday, which gives you and your traveling partner plenty of time to get a drink or a bite to eat at the awesome spots located right next door. Also, Churro Borough is right across the street. That is a must stop spot.Sure, there's a lot of improv in Los Angeles, but this show features some of the best talent I have seen to date... and I've been to a few shows now and I can easily say the show is consistently funny, fresh, and exciting!I HIGHLY recommend LATheatresports to anyone in need of perfect Friday night plans in LA... ranging from date night to girls night to friends night to ""I don't know what to do with my mom who is in town"" night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATheatresports
