40,A Park with History,"I have been to this park multiple times for various trips with my family and students. There are lots of perks to this location!To start, it is walking distance from a shopping center for treats and picnic food. You can bring your dog to the ""off leash"" park right next to the Redondo Beach historical house. If you have the time to tour this house (no reservations required) the docent there is full of fun personal stories that bring the museum items alive.My students loved the two playground parks. One portion is for younger students the other playground is for older kids. My students had some reviews for the park:""My favorite part about the park was the open space, you can play capture the flag.""""I didn't like the sand because it gets in your shoes.""""I liked that there was a lot of selection because there were two playgrounds!""",Griffortravel
