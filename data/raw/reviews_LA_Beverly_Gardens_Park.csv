30,Good if you have extra time,"Arrived on a Monday holiday after 12:30pm. Free parking at the meters for the holiday. Free park to walk around and check out the Beverly Hills sign. Different sculptures in the park. If I did not have free parking, I probably would not have spent time to see the park, would rather see the shops and homes which make Beverly Hills unique for tourists.",GiantsFanLosAngeles

50,The Sign,"Beverly Hills Gardens Park is really only famous to the tourists to see the sign, there are other small street signs as you wander around Beverly hills, the gardens are impressive as you would expect.",TeamWard
50,Worth the visit,We live 40 mins outside of LA and had family visiting from out of country. Americans don’t realize how exciting it is for people in other countries to see all the landmarks that you see in the movies and this one did not disappoint. We got there just before the crowds so managed to get some quick photos without waiting our turn. Other than the sign there are some lovely art sculptures and Rodeo Drive is a fairly quick walk away (we drove though). There is parking just behind the Beverly Hills sign which you can pay for in 15 min increments and it was cheap. We did notice locals lifting their hoods and not paying so I’m not sure if this is a trick that the locals know 🤣 All in all it was worth the visit that you can fit in with lots of other site seeing.,Bmore F
40,"Neat public park in Beverly Hills, quite close to Rodeo Drive","The park runs parallel to Santa Monica Boulevard for over a mile. This is a nice long park in an urban setting. I saw a lot of people for walks or jogs when I visited. There is a Beverly Hills sign which is definitely the touristy part of the park, but there are a few interesting, unusual sculptures/statues lining the portion of the park where I visited.This is quite near to the famous Rodeo Drive. There is a cactus garden, quite close to the intersection of Rodeo Drive with Santa Monica Boulevard. Also, worth seeing is the All Saints' Episcopal Church situated close by.",Nostalgiyeah

40,More than just the sign,"The park runs parallel to Santa Monica Blvd for just shy of 2 miles. The Beverly Hill sign is just one feature.

50,See the Bi-Annual Beverly Hills Art Show!,"I have seen this show around for decades and was finally in two showings of David Palmer's Romantic Realism photography showcases. I even made it into the tent for a change and not just in the bin.David co-wrote ""Jazzman"" with Carole King, sang with Steely Dan but his life has been photography and he defveloped his own style. He won a few blue ribbons at various shows and you can see why. He's a joy to work with and a surprise always with how he places his models against pre-shot backgrounds.The show is known for the best artists in every area of art that you can think of. It's an all day, weekend affair, twice a year. Spring and Fall. If you've never been, go. Parking is on the streets nearby and if you're done early enough you can go shop in Beverly HillsIt's a well laid out show and people watching and meeting is on the menu. Not all Angelenos live in their cars or on their phones. You will meet some wonderful folks along the way.The finished products are from two shows.Plenty of food trucks and security.Something different to do at the park!",EMFredric
50,Dive into history while standing in the present,"What I love about this place is that it is timeless and to make sure you realize that, the city has added scannable QR codes that transport you straight back to it's beginnings and you can see photos of how it looked early 1900s when they built it.",Mei J
40,Good Photo Spot,These gardens may be small but they have some very interesting areas that make for good photo back drops. The Beverly Hills sign may be the best known but we found the other sculptures very interesting and the cactus garden was surprisingly beautiful. The area is small so you only need 30 mins or so to see most of it.,NiPat5
50,Lovely park to relax,"It may be right on Santa Monica Boulevard but I still found this park covering several blocks a great place to sit down (on the nice grass, since most seats are in the sun). It’s got the Beverly Hills sign above a pond, lots of art, and a lot of well cared for trees and flowers. If you’ve been missing Australia, you can climb on the magnificent Moreton Bay Fig.",mrdom
50,"Great place for a jog, walk or to just relax and enjoy the fountains","I grew up going jogging down the path of Beverly Gardens park which spans the length of Beverly Hills along Santa Monica Blvd from Doheny Dr to Whittier Dr. You might see some celebrities jogging here, but most people are simply residents out for some exercise. You can park on the street, there are some metered parking.",Warren N

40,Rockford Hills in GTA V = Beverly Hills in Real,"The first thing that gets in my mind when I think of Beverly Hills is large mansions of celebrities on the hills looking down the LA downtown. I played GTA a lot and have always been a fan of those big homes as that was the closest I could get to feel the Beverly Hills. So coming here I was already much excited. Our tour guide allowed us a good 45 minutes to spend our time around the area and take pictures.Interestingly, the stores were mostly without any customer. I guess they rely on their loyal high-rollers from the celebrity world for their revenues.Overall it was a nice and quick stop. We did not get to see any celebrity walking across the street!! However, there were many exotic and super cars all around the block.",Akhil P Walia
40,Great Place for pictures,After visiting some of the Beverly Hills landmarks my family and I walked by this park and rested before taking some nice pictures.

30,Just went for a photo,"The garden and water feature/ pond are nice but really you’d spend a few minutes taking some photos then move on.

30,Not what I expected,"Not exactly a park in the usual sense, perhaps I missed something. The Beverly Hills sign is a popular photo stop but looks like it has been put there just for that purpose. They were digging up the cactus garden when we visited so that part was closed. There are some interesting sculptures and it is a good way to walk this stretch rather than along the busy streets.I advise walking some of the streets off the park just to look at the beautiful homes.",Gadabouts95

Even quite late at night, there is always someone there!",Phil M
50,Lovely respite,"We were walking Rodeo Dr. and ended up wandering right into Beverly Gardens Park. We were initially lured by the greenery that we could see and then the absolutely gorgeous, enormous tree that was in the sculpture garden (near the Erratic sculpture).

50,My favorite part of our Segway tour,The original developers of Beverly Hills did a great job of providing green space and this corridor does a great job of separating the commercial on Santa Monica Blvd from the residential to the north. It is beautiful with lots of plants and flowers and accented by great water features. The best part is the sign made for pictures. Also there you are provided with a view of the oldest tree in Beverly Hills as well as great views of City Hall. A must see for your Beverly Hills experience.,Grover R

40,Just a photo opportunity..,"So, it's a nice little park but you are not here just for that. You are here to get a picture clicked at the Beverly Hills sign. And that perhaps is the biggest attraction here.Get a lot of pictures clicked, and feel free to post them on your instagram and Facebook accounts😂😂😂",BhawaniPathania

50,Gardens Provide Walking/Jogging Trail Along Santa Monica Blvd,"For locals and travelers this is a convenient, beautifully maintained park for walking or jogging. This park is only 2 miles long and offers several different gardens. Essentially, the park runs between Whittier Drive (across from the Beverly Hilton) and Doheny Drive (near the Toubadour and the beginning of west Melrose Ave). In the 'middle' of the 2 mile stretch is the iconic Beverly Hills Sign.I've always been fascinated by the section between the Good Shepherd Catholic Church and All Saints Episcopal Church. In this area of the park, a garden has several cactus varieties and stands out amid the other gardens and palm-tree-lined streets in Beverly Hills. Several art features are placed along the park's gardens. Highly recommended for a quick jog or walk to relax and rejuvenate.",RikiUSA
