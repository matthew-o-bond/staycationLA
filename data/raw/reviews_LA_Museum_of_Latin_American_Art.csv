50,Amazing artists,Amazing Murals. Artists tell a story. Inspiring and very encouraging. Very detailed artwork. Some of it brought tears to my eyes and many emotions. Grateful to those that have this gift. Keep drawing!,Lriveira
50,Vibrant cultural experience,"We went for the Afro-LatinX Celebration. The museum was alive with vibrant energy that only the Long Beach Community can bring. We enjoyed the exhibits, vendors, music, DJ, and food trucks.",KG O
50,Yes yes yes,A good space with several exhibits. Mostly modern and contemporary art from all over Latin America.South California is certainly close to being primarily Latin so this museum is a must for all of us.Curious that the museum is less than 25 years old...Thank you Dr. G for founding it.Bring your family and friends. Yes yes yes.,Summerasalifestyle
50,Wonderful way to spend an afternoon!,"I went to MOLAA specifically to see a special exhibit on sculptor Robert Graham, and ended up enjoying all of the exhibits in the museum. We went on a Sunday which has free admission, free parking and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The gift shop is also really nice with unique, high quality items.",MaryE995
50,Amazing Cutting Edge Art,"The cutting edge Latin American art at MOLAA never disappoints. Special exhibits are changed regularly. Currently (Nov., 2019), you'll find an exhibit on an American artist in Mexico (Stein/Estano), a Mexican born artist who created the logo for the LA Olympics as well as the doors to the Catholic cathedral in LA, and short films in Spanish with the minature sets. There's a large gift shop, free parking, and sometimes the outdoor sculpture garden and cafe are open. .",GlobalGypsy_13
50,One of a kind.,"MOLAA is the only museum in the USA that showcases modern and contemporary Latin American and Latino art. Along with the amazing permanent collection, you can see brilliant exhibitions. Small fee for admission except for Sunday where the museum if free of charge.",Cynthia-LAX
40,Good cultural trip,Nice place to spend an hour or so. Nice art and culture experience.Not ever too busy so you dont feel rushed.,David R
50,The Past as it relates to Latin American Art,Tourists and Locals enjoy visiting MOLAA to expand insight of Latin American people and how their culture inspires expression through art. Learn about the multitude of achievements from this vast community of people whose involvement spans internationally.,Loren B
20,No touching,Not so many things to see. Not advisable to bring kids in the museum since they're always curious to touch what they see. Kids enjoy drawing/ finger painting corner and the fountain at the entrance. That's it nothingelse.,Natalie
50,A fabulous surprise,"I had an hour to kill while waiting for my daughter and decided to check out this museum. I didn't know what to expect, so I was stunned by the cutting-edge exhibits. I particularly liked GRÁFICA AMÉRICA, an exhibit of historical and contemporary print-making. Very engaging and beautifully presented. Highly recommended!",Anne P
50,The Grafica America,We saw the Grafica America Exhibit. There was a lot of historical print making archival pieces dating as far back the 1400s to the present. Covering the regions of South America and the Caribbean. It was very inspiring. We really liked the children’s activities that engaged the children into the theme of the exhibit.,KG O
30,Perhaps the most unusual museum we have visited.,"I have wanted to visit this museum each time I have visited my daughter, and this year we did. The primary exhibit was tattoo art. While the history of tattooing was educational the rest of the well put together exhibit wasn't really my cup of tea.There is a lovely sculpture garden out back.",Pauline K
50,Cutting Edge MOLAA,"Every time I go to the LA area I enjoy the cutting edge exhibits at MOLAA. In Sept., 2018+, this was literally true as one of their special shows was on LA tattoos. In addition to the naval connection to LA and international roots of this body art, various local artists' works were displayed. Also, one section had videos of various people selected who would receive tattoos on specified days during the exhibit. In addition works by two female Latino artists were shown. And do step outside in the walled in back courtyard where sculpture and cacti are displayed together. Currently, the outside café is closed for renovations. Free parking is available in the adjacent lot, and do stop into the museum shop that has gifts related to current exhibits. And enjoy free admission on Sundays thanks to Target.",GlobalGypsy_13

50,Informative,Visiting recently we encountered and exhibition of Latin American and Caribbean works focused on environment. there was also an interesting panel and discussion related to the exhibition. Top quality all around and I look forward to future visits. Very courteous staff and families as well as youth are welcomed. .,LeGrace B
30,Depends on the show,"I have been here for spectacular shows like the Frida Kahlo photography exhibit. Then I have returned with guests and was underwhelmed. I saw another show which was just OK. It is a small museum so I guess in between exhibits there is not much to see. I did enjoy their cactus garden and even rescued a broken piece of cactus off of the pavement which is now a proud addition to my garden! Glad to have this museum in the community, just make sure to confirm there is an exhibit or you will make a trip for nothing.",travelingrules
10,Where's the Art?,"I hate to diss a museum but sometimes even museums need to be called out on bad business practices and disrespecting their patrons. I've wanted to go to MOLA for several years. In fact, we drove down from LA a couple of months ago on a Saturday but it seemed packed so we decided that we would take a day off work and go down on a week day - which is what we did today. We arrived and walked through the lovely outside sculpture garden. We went inside to buy tickets to the exhibitions only to be told that the museum was changing exhibits today and that the only thing open was the garden (which we just saw) and one exhibit - which did not include any of their permanent collection. The price was discounted 50% so we opted to walk through what we could. What a disappointment!!! It was an exhibition of six large black and white photography portraits with the face blurred and surrounded by smoke. Upon leaving, I asked the receptionist why they didn't have the fact that the museum was basically closed posted on their website. A guy who was changing signage on the wall behind her interrupted and told us that it was indeed posted but we had to search using Google or some such nonsense. Before leaving home, we had gone to the website to check opening hours and saw nothing about limited access. If we had, we wouldn't have wasted an hour in the car driving to Long Beach. Two bad management practices at play here: 1) If you're going to be closed on a day that you're normally open, then POST it large on your website. 2) The museum was just closed for two days (Monday and Tuesday), why not do the change over then? If change-over takes longer than two days, then that should be something that is planned well ahead of time and should be built into the annual schedule and posted like a holiday. We were offered two comp tickets as part of our discount to come back on another day but that means another drive down from LA.",Tim G
50,A great local museum with a wonderful array of paintings and sculpture from a Latin perspective.,I have been coming to this Museum for years since it opened. I strongly recommend visiting if your in the area and you enjoy art. A wonderful outdoor sculpture garden. They have outdoor concerts at times. They have current exhibitions and some core art holdings.,Eric682014
50,Worth a visit!,"This is a very good museum covering a niche market - Latin American Art. It’s actually amazing this museum is in a city the size of Long Beach. A wealthy philanthropist in the health care industry funded the museum and started it by donating his own collection.It is a wonderful place for anyone to visit and a great place to take children.The museum has its own collection, but welcomes excellent collections that are touring the United States.It has a small, but very good store, which is a great place to buy interesting gifts for yourself or to take home after a vacation.The musem is free on Sundays, thanks to the Target Corporation and there are always activities for children. They have a summer art camp and a nice patio area behind the main museum where special events are held.This would be a great place to have a wedding or corporate event.I have been there for Mother’s day brunch, Day of the Dead celebrations and more. Lots of food to purchase during special events.If you are visiting Long Beach this museaum is worth a visit!",Tatabooboobax
50,Beautiful Space. Free Parking.,"I can't believe until today, I had not visited this lovely museum. The exhibition halls are open and well lit. The special exhibit Relational Undercurrents, contemporary art of the Caribbean archipelago has some amazing pieces from artists of Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico etc, and so many moved me. With contemporary art, not all of it does. Here there was plenty to provoke thought. Well worth seeing. The staff there is super nice and friendly. The guards even shared their thoughts of the work while we studied things. The gift shop there is terrific with lots of awesome things...and definitely fair pricing. If you're in the Long Beach area, you might consider going here to purchase presents. And free parking. I'd definitely make the trip to visit this museum again.",Nancy D
50,A great museum that always has terrific art...,"Well displayed and interesting exhibitions that put the focus on well known Latin American artists like Frida Kahlo, but also little known artists with a colorful vibe and big talent.",tvvvv2016
50,Always Worth Visiting,"MOLAA is cool because works of various Latin American artists, some on the cutting edge, art exhibited. We enjoyed a good selection of photos of Frida Kahlo by Charles Muray and a South of the Border lunch in Cafe Viva. In addition to the 3 or 4 galleries there's an outdoor restaurant adjacent to a sculpture garden that was closed on the Target free Sunday of our visit. Ample free parking is provided in the lot next to the entry area that includes a well-stocked gift shop. You won't regret visiting this small, but interesting museum in Long Beach that we first discovered after a cruise from the port.",GlobalGypsy_13
30,Call ahead to make sure all exhibits are open,"On a whim I took a trip to visit this museum, since I was solo and hanging out in the city with a few hours to spare.It's a tiny museum but has some really interesting art pieces. Sundays are free, so I was able to attend at no cost, which was nice.The high points were some of the interesting mixed media pieces - I really loved the art magazine painting series done by Ramiro Gomez jr. He and a few other up-and-coming artists had showcased work that made it worth taking the hour to wander through. Also, there was a Frida Kahlo photography exhibit, but much of the work was a reproduction of the actual work.A few things to note:1) Repeating it here, but Sundays are free2) Call to ensure it's all open. I heard amazing things about the sculpture garden but it was closed when I got there and it hadn't been annotated on the website, so that was a bummer.3) No backpacks in the gallery. They'll make you check them but they're not under lock and key where they're kept, which always makes me uncomfortable when I'm toting camera equipment like I was that day.4) The attached cafe has some delicious tamales.This might be a fine option for a family with bigger little kids (5+) who want a couple of hours of an easy activity in an air conditioned location. It's a great spot to introduce kids to some culture and also have exits, food, and bathrooms within just a few steps of one another.",JuliaGooliaAbroad
40,Sunday Funday,"On a hot summer's day, what could be nicer than a jaunt to nice, clean, air-conditioned art museum? The exhibitions were very interesting and engaging and on Sundays it's free! Definitely worth a cute weekend date trip.",Mikey B

40,Wonderful exhibit,We stopped here expecting this to be a museum with a collection of art dedicated to several artists both past and present. It is not that. There was one main artist on exhibit. I loved the work of this artist. He had lots of culture represented in his art pieces. Dreamland: a Frank Romero exhibit. The gift shop had some really unique items.,debbie w
40,Delightful exposure to Latino Artist,"Our visit to the MOLAA was on Sunday -- free admission. Pretty much the entire gallery was taken up by the exciting work of one artist who chronicled late 20th century life, Frank Romero. Vibrant, colorful. He was a master of many styles: I saw Monet, Picasso, Braque, etc. influences. I think his best is as an art memorialist -- telling stories.",JWP8
50,Small Gem,"MOLAA features Latin American artists, who have a distinctive style and sensibility. The museum is not large -- you can do it in an hour or so. Be sure to walk to the back and see the sculpture garden. The last time we were there, they featured alters for the Day of the Dead, which were haunting and fascinating.",Bob S
40,Worth visiting,"We visit this museum each time we're in Long Beach. We were a bit disappointed that the exhibits this time were not excellent, but this museum is always worth a visit.",markmd
40,Ifantastic installations!,"Wonderful, edgy exhibitions. Not what you'd expect in Long Beach. The staff is wonderful in general, but, the gallery manager who works on community outreach needs a heart transplant and a lesson in community relations. She refused to grant space or any gratis services for the nationally known PTA Reflections art program awards ceremony honoring student at a local school. She also refused to be interviewed for complimentary documentaries highlighting Mexican artists and the positive impacts they have on child artists. Very sad! I will give praise to the male staffer who provided a local PTA with over a dozen passes to the museum for their Reflections Art program. He went beyond and deserves recognition.",chicagoborn40
50,"Unique, World Class Museum","The Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach (MoLAA) is a national treasure, in my opinion. It is the only such museum in the country, and showcases works from masters and lesser-known but still important artists from all over Latin America. The facilities are modern, the grounds are nice, the curatorial work is culturally respectful, and the cafe is yummy. The best part is surely the museum's extensive and rich permanent collection. The only time the MoLAA misses the mark is when they forego exhibiting their permanent collection in favor or more specific or special interests. For example, when every hall is devoted to Mexican art and none or the rest of the permanent collection is displayed, the museum does not create the same world-class impression. That said, certain single-artist exhibits are out of this world. Two that come to mind from recent years that were awesome were a Siqueiros exhibit (Mexican artist), and Carlos Luna (Cuban artist). Definitely worth a visit!",JuliaCat57
50,Loved the Sculpture Garden,"I've know of this museum for several years but it took this long to make my way to Long Beach.We started with the Sculpture Garden which is down a long passage in back and might be easy to miss. It is a large quiet square with sculpture mostly around the edges. The open center is ideal for events. There is also a café.Next we moved to a small gallery with an exhibit on comic books. After a preliminary look at the gift shop, we moved to the main gallery space.The museum is contemporary art and we enjoyed the spaces. Two pieces we particularly liked were heads. One large head sculpture was sliced into about 5 pieces and reminded my of my headaches and the other was some type of animal with a frog over the face and a fish on top.In the gift shop, I bought two small clay sculptures of a three-legged pig which is suppose to be good luck in Chile.",Kenneth L

After the entry hall with the history of the building (film studio and roller rink), the entry room features the founder and philanthopist Dr. Robert Gumbiner. In addition to this current show that highlights their collection that is the only one of Latin American fine arts in the U.S., the adjacent sculpture garden has some stunning pieces admist cacti. And you have no excuse not to visit as Target is currently sponsoring free Sundays. If you still have time, go across the street and visit the store front Pacific Island Ethnic Art Museum that opened in April, 2016, and showcases another aspect of Dr. Gumbiner's collecting.",GlobalGypsy_13
40,"Exhibits, Sculpture Garden, and FREE on Sundays!","Thank you, Target, for supporting the arts. We drove to Long Beach to meet a friend and she suggested this place for a quick visit. Between the museum, the gift shop and Cafe Viva, it makes for a great few hour visit. On Sundays, Target underwrites the admission.It's a simple little museum that can be visited in an hour or more depending how much time one wants to spend. And ample free parking. Even with the free admission it wasn't crowded. Great exhibit celebrating its 20th anniversary.We will be back",halobb
40,Free Sundays,"My friends and I went in Feb when an new exhibit was being installed, so there was just one exhibit at the time. I went years ago, ok maybe over a decade ago when they had murals under the stars. It was a wonderful program. Now they are in a beautiful modernized building.",chinadoll418
10,"Overpriced, small, and not particularly Latin","All of the artists featured at this Museum are Latin American. However, their art does not necessarily reflect anything unique about Latin American culture. It's basically just Modern Art. I was disappointed to not see historical art or anything particularly cultural. It was just like any other Modern Art Museum. I went on a free Sunday. I highly recommend that, as the size of their collection and, in my opinion, the beauty of the art displayed are not worth the entrance fee. There is a statue Garden behind the Museum's exterior accessible only through the museum. Most of the statues were also Modern Art and not particularly enjoyable to look at. For me, this Museum was disappointing. I do not recommend it.",jscof
50,Worth the trip,Enjoyed their 20th Anniversary Exhibition. We went on a Sunday and it was Free! Nice to see so many people at the museum enjoying the exhibition.,MoxieBoston

We went tonight and got to view art work from Botera, Tamayo and Orozco.All the art work for auction are amazing.Very polite and professional staff on duty tonight. Drove 3 hrs to get there. (LA traffic) would do it again. Gift shop had very creative pieces on Frida (my favorite).",Victoria
30,A manageable introduction to modern Latin American Art,"Living in close proximity to Long Beach, we decided it was high time to visit this often-talked-about museum, dedicated to modern Latin American Art. We chose a Sunday morning to visit and found that entry was free (not sure if it is free every Sunday), which was a bonus. Although the museum has its own dedicated car park, being a Sunday, entry being free, and because there were other student workshops also happening, the place was packed. So we opted to park three blocks away for free.Because the Museum is located so close to the centre of Long Beach (the convention centre and the restaurant area), the area is very busy. But finding parking space was not difficult.We expected to visit for at least a few hours. Exhibit rooms are all on the ground floor and unless you want to meditate in front of a particular piece, allow @ 2 hours for a leisurely viewing. In honesty, we expected far more exhibits than were currently on view. The Frida Kahlo works were not on exhibit, which were disappointing. So my recommendation - if you have the luxury of time - is to keep an eye out for scheduled exhibitions to insure against disappointment.There's also an attractive outdoor area, landscaped with drought-resistant plants and sculptures. There was a function on at the time, so there was less opportunity to enjoy this area.",christinebraganza
50,"Unique museum - Art, Dance Classes and more!",The Sculpture Garden is amazing. The new exhibits are always fascinating.I love that they offer multiple types of events including dancing.,gmeredith
50,Love the outdoor Sculpture Garden!,This museum has very clean lines that make it a pleasure to stroll through the art exhibits. I believe it's still the only museum in America to specialize in Latin American art. The outdoor sculpture garden is absolutely wonderful - my favorite part of the museum. Have enjoyed it by myself on a museum visit and have attended nonprofit events with hundreds of people and loved it both ways.,TrinaSchoon
40,Went here on for something to do in Long Beach,"I have been to Molaa several times. This was a visit with a friend of mine from Chicago. I wanted to get out of the house and did not want to go too far afield. Molaa was perfect. There was a Dia de los Muertos exhibit along with some other interesting art. Also, do not forget to check out the sculpture garden. A nice diversion in Long Beach",John K

We have enjoyed everything from Lucha Libre matches to musical performances on the beautiful grounds outdoors.They also bring excellent exhibits such as Frida Kahlo's work. If you're in town on a Sunday, you can go see for yourself free of charge. A great way to spend the afternoon by yourself or with the family.",Nadith1970
40,"Colorful, Fun, & Free! on Sundays","I took advantage of the free Sundays at molaa, which is great. The exhibits were by local contemporary artists, and there was a festival going on with face painting, dancing, and food trucks. Not to forget, there is a cafe on the grounds called Cafe Viva. I had a cuban panini with pork, ham, swiss cheese and spicy mustard. Great flavor. Then in trying to stay in the cultural theme, I had coconut flan for dessert. I prefer traditional flan's texture, but the coconut was fun. Michael was a gracious, friendly server which added to the experience.

I don't think we would have gotten a tenth out of the exhibit if she hadn't been with us. By the end of the tour, Frida was our friend. This is a very small museum that should be visited from time to time. Nice little gift store. I bought a recommended book on Frida. There is also a restaurant on the premises. I had no complaints about the food but the service was very poor. There was a lot of getting up and asking for things that were forgotten. The name of the it is Viva.",MaryLouise H
50,An unexpected gem,"We were in Long Beach on business, had a couple of hours to spare, and decided to check out MLAA. We were stunned, awed, by the current exhibit. Brilliant works, wonderfully displayed, in a great building. Pluses were super friendly and enthusiastic staff. Too bad that we arrived to late to have a snack in the restaurant, but I'm willing to wager it would have been pretty good. We don't often get to Long Beach, but we'll make sure that we stop in every time we do.",David B

50,Excellent Exhibits,"I visited yesterday to see the current exhibit of Mexican masters and was not disappointed. The Tamayo hanging in the entrance is outstanding, and the icing on the cake (the very last painting in the exhibit) is Kahlo's My Dress Hangs There. Through July, 2015.",laurastegeman
30,Interesting visit. To avoid disappointment call before you go; details below,"I spent one hour looking at art during my first visit to MOLAA. Everything was at least mildly interesting, and there were several paintings that were worthy of lengthy scrutiny. I am by no means an expert on Latin American art, so I looked forward to my visit in anticipation of checking out unheard of (to me) artists. Aside from Kahlo and Rivera, I was largely unfamiliar with anyone else.My initial impression is that this museum leans heavily on works from Mexican artists. This is fine, but I’ll have to check back to see if upcoming exhibits pull from other Latin American countries. The quality of the artwork I saw was overall good, but not great. All the galleries (several) are on one floor, and there is also a sculpture garden (cannot comment; closed when I was there). I went on a Saturday, right at opening, and there were very few other visitors there.I noticed many negative reviews lamenting the closed galleries. Perhaps this is why the MOLAA website (“Hours and Directions”) says—right at the top—to call prior to visiting to see which exhibits are open, and to confirm the sculpture garden hours. I highly recommend doing this so you don’t get disappointed. The front desk staff is really friendly and explained everything I needed to know prior to walking in.For your consideration:(1) Full admission is $9 (discounts for seniors, students); this is waived for North American Reciprocal Museums members(2) Admission is free on Sunday; I’m told that it’s still not that crowded(3) Plenty of free parking is available on-site(4) Photography is allowed (no flash) expect where you see a prohibition posted next to specific artworks(5) There’s a pretty cool looking café on the grounds; I will try this another time(6) The small museum store is very colorful and offers 10% discounts for members",Jim L

50,Well Worth Your Time,"We've been to this museum a few times now. Sundays are free but it's a great museum regardless of when you go. The last time we went they had Frida Kahlo's personal pictures as their main exhibit, which was good and really helped me understand her art better. The art itself is in several small exhibitions with very diverse themes. I like this because usually there is something there that really catches my attention and one of the other exhibits is just meh. I like that the museum really knows its artists and is able to attract very well known artists (if you have a good Latin American art knowledge) as well as some lesser known up and coming artists. A couple things that are worth nothing is 1) depending on the special exhibits Sundays can be a bit packed (The Frida Kahlo exhibit had long waits during the first few Sundays it was open and had to turn away those who arrived late in the day.) 2) the layout of the museum is a bit counter intuitive, it's best to go all the way to the back and work your way forward or else its easy to miss some of the work (also the sculpture gardens are easy to miss as well). Overall the museum is large enough not to disappoint.",Kat B
50,Uniquely different due to collection of Latin art,The museum is essentially different because of sole focus on Latin American art not found in such a wide ranging collection that differs from collections found in other museums elsewhere.

40,Where was the permanent collection?,"We have been to this jewel of an art gallery numerous times, and always been impressed with the permanent collection- Rivera, Kahlo, Botero, etc. Unfortunately, on this occasion, very little of this collection was on display, most of the space having been taken over by special exhibits. Some of this was well done, but I was disappointed by how much space was dedicated to dioramas commemorating Dia de Los Muertos. While undoubtedly an important occasion for the Hispanic community, I question whether an art gallery is the appropriate venue. I suppose that is up to debate; nonetheless, I was disappointed. Hopefully, the next time we go, the exhibits will be more art- oriented. The sculpture garden is very nice.",Richard W
50,Outstanding gem,Honestly and happily we enjoyed a few hours at.MOLAA between returning from a Mexican cruise and meeting our daughter at the airport. It was a good choice and overview of modern Latin Am. art. We almost skipped the outside sculpture garden which is an almost stark Southwestern oasis with cacti that highlights intriguing pieces effectively displayed against stucco walls. We lunched at the outdoor cafe on a pork soup (meal in itself) and tamales. My only regret is not being able to spend more delightful afternoons here due to the distance from our home in San Diego.,GlobalGypsy_13

40,A Unique Learning Expierience,"This museum is not a place where you will see art work from ""The Masters"". It is a place where you will find modern artwork from contemporary Latin American artists.As such, we were pleasantly surprised to see the many types and styles of artwork. We found the embroidered and painted silk artwork to be particularly fascinating.Many pieces in the museum reflect the social/political experiences of the artist.This is a great place to expand your understanding of modern art in today's society.",Kevin and Sue M
40,The Little Museum of Latin American Flavor,"A must see and do when in Long Beach. The Museum of Latin American Art showcases artists that not all are normally exposed to, and for this we thank you. Excellent layout, nominal entry fee. Plan your visit so you have lunch at the restaurant attached and DO NOT miss the sculpture garden.",JAR411
50,What a nice experience,"First of all was a special exhibit a class I am in went to. Our teacher selected the exhibit. wow wow wow. Cuban painter. Then 2 other galleries. I loved their gift shop, very well done, range of items, prices and beautifully displayed. Sculpture garden in back with cactus, and great venue for relaxing or entertaining. What a lovely surprise for a museum.",Helene W
50,Surrounded by Art,This hidden gem in Long Beach is a wonderful artful experience. The changing exhibitions are fabulous and the collection excellent. A peaceful indoor and outdoor experience. Highly recommended for a day visit or special events!,Elizabeth M
50,Wonderful cultural experience!,Came to this museum several years ago for a Diego Rivera exhibit. Last year I attended Latin music performance on a Sunday afternoon and once again it was great this year. Saw a performance of an accomplished Cuban dancer's Spanish dance debut in L.A. It was to die for spectacular! It is rare to see flamenco dancers of this caliber in LA. Only in Spain have I seen such talent. Gracias MOLAA for bringing this rare gem (Irene Rodriguez compania) to us!,luvitaly1
50,Gracias!,"So glad I found this museum--an exhibition of the photographs of Frida Kahlo was on view. The exhibitions, sculpture garden and gift shop were all excellent. Well worth the visit for a unique museum experience.",downonhudson
50,The Museum of Latin American Art,"A mind-expanding experience! Savor the rich, succulent paintings; it's like a vacation.p.s. free admission on Sundays!",Andrea R
50,Worth a visit!!!,"We visited the museum last Sunday, coming all the way from Orange County. The museum was definitely worth a visit: the visits are free on Sunday, the Frida Kahlo photography exhibit was amazing, the small museum gift shop was very tasteful, and the museum is very well organized.It is a beautiful museum with great contemporary furniture, statues and cacti and succulent gardens.If you're a Frida Kahlo fan (and even if you're not): don't miss this small museum and great Frida exhibit!!",Ploosh
50,Great art,"I came here for Frida and was extremely happy. Her exhibit was plentiful and interesting in it blended in other Latin art to give perspective of the time period. When I lived in Oakland I would take Bart to MOMA in San Francisco on the free days each month, and head straight to the Frida section.I went on the last Friday of the month so admission was free and it was not crowded. I love that there is a parking lot, plus street parking in the adjacent neighborhood. I would definitely come back for another special exhibit or one of the salsa nights. Even if it's not Frida. :)",KNGA03
50,Saludos great time,"We went on Sunday to see the free Frida Kahlo exhibit it was packed, but line went fast, The museum is small but the Frida Kahlo photos we interesting , We enjoyed it very much & every Sunday is free you can’t get better than that , go & check it out.",Cody50
40,Enjoyed our afternoon here!,"This is a small museum but it warrants a visit. The current marquee exhibit is the Frida Kahlo photograph collection. There was an interesting exhibit by a Mexican artist concerning the oil industry, I enjoyed it. Fortunately, it was a beautiful day and a stroll through the sculpture garden was very nice. The cafe on the premises is very good, food from Spain, Mexico, Cuba and central and south America. Very reasonably priced as well. I will definitely be back the next time I am in town to see what they have on exhibit. The gift shop is also worth a visit and I bought a beautiful piece of jewelry there.",adventurerplus
50,Hola!,"MOLAA is currently showing a Frida Kahlo exhibit and it's fabulous. Every exhibit here is well curated and the museum is free on Sunday, thanks to Target. There are always wonderful events and the gift shop is terrific. Try to go to the restaurant attached to the museum, it's terrific.",Anne P
40,Free Sundays; Frida Kahlo exhibit a little misleading,"You can't beat Free Sundays. Living just a few blocks from here, it's a great place to spend 1.5 to 2 hours on a Sunday seeing the exhibits and the such. The Kahlo exhibit was interesting, but most of the photos are not by her. But if you find the video screen at the end of the exhibit, it makes the connection between most of the photos in the exhibit to how they influenced Kahlo's work, or became elements in her paintings.The regular exhibits are usually interesting, although not varied enough to be considered ""Latin American"" as some other reviewers have noted. The sculpture garden is underwhelming, but I personally find this to be the case with most sculpture gardens.",Aaron_Widera
50,Great museum!,"My friend and I recently visited the Museum of Latin American Art to see their current exhibit called ""Frida Kahlo: Her Photos"". We went to the public opening on Sunday which was free. I hadn't visited the museum in more than 12 years and it has changed considerably. There is now a front glass facade, huge pond with fountains and a beautiful sculpture garden. The museum shop was full of Frida memorabilia. There were plenty of activities going on in the Balboa Center such as hands on projects and slide shows. In the Sculpture Garden there was continuous live music through out the day. The highlight for me alongwith seeing the photo exhibit was the Frida Look Alike contest. Even though I don't live in California I joined the museum. I would definitely visit it again!",Soledad2009
50,Great smaller Museum,"This art museum has wonderful special exhibits - often very contemporary: sometimes provocative, sometimes amusing, sometimes sobering, but staying true to its presence as a representative of Latino culture.This is a newer museum and its permanent collection is growing still. The building is beautiful, great museum gift store and good coffee at the cafe!We stayed over an hour - had a coffee and went out to see the sculpture garden.",414gottago
50,Try it you will like it!,"The exhibitions are consistently excellent and varied. Free on Sundays. Beautiful gift shop and Cafe. Easy to find. Do not miss the sculpture garden, spend some time to look at the architecture.",sb-cre8art
10,Thankfully Sundays are Free,"The Museum of Latin American Art lacks variety and 99% of the exhibits are from Mexican artists or American artists who worked in Mexico. I expected to see art from more countries of the Latin American region. The museum is quite small, and took less than 30 minutes to see everything. 50% of the museum consisted of Lucha Libre photographs. Every Sunday visitors can get into the museum without paying a fee. I won't be returning, free or not.",Petzl76
50,A little gem,"Featuring art from Latin America, this museum introduces the public to art they may never have seen, with thought provoking exhibits from artists well known in Latin America, or emerging ones. The museum is small enough to be viewed in one visit, and also is connected to a delightful restaurant serving lunch on an outside patio, or indoors, with food also inspired by cuisines from across Latin America. The sculpture garden is a hidden treasure, intimate and haunting. And the gift shop is the place I go to in order to find all manner of fascinating gifts, especially around the holidays.",spanprof1
50,Outstanding small focused museum,"This museum is worth going a bit out of your way to find. The retrofit of an old skating rink with blocks of vivid color set the tone for outstanding exhibits of art from Mexico & South America.I am primarily interested in Mexican art, both traditional & current, which is well represented here. But there is also art with good documentation from all over Latin America. The themed exhibits were very well done & organized a diversity of provenance into trends & themes that illustrated the richness of Latin American art that is not widely-enough appreciated in this country. The sculpture garden is serene & incredibly satisfying, much as many courtyard spaces in Mexico are. My husband & I liked this place so much that we went twice during our two & a half weeks in the area. There is also a pleasant restaurant if you are there at noon.",carolshodge
40,Competent,"In a cool setting with nice architecture, you get here a competent insight into the contemporary art scene of Latin America. An their little restaurant offers a variety of Latin world inspired snacks. The museum also offers a special event program.",RGerman
10,Disappointed,"As a Mexican/American woman, I am always on the lookout for books, art, museums, and events that relate to my cultural history, which is very difficult to find. Therefore, I REALLY wanted to like this place. Convinced my teenage children to go with me only to end up disappointing them. Two galleries only, exhibits closed, few pieces, garden closed, and a gift shop that leaves a lot to be desired. Nobody to guide you or explain anything to visitors. Few staff that was available at the entrance were nice, but that's it. My inner conflict is whether it's worth a second chance...",aztkdiva
50,Gem of a Museum,"The first exhibit I saw at the Museum of Latin American Art featured the works of Diego Rivera. Since then, I've returned many times, each experience educational and unique. Plus my husband and I became members. Membership benefits are impressive. We never know what to expect at art openings because each one is different. Sometimes there is music. Usually there is food from the country of the featured artist. The museum has changed over the years; the present version has sculpture in the outdoor areas, including the museum's beautiful patio. Last year on Father's Day, a group of us, including 3 grandchildren, enjoyed the experience of viewing the art and even relaxing in the patio of the adjoining Viva museum cafe. A few months ago, we went to an opening with our artistic young grandson; he enjoyed the exhibit with the boxing ring, the music, and the food.",tapbelle
40,"Very Good Museum, Interesting Presentation","We enjoyed our visit to the Museum of Latin American Art. There's lots of free parking available. During our visit, there were two temporary exhibits, one of the work of Debora Arango, a Columbian painter with an interesting approach to female nudes and political issues, and Lola Alvarez Bravo, an innovative Mexican photographer. We were particularly attracted to an interesting way of displaying the permanent collection, tying together disparate art works by story telling. The sculpture garden has some interesting works, but it isn't overwhelming. We enjoyed an excellent lunch in the cafe and the bookstore had a nice selection with a special seasonal emphasis on the Day of the Dead. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Long Beach.",areview28
50,Always Learning Something New at this Place,I've been to this museum about five times... the facility is neatly laid out and the exhibits are nicely portrayed. I've never seen the place crowded. The art is grand and they are always adding something. On my last visit I discovered and adjacent restaurant where the food was decent and I loved eating on the patio. This is a nice place.,revolor
50,Art and events,"Molaa has a wonderful, changing collection of art and has frequent activities too- from music and dancing, to children's events...it has something for all of us!",Sandrinaav
40,Surprised,"Having read others' reviews, I didn't hold much hope, but the exhibits intrigued me and although they really don't have any famous art there, it seemed very avant garde, which I liked. I'd say it's more of a museum of Latin American artists than art. The current exhibit with the ping-pong table and inflatable book are memorable. Like most small museums, this one is surely underfunded; so while it seems expensive for the value, if you like seeing innovative thinking and go open-minded you'll enjoy this.",Blahblahb
20,A disappointment,"This could have been so good, but it's not. It's a very small museum with disappointing collection. Restaurant is okay, but service is slow and inconsistent. Museum store equally disappointing. Visitor services was borderline rude.",TiTiTG
40,Worth Visiting,I visit art museums all over the world. This museum was very interesting when I visited. The urators obviously do a good job of finding interesting art and presenting it to the public. The sculpture garden in back was open on Saturday and is worth a look. Drinks at their cafe was a nice respite.,Jorden N
50,Beautiful exhibits and building,"This is a beautiful museum. I went to visit a specialty exhibit entitled ""MEX/LA: MEXICAN MODERNISM(S) IN LOS ANGELES 1930-1985."" The exhibit was rich, but I'm sure not for long. Nevertheless, taking the trip to here from LA was well worth it. The building itself is quite extraordinary and friends and I sat for a time outside at various parts of the outdoor areas in front and to the side of the building. The museum has a good permanent collection, a gift shop, and a cafe. Also, easy, FREE parking lot right out front. . .a gift! We stopped at a local donut shop just up the street and munched and had a cafecito before going in. . .",Irma M
10,DO miss it!,"What a colossal waste of time and money. Two lousy galleries, most exhibits closed and an unhelpful staff made this sad ""museum"" one of the most lacking cultural experiences we've ever endured. From the Prado in Madrid, to the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Buenos Aires, we've visited worthy museums all over the world, and this joke of a museum is at the very bottom of the pile. Don't bother with this place, and don't be taken in by the pretty exterior of this nicely packaged clip joint. A true disappointment in every way.",kcbobo
10,What a RIPOFF!,"While visiting Long Beach, the owner of the hotel we were staying at recommended MOLAA & we couldn't have been more disappointed. They had 2 exhibits opening the next day so 2 areas were closed off. But the building was large we thought since they were charging us FULL PRICE, there must still be a lot to see. Wrong! Even the sculpture garden outside was a disaster - filled with tables, lights & catering people preparing for that night's event to sneak preview the new exhibits for big donors. Here's a marketing tip for the staff - next time say ""Sorry the big exhibits are closed; the museum is free today - please enjoy the museum & come back when all the exhibits are open."" They are not interested in promoting Latin American art...just your $18.",Sandi M
50,Check the current exhibit before you go... I loved the Mexico exhibit,"Whether or not you enjoy MOLAA will likely depend on whether the current exhibit matches your personal taste. The Mexican exhibit on display while I was visiting was very modern and edgy, and I loved it. On the other hand, someone with a true love for classic art might not agree. There was a wonderful combination of painting, photos, three-dimensional pieces and video/film works. The layout is easy to follow. I would have liked a little more information on some of the plaques. However, that was balanced out by the neat ""cell phone tour"" feature that allows you to use your cell phone to call a number, bunch in the code (for some of the pieces), and then hear a recording that provides great details. Best for unlimited cell phone plans! The scuplture garden out back is interesting, but pretty hot when the weather is warm, without much shade available.The museum is not in the main downtown tourist area, but one of the Passport bus lines can drop you off about 2 blocks away for $1.25 fare.",kleetampa
20,Skip it,"This musuem gets a lot of hype, so I finally went to see it (I live locally), and was underwhelmed. Doesn't live up to it's rep.",sophies610
10,Save Your Money,"I love museums. I've enjoyed Latin American art at such museums as the Guggenheim in New York. I had hoped to bring my class to this museum for a field trip.So I was completely disappointed upon touring MOLAA. There was an entry hallway with information about a singular artist and a large room with a display of his works which was a mishmash of inconsistency without meaningful explanation.The rest of the museum consisted of 2 rooms. One had 6 quite large, um, paper wads on the floor. Again, didn't find the explanation, though it may have been there. In the other, again, odds and ends of odd photos and drawings without any seeming tie. The sculpture garden was closed for a special event. This was actually a step up because the previous 3 times I'd tried to visit, the entire museum had been closed for special events. (This, apparently, happens quite often. I always check the website before I go, but they don't seem to post closings.) That was it. This is supposed to be a world class museum. Don't waste your time or your $9, there are too many wonderful sights in Long Beach that are worth a visit.",Wendy M
50,A hidden gem,"After visiting the great museums in New York and Europe I can say that this one holds its own. As befits the Latin temperament, its art is passionate, colorful, evocative -- it moves you. I went to see an exhibit by the Puerto Rican artist Arnaldo Roche and was bowled over.This museum is the best survey of Latin American contemporary art in the United States. The building is modern and bright and spacious and gives every piece the right placement and the right light. There's a lovely outdoor section and a nice shop with an emphasis on Frida Kahlo.This museum is a neglected gem that deserves a far bigger public. But that's your good fortune, because it's almost never crowded. It's definitely worth a journey to Long Beach.",luvtheworld
50,Definitely worth a visit,"The MOLAA occupies what was the old Hippodrome in Long Beach, just on the outskirts of Downtown at the intersection of Alamitos Ave and 6th/7th streets. It is the gateway to the East Village Arts District. The exterior is well done, with a modern flair and drought-tolerant plantings. Inside is all warm tones and a contemporary feel. There are several large spaces/rooms where the artworks are shown, some part of the permanent collection and others ""visiting"". Many countries and genres are represented and quite a few are political in nature. There are volunteer docents who take small groups around and discuss the works (this is an option and not a mandate). The museum also offers activities and events during its off hours (dance, music, classes, etc), so pick up a calendar if you wish. The museum cafe is nothing special so try one of the other places in the area for lunch or dinner.",NativeCalGal
50,nice variety and interesting works,We enjoyed a nice stroll through the MOLAA. Many different countries and media were represented. It's a lovely building and a great place for a short visit or a long one.,fairbanks6
