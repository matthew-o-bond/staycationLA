50,Enjoyed walking around this lake and watching all the dogs with their owners,"A small lake with paved walking path around the perimeter. I walked and as an artist, I sat on a park bench and painted and photographed. There seems to be a marina where you can rent water-based activities, like swan paddle boats. there are many gazebos and trees with benches so plenty of ways to get out of the sun. It was fairly busy. Lots of couples. Lots of dogs walked with owners. A few joggers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janemO4600FS

50,Tranquility,"After a busy day of sightseeing & shopping, it was a pleasure to stop here and relax for awhile. People watching is always enjoyable as is duck and bird watching. The walk around the lake and swan boats were fun too. Water, the sun and beautiful breeze all made for a very Zen visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaralY2470PY
50,Beautiful gardens,"Amazing walking, wonderful view. I was so happy to see this beautiful place. The Japanese garden is nice for walking and meditation. You can see different birds, flowers, trees and bushes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianavR7504US
50,Nature walk with the dogs,"My friend and I took our dogs to Lake Balboa a few months ago. Lovely! Clean, nice walking trails of concrete or dirt. Beautiful trees and foliage. Plenty of room for two- and four-legged patrons. Everyone was responsible and respectful with their animals and each other. Will definitely visit again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladydenise3
30,Great sized park north of Los Angeles,"Cozy park, easy parking, swan boats, places to sit and eat, free admission. Can't complain...bring the family and enjoy a day out or come alone and read a book. There are lots of trees, its quiet and there are places to sit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
50,Nice park,Spent a couple hours under a tree relaxing and walking around the lake here. Good place to chill and see some ducks and they had boats and bikes for rent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AprilJoy85
40,Paddle boat ride,It was a fun experience and I'd recommend it. It doesn't cost too much and they give you a whole hour which we didn't use up all our time due to a 6 yr old needing the bathroom.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/986deboraha
40,Pleasant Outdoors,"We've come here many times before. This time we rented a swan boat (swan-themed paddle boat). It can be pricey, since you pay by the number of people, not by the boat. $22 for two of us for an hour. We had a good time paddling around the lake, looking at the birds. It was hard to get close to the shore, because the lake was lined with people fishing, and we didn't want to run into their lines. Some of them were fly casting in areas where they aren't supposed to do that. This lake is filled with reclaimed water, it looks dark and not very clean, and you can detect a bit of the sewage odor. I certainly would not want to eat the fish. In general, though, this is a fun place to hang out for a walk around the lake, bicycling, skating, walking the dog, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosemaryw534
20,"Do NOT go around the park,",Not safe environment around the park anymore. It's nice around the lake only. NatureYa no es seguro el ambiente alrededor del parque. Es lindo solo alrededor del lago. Naturaleza.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlgaVls71
30,Good area park,"Lake Balboa Park is a large park just north of the 101 freeway in the San Fernando Valley. It is easy to get to and offers many outdoor areas for relaxing, walking, sports, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67

40,Sepulveda Basin,"I'm going to discuss the Basin area which Balboa park is a part of. You gotta love a nature reserve in the middle of the San Fernando Valley. This place offers a variety of bird species as well as other nature. Just watch out for homeless and the weird gay ""meet up"" subculture. This place has also been used in movies IE.. Gattaca",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/436stug
40,Lake Balboa in Encino: A nearby outdoor hob,"I live nearby and would consider lake Balboa and surrounding area a good hangout place to bike, jog, rent a boat or even fish! I can not say it is very well maintained but if you are visiting the surrounding urban areas and need a nearby escape to nature this is your easy access to walking and biking trails, boating, fishing and bird watching.Pros: It is inside San Fernando valley area so you don't have to drive miles to get there. Lots of possible activities. Safe neighborhood. Possibility to fish and paddle boats. Benches and BBQ for family picnic.Cons: very crowded on weekends sometimes. Bathrooms not very clean. Lake water is reclaimed so it may smell a little bit, good access to LA river.Overall a very pleasant hangout and recreation location. Best season to me is Spring.Also I have made a video about fishing in Lake Balboa. You do need to have a California license to fish and can get it online easy. If you fish please catch and release",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seanschin
40,Lots of birds,"We usually come here to walk and see the birds It's about a 1.3 mile walk around the edge of the lake, just enough to count as exercise without going overboard. This is a great place for birdwatching, with some that are year-round residents and others that change with the time of year. There are plenty of fish in the lake, and it's fun to watch the birds diving for them.People also go fishing here, but the reclaimed, bird-filled water isn't very clean. I wouldn't want to eat those fish.For extra fun, you can rent bikes or paddle boats. We've done both in the past and had a great time.This park is popular for family outings, and can be crowded on the weekends, but parking is not usually a problem. Just keep driving around until you come to a lot with a few open spaces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosemaryw534
40,Wonderful Park,"Wonderful park with a paved path around the lake for a stroll, walk or jog. Beautiful scenery & plenty of benches to sit & enjoy the views. Playground for the children, peddle boat rentals & fishing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lm1109
50,Balboa park ... üö≤‚òÄÔ∏èüö≤,"LOVE IT ... In contacts with the universe, AMAZING !!! We have a wonderful day with my friends on the bicycles all around and Inside the park soo nice!!! I want to comeback as soon as possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MARMOTONA
20,Some positives and some negatives,"It is a good size park and the lake is pretty although at times the water smells. It is also fairly popular and it can get very crowded, in particular during w/e's and holidays. The availability of parking is not bad though. The scenery is excellent overall and there are areas for children to play and a reasonable amount of parking options, the loop around the lake is probably about 1 mile and there are several benches where to sit and relax and/or enjoy some breeze. These are the positives.The trails are definitely a semi-disaster though. I have used this park for 7-8 years and the quality of trails has been deteriorating dramatically over the same period: many uneven concrete slabs, several broken in pieces, patched up and then broken into further pieces, many holes, a lot of debris and when it rains, sections of it (along Woodley Avenue and, even worse, Burbank Blvd) get flooded for days, and covered with mud and dirt.The park personnel does a fair job trying to keep them clean from time to time. Cannot do anything when they are flooded and that is acceptable, although they could try to eliminate the problem by raising some of those small sections. There is no hint and there has not been one for years of fixing the broken concrete slabs.The parking lot for the golf course is in horrible shape and has been in need to a solid repaving for years. Be very careful in this area for many drivers pay no attention to pedestrians, cyclists and skaters alike. Once I even saw an old lady driving on the trail as she got confused and thought it was part of the road. No, I am not kidding. The screaming of people on the trail was real.Trail etiquette is quite poor with many users paying no attention to others on the trails, walking in pairs in the middle of the trail, often with dogs (who, truth be told, exhibit more judgement than their owners and try to stay on the sides of the trail), jogging with headsets and so unable to hear when cyclists or the few skaters announce their approaching. Once I even saw a skateboarder with a sail on the trail and who was completely unable to see where he was going as the sail was in the way of his vision.There is hardly any attempt to enforce any rule with people feeding the birds, or even when trucks park on trails so the truck can be in a shaded zone. No authority or personnel seems to ever do anything about it. In 8 years I only saw a lifeguard approach an ""idiot"" who parked his pickup square on a section of the trail and forcing him to move it as it almost caused a cyclist to run into the truck since this ""Einstein"" parked it in a shaded area after a nearly 90 degree turn on the trail.If the trails were well kept, fixed when needed, and etiquette were enforced, this park would have a huge potential. As it is, my rating is poor to average at best. But it could be fantastic if only someone did something about fixing the main issues.Clearly, I go to the park mostly to use the trails. I have little interest in picnics and the like. I have walked the dog around the lake many times and enjoy it. Thus I may be biased. However, it is a fact that the number of cyclists and skaters has been decreasing since, as they are, trails are more akin to hazards than fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mauriziot101
40,LAKE BALBOA PARK,"We went to the park for the first time with a Dutch Oven Cooking Group for one of our outings. The park is very large with a nice lake, many grassy areas for groups, areas for kids to play, nice paved paths that go around the lake, fishing (although I did not see anyone catch a fish), lots of birds, benches by the path and picnic tables scattered in many areas. There seemed to be adequate parking at several lots and road parking to cover more isolated areas.The way they made the lake you can not see any of the city around the park so it has great views and many photo ops.The park had a lot of people all day long, it was a sunny Saturday in December but did not seem overcrowded. I can see this could be crowded in the summer time though. The restrooms are located all around the lake and the ones by us were never full. However the restrooms could use some maintenance, the lights did not work in some, water leaks at the flush valves, with lots of trash on the floors. I never found a place to wash my hands which I think is a real negative. The grounds in general showed some lack of maintenance but not to the point of distracting from the experience.I was surprised that a park this size and this nice did not have an entrance or parking fee. I will have to check on how the fishing is and may have to come back to try my luck at catching some fish next time.A very nice park in a busy city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/707clayg

Our two yr. old baby girl Maddie, who is very matured in her age enjoyed tremendously in feeding the coots and ducts that sometimes she has the opportunity to touch them.

Including, tennis, soccer, softball, three golf courses, a Japanese Garden at the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant, walking and biking trails, nature trails, archery range, model airplane park, skate park, and a velodrome.

50,Lovely place for family fun & outdoor activities,"This park is a great place to take your kids, especially if they just need to run around. There are actually two playgrounds -- one for smaller kids and one for big kids. It definitely helps so that your little toddler doesn't get run over.In addition, there are tons of green space where they can run around, and there are enough picnic tables to have some snacks.And then if you want, you can take time to walk around the lake, which is filled with waterbirds.

Granted, it is actually treated effluent from the waste-water treatment plant, but still rather wonderful to walk around and enjoy. There are benches sheltered by arbors full of wisteria surrounding the lake which are wonderful to escape the sun.

A kids playground and a chance to feed the ducks.Before I started the BBQ I went for a 2.6 mile run around the park twice to help get that belly ready for some amazing steak.

50,A haven for wildlife and lifestyles,There is so much to see and do at this park! I come in the early morning to enjoy the cool crisp air and the sunrise as I walk the 1.2 mile circuit around the lake. A great way to start the day any day of the year in Southern California. There are fantastic playgrounds for children and ample room for picnics and birthday parties.

There are paved walking trails all around the lake. The lake is man-made and there are lots of ducks and other birds all around, which means lots of mess to avoid on parts of the trail. However, it's still an enjoyable and peaceful place to be. I was by myself on this visit, but after seeing all of the play equipment (lots of equipment that looked pretty awesome) I can't wait to bring my family here. There were lots of people there, but still didn't feel like it was too crowded. There is no fee for parking or entrance to the park.

The kids have enjoyed bike riding and skating here as well as fishing. I wouldn't expect much fishing but the whole experience is fun for kids. Pack a picnic bag and have a nice lunch under one of the several large trees. There are also paddle boats for rent and a nice playground for kids.

If you are a bird watcher this is heaven. You may see egrets, pellicans, cormarants, multiple varities of ducks and geese and the ever present coots. As soon as it was filled it became a main stopover on the bird migration path. We have traveled to remote areas to see this kind of wildlife but you can see more here in L.A. (ironicaly) on almost any day. Mornings are best. There is a great kids playground picnic tables, BBQ's. Miles of hiking and biking trails (class A). An adjacent Japaneese garden and more wild natural lake. The Cherry trees are blooming right now but will be over by the end of April. Oh did I mention two great golf courses as well.
