Between about 14th St and 17th street are some lovely shops (even chains like JJill and Chico's for women's clothing) and cute restaurants.

50,Walkable small town downtown south of San Vicente,Walkable small town downtown south of San Vicente. South of Montana is tainted by the hustle and bustle of Wiltshire. Yet the closer you get to Montana the neighborhood changes and it begins to take on the flavor of Montana. Santa Monica is stratified by where one lives. Wiltshire is big city and full of condos. Then more single family homes are mixed in as you get closer to Montana. North of Montana are nearly all single family dwellings. All a matter of money.,Cavydad
50,The Montana Ave experience,"Montana Ave is an icon in my book. You cannot be in the LA area and not go to Montana. Restaurants, cafes, boutiques, all in a beautiful surrounding. You have to walk up and down this street and enjoy Cali at it's best :)",cristinanedelcu
40,High End Shops. May not be for everyone. Occasional star sighting,"This is not where you want to do your holiday shopping. However, if you are not on a budget, there are several small boutique non-chain shops for those in the 1%. Still nice stroll with several nice restaurants and coffee shops. not super touristy so if you want to hang for an hour or two and see how the wealthy locals live....this is a good place to do it. 1 out of every 3 visits you'll get a star sighting as this is prime real estate in LA",ChezCarrere
30,Not what I was expecting,"My friend and I do a girls shopping trip every year. We typically go to New York, but this year we chose Los Angeles. I did some research before we went, to find out where the best shopping is. I found several good reviews for Montana Avenue, saying it had great boutiques.So, we made our way there. There is nothing wrong with the street as such, it does have everything it claims to haveâ€¦ That is, shops, restaurants etc. I was simply expecting something different. I was picturing something closer to 5th Ave., New York. There were women's clothing stores here, but I would say that most we went into were for older women (over 50). If I'd stumbled across this street as I wandered the city, it would've been fine. But, making a point to come all the way there by uber from our Beverly Hills hotel to check it out, left us disappointed.",MTVandendooren

The Aero Movie Theater shows awesome old movies and new movies alike. A program called American Cinematheque at the Aero even brings in famous directors and actors for after movie interviews. I have asked questions of Colin Firth and Forest Whittaker live and in-person! I also really enjoy eating at R & D Kitchen and Father's Office on Montana. And Yogaworks on Montana is my favorite yoga place in Los Angeles. Montana Ave has a small, cozy feel that is remarkably rare in this sprawling city. Last but not least, there's even a smallish, accessible Whole Foods on Montana Ave. This one street has almost everything you need.",Melissa D

This can be particularly nice when you time your walk near sunset.The sidewalks are less cramped than Third Street, and all the shops have more to offer. They're not as commercial, but you're more likely to find something that resonates more with Santa Monica.",CoRo1313

50,Montana Avenue - Cute neighborhood boutiques and great restaurants!,"Montana Avenue is a great place to come for a little shopping and a meal with a neighborhood vibe. There are great restaurant choices. Some of my favorites are Blue Plate for breakfast (it's an upscale diner); Forma for dinner (it's great inventive Italian, they toss pasta in a hollowed out giant round of Parmesan); Locando Portofino for dinner (expensive but definitely worth it Italian); and Kreation for breakfast, lunch, or juice (very casual healthy organic food and great fresh juice blends). There's lots of little boutiques lining the street to window shop or buy. I like Splendid for super comfy casual women's and men's clothes, Planet Blue for trendier women's clothes, Kiehls and Blue Mercury for skincare and cosmetics, and many other small interesting stores. There's also a Drybar on Montana if you want to drop in for a blowdry while you're there. For planning purposes, walking down Montana won't take too long. I would say it's 1- 2 hours at most for the shopping part. Enjoy!",Kathy G
30,Typical over-priced shopping but fun to look,"We've walked Montana multiple times; nice cafes/restaurants, unique stores, both clothing and gifts/housewares.

40,Pleasant shopping street,"Between approximately 7th Street and 17th St. there are 10 blocks of shops, restaurants, bars and coffee shops. The shops consist mainly of boutiques and are mostly high-end. Of the restaurants, we like Rosti which has tasty Italian fare and reasonably priced. It is a busy street but there are plenty of pedestrian walkways in the traffic usually stops for pedestrians.",vincemc
50,A lovely place for a stroll,"Whenever I come to LA I always take the time to visit Montana Ave. There are so many independent shops to either step inside, or just window shop - one of my favourite window shopping places is the doggy parlour.Just park down one end of the street, walk up one side and down the other - a really pleasant way to spend an hour!",DanteandDougie

30,Where the locals shop??,"We were told this was the area where the locals shop. Our idea of locals were more of a mid range experience than a high end experience.

40,It Ain't Your Father's Montana Avenu,"What a change since our family first put down roots off of Montana Avenue in the lat 70's. Montana Ave. was gas stations and tired old grocery stores with a smattering of small, ugly shops in between. Except for the local go-to diner, ""Sweet Sixteen"" there wan't a restaurant to be found. (Or perhaps I've forgotten?) Contrast that with more coffee places than an economist would find sensible in such a short stretch of street (between 7th and 17th), but you have a fine choice with coffee styles for every taste, from Starbucks plain, often bitter brews to Lady Jane's creamy blends of espresso and steam milk, Groundwork's decent brews served in handle-less mugs to accompany your way overpriced baked offerings($5 for a bagel? Seriously?) The venerable Aero Theater hosts many films some with Q&A sessions after featuring actors and/or directors, a special treat, especially for old film buffs (old film, not old buffs, or maybe both...). Nice to walk, but at the spring and winter Montana Ave Walks, beware that the surprisingly narrow sidewalks do not extend a hand of welcome to strollers, especially the twin side-by-side variety. It's a nice bit of small-town charm and welcome in a non-beachy way. Parking is not fun, but just add enough time to find a spot and maybe walk a few blocks. And take the kids to Rosti for lovely salads, sandwiches, and decent if not exciting pizza. Their outdoor tables are popular in the summer, and they have heaters for our bitter Santa Monica winters. No wonder it's become a magnet for westside visitors. Although, you won't see tour buses lined up. Thanks for that! Lots of good restaurants now. Come stroll and take a look. You'll probably be charmed.",Richard G

20,Can We All Say Pretentious Together,"Most locals do not go to Montana Ave. It is located in Santa Monica and if you are on vacation I can tell you 100 places to go to first. It is a street, a few blocks--blocks of boring and over priced stores, restaurants that are okay, but not great. You can keep walking and see some beautiful homes--that is nice, but is this how you want to spend your time?There is just no there there, if you know what I mean. There is nothing you can't see on a drive through Beverly Hills (with better shopping and much better food). You will pay to park and walk. You will buy something that you can get for less elsewhere, unless your toddler really needs a 350$ cowboy outfit that he will out grow in a month.There are stores that have skin cream and perfume and oh who cares?There is not one thing special about Montana Ave. If you want shopping go to Rodeo Drive.

Marmalade's for breakfast, sharing the big table with the locals, Roesti for an inexpensive BYO wine meal, Father's Office for a great hamburger (wines are a bit too expensive), Peet's Coffee is a nice corner to watch the people go by and the Aero Theatre for fabulous art house movies. Luxe does great cappuchino and even flat whites! (As an Australian, I love the flat whites). The street has had many ups and downs but seems to have come through unscathed and is now a must go to destination for those staying in the area. The Blue Plate is popular and serves traditional American staples, yoghurt shops abound and there is a Ralph's Supermarket as well as a small organic supermarket. A couple of good wine stores makefor a great holiday stay. Close to the neighbourhood are hotels such as Palihouse, The Huntley, Cal-Mar and the Fairmont. All are walking distance to Montana Ave. At the beach end of Montana the Palisades Park is a wonderful early morning walk or just a spot to sit and gaze out over the ocean from the bluffs.

Nice gardens full of flowers if you park on one of the side streets and great places to grab lunch or window shop.

The street is sloped though, so wheelchairs may have an issue.",JimL_RedMaps

40,Some great shops and restaurants,"Most of the shops and restaurants here are locally owned rather than national chains, so there are a little places that aren't the same as everywhere else. Prices vary, but most shops aren't cheap. There are some excellent alternative type food places. If you're a runner it's great to head west on Montana until it deadends into Ocean Boulevard and the Pacific.",davemh333
50,Favorite non-touristy shopping street in Santa Monica,"You literally don't have to leave the street... there is shopping: cheap-expensive, food: cheap-expensive, fro yo, ice cream, dry cleaners, make up, nail salons, hair salons, a movie theater playing older classics, grocery stores, bakeries, yoga/pilates studios, a library, a mail store, blow dry bars, massages, shoe repair, home/kitchen goods, pharmacy, a dermatologist (and of course plastic surgery)... plus more.",Whitney C
30,Ok if you have time to meander.,"Montana is a street in Santa Monica that runs from the ocean all the way to the Brentwood area of Santa Monica. But when people mention Montana they are usually talking about the 12 too 14 blocks in the middle approximately from 7th to 17th street. You will find the usual suspects, Starbucks, Menchies, Whole Foods etc. along with many one of a kind shops. Also some banks and real estate offices. There are also a good number of restaurants in various price ranges. Many of the shops are unique and I feel are owned by the wealthy so they can have something to do with their time. With the rents on Montana they can't possibly be making money selling things like dog collars.If you've run out of places to go take a walk up Montana. Weather is almost always good. You can also wander the side streets like I do and admire the multi million dollar homes. Or buy yourself a tear down for 3 million and build your own.",Morris K
50,Love Montana Ave!,"Another essential shopping fix for me when visiting Santa Monica... Along with 3rd St Promenade...I spotted a few celebs when last there as many Hollywood stars enjoy their local shopping on Montana.If you have a dog you must visit ""To Wag For""..

40,Relaxing and local,"I loved it that it is removed by quite a way from the Third Street Promenade. You could almost be in another world along this street in comparison. The street had a very local feel to it (unlike Third St Prom). There were lots of unique coffee shops and clothing boutiques that you do not see anywhere else. The fabulous John Kelly Chocolates whose only other chocolate store is in Hollywood, has a shop on Montana Avenue. These are the best chocolates in the world people. You must try them. There are some very high end places here, but also some more affordable ones as well. It is a good mix and moves at a much slower pace than Third St Promenade (thankfully).",Belgo96
30,Overhyped Spot,Montana Avenue is not as great as all the hype seems to built it up to be. I think the only real draw is potentially spotting a celebrity.,TheValleytoTheWorld

There are lots of independent boutiques as well as a few small local chains selling clothing, shoes, jewelry, and accessories, and a ton of great cafes and restaurants. Probably the best area to explore is between Lincoln and 18th Street (a ten block stretch), but you should first stop by Primo Passo at Montana and 7th for a great cup of coffee.",Ashley B

The Aero Theater on Montana hosts many international film series, as well. Montana runs parallel to Wilshire Boulevard. I like going for a long walk along Montana and doing window shopping. It gives a good feel of the surrounding neighborhood.",mermaidsylvia
50,Great small boutiques and restaurants...,Montana Avenue is one of my favorite streets for a walking tour in Santa Monica. The best boutique couture type and upscale shopping are located on this street. A nice selection of restaurants are close enough to give you several choices within walking distance of shopping. You can park on the side streets or many places have their own parking. Montana Avenue in Santa Monica runs from the beach to about 17th Street for a walking tour...the stores are great to find unique gifts for friends or just for yourself. Restaurants range from formal to very casual. Montana Avenue has a wonderful atmosphere. You may run into some celebrity faces that live locally...but please respect their privacy.,Akiko A
30,A few speciality shops,I walked here form the Fairmont Hotel. I bought a pair of ballet flats for a comfort shoes store that had some interesting shoes. I passed a speciality cheese shop. And another shop selling nice shoes from France and Spain that were pricier but nice,MrsWorldly
40,Good place for shopping and food,"Condos, home, restaurants, shopping make Montana an interesting street. One can also find parking on the street on streets perpendicular to Montana.",Dhanan
40,Fun food and Movie tars,"Go to R & D for a yummy, groovy time. No rez taken so just show up. Catch a cool retro film double feature and catch a director at the break at the Aero Theatre. Go to Father's Office for the best indulgent burger evr..but do not ask for substitutions as it only comes one way. Get a fresh juice at Kreation and keep your eyes open. There are stars allllll over.",HongKongTania
40,Street full of chic shops and lots of coffee places.,"Montana is very close to my home. So perhaps I am a little jaded and should give it a higher rating. If you like to shop in chic shops, perhaps site a celeb, sip coffee at one of the coffee places (there is one at almost every block) then you will enjoy it. The street used to be more 'mom and pop' and some chains like William and Sonoma and Kheils and Pinkberry have slipped in and that kind of ruins it for me. There are a couple of hi-lites for me. Food wise - Spumoni offers great Italian. The Aero Theatre (look it up) is a great local theatre that runs older movies and sometimes has a celeb connected with the movie give a talk. Very worthwhile. The Clock Shop owned by a lovely Greek man who can fix any watch or clock..old school ...is fantastic. Drugtown Pharmacy on 7th and Montana is like the kind of drugstore I grew up with...small, friendly, personal and all sorts of kitschy do-dads you can buy. That's about it. p.s. as mentioned it is highly caffeinated ...there are 2 Starbucks, a Coffee Bean, Peets, and a couple of other independent coffee places like Cafe Luxxe (good coffee) on this 10 block street and you can have your cake as well as there are several cake places too.",AFoolForTravel

40,Great little strip of shops,"It's a little out of the way from Third Street Promenade, but has a lot of quirky, funky and fun little shops as well as the usual big name shops. Lots of great restaurants and also Wholefoods. Worth the walk, so check it out!",goslats
30,Interesting,"Lots of different shops and displays. People friendly. It's worth a trip, particularly out to the Palisades next to the ocean.",Rob H
50,neighborhood stroll,"Montana Avenue has something to offer everyone. Starbucks, Peets and vasrious other coffee shops with nice patios for reading the paper, good restaurants for BL and D, shops in other than cookie cutter mode of Gap and other mall stores, many home oriented and antique stores but also pharmacy, hair salons and other brick and mortar establishments that a neighborhood needs. It's filled with baby strollers on a weekday and ladies who lunch and the weekend attracts shoppers and friends meeting for brunch. Has the feel of a small town main street",janieB1123
50,Star gazing in Santa Monica,"Not everything happens in Hollywood...Montana Avenue is great for shopping & some fine dinning. Strolling down towards the ocean on a sunny day is a great experience, very exhilarating while star gazing! Many great jewelry & clothing stores, antiques shops etc. There are also some fine restaurants and cafes to choose from...lunch or romantic dinner it's all here. Try Rosti, RD or Locanda Portofino.",PeterO709
50,Great for Star-Gazing,"People think that Hollywood and Beverly Hills are the places for star-gazing, but the fact is the only time celebrities go into Hollywood is for premiers and the Oscars and they don't shop in Beverly Hills - the Beverly Hills shops come to them. If you really want to see celebrities in their ""natural environment"" take a stroll down Montana Avenue in Santa Monica and sit for a while at one of the many great side-walk cafes.",Mysticyat
50,Beautiful people and beautiful homes in this neighborhood.,"Lots of shopping and restaurants on Montana, and if you walk through the neighborhood, you'll see gorgeous homes and gardens. A family oriented neighborhood that's always a pleasure to visit.",Barbara_Antle
40,History,"I probably would have enjoyed this more when my kids were young and could have gone on the beautiful merry-go-round and the ferris wheel. For my husband and I, it seemed a tad run-down; you kind of had to imagine how wonderful it must have been much earlier in its life.",C B

30,Shopping of the same ilk,"Montana ave in Santa Monica is fun. Good eating joints, people watching are two good points.Parking is poor and expensive. Limited meters with meter attendants waiting to give you a ticket. Shops that are mostly overpriced, that sell the same items. The turnover rate for these shops is mind boggling. How many clothing stores do you really need anyway?Like coffee? Every other block has one. Eateries have both trendy places and stand bys. That is a plus.Montana ave years ago was a heaven for neighborhood shopping. Now you may need to take out a small business loan to buy a shirt.",Frank G
40,Check It Out!,"If you are looking for upscale shopping and dining experience in a laid back quiet part of Santa Monica (like Rodeo Drive for the funky rich), then come stroll down Montana. Having lived nearby for 26 years, I spent many a peaceful day shopping, having lunch with friends or on my own, going to the Aero to see a movie, and enjoying the ambiance. For people who are star-struck and like to frequent places where you see celebrities, you'll find all the local celebs shop and dine along Montana where they can move about without paparazzi or autograph hounds. They are used to being left alone there, so demonstrative fawning or autograph hunting would be off-putting.In September I met a friend for lunch there and it's still the same great place. People are friendly and warm in the establishments and there's no cost to looking! Parking is tricky, and watch the parking meters...the ticket for an expired meter is a lot!",BritFrenchPol
40,Charming neighborhood,"This was a charming ""local"" neighborhood of stores and restaurants, and gave us a taste of the real Santa Monica.",Susan O
50,A nice street where you can eat and shop,"Yes the places here are a tad expensive but it is alot better than going to Melrose or Beverly Hills Rodeo Drive. There are little cafe's that have really go food to eat, and you are in the hot spot of everything around you. A grocery store down the way, restaurants to go eat places to shop that is all here at you doorstep. I recomend going to the 17th Street Cate and the Montana Cafe as excellent places to go, and if you are on a health kick there is Kreation where they have great pita's and humus there. Oh, and who could pass up Babalu where their food is always good, and Rosti for good italian food.",Christina R

40,"Laid Back, Neighborhood Vibe, In Need of More...","Montana is a great place to take a stroll. As far as shopping goes, there are a few high end boutiques, and some other mid-range ones, but nothing compared to third-street if you really want to shop. They really do need some more diverse stores...instead, they keep putting in stores like London Sole, which just sells ballet flats?? There is a nail salon on every block, if not two per block, dry cleaner every block, and random pharmacies. What is missing is a good lounge, wine bar, cocktail bar, cheaper/trendy restaurants. There is R&D Kitchen which is delicious, but pretty pricey. It is the only place on Montana you can get a cocktail. The only bar is Fathers Office, but they only have beer/wine. People are definitely drawn to Montana Ave because of the neighborhoody, low-key feel, but the quality of stores and eateries really needs to improve I think!",jsipe
40,"Great Walking, Shopping","Trendy boutique shops and some fun sidewalk restaurants along the avenue, make it a fun place to walk for a few hours. Check it out. It is a pleasant shopping experience, unique stores, many pricey.",whocareswhoiam
40,Shopping and dining,"Montana Ave is a 10-block stretch of shopping and dining with everything from designer boutiques to cheaper, trendy shops. You can stay for happy hour at Father's Office or R&D Kitchen, or have lunch at Cafe Montana or Blue Plate. There is practically a yogurt shop on every corner. Many of the shops focus around kids and babies, but there are plenty of places for non-stroller-moms, too. Planet Blue has pricey but amazing finds.",Ktschmatey
50,Quiter vibe...,"Definitely more exclusive, but there were a few nice boutique like clothing shops that were affordable. There's a Whole Foods Market on 14th & Montana, & one block up is a very affordable restaurant the Blue Plate. The Blue Plate is small, but offers a variety on the menu at very reasonable prices. Their fries are the best!",Gypsy O
40,Posh but laid back,"Montana Avenue is definitely the poshest area of Santa Monica, with high-end independent boutiques and pricy coffee shops and restaurants, but it has a certain kind of Californian charm to it that makes it rather delightful for a stroll during the day. If you're looking for night life, Montana is not the best place for it, but it has a few restaurants that are open until 11 pm. If you're into movies, one of LA's historic movie theaters, Aero Theater, is on Montana and you can find some of the best older movies screened there.",Bitil
40,Great shopping,This is centrally located in Santa Monica. Not your generic shops. Something for everybody and close parking that is reasonable. Don't do street parking in Santa Monica. They are notorious for weird tickets.,SweetnDandy

30,Trendy No More,"This used to be Santa Monica's version of Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. When the economy took a hit, a lot of the merchants closed their shops. What is left is a smattering of cafes, bakeries, clothing boutiques and store fronts with ""for rent"" signs..",cuppajoe2

Beautiful palm tree and pine tree lined streets, gorgeous landscaping and gorgeous estates. Fantastic shopping and dining is between 7th and 17th, so park and walk.

40,A Woman's Afternoon Delight,Montana is known for shopping. It consists of walking up and down approximately 10 blocks of primarily women's apparel and small bistros. There are also a few children's shops and furniture/antique stores. It makes for a pleasant way to spend an afternoon if you are in Santa Monica and have an extra day.,savvytravelers2
40,Home away from home,"Visited Montana Avenue after reading tripadvisor reviews. We walked from Hotel Shangri-La on our first morning. Found the best coffee we'd had during our 3 weeks in America at Pete's Tea and Coffee. Loads of shops from home furnishings to original jewellery. Can't tell you how many laundry and dry cleaning services we saw in this street! Crossing over Montana Ave are beautiful wide tree lined streets mostly numbered. The next day we drove along Montana Ave which took us through the fabulous suburb of Brentwood, home to several notable actors.",RaineandAl
40,Nice but Expensive Shopping Street,"Montana Avenue is a street within a beautiful residential area in Santa Monica with small shops and cafes. It runs between Ocean Avenue and 26th Street although most of the pedestrian traffic is between Ocean Ave. and 20th Street. Fun place to walk, have ice cream, coffee or a snack. The restaurants and shops are expensive. There is parking along the streets and at meters.",alanmhersh
50,Nice shops. Good eateries. Chance at celebrity watching,"There's a lot on this street. Among the nice shops is a wonderful toy store with Dr. Seuss lithos, and other famous children's author's art on the wall. The best burger in the LA area is found at Father's Office near the intersection with 11th Street. The Aero Theater by 14th often shows classic movies introduced by people involved in the making of the film. ...and there's the possibility of bumping into a face you think you recognize from that movie you saw recently as you buy a coffee or pinkberry to fuel your afternoon or evening. If you have the time to relax and just enjoy a nice day in Santa Monica, this is one of the best venues for that.",RangerBobN

Pretty dog friendly too.",FlyersFanInLA
40,Fun Shops and Restauants,"Nice upscale expensive shops and restaurants. I like this area and find that the most unique higher end stores in the LA area tend to locate here becasuse of the high net worth of the local Santa Monica, Brentwood, Pacific Palisades population. While 3rd Street is dominated by the big corporate stores (Gap, BR, LV, Nike,etc) and Main Street with its slightly lower brow operations Montana's operations have the edgyness of Melrose Ave. combined with a higher end presentation of Rodeo Dr. It's also a great place to people watch the locals of Santa Monica and West LA.",PVGreg
