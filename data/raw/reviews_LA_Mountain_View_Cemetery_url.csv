30,Odd,"I find it odd to see an American cemetery on a list of attractions. It's just an ordinary cemetery, of interest only if you have loved ones buried here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
30,Got to pass it every day,"I live not too far away from it, so got to pass it on my way home, almost everyday, went there a few times for viewing of a body, was very ambient, the Cemetary itself is very nice and well kept, hope I can be buried there someday",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bellizeanlady
40,Hisorical site,"Within these grounds lie the remains of the history of Altadena, a site of multiple filimings of movies and TV as it and its mausoleum can pass for many places. I contains above ground monuments, large trees and Mt. Wilson as a backdrop.Ghost tours every year.Headstones tell the history of Altadena.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesv8
50,History and theater in a stunning setting,"Well, I haven't been buried there, though I once did sit down to make pre-arrangements. For the community of Altadena, Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum is almost like a local park. (I have heard of people whose parents taught them to drive on the streets that run through the cemetery.) The cemetery has been owned and operated by the historic Giddings family and descendants since it was opened in 1883. It is open every day for visitors to stroll among the tombstones that mark the resting places of Civil War veterans (mostly Union, but some Confederates as well), as well as notables and just plain folks. The pioneer of aerial surveillance, Civil War balloonist Thaddeus Lowe, is interred alongside his wife.Mountain View offers works with performers throughout the year to utilize the facilities for productions. On Memorial Day, reenactors take folks through the Civil War section and further, to some of the first graves, and standing by the Lowe tombstone, bring the family back to life. WickedLit from Unbound Productions mounts a trio of plays there every autumn, using the cavernous mausoleum and grounds to present tales of terror and horror.Whether one goes to make arrangements, enjoy the scenery and the vista of the San Gabriel Mountains (including Mt. Lowe), or attend an event, it is a lovely place to spend some time in Altadena.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spinymountain
50,A slice of history,I always like cemeteries. I live near by a take a drive through this old cemetery once a month. There is a feeling of history and tranquility. There are some great old monuments.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mtd330
40,Well cared for,"The trees and the overall setting of this peaceful cemetery couldn't be better. I like that it has some turn of the century (last century) stones that are interesting, and it also has the stones of the founders of Altadena, the Woodbury brothers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caity008
40,Can you rate a Cemetery? I think this one stands out from most...,"Mountain view is a cemetery so beautiful that most location scouts for Television and Motion pictures have it at the top of their list. That's unusual in itself. At least 1 out of every 3 days has some production going on inside its mausoleums or outside in the lush and tree rich exterior locations. Some favorite shows that have been here recently, CSI and Sons Of Anarchy.History is rich here as well and is the true attraction of the cemetery. Many local civil war veterans and early Altadenans and Pasadenans are buried here. An annual ceremony of historical stories told by actors in character is a highlight of the year. Actors will present the personal stories of Civil War-era personalities now interred in Southern California graveyards, including T.S.C. Lowe, aeronaut, inventor, and entrepreneur who helped Lincoln win the Civil War; Biddy Mason, a slave who was freed in the California courts, becoming one of the wealthiest women in LA County; Ruth Brown Thompson, daughter of John Brown; and others. Yes...John Brown of pre-Civil War fame who has a mountain above Altadena in his name, Brown Mountain. Besides the lush grass and multitude of mature trees, it also has an art collection, two chapels, and two mausoleums.One interesting note is that there are many fascinating headstones...and the most interesting ones look like WOOD and logs and stumps. They are cement and signify that the deceased was a WOOODMAN OF THE WORLD...an interesting fraternal-insurance group that had a strong presence in Altadena. It is still a strong insurance group in the Midwest. The distintive headstones are one enduring physical legacy of the organization.This was an early benefit of Woodmen of the World membership. This program was abandoned in the 1920's for cost reasons.Either way there is a lot to see and the grounds are beautiful in our foothill hamletof Altadena.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CayeBoy
50,Historic resting place,"The cemetery grounds are themselves well worth visiting, so many beautiful memorials and markers. For me, it was the mausoleum buildings that drew my attention. The beauty of each of them is astounding, and the workmanship and artistic beauty are wonderful.The Pasadena Mausoleum is a family favorite, and the stained glass on so many walls and parts of the ceiling are excellent, the design a tribute to nature, the coloration beautiful.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/335williamm
