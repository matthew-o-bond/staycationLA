50,The Coolest,"I love this hotel. Rooms are small and old, but I have never seen a better staffed hotel. The staff goes so far above and beyond, you would swear they were set up by your very best friend. The food and restaurants are very pretty and a great place to people watch. Great history in the hotel too.",Pennie727
50,One of the Great Hotels on Sunset,This is a great Hotel with great rooms and Suites. They have a terrific great room for drinks and one of the best restaurants in town. The restaurant food is inventive and very good along with a very good wine list. This is a great place to stay. Valet parking is a little slow but worth it.,love2skiLosAngeles
40,Old School LA (baby!),"Set upon hill this establishment thinks a lot of itself. It has a history of accommodating Hollywood's elite and is not ashamed of it. An eclectic mixture of Cannes chic and granny's attic - it has a very European, old money feel to it. We were welcomed warmly for drinks on the terrace and enjoyed an hour or so of people watching in a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere. The food is not bad and the price is reasonable. Its a lovely, Grand Dame sort of affair but don't be intimidated - it's bark is worse than it's bite....",Vinca123London
50,European Homey Elegance,"Each room is unique. Nothing matches. Everything feels like it has a story to tell. Legendary in terms of old Hollywood chic, and dripping A-Listers coming to hang out, the Chateau Marmont is a quirky elite hotel for those who want a place that feels more like (a very nice) home than a luxe hotel.The restaurant stresses local produce, strong preparation and elegant service. It is French-leaning classic cuisine, but with a strong overlay of California fruit/vegetable/fish. The room service menu mirrors the restaurant, and the slightly more laidback pool service is delicious.And that pool is an incredible place to spend time. Smallish, the chaise. lounges and small sofas suggest languishing while waiting for the big deal to come through. Indulgence is encouraged; the frose alone is worth the afternoon lost,For those who can afford the Cabanas, they are the best of the California Joan Didion celebrated in THE WHITE ALBUM. White washed, shabby chic, full of light, they sprawl and ramble -- and foment creativity without being obvious.Yes, the bar scene is terrific. The living room off the check-in area is equal parts Morocco, your rich grandparents' home and Keith Richards' '70s aesthetics. With a staff who aims to help, it's worth the splurge.",LadyGoodman615
10,The worst,Visited the famous Chateau for a drink only to be told upon arrival (after making a reservation) that they had an event and we wouldn’t be able to enter. Typical LA vibe (too cool for school) and the hotel staff is extremely snobby and rude. Skip entirely.,nikiroo29
30,Awesome New Years Eve,"We had a large one bedroom apartment in the tower and a decent view of fireworks in the distance from the small terrace/balcony. Although large, the apartment was quite shabby - Just shabby - not “shabby chic” as I had anticipated. The experience however was low key relaxing and beautiful for our group of friends. The proces are high already, especially for the poor condition, however, if they updated them I’m sure the property would be completely out of reach for our level travelers!",Michael K

50,Agréable moment,"This is the second time we have been there and we had a great time. the setting is great, the staff helpful and discreet. we have however regretted the dress of some, shorts, flip flops, ...... it is a pity that some people have no respect for this place. what is even more damaging is that the staff let anyone in.",fabrice l

50,A classic and rightly so!,"I just dropped in for a drink or two at 11pm on a Friday night. The bar was full of wasted types, just as expected. It felt like stepping back in time to the excesses of the 70s. Two whisky sours later (at 20 dollars a piece) I left The Chateau a happy man,",swedensm
50,Great lunch in the restaurant,"Not a family restaurant in the traditional sense but I wanted to eat there so braved it with the children. The most lovely spot for a lunch under the umbrellas on a hot summer day. It’s not cheap but certainly not as crazy as some hotel restaurants, and frankly we thought it was worth it. Our waiter couldn’t have been more charming and the food was lovely. Coffee was best we’ve had so far in LA. Loved it all. Will be back next time we’re in LA on our own for dinner!",kate d
50,Amazing Atmosphere,My favorite hotel in the LA area. I always stay here because I feel like I am at home. Very relaxing place.,fiasco001
30,Pretty good but not great,"We stayed in a cottage for four nights. I’ll start with the good. It’s a quaint, historic hotel that is reasonably well maintained. The valet was friendly, the front desk staff helpful and the cleaning staff did a very good job. The food was good and we had some good service and some mediocre service.The cottages are quaint, clean and charming. But they do lack some of the finishing touches/ updates you would expect in this price range. The pool is small but nice and it feels like an oasis steps from the bustle of Hollywood and the strip.The not so good. On our fourth night we were challenged, yes I do mean challenged, as our Uber dropped us off and we headed to our room if we should be there. I woke up each morning to at least one person sleeping on a lounge by the pool with beer bottles/ glasses and cigarettes strewn about them. During one afternoon I watched a guy smoking pot at the bar, then chain smoke cigarettes and get wasted strip down to his underwear and lounge poolside for hours.I get that’s part of the deal with this hotel but seriously the management needs to have some standards. Underwear at the pool, drunks sleeping on lounge chairs, cig butts all over the pool deck. I don’t care if people smoke pot or get drunk but it was border line out of control and the pool bartender told me it was mellow compared to the usual.Overall a cool place, great location and a lot of history. It was worth staying for the experience but I doubt we would stay there again.",Chris Z
50,A must for lunch in Hollywood,"I adore this place, such a gorgeous, peaceful setting in addition to being a historic location. Recently had meal here and loved the meatball appetizer as a main dish when not super hungry. Lovely rose wine on hand, will always return here when in Hollywood.",EasternTraveler1921

50,Perfection,Huge suites in a legendary place. Perfumes of orange trees and jasmine. Best pool of Hollywood. Adorable people at Front desk and at Restaurants.,teocauro
40,Yes and No...,"This is obviously a place that is great to stay, however they will need to rely on keeping up world class service and not rely on their name and history. That said I have stayed in the penthouse and in the bungalows, I would prefer the Bungalows!",JohnFallonstudio
50,International Class,"International tourists and great celebs watching - expensive and great lunch. It is not a luxury hotel, but the charme wins your heart and wallet. If you can not get a room - book lunch weeks in advance",Christian G
30,Very slow waitress,"We thought we would stop by here and have couple drinks. Our waitress was very slow and didn't have much of a personality.Had the same experience at SUR so wondering if it is a California thing. No attempt at any small chat like ""Where are you from""""Are you enjoying your stay here in California?"" I have traveled a lot and ate/drank at many nice places and was very surprised at the lack of good service at both these places.",Tahoeguy0

40,A Place to Run Into Celebs in LA,"Nearly all the tourists visit LA always ask the same question- where should I go to see celebrities?... honestly, everywhere! They could be in the hole in the wall bar for a bear, or a chic restaurant for a romantic dinner.. BUT, if you really determined to enjoy brunch or dinner and see an A-lister actor you are in luck, make a reservation for Chateau Marmont Restaurant, you have high chance of run into one, two of many of them on a good night (later is better, both for brunch or dinner)The restaurant is like an oasis in the center of the busy Sunset Blvd., the outdoor area is the place to be, it is a castle garden, surrounded by the trees, drapes, and the view of the beautiful castle wall, you will feel like you are travel back in time to Europe in the 1800's, minus the hollywood pretty people.Food is ok, service is so so, then again, you are not there specifically for food right? You are there to experience the old Hollywood, the amazing ambiance, the possibility to rub shoulders with celebrities. A great place for romantic dinners for the couples, also excellent place for friends get together to celebrate and have fun!Remember three things:- Reservation is a must- No photos are allowed- Valet is recommended (get validated for reduced fee), you may just be chatting with Elton John, and get your parking paid by Sacha Baron Cohen, celebrities are just like us ;)",SheenaGao
30,Bungalows,"Stayed in the bungalows as a more chic and mature option to a weekend in Vegas :)Hotel is cool and attracts a stellar crowd to be sure. But it's just plain tired. At times feels like you're stumbling around grandmas house, save the beautiful people stumbling with you. It will always be the chateau, but $ for $, there are many properties in LA that surpass this one (Beverly Hills, Bel-air, Montage, Waldorf, etc.).",TheEpicureanBachelor
50,Just like the movies!,Loved the entire experience. Went with couple of friends. Feels like a dream! Must go once in your life to experience Hollywood in it's core!,kaiaschroder88
40,Great setting average service,We visited the Chareau for breakfast which was served in the beautiful courtyard garden . The food and choice were good - however it is totally let down by the service . We had to ask to order after sitting at our table for ages and then had to remind them to bring forgotten drinks and side orders . Nice experience but not worth the effort until the service picks up .,Squirrelsfam
40,Bar and Restaurant Review,"There is only valet parking and it is difficult to get into the place. The bar is tiny, the drinks are good. The restaurant was outdoors and very pretty. It was a Friday night and very crowded - mostly gorgeous 20 and 30 year olds. Very expensive, but it's a vacation. It is a very old and iconic hotel. I checked it off my bucket list.",Kabear
40,Lovely lunch on the patio,"We had a lovely lunch on the patio on Friday afternoon. The hotel did not disappoint, it was as i imagined, old school glamour. The food was surprisingly good, i had the chicken paillard and my husband had a salad. We got truffle fries to share which was a great idea, they were delicious.I struggled with what to wear as i had seen reviews saying people got turned away for being too casual but there were people there in shorts & t shirts. The woman were more smartly dressed in dresses or jeans.I would recommend to someone visiting the city and wants to do something a bit fancy.",emmaroback89
10,Underwhelmed,Hired a taxi expressly to visit the legendary Chateau Marmont only to be told that it was closed for refurbishment.A simple notice on the website would have saved me a wasted journey and a taxi bill.,chilli_bom_bom
40,Delightful lunch,I met an old friend at the Château for lunch and we had a delightful time catching up in the garden. I had the classic sole and my friend had a steak salad. Both were cooked perfectly. We then moved into the library for dessert. I had raspberries Pavlova and she had a lava cake. Wow.The ambience was a world apart from the busy Hollywood streets outside. It could easily have been the Hollywood of a bygone era.,Heather H
50,Visited for lunch,"Booked a table last minute to sit outside in the beautiful garden restaurant. Had a delicious salad, as well as a shared meze with humous and pita(pretty sure we were the only people in LA eating bread!), and calamari. Anne Hathaway was sitting 3 tables away! A lovely treat before heading back to London.",Dianne S
50,Great place to get away.,"I love going to Chateau Marmont because it feels like I'm getting away although it is just steps to Sunset and close proximity to Beverly Hills.The food is great, the service can be slow which leads to an absorbent parking charge so be careful.",Catherine B
50,Great for cocktails,This review is for the bar and restaurant. Great swanky place to have dinner or evening cocktails. Definitely a great place to dress up and experience (a higher end) la nightlife.,Jyrock
50,"Euro Hot, Fun and Friendly, as close as the Sunset Plaza area","Well, the whole Sunset Plaza area is Internationally Cool, for the Beautiful people who live there and for those who visit- but just down the Street is a Hotel, a Restaurant and THE Bar for Hip, Hot Beautiful People, Why Not? the traveling Beautiful Bodies of the Entertainment and Sport World need a place to call home, avoid the Crowds and enjoy a Fabulous setting of a Mediterranean like Gardens and the romantic feeling of making New friends-",JBjeffreyl
30,Good people watching place,"The infamous Chateau Marmont, where John Belushi died, is one of those places you feel you need to try once in your lifetime. Parking is a big issue there and they a very restrictive about letting anyone on the property unless you are a hotel guest or have restaurant reservations. Lots of celebrities to see at this place. When I went I saw Lady Gaga - from afar. They definitely segregate between Hollywood types and the riff raff. Menu choices were limited and service just ok. It's now off my bucket list and I don't feel the need to return.",sdgamer
50,Great lunch,"I called ahead and made reservations for lunch 1 week in advance, but upon arrival they said I had no reservation for lunch, but that it would not be a problem. Thankfully it was a quiet day..The food is good, but expensive.Go for the ambiance and the feel of Hollywood glamour!",TravelT
50,fab old hollywood,Very classy with sightings of many stars. An elegance rarely found nowadays. Excellent food & superb drinks complement the décor. The crowd is upscale high end.,playwright150
50,Great food!,This is a great interesting place to go for food and drinks - I would definitely recommend it if you're visiting Los Angeles. The staff were all very nice and welcoming. Thumbs up.,Adzzy
50,The only hotel in LA,"This place is so on-point for me it's difficult to be objective. But I'll try. Impeccable service, charming rooms - to be clear by that I mean they are idiosyncratic in that they are older but very cool - i love the garden and pool, the common rooms and just about everything else. The one creepy thing is the gym, but why are you going to the gym when there's Griffith Park, the beach, and everything else to do.",mattmurphy18
50,amazing iconic spot,"I didn't stay here, but did go for breakfast and it was amazing. Such a gorgeous old Hollywood icon. The food is expensive, but you're really paying just to be at the most famous hotel in hollywood. Would definitely recommend checking it out!",OnAir27158580247
50,Great place to see stars,"Love the decor, bar and restaurant of this legendary property where John Belushi od-ed on drugs. Great spot to lunch with pals.",Pattithediva P
40,Sleep like a star,"I love the mid-century feel of the Chateau. Most middle-priced rooms are equipped with a 1950s fridge and a kitchen that make you feel at home. The windows might be squeaky, you are in place that has its own strong identity, truly unique in the world. Order those truffle fries and oysters from room service and watch your favorite movie as you dream of going to the Academy Awards.",Emmanuelle L
50,A Hollywood Classic,"One of the most classy and prestigious hotels in Los Angeles, the history alone of this hotel is worth a visit. The hotel rooms vary, and offer bungalows above the pool area. Be sure to have a reservation for dinner, as they are always full or have special tables reserved for celebrities and high clientele.",Sean M
30,Historic and worth a cocktail,We stopped here for a cocktail in their lounge area late afternoon. Absolutely stunning but we moved 3 times from the seating area along the walls as there was a very cold and uncomfortable draught of air coming through the floor air vents.Lovely quirky spot to say you've been to but thats all.Service was slow to begin with but became efficient when we started spending money. We didn't stay long but would definitely return for a beverage in the future.,Andyoz
40,Beautiful Place,"Visited the restaurant for breakfast. Place was completely empty at 10 am but then again just by the outside you know this is ""live styles of the rich and famous"" (which I am not). High-end cars in the valet, you really feel rich the minute you get out of your rental car! Hotel lobby is absolutely stunning. You get transported to an old fashioned, marilyn monroeish era. Jazz is playing from a record player none the less and yes, some of the records are scratched, but we got a kick out of that one. You can sit indoors where they have couches and coffee tables, rather uncomfortable to eat at or you can sit in their garden. We chose garden after sitting indoors for a little bit. The garden is beautiful, quite and relaxing. We were the only ones there, but it was fine for me. I ordered the yogurt and granola, my coworker the avocado tartine and the other coworker the eggs benedict. While the food was good it was really nothing to write home about. They no longer have the french toast on the menu which was a bummer, but I survived. Be ready to pay because it is expensive. Not sure if valet is validated while dining at the restaurant as I didn't pay for it but do check so you have no surprises. Worth visiting just to see the place. Heard many celebrities go there, if you're into that, then be on the look out.",made1024
40,Old Hollywood Charm,"We come here for events or for brunch once or twice a year. Each time, I'm torn between loving the old Hollywood charm, and thinking it needs a major facelift. For now, the charm wins the debate.Minor item: waiters need lessons on opening old wines. I ordered an older Bordeaux, and the waiter muscularly snapped the cork. Before I could stop him, he dashed off to get another bottle, apologizing for the ""bad bottle."" Then he did it again. This time I stopped him before he could take it away, and got the cork out fine myself. I hope he enjoyed the $500 ""bad bottle"" of wine that he'd whisked away, rather than just tossing the lovely wine in the trash. Anyway, a lesson in old corks would improve the profit margins. :-)",LoveLuxTravel
50,Highly suggested,This location is to beautiful to pass up located right off of sunset across the street from the worlds best bank (Chase) you have a French hotel that caters to every possible thing you can imagine. Bar and dinning are located downstairs and the staff is awesome. The rooms are clean and beautifulGreat job Chateau Marmount,Peter M
40,GREAT ATMOSPHERE,"We were a group of 5. We ate outside I had spaghetti in a bolognese sauce it was good! Service was good, not overly friendly wait staff but nothing to complain about. After dinner we sat inside and listened to a piano player very relaxing.. A little Pricey but I was aware of the Prices before I went. They only make reservations for regular people for 6:30 it seems unless you are famous!! Lol",Lynn C
40,Charming and Quiet Stay,"We loved The Chateau. The rooms are lovely and large, plenty of room to spread out to relax, get work done, and/or party. Our room facing the hillside was quiet. The staff were all very pleasant and we wanted for nothing. Food in the restaurant is yummy. Loved the 24-hour pool life. Could take a trip here and disappear for a few weeks easily. Very convenient to everything. Will be hard to stay anywhere else when in LA.",MonkeyintheSky
40,I get it but I don't ....,"I have known of and stayed here recently along with friends, and I still don't see the real appeal of th place. Old Hollywood maybe, rooms where folks died, a restaurant that's over priced and full of people who think they are beautiful, even when they aren't.",AARDVARKKILLER
30,The beauty was lost on me.,I feel this hotel is living on ancient history of greatness. Not today. I went because I love the old history of Hollywood and was most anxious to view this hotel. A great disappointment. The staff is something much less than friendly. Actually bordered on rude and nasty. It appears they literally have not changed one stick of furniture since its inception. Overpriced and overrated. It is like visiting a museum with rude staff.,Flhappy
40,Great Atmosphere,"A treat for anyone looking for classic interior and the old Hollywood feel. Staff was very friendly. We had dinner and cocktails in the lounge with the piano bar. The atmosphere is really something to behold the food was good, not outstanding but good. Fun people watching, cozy and romantic. It's a full sensory experience. We were going to dine in the bar but it was not open on Monday or Tuesday's. We were lucky to get a table indoors. Larvae comfortable chairs and small bar/living room type tables made it cozier.",Vivsmom
50,Still the Place on Sunset !!!,For many years this hotel has been my Sunset's favorite hotel. Pricy but worth it. You will always will run in to a celebrity at the happening restaurant and bar.,AlbertoMay
40,Have your next bender at this funky hotel wth a fun indoor and outdoor bar,"This was where we decided to stay for our one night in LA before we headed south to Laguna. We stayed on a Weds night, which the bartender told us was the second least busiest night next to Tuesday. We got upgraded to a nice suite, granted it still had some gross brown carpet and older rugs. The bathroom was small and old school, and the kitchen was cute and old fashioned. I think that is part of the charm, and personally I loved it but the wife didn't expect it. The bed was fantastic, the service excellent. The pool was smaller but super fun. This whole place is built around being quite, exclusive...not swarming with hotel attendants asking you if you need something, etc....but more ""available"" to assist if you need it. Otherwise they leave you alone. The hotel mini bar, by the way, is the best ever. I could barely resist.We did hit the inside bar where I had the most fantastic manhattan ever...granted it was with Booker's Rye, which until the day after, did I learn it was very rare and impossible to find..and $40 a shot.Everyone else seemed to go to the outdoor patio bar/lounge, which was a lot of fun, busy and the place to be.",Jmdidday
40,Dinner for 2.,"We booked this 2 weeks in advance and got a nice table outside, although earlier than our preferred time as they reserve most of it for guests which is fair enough! We just had a main course as we'd had a rather indulgent day of food anyway. It's was nice without been top class which was a little disappointing given the stature of the location. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. It's a nice experience sitting in their patio and worth a visit.",An0nymou5
50,other worldly,Chateau was built to suit new yorker taste and not feel like LA. Those feelings prevail today. When you walk up the driveway you feel like you have entered another world. It's simply magical. The food and drinks are not bad either. A bottle of champagne at the chateau with friends is one of the best evenings you can have.,RachelAMullins
50,Great Old Hollywood spot for a cocktail,"One of my favorite places in Hollywood to grab a drink and sit in the outdoor patio and perhaps do some celebrity watching. Great staff, wonderful food and beverage selections",CutterInChicago
40,Great spot on the strip,"Nothing on the strip is cheap but this place is very laid back and slightly set back from the strip which gives it a more casual feeling. I mean your walking distance from Beverly Hills so you know it can't be cheap. But walking distance from the Ranbow bar and grill, the Roxy, and the Whiskey a go go. Anot far on Santa Monica is my favorite music venue the Troubadore",Tramachef
40,Good But,"A great atmosphere to start with. You will be wowed by the reception, the experience, and the expectation. Reservation in advance is a must as it is almost impossible to take walk in. Value priced although not cheap. The food is amazing as they seem to have low variety however great food preparation. The only problem is the lack of training for their staff or their staff cannot handle pressure. You would expect to meet more pampering as well as more accommodating staff which wasn't the case during our visit. Other than that, a great place to try.",Isakka

As we left, we asked if we could see further and were treated to an interesting tour of the hotel. A wonderful afternoon all round.",Pam D
20,Castles in the air,When you hear the words chateau marmont decadence splendour and excitement spring to mind. Hence a breakfast was moved from the unspectacular sunset tower to said chateau for experiential voyeurism. What a disappointment.

Food good staff competent but far from cool,Victoria M
40,Hollywood!!,We had a birthday lunch here and really enjoyed it. It has a real old world Hollywood charm and I expected to see a starlet slink past! The food was good frankly had better and it ain't cheep but I just loved the whole atmosphere. Suggest booking a table in advance or going out of meal times but then it's not busy. Recommend ...PS no photos allowed (for privacy of big stars!!),Jill M

50,Great cocktails and a piece of Hollywood history,"We went to the bar at the Chateau Marmont on Sunset Boulevard for some cocktails to celebrate our final night in LA before flying home the next day. We were greeted very warmly and enthusiastically at the door and shown to a table. The server came by almost straight away so we didn't have to wait long at all. She was very chatty and helped us to choose our drinks by making some great suggestions based on the flavours and ingredients that we said we liked. We had a few cocktails, and while they were perhaps more expensive than some of the other bars we'd been to, we couldn't complain, because the bar was great, it had a really cool atmosphere and the drinks were amazing. It's also a bit of a celebrity hotspot, so you may well see some well-known faces like we did...but there is no snooty or snobby atmosphere as all. Very relaxed, very trendy and very good drinks! It was the perfect way to end our stay in LA.",AbbyOlivia

We were not acknowledged for some 5 mins then shown to the lounge , took at least 15 mins for our order to be taken . Only 4 of us but the server only managed 2 drinks to be presented and then a further 10 mins before the other 2 arrived - no coasters ! And these were all standard drinks. Did mention to our server that we were disappointed but all we got was a perfunctory response . Really not good enough and spoilt the start to the evening.",barbs338

50,An acquired taste but up our street,Let me start by saying that Chateau Marmont is a bit marmite. I imagine that there is quite a strict door policy. The hotel is of a certain era and there is a bit of a secretive vibe to it. The decor is quite dark and grand which I think is the way its meant to be.We ate dinner here. The steaks were good and service pretty decent if a little surly (which is fine in my book). We retired to the bar area for some after meal drinks before hitting the Saddle Ranch. All in all a very good night. It is worth a visit anytime if only to tick it off the list.,wilsonandmurphy
40,"The Cafe is excellent! But beware of ""Actorish"" Servers, LOL!","Didn't stay at the hotel, but the cafe for lunch was great. Some pretty good vegan food selections, nothing special, but the atmosphere is what really sells it! The decor is phenomenal and ritzy cool, this is a top celebrity hangout!Our waiter as too good looking for his own good, and he knew it, that was the only disappointment. Poor listening skills and an attitude of ""I'm really actually an actor"".But I'd like to come back and visit again, their excellent reupation precedes them!",Joy_Villa
50,Amazing Hotel,"My wife and I have visited this hotel numerous times, and we always stop there when we are in West Hollywood, the food, atmosphere and history is amazing.",Don B
50,Not what you would think from the hype....,"...and that is a good thing as celebrities have graced the classic hotel for decades and one might think it is ultra-trendy, full of attitude type of place and it is not. Completely professional with a non-stuffy sense of themselves who are there to please their guests. Place is so comfortable as we had a apt size suite with dining room, etc but I think any room would have been nice. This place is not cheap so be prepared as rates are quite high and cocktails are $20 and up. Dining is lovely but they tend to make the dinner main dishes too muddy (Rack of Lamb is cubed and coated with a messy sauce. They should maintain the character of the pristine ingredients. Simpler is almost always better. Wine Somm lady is terrific and drinks well made. Lots of discretion here overall at the hotel as you can go straight to your room without almost anyone seeing you....guess that is important for some folks!",DineAboutWorld
40,Gotta see it,"Must pop in for a drink you never know what celebs you may see very popular with rich and famous , must warn you drinks are VERY expensive , John blush I died here and the doors used to virtually live here at one time Jim Morrison nearly fell off the roof and they used this excact location for the movie with cal Kilmer",Marilyn B
30,OVERRATED,"The hotel is very well kept from the 1920s. Rooms are small but nice. Outdoor dining area is great for cocktails and the drinks are superb. The staff.... They are always busy and don't make you feel welcome, unless you are a celebrity. If you're going there for celebrity-spotting, you just might get lucky but not always. Is it worth your money and time? Definitely not.",SedaEg
50,"great attention to detail, fabulous vibe","OK, I will admit that I went to see the stars. What I got was an immaculately maintained hotel from the 1920s. Great location. Great outdoor dining. Great bar. Movie stars, maybe, but I really wasn't looking. Immersed in my own experience. Very private saltwater swimming pool open all night. Splurge!",babsorama6688
40,Lovely spot to star spot!,"I came to the Chateau Marmont for the first time this year, expecting something a bit more ostentatious. I was very impressed with the understated glamour of this place - the courtyard is just lovely for cocktails, outdoor dinners and meetings.",David J
20,A bit of a disappointment,"I visited this restaurant with a group of friends and we were all pretty excited to be eating at this famous restaurant. Despite there being 7 of us we were given a very small table (would sit 4 comfortably) that had wobbly legs (not good for balancing martinis and champagne flutes on!) Our waiter was slow and not very friendly, he seemed distracted. Two of us asked about the portion sizes and if they were suitable as a main meal and were told they were but when the food came the dishes were tiny! I am not a big eater and am a size 4 so if I thought it was small then a man would consider it a small appy! Overall the service was slow and there was an air of stuffiness, we were not made to feel welcome at all and almost felt we were inconveniencing the staff when asking for anything. We were all disappointed, felt the food and drinks were overpriced and would not go back again. If looking for a good restaurant that is reasonable in price, has excellent food and great staff, I would recommend SUR.",Kitty71Canada
40,Cool 1920's Hollywood glamour,"We had a late night dinner at Chateau Marmot and as you would expect the atmosphere was cool, glamorous and intimate. A wonderful night of fabulous food, star spotting and feeling like you had been transported back in time to the golden era of Hollywood.",Dina M
50,The best hotel in the world,"Staying at the Chateau is a pure adventure. The hotel is perfect in all aspects. It has an timeless atmosphere, very historical yet very much in the now. The staff is excellent and service is top notch. I know some visitors react negatively about the rooms having sort of an vintage interior, but thats one of the reasons why the hotel is so great.",Joachim B
50,A real treat,Called in for glass of bubbles on our girls week trip to California and it was just as imagined. From valet parking to service it was all a real treat and completed with the utmost professionalism. Our waitress was not terrible friendly and took an age to attend us and was icy cool. Thankfully our drinks were bought by another who has lovely. It was a quiet Wednesday late- afternoon there so it's not a s if they had a lot to do. Perhaps they made up for it by directing Anne Hathaway to the table right next to us. If you can't afford to stay here then treat yourself to a drink. It really is a remarkable hotel and well worth the visit.,DCBAuckland

30,Not sure I'd go back,"This restaurant was a little underwhelming. The decor and service was lovely, we enjoyed our Charcuterie platter but the mains were a bit bland; we had the risotto and the chicken. Tea was lovely but didn't bother with dessert.",Sandeei
30,Pink ~expensive~ champagne on ice,"Went for brunch because we wanted to check out the scene. Ordered 2 mimosas without seeing any prices - $38 for the pair. Oops. I asked the server if the bagels were made with eggs (I have an allergy) and from his reaction you might have thought I had asked him if the moon were made of cheese. He said ""in the twenty years he has worked there no one has asked such a thing and how could he possibly know that"". Oops. It was worth going only to see Hotel California, the history, etc.",Emily M
30,Not Worth the Money....,"The Chateau Marmont is a cool place to stay for sure - but the rooms are a little small and the bathrooms are still in their original state. The room rates are quite high considering the original amenities/ fixtures. Request a room not facing the restaurant/ courtyard as its very noisy for sleeping. The supplied earplugs were a nice touch, but a real drag if you are a light sleeper.",momagerBC
40,So LA-Stay for the Experience,"As expected, great location for people watching and good drinks/food. If you can't stay go for the Hollywood scene and enjoy the atmosphere. It still carries that off beat vibe and is not your traditional high end over the top luxe stay. You still get more of the old school and unique flavor the hotel is known for. Definitely worth a stay!",ChadS303
50,Classically classy,"It really doesn't get any better than the Chateau. If you can't afford to stay here, splurge and have lunch or dinner; it's worth it just to see the place. If you can stay here, by all means do.....best hotel in L.A.",JohnRyan724
40,Worth a look.,"We went and had a drink with some mates who were staying there. We were given the 3rd degree on the way in - which almost put me right off because I got a bit of a bee in my bonnet that it was poncey and I wasn't sure I wanted to go.. but in fact it was worth it. We had a cocktail in the lobby bar which has lots of quite fabulous sofas and little nooks. The very dapper waiter amusingly and very proudly told me that ""anybody's who's anybody"" comes to the Chateau Marmont.. Well that may be so.. but it's perfectly ok I think to be a somebody who's a nobody like me, and have a nice drink and a snoop about the pool too! It's a good people watching spot and the restaurant is sort of buzzing with filmy types - looks pretty awful to be honest.. but I do recommend the lounge bar area for a drink. It's a lovely atmosphere, well decorated and the cocktails are pricey but no more pricey than normal UK pricey. In fact not as much I suspect.",Laurabbbbbbbb
10,EH,"This place really didn't live up to the hype.Not a lot of privacy as this place is where you go ""to be seen""While the room service staff, wait staff, and even bellhop staff are nice- the check in staff and valet staff tend to be offputting. They like to challenge their guests, which is not customer service oriented. It's also a bit dated. I prefer modern luxury, or at least contemporary. This place is pretty clean and moderately well maintained, but still old.I am so ready for Hollywood to have bigger, better, and more luxurious hotels! Give this old one the BOOT.",Gordon S
50,Lovely terrace for sipping wine and people watching,Loved this place for sunset drinks on the outdoor terrace. The wine list was good and considering where are are the prices weren't too insane! Will definitely be back.,Viciousb
40,Perfect place to star spot or if you are a little eccentric yourself,Well...everybody likes a little bit of star spotting and at The chateau that is what you will get. Beautiful gardens where you neat by candlelight and steeped in Hollywood Mythology.Of course there is a downside. I like luxury but The Chateau aims for eccentricity. Shabby Chic rooms...old plumbing and you do pay top dollar for this experience.,Blue B

50,Just Enjoy the History,"Have spent a few nights here over the years. No, it's not the Ritz, but I could care less. Contrary to some, I have always found the staff to be courteous, helpful, and friendly. Room was clean, and nicely decorated. Good firm mattress, a must at this point in life.Of course it's expensive Both The Restaurant, and the Bar Marmont can provide good eats....for a price.

Travis is a huge asset to this place. He is by far the friendliest, most helpful person. The food at the restaurant is always delicious. However, the dining staff is hit or miss. It can be either fantastic or terrible. The rooms are spacious and clean. The grounds are just beautiful also. Thanks so much guys! Can not wait to return.",KMS042

The staff is always looking around to see who is who and ignore the regular costumer despite the expensive prices of the hotel, bar and food. I think if they want to mistreat regular costumer, then they should just only accept reservations for the stars! Seriously I doubt even the stars would want to stay in this smelly older hotel!",NA H
10,Never Again,"I was very disappointed with our experience. The food was very average, the service was horrible. The waiter was beyond arrogant. The $50 tip on the $800 bill was far more than he deserved and left to send a message. To make matters worse, we were told that we had to vacate our table because we had been there too long. We were there so long because of the deplorable service. The hostesses and manager did not really seem to care that we had such a bad experience. Don't bother- the restaurant has very pedestrian food, is overpriced, and has arrogant incompetent waiters.",andreanoonoo

50,WOW - Way better than I ever imagined,"I waited until the last minute to call the restaurant to make a reservation, yet the hostess was very polite in letting me know that I may not be able to be seated. When we arrived, the staff was polite and welcoming. After going up to the restaurnat/bar area in an adorable old school elevator with two friendly staffers, we entered the classiest, most charming lobby/bar area. We were so pleased to see seats at the bar, and had a couple of great drinks. The bartender was very friendly. We thought about ordering food at the bar, but she guided us to the sitting area to the left of the bar. It's filled with and eclectice mix of classic style sofas, arm chairs and coffee tables. So charming and lovely. We were greeted by the server with whom we shared the elevator on the way up. He was a lovely man from El Salvdor and we chatted with him for a bit.The menu had many wonderful choices from all ilk - meat, fish, vegetarian. It was hard to choose. The bartender recommended the chicken - and it was delicious. My friend ordered an equally delicious steak.I've written in other reviews that I am sometimes skeptical of such high profile destinations, sometimes the hype just can't be met...not here. Absolutely wonderdful.Added note - you can walk down the hill to the iconic Magic Castle...it's kind of cool to see it up close at night...",Lynne H

20,Possibly one of the worst egg Benedict I've ever had,"The hotel is nice with a lovely courtyard. Great place for drinks, and that is about it.Breakfast was a massive disappointment.I ordered eggs Benedict and ask to swap the potatoes for fruit, which they happily did. However, the eggs were far from organic, the yolks nearly neon yellow. The brioche buns were supermarket bough, with a feeling of old buns becoming hard and chewy. The eggs tasted of vinegar, clearly used to poach them, and the fruit came all on the same plater, so it was covered in egg sauce... Disgusting.The latte I ordered was served in a soup like bowl. Tasted blend, nothing to it.Service was good, but I expected a lot more for a hotel like chateau marmont.",Cconti

As our day unfolded, we decided we needed an extra hour to get there without cutting our morning short. Hostess was very accommodating and moved us up easily. We parked behind the hotel along the winding street rather than spending a ton on valet. We were seated immediately and the patio felt as if we were in another world. It was just lovely.

40,Drinks,"We hadn't booked a table but the staff we quick to find us a table for drinks. Lovely old hotel, worth a visit!",SLBell2014
50,restaurant amazing food,"we went to the chateau for lunch, great food and service, we ate outside in the garden area. we had a few famous faces sitting near by",Donnaoo1
50,Great late night eats and ambience,"I used to go here back in my drumming days. Back then it was pretty seedy and much more affordable and everybody who was anybody, or wanted to be, was there. Now it's much cleaner and certainly more pricey but if you can't sleep at night, want a great snack or meal, by all means stop by. You never know who you'll see there. I am really not a celebrity hunter and am actually somewhat put off by them but I've seen several there. Grab a dimly lit, comfortable spot and just let it roll!",Ruben C
50,Go for breakfast!,"The food was outstanding; best eggs benedict I've ever had. The outdoor patio was peaceful, even though it was packed -- and the staff a perfect mix of attentive and leaving us to enjoy our meal and time together.",Elizabeth S
50,Wonderful location.. Great view from penthouse,"Great views of LA and Sunset blvd from this penthouse. Food was excellent. Modern with great flavours. If you are lucky to get in before sunset you can watch two gorgeous panoramas of the city, one by sunny day and another by twinkling night.",Shreya14
30,Hollywood history,"Stopped by with my bro and his wife for a walk thru and drink. They are locals and love the history of the place for actors, overdose deaths etc. We sat for a drink, bro decided on the 16$ fruit juice...I opted for ice tea. When the server brought our order, he plopped down an unopened bottle of Odwalla juice...come on, at least fake us out and pour it in a glass with ice in the kitchen. We laughed about it later, but puhleeeze!",TopSarge41
50,Wedding Evening,Wonderful ambiance and superb service on a beautiful Saturday night. The wedding and reception took place in a beautiful suite with the terrace overlooking the gorgeous city. Dinner was wonderful.,Anne J
40,Elegant,"I was very excited to visit the Chateau for lunch. The Chateau's atmosphere did not disappoint, it is a cool venue with an impressive history. The patio was everything I imagined. Enjoyed in a few G&T's in the sun and had a reasonable but very expensive lunch. Pleased that I went there but doubt I will return.",Laruebunny
40,Great place but the food is just OK,"I was very excited to eat at the Chateau. I felt like for the price of meal, it was not up to my standards. There are better places to eat in LA. The outdoor patio was really cute, but I probably wouldn't return. The bar is super small as well, so I would choose bar marmont.",Stefaniefarrah
50,Iconic lunch,"Without a doubt one of the coolest lunches I have had.Read up before going, and you will understand why a visit to the Chateau should be treated with a certain degree of reverence.Had a BLT and it was delicious. The Bloody mary I had was really good as well.The service is discreet, efficient and really good.We also had a child with us, and they provided us with everything we needed to make our lunch great.Go for some star-spotting! Great fun!",TravelT
50,what a iconic place,If your in the area stop in for a drink. So much cool history. Stay the night and rent a bungalow you wont regret it..,RUSSGUAJARDO
40,A quiet place to stay,We decided to spend our last two nights of a holiday at the chateau. This hotel reminds me of the 50s/60s. We were upgraded to a suite and on arrival in the room we had some cookies and a bottle of wine. The suite was spacious with a 1950's style kitchen and decor. I quite liked that it was different to other hotels that I stayed at. Our room faced a side street and other houses. We had dinner at the restaurant which was quite nice. Staff were attentive at all times. It was a pleasant stay. If you stay at this hotel you will need a car to get around or you will need to pay for cabs or walk.,Jackiesholiday
30,See and Be seen,"The bar is nice as well as the ambiance,but really people are only here to make sure they are seen or to spot celebrities. If you're a tourist, you should go. If you live here, its where I would have my first drink of the night before going somewhere more fun.",Kristin Wingfield Koefod
50,Great Restaurant and Atmosphere; Terrific Staff,"I recently dined at Chateau's terrific restaurant and have stayed in one of the cottages before. It is a great experience from top to bottom. Manager Carl Hubbard and his staff really seem to want to provide you the best experience possible. The bartenders, even on a night when they were just slammed with business, were polite and seemed very interested in making sure my guest and I enjoyed our food and beverages. The quality is bar none, and with the new renovations to the lobby lounge, the place looks even better. It is not easy to get a reservation there, and most nights if you do not have a reservation you will not be able to visit the restaurant. But it should be said that the Chateau is a destination spot and the staff do a great job protecting the integrity of that status. But it is clear that those who are hired at Chateau are vetted for being some of the best at what they do. The host staff is very friendly and will try to help you get the best table available. The rooms are terrific if you have a chance to stay in the cottages, I recommend it.",tommooreradio
50,What a treat!,"My 23 yr daughter and I stopped by impromptu while in LA for the day. Walked in like we belonged there and they sat us in the outside garden and it was perfect. It does have a certain quiet vibe to it, clearly ta ta people all around. The servers were great and we had some wine (great selections and yes priced that way) and a cheese platter that was fresh and plenty. The hostess was a little stiff but otherwise it's a treat to be there and in the scene!",amsandbeach
50,Gorgeous boutique hotel,"Beautiful place, really nice staff, and especially loved the patio for lunch! Great food, peaceful, serene, and enjoyed the people-watching!!!",Vicki D
40,AL FRESCO LUNCH a DEUX,"CHATEAU MARMONT is Iconic Hollywood. You read about it as a High Powered place to stay and a great Celebrity Watching Local.Most people 'HEAR"" about the CHATEAU MARMONT and never go. One of my dearest and longtime friend took me there for lunch.We were led to an enclosed patio that was filled with interesting looking people. We didn't spot anyone I recognized, I would have recognized James Dean and Gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor,alas they were somewhere else pushing daisies!The crowd was not HOLLYWOOD GLAMOR as that is totally dead. But, there were very attractive people and no one looking like they had just fallen off the Proverbial TURNIP TRUCK. Lots of very tight jeans, long tousled hair and only one OVERLY MADE UP and BEAUTIFULLY STYLED WOMAN.The Food was really delicious as it wasn't overwrought. The salads tasted fresh, pristine and delicious. Funny thing was that a really popular dish was GOLDEN CRUNCHY CALAMARI FRITI. We loved ours andate it down to the nubbins.Our white wine was refreshing for a hot July afternoon and we lazed our way.through an idyllic afternoon.WE WILL GO BACK, maybe even stay there. It is definitely a retro French-style chateau from ""Back in The Day>""",QUEENIE_ELLE
30,Just popped in for a cocktail,we were in Hollywood for a short break. we went here after hearing all the hype but was made to feel uninvited.... so sod you then.,major_rawls
50,Beautiful Hotel,We had breakfast here - we were not guests but they treated us like princess's. Great menu and food was great and service even better.,karla m
50,LIve like you're a star,"The most fun place to stay in LA. The food is awesome, the staff are discreet, and the rooms are awesome!",miguelstanley
50,Celebrity Sightings Unavoidable,"You can't sit in the lobby of the Chateau without sighting a celebrity. In my two day visit I saw Ron Woods, Christopher Walken, Lindsay Lohan, Denzel Washington, and Richard Lewis. Go in order a drink and try not to stare. And DO NOT take pictures. You will be asked to leave. If you have the means ($2,000 a night) stay in a Bungalow. (I don't BTW I was working there on a photo shoot)",Vivabaxter
50,Full of Character,"Whilst it gave off some 'spooky' vibes, I loved its opulence and warmth.",Di S
50,My Favorite Hotel in the World,Live like Hollywood royalty for a few days. Everything is perfect about a stay at the Chateau.,WorldTraveller209
40,Gorgous landmark,Have not stayed here but went to lunch and walked around. Beautiful grounds and staff are more than willing to help you have an enjoyable time.,KarenH92807
50,My Fav!,Such an iconic hotel. Def go for drinks or brunch at the hotel. Great spot for celeb spotting.,samwabs
40,Fun to Stay and Fun to Play,"Great food, fun place to go for a few drinks later in the night, cool view",Jenn J
40,Great trendy place,"Great for spotting stars, GQ man of the year celebration took place last Thursday. The ""pops"" were out but we missed all the stars exiting the hotel",arrbarr
40,Part of the Hollywood/Sunset Strip experience ....,"While visiting LA, we walked from Hollywood and Vine all the way up to the Sunset Strip. My wife, who is a big show business fan was interested in seeing the Chateau Marmont due to it's rich local history and reputation. We did not stay there, just visited for lunch in the courtyard. The hotel itself is just like you would expect from the pictures - tastefully old and dark. Although we didn't see any personalities we recognized, the Sunday lunch crowd seemed like mostly locals that knew one another. The service was cordial, and the food was good, but pretty expensive, even to LA standards.Overall, it was fun to see the place in person, and have a nice lunch while chatting about the history around you.",wiliwali
50,Definately Go,"If you like Hollywood and all the tales that go along with it, then you want to go here. If you don't wamt to spend the night, just go for drinks and dinner. This is a very historical and storied place and worth a visit!",nolaqueen
40,Totally cool!,"After driving past this place for many years it was such a treat last night to actually go inside. It was an impromptu visit and as we drove up we weren't even sure if we had on the appropriate attire. The valet assured us it was cool. And it was! Not an ounce of pretension from the staff. As can be the problem in some of the higher end establishments. The staff even begin to feel entitled as the high end clientele! Not here, it's all about the guest. A, B, C, D and even no listers get the same treatment.We started our drinks in the lobby. Awesome, so much fabulous decor and architecture. We were then graciously asked if we would like to sit in the coveted garden area. Which we delightfully accepted. Nothing fancy just to be in the ""area"" but definitely a cool vibe.Definitely bucket list this place if it's your kinda place. It was mine. And I look forward to becoming a regular.",GiaMia
50,A fabulous stay!,"On a recent trip to Los Angeles with my daughter and two of her friends, I booked the Chateau Marmont for our first night. Since there were four of us, we booked a junior suite for about $480.00. It was incredible! We were on the second floor and there was a large bedroom with a king bed, two closets, a large flatscreen TV and everything else you would need. There was also a kitchen with a great mini bar as well as pots, pans, glasses and anything else you would need for a prolonged stay and a separate dining area with a small table and chairs as well. The living room had a couch, comfortable chairs, another large flatscreen TV, DVD player and a rollaway bed that we requested which was more like a luxurious twin bed rather than the kind of cots you would get at most hotels. Also, the windows were long and beautiful and unlike many modern hotels, you could actually open them up wide and let in the fresh air.When we arrived we had lunch at the outdoor restaurant. The garden setting was lovely and the food was very good, and also pretty reasonably priced! Later that night we enjoyed room service and the food was excellent.All of the staff were very friendly from those at the check-in who answered all of our touristy questions about the sites as well as those in the restaurant or at the garage.The pool was beautiful and surrounded by lush gardens. I went down in the evening and was the only person there and I enjoyed a nice, quiet swim.My daughter and her two friends (all 19 years old) loved the Chateau! It was well worth the price and if I hadn't booked a somewhat cheaper hotel (and already paid for it in advance) for the following two nights, I would not have left.I highly recommend the Chateau Marmont. It was a fabulous way to start our vacation in Los Angeles and we can't wait to return!Fran in NY",frano429
50,Fab stay here if you want to see celebs !!!,"We picked this hotel because my wife is a huge fan of celebrities and last year we got a taste of what this hotel could offer when we visited for lunch when we were staying at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. As we decided to go back to LA this year, we decided to stay at the Chateau Marmont so we could experience in full what the Chateau had to offer. My wife also held onto the fact that she would see one of her idols as last time we visited we saw a few famous people whilst having just lunch!!! We were not disappointed as we saw lots of celebrities here such as Jason Stratham, Michael Madsen and Lawrence Fishbourne to name but a few !! Oh no not forgetting Marco Pierre White, we saw him breakfast, lunch and dinner the whole time we were there !!! If you want to experience what it is like mingling with the stars then stay here, whilst we do not regret our decision to stay here because we had a fantastic time, there are better rooms available in LA and if we went back we would have to think hard about whether we wanted to stay at the Chateau although without doubt, we will be visiting their lots. The hotel staff particularly the breakfast lady host are all very friendly and make you feel welcome - you didn’t feel that you were not as important because you were not a celebrity !!!! We had a garden cottage which was very noisy because of the road and the Bar Marmont. The food is great here as well and is reasonably priced. Go and have fun there, you won’t regret it !!!!",Alvin&Tracy
