50,The best Farmers Market in LA!,"This is a great spot for locals to shop every Sunday morning. The second oldest farmers market in LA County, I personally think it’s the best one bar none. Four full city blocks of fresh baked breads, an astounding array of organic fruits, vegetables, legumes, dairy and meat products, plus a wild array of crafts. Some of the best buskers as well playing everything from bluegrass to jazz. Great people watching. Great place to come for breakfast or lunch. A place where you get to know your farmer as well as your neighbors!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aronaki

There are many offerings that would appear exotic to first time visitors, but it appeared most people knew exactly what they wanted and expected something wonderful. There were fresh shellfish being shucked, Indian tandori, Korean, French macarons, Mexican dishes, organic fruit & vegetables, nuts, berries, honey, and both a blues performer wailing on his harmonica and a bluegrass group plucking mandolins and banjos. Visiting this weekly event is a nice way to spend a Sunday morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RangerBobN

50,Amazing Market,My wife and I stopped here for a lunch break as part of a LA Day Tour. Totally amazing place with plenty of food vendors and places to eat.

50,One of the best in Los Angeles. Lots of choices.,"Lots of choices for just about everything. Sometimes prices can be a bit high.

That was big on my list today.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
40,Great Lunch Stop,We called in here for lunch between a trip to Rodeo Drive and the Hollywood Sign. There was a variety of places to choose from for most budgets.

There is a Cheesecake Factory in the centre of the mall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/165mareeg
50,SO much local citrus!,"I'm from Chicago; we can't grow citrus here and in early April, when we visited, it was still in the 30s at home. I go to farmer's markets a lot at home and was really impressed by this one! Our AirBNB host told us about it; it was right down the street from where we were staying but I wouldn't have known to look for it otherwise. It is about 4 blocks or so worth of vendors and there are places to get a meal too, not just produce. I bought a passion fruit, something else that does not grow at home! There was a great assortment of fruit and veg, many varieties of oranges, lemons and other citrus I'd never heard of, and the vendors I spoke to were all friendly and eager to talk about what they grow. I so wish we had this at home!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fastrada

50,The best farmers markets in this universe,Being a bit of a foodie I have seen many markets in Europe and the US and I have never been even close to the quality I experienced today.Approx 80 stalls with few repeat offerings.

50,Fun place with good food,"The Farmer’s Market is a foodie’s delight. There are so many stalls of so many kinds of different foods there! But, the place is not just for foodies. The market has a happy buzz, and you can sit and enjoy a drink or an ice cream - whatever you fancy - while indulging in a bit of people watching. A couple of hours should be good enough here. There are some souvenir shops there as well, with interesting, typically touristy stuff. Do check the timings for the market before heading there, as there are different closing timings on weekends and weekdays. The Grove, an outdoor mall with great eating options is right next to this, and you can easily club a visit to both the places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Touristy_D

20,Don’t waste your time if you’ve actually been to a farmers market,Maybe the Ohio selections of the north market in Columbus or West Side Market in Cleveland or La Boqueria of Barca (I’m sure there are other great ones around the country and world) have set my proverbial bar but this was painfully underwhelming. Food and market items were good but not nearly the selection I expected. Reviews suggested it was a destination; just didn’t get there for me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nathanm270

50,A feast for the eyes as well as the stomach,"The Hollywood Farmers’ Market is held 8-1 every Sunday.Following on-line advice, we had only a light breakfast at home, drove to the market area and parked, and were walking among the stalls by around 8:15 a.m. It was a pleasantly cool May morning, and the market wasn’t crowded.We looked at the various food stalls selling take-away cooked food, but along the way, we sampled so many kinds of cheese, jam, and fruit that we hardly needed to buy anything for breakfast.The food for sale is fresh and reasonably priced. Regular customers come with small wagons and load them up with a mountain of purchases.I like farmers’ markets. This is one of the best I’ve ever been to, in terms of the range of food available and the quality of what was being sold. Most of the vendors urge customers to sample before buying.We stayed about two hours, strolling up and down the streets, nibbling, and making purchases. We capped off the morning with a great ice cream sandwich from a food truck near the entrance to the market area that’s near Trader Joe’s.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ms_Yokohama2014

It is a landmark of the city since 1934 and it is a place where you can find over a 100 different food options, including markets and diversity. The possibilities are just too many to enjoy them all in one trip.From a French restaurant in the vicinity of its special grocery to any kind of American comfort food, even crepes, mexican, oriental food, desserts on any kind and probably my favorite, different kinds of fruits of different nations to enjoy. There is even a shoe store! For sure you will find something that will make you want to come back. Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelcooking

30,Farmers market tied to a shopping mall,"Strange mix, there is a farmers market, but there is also a high end shopping mall. If you like shopping you will like this. The location is distinct from other site seeing locations and not really a close match to the surrounding neighborhood. It is an interesting mix.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kyle_SD_308

40,Hollywood Farmers Market,"It's called a ""Farmers Market"" but it's more like a fairground foodcourt. I didn't see any Farmers selling produce lol! However, there are lots of cool places to eat featuring many different kinds of food. Everything is jammed into a fairly small space and it's kind of cool to walk around checking out all the various vendors, and looking at menus, etc. Of course the usual tourist souveniers and trinkets etc are available.Parking was tough to find but eventually I found a spot in a parking garage. It wasn't too expensive compared to other places I've parked at in LA.The ""Market"" is kind of buried in the outdoor mall area. You have to look for it, but I enjoyed looking around. Back outside of the market there is the outdoor mall area that features plenty of shopping and several restaurants like Mixology, Cheesecake Factory, Marmalade Cafe, and a few others.I'd definitely return to the Market and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun way to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/176dougg

There are so many vendor stalls with numerous food choices including seafood, Chinese, BBQ, pizza, Mexican, deli, ice cream, donuts, candy, etc. Everything that we tried was very good. Just be forewarned that not all stalls accept debit or credit cards, so bring some cash.There is a lovely, car-free shopping district behind the Hollywood Farmers Market. It is a beautiful area with a trolley that you can ride the length of the promenade and a delightful fountain area.

20,"Just a market, don't know what all the fuss is about?!","We went here today after reading the reviews, however were disappointed. If you've ever been to any market, then you don't need to go here, it's just a market, nothing special. I can't see what the fuss is about, there's various market food (90% of the stalls sell food) and a few tourist 'junk' stalls, nothing you can't get anywhere else. It's also pretty small, don't expect to spend long here.The only good part was the outside mall which is across the road, that's quite nice and scenic, but again, if you've been to a mall before, then don't expect anything different.We honestly thought we'd gone to the wrong place but viewed the photos on trip advisor and we were in the right place. I wouldn't recommend going here at all unless you've never been to a market before, and to be honest, if this is your first market you'll be pretty disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Razorsharp192

It can be a little expensive so make sure to walk the whole market. And it is a large farmers market. Buy what is in season! The colors and atmosphere are terrific. Everyone is in a good mood. Great photo ops. Street parking at meters available but may take some time to find. No dogs allowed. Food trucks on site. Not just veggies and fruit.

50,The best farmers market ever!,"I love this farmers market. They have more organic fruits and vegetables did any of the other farmers markets I have attended in Los Angeles and even more choices organic than Whole Foods Markets. They have seafood, bison, grass fed beef, flowers, food trucks, huge assortment of bakery goods, and a guy who is there every week selling a variety of pesto sauces. The only better pesto sauce I remember is in Genoa, Italy. I can even buy plants at this farmers market, and grow my own organic herbs. And there is music in every corner of the four blocks - some local musicians playing for spare change. It's rain or shine, Sundays until 1 PM.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elysekomer

50,Fun Sunday at the local market!,"In town for the first time and was taken to the Hollywood Farmers Market - coming from the east coast in February, it's so cool to see what's available on the west coast at this time of year, Lots of oranges, strawberries, as well as lettuce, mushrooms - you name it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763bethb
50,"Iconic, eclectic and definitely worth a visit","The Farmers Market has been around forever, but has gradually morphed into an interesting collection of eating places as opposed to all-out produce stand. It's still the mostly wooden and stucco buildings that have been there for 50+ years and you can still buy some beautiful fruits, vegetables and meats, but there are also many food speciality kiosks, one or two souvenir stores and a ton of interesting restaurants and/or food stands. We spent an interesting two hours walking around looking before having a great lunch at a French restaurant (Monsieur Marcel's). We watched a TV news crew film a segment at the Brazilian food stand that was dolled up for Mardi Gras--including poodles in couture and beads. A small band was on hand to entertain customers. Bought some spectacular oranges for dessert at another stand close by. There is good parking that is free with a ticket validation. The market is about a mile from the LA County Art Museum, so a great place to lay up after art peeping.We'll keep going back to this LA/Hollywood institution Let's hope it doesn't get swallowed by developers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlueNWashington

50,Sunday mornings at the Hollywood Farmers Market,"My vegetarian wife prefers to cook with fresh, local, organic produce, so we drive to the Hollywood Farmers Market every Sunday morning. I've grown to love the experience and recommend it to tourists and travelers. The market is the historic core of Hollywood, within site of the Hollywood sign. The market is bordered by Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards to the north and south, and Vine and Cahuenga on the east west. It runs from 8 am to 2 pm every Sunday. By far the best time to go is early - you can park and walk through the market as early as 7:30 am, and that's the best time to stroll around the market, see the Walk of Fame, check out other historic attractions, and grab breakfast. The farmers, who come from all over southern and central California, are still setting up, but they're happy to sell and talk to you about their family farm or orchard. You can sample fresh fruit samples or eat at the many food vendor stalls. This is also the best time to catch celebrity chefs or sleepy rock stars or film/tv stars who have wandered down from the Hollywood Hills to get their fruits and vegetables before the crowds arrive. (More likely, they send their personal chefs.)The market is truly in the heart of historic Hollywood and it's a relaxed time of morning to stroll around and see the Hollywood Walk of Fame or other attractions. There are plenty of Apps and websites for the Walk of Fame. As a music lover, I'm always amazed at the musical history of the area. The famous Sound Factory is in the middle of the market, and a nearby coffee shop (corner of Selma and Cahuenga) has a plaque for Wally Heider's recording studio used to be. Between the two studios, many of the most famous rock stars and bands of all time have recorded there - The Rolling Stones, The Doors, The Who, Beach Boys, CSNY, Fleetwood Mac, Jimi Hendrix and more. Two doors up Cahuenga, look for the sidewalk marker in front of Kitchen 24, at 1608 N. Cahuenga, which used to host a famous jazz club owned by drummer Shelly Manne in the 60s. Look these places up on the web before you visit.Be prepared for an eclectic group of people ranging from hipsters to the homeless. You might spot a star without makeup or a celebrity chef, but don't stare. It's pretty relaxed here in the early morning, but it will soon get crowded.Above all, enjoy the incredible bounty of California agriculture and feel the pride of local growers and family farms. There's a wide range or organic fruit and produce here. You will feel healthy and vibrant just strolling through the market stars on an early Sunday morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LNewnam
