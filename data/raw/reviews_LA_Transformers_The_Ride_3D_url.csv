40,It was good of you are into this kind of ride.,"It was good of you are into this kind of ride. It is one of those motion simulators which many people love, but if you suffer from motion sickness, I would suggest you stay away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missedme
50,Wicked!,OMG this is a totally submersive 3D ride and was so realistic it was amazing!I loved every second of it - canâ€™t rate it highly enough ðŸ˜ƒ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/441brigitteh
40,"Great ride, well designed inside.",Go early in the day and walk right onto the car. We did it twice before moving onto the other rides in that lower park area. The 3-D video and car movement was timed well. As with all the video/motion rides getting the front row is the best so you don't look though peoples heads. Lots to look at inside if the lines are long. First photo op with a transformer character was at 11:00am.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrGillatt
30,Loud 3D Movie That'll Jostles You Around,"If you've ridden the Ratatouille ride at Disneyland Paris, you'll know what to expect with the Universal Studios Hollywood Transformers 3D ride. It works the same way (you're in a ride vehicle that moves while wearing 3D glasses and moving around in front of giant video screens) except that instead of a nice little race through the streets of Paris with a mouse chef, you're thrust into some sort of battle with giant transforming robots.I don't really know what the heck was going on as far as the storyline of the ride goes, it was super loud and just a huge commotion with no real rhyme nor reason. It was sort of fun I guess, mostly because it's one of the longer rides in the park. But I don't really know what was happening except that there were big, giant robots screaming and jumping all over the place.There's a totally cool heat seeking missile effect that was pretty rad. Definitely worth waiting to ride this one, but I'd use caution if you're prone to motion sickness!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moviegal226
50,Simulator,Great ride that is very well thought of. You need 4D glasses which are provided so that you can travel on the purpose built car through the simulator,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Duerds5
50,Fast ride,A must do ride lots going on from every direction it takes you up down and around looking for the all spark,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404christiner404
40,Fun !,"Fun, rather violent ride that seems way too short for the amount of time you spend in line. Do yourself a favor and buy the express ticket !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dware82320
40,Transformer fun!,"This ride jolts you around a lot in the simulated ride for the 3D thrills. There are a lot of Transformers fighting and changing shape, killing each other with gleaming eyes. There are a few 3D simulated rides at Universal and this one was one of the best. Buckle up because its a rough ride!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/865kg
50,Excellent ride,Another excellent ride at Universal. This is mainly a motion simulated ride but it does move quite a bit to really add to the experience. Interestingly the queue is nicely quieter than the one in Orlando which was good for our group (the loud queue caused some folks to backout). Good fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daswifty
50,Our Favorite!,We went on many of the rides at Universal and our favorite was Transformers. Fun for the little kids and the teenagers. Highly recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misopiso88
50,Wonderful Ride,"This was another great ride a 3D simulator ride one of a few in the park , we had about a 40 minute wait on this ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianJ459
30,Great ride,"Very good ride, to me the best after the Harry Potter one. After paying 129 bucks to enter the park per person, it better be. Still, the lines, the lines...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cabesua
50,After ride photos is a must !,"There are a lot of these 3D simulator rides at Universal now, however this is the best and if not, one of the best. Story is great and the special effects make for a few surprises as you go.In addition to being a simulator there is more than a hint of it being a pretty quick moving roller coaster, moving you rapidity in every direction as well as spinning in circles.After the ride be sure to turn right as you leave the gift shop and get your photos taken up close with a half man, half robot walking and â€˜talkingâ€™ 10ft tall Megatron, (or one of the smaller transformers that feature throughout the day.) If Iâ€™m honest this was the best bit of the whole experience for me. To see the look on the little kids faces (and some of the bigger kids) when a fierce looking Megatron announces he â€˜doesnâ€™t do smilingâ€™ was hilarious !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/615derekg
30,Cool 3D,3d effects were blurry at times. Storyline did not follow the movies. Megatron is dead. How has he come back to life? I don't know.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbmusic
50,Great Ride - Good 3D Experience,One of the newest rides at Universal Studios Hollywood. If youâ€™re a fan of the Transformers movies then this is a must!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SixtyOne
50,Really good rides with short queues,"This is located in the lower section of the amusement park, and many times there is no queues at all. I really recommend this 4D-ride!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DjJassu
40,A Must Do if You are a Transformers Fan,"We had a lot of fun on this ride, despite not being huge fans of the franchise. It is a 3D motion ride, so if that isn't your cup of tea, steer clear!TIP: Wait in the single rider line, it goes much quicker.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveDuff
50,Awesome Ride,Fantastic effects really felt I was in a transformers movie. great intro leading up to the ride itself. plenty to keep you entertained in the queue. Gotta see the Trash talking robots before if you can. all in all very good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_In_Ulster
50,Awesome ride,This is one of the best 3D rides at Universal Studios. Beware of your personal belongings especially your cell phones if you are carrying them with you on this or any other rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sachin_Zarekar
50,The most amazing ride ever,The Transformers: The Ride - 3D was a 360 degrees 3D ride. It was amazing. I thought i was in the movie fighting the Decepticons.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntoNic7
50,Best 3D Ride ever,"This is one of the best (if not the best) 3D rides at Universal, and maybe all amusement parks.In this ride you ride a small autobot that needs to protect ""the spark"" or something like that.Although the atraction is not a roller coaster the vertigo sensation simulated by the immersive 3d and the car movement is superb. I did it more than once and I felt it was one of the best atractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SebasLallana
