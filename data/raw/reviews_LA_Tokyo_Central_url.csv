40,A Taste of Tokyo in Los Angeles,"This is a favorite place of mine.I like stuff that Japan produces, from Fender electric guitars to their teapots and furniture. The designs are simple and that simplicity and balance is one that attracts the viewer.Their gardens and plants are a favorite of mine. This is why during my first visit to Tokyo Central, I was excited... and looked twice at stuff they are selling. Japan made items are items I fancy.The only downside is the price. I am made to understand that the shipping and taxes make these items quite expensive. Purchase has to be planned and saved for.Walking the aisles with kids can be quite adventurous since the kids love the anime characters and the Japanese characters made popular by the net.When with kids, make sure you watch them since there are displays that are breakable. If you break stuff, you pay for it.Small eateries inside the Central make it a popular place to visit. Japanese residents in the community make this a regular place to visit. When inside the establishment, you get lost in the many displays and you may even imagine yourself transported to Tokyo, Japan.Truly an awesome place to kill time.",Hexelspixels
40,A Little Bit of Tokyo in South Bay!,This used to be the Marukai Store before but it is had a facelift/makeover!The lighting is much brighter than before and it has a clean crisp new loo to it!There are many Japanese dishes and pastries you can try!They have many small restaurants inside the store and not too pricey!,Farangdingdong
40,You can find anything you need from Japan,"Tokyo Central is by far the best Japanese supermarket I have ever been. It is even bigger and better than the one in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles. It is packed with different products from Japan ranging from skincare, cosmetics, toys, snacks, groceries, Japanese condiments, sweets, beer and wine and ready-to-eat obento to toys, stationery and gadgets. They are all neatly organised and you feel so comfortable to shop around with no pressure. There are also small restaurants, bakery and a ramen place with tables inside the supermarket. Tokyo Central is truly a SUPERmarket which has it all.",elsie C.
