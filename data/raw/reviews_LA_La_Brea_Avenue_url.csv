20,Not an 'attraction'.,"La Brea is certainly a very long boulevard, and yes it has plenty of stores on it. That does not make it an attraction that is worth visiting, otherwise every street in LA would be on Tripadvisor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/df86
40,Took a walk.,"While in California, my nephews were eager for me to take them there, I wasn't sure why.. They wanted to check out a couple of stores, which we wound up at. There is plenty parking during the day, metered parking. It's overall clean with a good amount of foot traffic. Great neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/almightySR
40,Long La Brea ...,"The length of La Brea is huge, starting at Hawthorne Blvd. east of LAX & running Northwards all the way to the Hollywood hills - lengthy. As such the neighborhoods it passes through include glitz, good, bad and ugly. But to most Angelenos & tourists, La Brea refers to the nice section just East of the Tar Pits, LA County Art Museum, Peterson Automotive Museum, great restaurants and lots of shops. I drive it regularly and enjoy the diversity of this part of La Brea. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,Nice walkable bouelvard,"A major thoroughfare in Los Angeles that covers a lot of territory and therefore includes some retail and commercial spaces, some neighborhood green spaces and parks, and lots of pretty and interesting sights. Probably best to do with at least one friend, in the sunlight; I'm not sure I would feel safe by myself at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652rayq
30,North/south thoroughfare with things to see and do around it,"It is a long north/south road in Los Angeles covering a wide range of districts, some of which didn't look so appealing and some which did. La Brea means tar in Spanish and of course the famous La Brea Tar Pits Museum is around here, but not on La Brea Avenue - it is on Wilshire Boulevard (Museum Mile), a bit west of the intersection of La Brea and Wilshire. There is an amazing ice cream shop along here called Mashti Malone's (at 1525 North La Brea Ave). Doesn't look anything from the outside but was the best ice cream we had in the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
30,A street,"La Brea Avenue that runs through much of Los Angeles, including neighborhoods good, bad and ugly. It is not a neighborhood. Lots of traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
40,Tarpits,"This is a really interesting place. Located on Wilshire Boulevarde next to the Los Angeles Museum of Art it shows the history of the pits,the bones recovered and how it all actually happened. There are several talks and a tour of the site which is still a work in progress. It has the big tar pit fenced off but easy to view, in a large park environment..nice to take the kids. The bus stops outfront..dont ask for La Brea thats a street quite a walk away..so we discovered. The driver will tell you which stop to get off at. There is a cafe at the Lacma and clean toilets both in the park and the facilities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeidiH382
