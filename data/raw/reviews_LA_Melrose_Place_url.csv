50,Love this place!,"This place is soooo cute... food is good! Drinks are amazing!! So first you walk through a hookah lounge to a door in the back. In the door there is a room of knobs on the wall. Gotta find the right one that opens up to a trendy spot. We came for drinks and food. The food is appetizer style. I had the spring rolls, sliders, fries and spinach artichoke dip. Foo was sooooo good! I love the berry me already. It’s very tasty, but strong.A bit pricey and this to me is not a place for kids. I went on a date here, also a night out with girls and a birthday. Overall A+!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissKiaBaby
50,Melrose Place Farmers Market,"I love this farmers market, it's super convenient and always has great selections of produce and vendors! Lots of fresh produce and yummy vegan foods.You can find soap, flowers, candles and jewelry! I’ve bought for the upcoming Hollidays a piece of jewelry from a French booth that sells only French designers and I will definitely come back!I love how this farmers market is so close to me and I definitely will be back! Always a fun way to some time on a Sunday morning, they are open from 10am-2pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elsabendav
40,Strolling through West Hollywood,Lots of fun shops and eateries where the fabulous people come to roam and be seen. Love the Stumphouse coffee shop with its funky layout,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliotf93
40,Great for a stroll and some high-end shopping,"On a sunny afternoon, Melrose Place can be great for a stroll, tea, and browsing high-end brands. The buildings are cute and the shops are less mainstream than Rodeo, however it gets old quickly. Worth a couple of visits per year at most. If you don't live in LA, a single visit should do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmznoh
40,For the name,"Cute little street, but visit it for the name only (if you liked the tv show) as nothing special can be found there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pengemex
50,Celebrity street,This is the street when you can always find celebrities and papparazzi. It is funny. You can also have a good coffe @ Alfred. Don't miss the street market on sundays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610cristianer
40,Quaint Alta Moda Street ...,"We go to Melrose Place ( Not Melrose Ave, ) because it's tiny ( only a few blocks ) and has top name shops and boutiques. The walking is delightful with many trees and greenery plus wonderful architectural details to buildings - like a mini-slice of Europe. Prices are haute, but no more so than on Rodeo. Window shopping & browsing is great, plus the several nice restaurants make it all worthwhile. Fun jaunt with few people! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,The new shopping cool scene of LA,Someone says it is much trendier to go shopping here than in the more glitzy Rodeo Drive.Some of the Shops are truly beautiful with a stunning architecture; some are disguised by big trees or hedges in front of them... Perhaps great for celebs who like their privacy while shopping.Worth a look if you are around!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartiGianlu
40,Great for Strolling,"Not to be confused with Melrose Avenue (nearby), this is a relatively short street to the north of Melrose Avenue. However, it has much less traffic (largely because it does not really ""go"" anywhere and is therefore much more suitable to walking. It has substantially more landscaping, many small boutiques and some restaurants, and overall, a relaxing ambiance (as opposed to the rather hectic and frantic pace of Melrose Avenue). In a busy city with a lot of serious traffic congestion and many recent immigrants with different driving habits, Melrose Place is an oasis. There is some on street parking but not much, but there are some parking lots (expensive) in the immediate vicinity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/og84
30,For those who remember....,"Yeah. About this. It's not where you think it is. The entrance only isn't anywhere near west hollywood. It's actually 4616 Greenwood Place, Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. But people actually live there, so it's a gated community. But for a show that lasted 7 years, it's kinda cool to see (92-99).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacksondc
50,Sunday Farmers Market is the Best,"I was doing consulting work for eight months on Wilshire Blvd and lived a block from Melrose Place. I could not wait for the farmes market each weekend. I have never experienced anything like it. California is blessed with two growing seasons and this farmers market captures the best from the surrounding farms. It is very small by comparison to others, but the prices are low and products are so fresh. This is worth planning a visit when you are in the area or if you live anywhere in LA, Malibu, Calabasas, make it a point to check this out. This is like no place on earth. I miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottPerr
20,shopps are far apart,"We were told that walking melrose ave we would see shop after shop, all different. But the shops were far apart so it was a very long walk. And many of the shops were closed due to failure in economy.There are many better shopping areas in LA. If you have only a few days to shop do not waste your time. One end called melrose place is very high end-the rest of the shops along melrose ave have a variety of price range and will barter on price. at one shoe store shoes for 35 dollars for the very same shoe at fashion district for 20 dollars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hillmel
