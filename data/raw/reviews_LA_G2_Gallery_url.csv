50,"Dazzling, small gallery on hip Abbot Kinney Boulevard","I am a nature girl, and was searching the internet for something special to see on my birthday. And free would be nice, I thought. So I took my young 91-year old mom with me, and off we went to our nature/wildlife adventure. We both loved it! The photographs are extraordinary, as well as the several digital slideshows spaced within this small gem of a gallery. The staff is great, too. I had a question about how one of the pictured fish takes it's food, and he was kind enough to look up the information for me. The photos are changed out every six weeks. I definitely plan on returning, and have already told other fellow nature lovers about G-2. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Towanda4Snix
50,Nature photography,"I chanced upon this gallery when wandering along the boulevard soon after I arrive to stay at Venice Beach. Staff were very interested in telling me about the photographers being exhibited. The aim is to exhibit the work of Nature and Wildlife Photographers of international repute. Proceeds from any sales or prints go to supporting environmental charities. Mark Leevan. Susan Gottlieb and Ron Le Valley in addition to photographs from a collection of the renowned photographer Ansel Adams were on exhibit when I visited.There is more to Abbot Kinney than boutiques, bars and cafes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/908stellaw
50,Ansel Adams and MUCH more in Venice!,"This is a great spot to check out if you're traveling to Venice, CA. Among the hip shops of Abbot Kinney Blvd lies this stunning nature & wildlife photography gallery. Expertly curated and FREE, this is a place you won't want to miss. Perfect for any age, any demographic - read: family friendly! Oh, and did I mention FREE?! If you do, however, decide to purchase a piece of art, know that ALL PROCEEDS benefit local environmental agencies. That's right. This is a high-class, non-profit gallery smack dab in the middle of America's hottest blvd (I know because the magazine GQ told me). In addition to perusing their current shows, make sure to check their calendar of events as you may be able to catch an artist reception, holiday event, or guest lecture series.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeaW_13

50,The G2 Gallery in Venice Beach,"The G2 Gallery is one of the best galleries I've been in throughout Venice and on Abbot Kinney. The gallery mainly features nature and wildlife photography but also is home to a little gift shop where they sell jewelry and books in the front. The place is perfect for both adults and children to visit.Each month they seem to have a new exhibition, currently they're exhibiting photographs by JJ L'Heureux, a noted antarctic photographer. Her photos of the various penguins of the antarctic just warm your heart.Another neat thing about the gallery is that most of the proceeds go to various environmental organizations and causes. The gallery is devoted to keeping green in everything they do.It's a beautiful space and a great spot to visit as you walk down Abbot Kinney!The G2 Gallery1503 Abbot Kinney BlvdVenice, 90291",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caitliwinx
