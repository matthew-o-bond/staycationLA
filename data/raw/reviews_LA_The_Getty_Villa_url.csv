50,Great experience,Great family experience with lots to see and wonderful tours by knowledgeable docents. The buildings are truly amazing and the exhibits are rare and interesting.

40,Legendary Collection Highlights Legendary Malibu Location: Some Pro Tips (B+),"The Getty is a must-visit museum if, and that's a notable if, you are into classic antiquities. It is a second or third-tier attraction for LA if, for example, displays of Roman coins are not your thing. The art examples must be among the very best in the world. The museum is small which surprised us. There is lots of walking. There are stairs but plenty of elevators. Make a reservation as sometimes they turn folks away if it is too busy. The museum is free but the parking, interestingly enough, is not. My last visit to the Getty Villa was 30 years ago. I wish I had not waited so long to return. An excellent museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrGaucho1987
50,Amazing place!,"Amazing place!Parking is $20 per vehicle but then admission is free.Built by J P Getty this is a replica of an Italian Villa. The museum houses his collection of art, artifacts and marble statues from Italy and Greece. There are large beautiful gardens and pools. This is definitely worth visiting.There is one room that is an interactive area for children.Also on the grounds are a cafe and a museum store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiFromOhio
50,Serene,The views are breathtaking. The craftsmanship that went into every element of the entire property is splendid. The gardens are lavish and every fountain is simply stunning. One day is just not enough to see it all. Wear comfortable shoes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Briggsaltenbug
50,The Getty Villa near MALIBU,"This entire Villa and setting is absolutely the best well kept secret as you don't see if from the street. The artifacts and items on display are so very interesting! We had a group tour with a docent named Sally and she offered us so much invaluable information about the Villa, and the gardens. I could visit this museum often. Please do not miss this. Usually you have to make parking reservations as their parking lot is rather small. But, the docents are all friendly and valuable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeverlyT45

50,One of the best!,"The Getty Villa is simply one of the best day museum. The place was well kept and the artifacts that they have there will bring you back in time. Everything about this place is beautiful. The fountain, the square, such a European vibe! I love this place! Not to mention that it's free! You just have to book your ticket in advance. They have their own restaurant inside, a bit pricey but you pay for the ambience as well. Serene, clean, amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dslss
50,Beautiful Day,Our group of five thoroughly enjoyed our day at the Getty Villa. It is absolutely beautiful. We took the architect tour offered by the Getty. The guide wears a mic so that you can hear with the headphones provided. It was hard to hear with the static even after they tried to adjust it. During the architect tour things were brought to my attention that I would have never noticed. So I am very glad we took that tour even though it was hard to hear. We also took a wonderful tour offered by Oasis Bible Tours. We will definitely visit the Getty Villa again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rpsandyfeet
50,Amazing!,"If you love artwork from antiquity, Roman history or just want to see something beautiful - this is your place. Every detail is remarkable - from the Roman style road leading to the villa, to the gardens, to the structure and everything inside! Its awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ModernColumbus
40,For history lovers,"First of all you must book to go, its free, but you have to book your place. Then its $20 to park you car! ($15 after 3) First ticket is for 10 am. We booked the 10.30 and got there about 9.30 and had no problem getting in. May be more difficult at peak times. The villa itself didnt open till 10 but we could look around the grounds.So, the construction of the villa is amazing and the artifacts impresive if you are are interested in that. We were really here to see the grounds as a '1001 garden to see before you die' Well, I probably could have managed but they are lovely and in keeping with Roman times which is why I guess it made the book. They will look much more impressive later in the year.Everything is pristine in and out.We were there about 90 minutesclosed tues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gardengel-IoW
50,Wow! A Real Treasure in Malibu,"You can adequately see this museum in 2 hours, but if you have more time take it. The outside gardens are stunning. This private collection of artifacts from ancient empires is stunning. The museum is free. Parking in a covered garage is $20. Plenty of elevators and ramps if needed. A cafe is available along with a beautiful tasteful gift shop. You can take a guided tour, go on your own and read the good signage, or get the audio system. You must go online and reserve your time. If you can, go to one of the early slots. They start at 10am. We went at 10:30. By 1:00 people were pouring in. You can only enter the museum entrance from the south off of the PCH.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/466judithd

It has several museums, gardens, restaurant and gift shop. Very nice to spend 4-5 hours leisurely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkh_travels
40,Lovely intimate setting with fabulous gardens,Just beautiful. More intimate than the Getty center. Love the gardens! Lovely museum exhibits of a classical nature. Beautiful flooring and details,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AuntTink
50,Fabulous,"It is fascinating to consider that Getty oversaw the entire Villa endeavour from his English country mansion and he never visited the Malibu sight.We were particularly taken with his quote saying visit Herculaneum to see Roman villas as they are now then come here to see how they were in antiquity.The vision and its achievement are stupendous. Recreating the Villa dei Papiri and populating it with an incomparable collection of Assyrian, Greek and Roman art is astonishing.We delighted in viewing the extensive assemblage of pieces, interspersed with walking around the gorgeous ornate gardens and water features.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Don't miss.,"The Getty Villa was one of the highlights of my recent visit to LA. It's a villa inspired by the Villa of Papyri that J. Paul Getty had built to house his collection of art and artifacts from ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria. Normally, ancient art isn't quite my favorite. But the displaying of this art in this particular villa makes for an incredible experience. The villa itself is GORGEOUS. The villa also has four gardens that are wonderful to explore. And the museum displays approximately 1,400 pieces of antiquity spanning 7,000 years (from the end of the Stone Age to the fall of the Roman Empire. Admission is free, but you must make a reservation for timed admission and you'll pay $20 to pay your car. For the three of us, paying only $20 to park the car seemed like a steal. I had read that you should plan to spend one hour here, but I think that's much too short. There's so much to explore: the building itself, the gardens, and the galleries. I recommend you plan to spend 2 hours here. It's really a stunner. I got some amazing photographs, and I certainly recommend the Getty Villa to anyone visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisrachelletx
40,Lots to See in a Beautiful Environment,"We came here at 3 o’clock, because there’s a parking discount after 3pm. Usually pay $20 to park in the museum is free but after 3 PM it’s only $15. We stayed until they closed at five and we could’ve stayed longer. There’s lots to see & the gardens are beautiful. If you enjoy sculpture or Greek/Roman history this is an excellent place to see some beautiful finds that the Getty family collected. The Villa is modeled after one in Pompei, which I had just visited last summer. It is interesting to see the attention to detail.Word of warning: The day we went it was cold and rainy, so we stopped off at the Café to grab a cup of tea. Nowhere does it say that you cannot bring a drink into the house or gardens...But after the guard watch just make a purchase and make our way towards the house he stopped us and told us we cannot eat or drink inside the museum. So we basically had to slam a very hot drink if we wanted to have time to see the museum. It’s a little thing, and I understand if they don’t want food or drink inside of the house/museum. But it would’ve been nice if somewhere in the café this restriction was mentioned, so we wouldn’t have to burn our tongues. We would have ratcheted to wait & have bought a drink after touring.Otherwise, 100% worth the time spent & I’d say give yourself at least 2 hours if you don’t want to rush",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P7634BClauraw
50,It never disappoints,"This is perhaps our 5th visit and it still brings us to our knees. We spend months every year traveling the world and here we are, an hour away away, in total awe. How fortunate can we be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogiacomo
40,Great Way to Spend the Day,"The museum is free, parking is $20.00. We took the guided architecture and garden tour, and then walked around on our own to view the galleries. It was an interesting and beautiful way to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melissa_musgrove
50,A Museum With Amazing Artifacts and Gardens,"I visited the Getty Villa Museum with a friend, and I loved every minute. The artifacts in the museum are amazing, but what distinguishes this museum from others is the amazing garden, fountains and views. I didn't want to leave.It's free admission with parking on-site for about $15 (well worth the cost). Get there with plenty of time to spend time to sit and enjoy the gardens and soak in the beautiful scenery. I highly recommend, and I definitely plan to go again and take family and friends!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/75FA
50,A gift,I was fortunate to visit Pompeii and Herculaneum a few years ago and whilst immersing myself in the amazingly well preserved villas at both locations I wondered... why hasn't someone recreated one of these villas as an example of what they really looked and felt like back in Roman times. Little did I know that J Paul Getty had done exactly that. This place is a gift and is a definite trip highlight for us on our CA road trip.The building itself is enough reason to visit but the museum of relics is a massive bonus.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielT716
50,Outstanding Villa,"The Getty Villa is a fabulous place to visit. The only charge is for parking, the rest of the Villa is free. We took a guided Architecture Tour which I highly recommend. The tour guide we had was knowledgeable and was able to effectively communicate his information. We also took a guided Garden Tour which was enjoyable but not as good as the Architecture Tour. There are several art and sculpture galleries available to enjoy also. There is an excellent place with tables and chairs for a picnic lunch overlooking the Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventurer1234
50,Getty Villa is a great free attraction.,"My wife, mother and I visited the Getty Villa in Malibu in January 2020. We took an Uber to avoid parking and it all went smoothly. The Villa does not have an admission charge which only added to our experience.The Villa itself is based on an ancient Roman Villa covered by the Mount Vesuvius eruption. It is beautiful and there is so much to learn. The exhibits show ancient artefacts from Greece and Roman civilisations. Again, there is so much beauty and so much to learn.There are free guided tours if you wish or you can simply walk through the exhibits at your own pace. There are plenty of benches to sit and just ponder the history.The gardens are beautiful and again are based on the gardens from ancient Villas in the Herculaneum region. They are lovely to stroll through.There is a nice gift shop and the staff are quite helpful. A restaurant is located onsite with a wide menu of high quality items. It’s a bit pricey but the views make up for it.The Getty Villa is an excellent way to spend a day in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Huskieinrooland
50,Getty museum,"The Getty museum is a great place to spend the day.There's so much to see ,the property is beautiful , the buildings are morden clean Sharp lines. The displays are laid out in a easy to fallow pattern. There's a lot to do and see, we had a great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/571harryj
50,Beautiful!,"Wow! What an amazing museum. The villa is just stunning! The views are amazing. The artifacts are so interesting and we didn’t even get to see them all. It’s amazing that the entry is free of charge and you only have to pay the $20 parking charge. You do need pre-arranged entry tickets to get in. The cafe had a decent selection of food- it was a little pricey, but what you would expect considering it’s free to get in. The security lady when you first arrive, Teresa, was very friendly. I am looking forward to returning someday to enjoy the museum more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NW748
40,Great museum,The Getty Villa is very interesting. The Assyria exhibition was fascinating- not sure why I had to come to LA to see the friezes.The skill of the artists was amazing. The building is great. Parts of the garden are lovely but parts of the herb garden needs to be replanted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJMglobaltraveller
50,It's all Greek and Roman to me.,The temporary exhibitions are always worth a visit to this to this superb museum with its outstanding permanent collection that can be visited again and again. The park like setting gives a romantic impression of what a luxury Greek or Roman villa could have looked like a couple of hundred years on either side of the Christian year zero.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rolfa832
50,Wow this was amazing,"Highly recommend a visit here. Gardens and pools, views in addition to large collections of ancient art. Great place to visit more than once. Too much to take in quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/549deanv

50,Do not miss,This was a fantastic tourist attraction. It was free except for the parking. What a fantastic re-creation of a Roman seaside villa! The Greek and Roman collection rivals that of any top museum. The gardens where beautiful with statues everywhere. I highly recommend this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevebC3900EZ
40,Be sure to take one of their tours,Beautiful and interesting to visit. The tours you can take are quite interesting and the guides are extremely knowledgeable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QTHarris
50,Modelled on the father in law’s house...,"A lot of ambiguity remains about many aspects of the private life of J.P Getty. One of the telling aspects of his living breathing scale model of the Villa of the Papyri is that it would most certainly have impressed his father in law. Papyri was almost certainly a home for Calpurnia’s father Lucius Calpurnius to visit her father on her days off from being the wife of a Caesar. And certainly Julius wasn’t short of money... Caesar that is not Baer. Sorry I was temporarily buried in a post-Pompeiian time warp recalling dates... You get the impression that erosion won’t trouble the Getty Villa as a cataclysm already hit the stratigraphy and left it high and dry. Papyri didn’t enjoy the height to stand a chance of escaping burial. But the beautiful entrance from the Pacific Coast Highway provides you with the perfect start to an intriguingly cheerful living tomb of treasures.Look out for the usual bust of Marcus Aurelius which looks uncannily like Cicero ;-)I think J.P housed many artefacts that many other collectors were too superstitious to house themselves. That’s the feeling I gained as I wandered around. The Child of Bacchus represented the Roman fascination with how a child could be bred to be a leader. To deliver man his drink. But it equally could be a miniature monument to a lost boy who gave everything to those who loved him and he loved. Nobody incorporated romance in to belief greater than Ancient Rome.The Getty Trust always being aware of the times has an exhibition on-going at the time of writing; of Assyria and Iraq, which is breathlessly poignant.You do need a car to get there. Public transport from Downtown LA will set you back two hours journey time. And it’s good value when you do arrive: just like at the Getty Center, the $20 parking fee doubles as an entry fee for everyone in the vehicle. J.P obviously left incentives for people to travel through time with their nearest and dearest. His public persona is flawless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jassimalkanani
50,Nice tour,We went on the architecture tour and it was well worth it. Lots of highlights that you miss otherwise.Interesting collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrandMrsT24
50,Great way to spend a day,"A first class experience. This re-creation of a Roman villa comes complete with priceless statuary, beautiful gardens, and live plays in the amphitheater. I learn something new every visit. The sculptures have an appeal for adults while the gardens and reflecting pool are favorites of the kids. I always find a quiet and relaxing feeling when visiting the villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dshores2
50,Nice museum,"You have to have a reservation to go here. There is no charge for the museum but the parking is $20. Plan to spend about 2 hours here. The gardens are really nice and the museum has multiple small rooms with Greek, Roman, and other arts. It was very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cliffview12
50,"Architecture, Gardens, and Art","We enjoyed this equally if not more than the Getty Center. Our visit was enhanced through a free volunteer-led Architecture Tour. Since Getty had this Museum built to recreate Greek and Roman architecture and building techniques, the tour provided the foundation for fully appreciating the details and origins of the Villa. We appreciated that it's free, although there is a fee for parking. If you visit the Getty Center, too, you can get a coupon to park at the Villa on the same day. You also need to reserve on-line a free ticket for entry at a specified time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wis_Badger_Traveler
30,Nice but...,"The Getty Villa was very nice but seemed rather sterile. And, we expected to see the actual Getty home...but not so. Unexpectedly, the buildings and grounds open to the public are patterned on a villa buried in Pompei.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCtravelerWS
50,World-class art center with beautiful outdoor amphitheater for stage plays under the stars!,"Beautiful setting for world class Roman & Greek sculpture & statuary, as is its sister institution, the Getty Center in Los Angeles. However its most outstanding feature is the outdoor amphitheater where creative staging of ancient Greek plays are performed during the summer months. A great reason for flying into LA & Malibu just for the weekend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeenThereEnjoyedThat
50,Wonderful Experience,Everything about this place is special. It is a must see location in Malibu. We tried to see this last year however tickets were not available. So please we got in to experience the beauty of the rich history and gardens. To see some of the items on display and their age makes us realize how important it is to protect human history and art. Ancient objects are meant to be treasured for the public to enjoy. You can certainly enjoy the works of art and history here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448bobc

50,Highly recommended,"My husband and I truly loved the villa and the gardens.We didn’t have too much time, but I didn’t want to miss the Getty Villa. It’s worth taking time to absorb the art collection throughout the villa( two floors). The gardens are beautiful. It’s easy to forget it’s not in Italy. Truly a gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anat4om
50,Well worth the visit,"Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to visit this place.

50,Packed Full Of Ancient Finds,"You can visit both here and The Getty Centre on the same day, and only pay $20 for parking, which is a very good deal, and you still get a good few hours at each. The Getty Villa may well be a replica of an Italian building, but inside there are so many Greek and Roman Treasures, i particularly enjoyed seeing the decorative items of jewellery. The gardens are very pretty too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/38sallyj
50,Villacious Excess and I Loved It,"For the cost of parking, this little slice of southern Italy brings to life the excesses of the first century wealthy, through the eyes of one of the 20th century’s richest men. The genius of Getty’s excess was to bring an Italian villa into such a comparable clime in such sumptuous proportions. The main difference is likely the sea views the first century original enjoyed before being buried for centuries during the mount Vesuvius eruption. The sheer volume of art from the original house was astounding. The beauty and skill reflected in the objects shown how refined some aspects of their culture was in the first century. What an amazing place. If you like anything about Pompeii, you’ll love this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/754thomassp
50,A dream,"Signage on Highway 1 clearly directed me to the driveway leading up to the parking lot of the museum. Parking is pricey but entry to the museum is free and if someone drops you off before the lot there is a way for that car to exit without paying. Besides, if you go to the Getty Center later in the day parking there will be free when presenting a voucher from the info desk at the Villa.We totally enjoyed our visit from the moment we arrived. There was a kiosk on the terrace of the cafe which served ice coffee so we didn't even bother going into the building to line up for the cafeteria-style sevice.After relaxing from the drive into the city we went on to explore the exhibits. I particularly enjoyed a temporary exhibit of finds from the Pompeii villa Getty used as a model for his museum. And, some wonderful, original Greek and Roman statues in a fine state of repair. The Etruscan exhibits were weaker. But, then, it was also a minor culture in comparison. The Greek red figure vessels were particularly impressive.And the gardens with pools, sculpture and fountains. The sounds, sights and smells were entrancing.All in all, this is a small museum with a lot of classical art. There are perhaps too many reproductions of statuary. Mainly in the outside gardens. However, when not original there are clear signs indicating it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfindysz

The art includes Greek and other cultures. The Greek pottery is vibrant and spirited, and the Roman sculptures are outstanding. Be sure to adopt the Roman leisure ideal of ""otium"" and spend some time in the various outdoor garden spaces. There is a theater (check website for plays) and a pricey cafe.

40,Lovely day ends in confusion,"The Villa is a wonderful place but after a long day it is hard to find your way back to the drop off and pick up location. I understand that that they do not want too many signs but there could be more information about how to get down from the far end of the outer peristyle to the circular drive below.We enjoyed the architectural tour, the gardens and the special exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phoebe059
50,Nice quiet museum away from city,"Around the corner from LA, Just off the Malibu ocean, steep gated roman road driveway to parking garage. Museum is free but parking is $20. We had a timed ticket but they didn't seem concerned with it on a week day. Quite a few private school bus trips present. Nice modern entrance with elevators to modern arena and café next to villa. Nice café but pricey. Amazing amount of old Greek and roman statues, jewelry, frescoes, pottery … So much that some of it is also at the other modern Getty museum miles away. Quiet canyon away from everything, you can see a few neighboring houses and a sliver of ocean. Lots to look at and casually enjoy. Reminded me of another tycoon folly Hearst Castle",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevendale
50,Well worth visiting,"Nestling in a 'canyon' facing out over Malibu to the Pacific Ocean, this replica of an Italian Villa displays a beautiful collection of Roman architecture and also there are exhibitions of 'real' statues and other artefacts. The gardens are memorable indicating the considerable thought which has been put in to presenting them as faithful as possible as to what the Romans created. We were fortunate to be taken on a tour of the garden by a delightful, knowledgeable lady and learned so much from her of Roman culture based on how they used these various plants. You have to book to attend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTraveller659
50,Lovely villa with great antiquities,"If you're driving, be sure to make a reservation. When we arrived, they were serious about finding our name on the list before letting us in. Parking costs money but the museum does not charge an entrance fee.I was familiar with the history of how Getty designed this villa, but I agree with another reviewer that more information could be made (perhaps an orientation video?). This is a collection of spectacular antiquities - don't expect paintings. Depending on your level of interest, you may breeze through the museum, stopping only to see something that catches your eye, or you might look at each exhibit and read each label. So the amount of time you will be here can vary quite a bit. We broke into 2 groups and while I took my time seeing many things, my husband enjoyed coffee in the very good cafe. You can also enjoy walking the terrace along the pool.The gift shop is lovely.We did not take a tour, but I think that would be the best way to see this museum. I'm sure I missed things that would have interested me. This was a lovely way to spend part of our day in Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loribbb
40,Touristy Saturday morning,"I was slightly dubious about 1970s copy of an ancient Roman Villa.Undoubtedly a beautiful location.The antiquities are stunning, I’ve been to Italy twice this year and have been to some local museums. The quality of the items here surpassed by a long way these, the museum is sympathetically laid out.If Ancient Roman and Grecian artefacts are your thing, this is a must. If not it’s still worth a visit.I scored it 4 as walked in not knowing where a should go, the most logical route around is. I asked about tours to be told I get them from but they’d started so I must wait 30 mins for next one. So that bit is unclear.Also very little about Mr Getty himself, I think something about him and anecdotes hot he came upon pieces would have been interesting too.All in all I enjoyed this and was pleased I went.Get there early so you don’t get caught up getting in to car park, and best photos - is my tip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Husky-W
50,Definitely visit the Getty Villa (and the Getty Center),"Both Getty properties are amazing. Beautiful art, in gorgeous settings. Inexpensive to visit. Nice cafes and outdoor seating with views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbrothers50
40,Worth a visit if you are in Santa Monica,"Went here 12/09/19, weather fantastic. Easy to find and parking on site but you pay $20 before 3pm. Helpful staff and well worth a visit if you are a museumy type.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charleychester
50,Fascinating and fun,Recommend that you take the free tours that are offered - makes the place come alive. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit there and learned a lot about Roman and Greek history. Very well done!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rabt0123
50,"Great location, amazing collection","Far away from the The Getty, the Getty villa is located close by to Malibu beach. It has a large collection of ancient roman and greek objects and art. It takes at least an hour to get around it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelWorldMap
50,A glimpse of the ancient world,"I had been to The Getty Museum twice before so I told myself to expect less of the villa because it appeared to be smaller and with less grand a view. The Villa is more wonderful than I expected. We didn't realize that we should have gotten tickets in advance. Luckily we arrived early on a slow Monday, so we were allowed to walk-on. The only downside is their closing hours at 5 pm. We could have stayed another 1-2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraV9132013
50,Usha,Mindblowing experienceCouldn't believe such a fantastic collection existed but it was right in front of my eyes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ushablog
50,Beautiful museum in sunny Malibu,"The Getty Villa is a great museum in Malibu. You typically need to make a a free reservation ahead of time. And parking is $20. While we had a reservation, no one ever checked out ticket. On a beautiful sunny Saturday we went to the beach then the museum. It had a great collection and the museum itself is as interesting as the collection. A an Italian villa built to model that of one covered by Vesuvius.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USCKaboom
50,Relaxing place in almost European style,"The villa is not big but cosy and calm, being constructed as a Roman style villa. It’s situated in a beautiful park in Malibu. From the terrace you have the ocean view. I totally enjoyed the summer smells of the Herb garden. The admission is free. So, if you want to escape from the big city and feel the Mediterranean atmosphere, the place is for you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightsee419201
50,Great museum/education center,"Great museum/education center. A recreation of an actual Roman Villa. What is really impressive (is basically everything) but especially the guided tours by the very well informed volunteer docents. Parking is $20 but the Villa, like the Getty Center is free. Go on-line and make a reservation before you visit. The reservations are mainly to control the limited parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/183RobertR

The place is gorgeous, the service perfect (free shuttle from the main door if you come with public transportation), amazing house and garden + stunning pieces of art ! Don’t miss it ! If you have the chance, you can also attend a concert or a play in the outside theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/254jeromeh
50,Funnest audio tour I've ever had!,And they didn't pay me to say that! they made a little narrative to make the self- guided walking tour really engaging. Loved it- highly recommend for the Greek mythology buffs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darwind411
40,Beautiful and inspiring,I visited the Greek exhibits and there is such amazing detail shown in the works. Everything felt authentic and I felt like I was really stepping into Greek culture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/creamdream
50,Learning day,Very nice museum that contains 3000 BC pieces!!! We took children to entertain them in educational way. We were amazed by all collections.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nguyenvi252
50,Absolutely Incredible.,"We had off-day in our itinerary and decided to visit the Getty Villa, believing it would be a good distraction in advance of a lingering lunch and our evening flight. We stayed for nearly 5 hours. The Getty Villa is an absolutely must see. They have several repeating tours throughout the day. They are limited capacity tours so arrive about 15 minutes in advance to get your ""sticker.""Admission is free but you need to reserve tickets. They do charge $20 for parking. If you visit on Wednesday through Sunday, you can get a voucher to visit the Getty Museum and park for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WineauxAlexandria
50,Gorgeous,The Getty Villa is stunning. This was the last stop of our LA trip. We definitely saved the best for last! One of the most amazing art collections I’ve ever seen.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbarryman88
50,Stunning vista and stunning art collection,"Our family of four stopped at Getty Villa on our way from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara as part of a week long trip to Southern California. This museum is a must see. The sculpture and art pieces are amazing. The setting (a recreated Roman villa) along side the ocean, is without compare.There is no per person entry fee for the museum, but they do charge a $20 parking fee ($15 if you arrive after 3p). For our family of four that arrived shortly after 3p, we paid only $3.75 per person to visit this museum. What a deal! There are plenty of benches and areas to sit to just enjoy the views and art. The museum shop is wonderful as well. This will be a must-see everytime we're in SoCal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkaykay19
50,5 Stars Again,"Even on a beachday Sunday, the Getty Villa is worth visiting. It's easy to reserve a free ticket online that guarantees you a parking space. Although the fee may seem hefty to some, but becomes a real LA bargain as it also includes parking at the Getty Center (we exchanged our receipt from the Villa for a paid parking ticket at the parking office). Their special exhibits work on many levels -- from the scholar to the school kid. They have a gift shop, an indoor restaurant, an outdooor cafe, and an amphitheater for performances wrapped in an awesome Mediterranean garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
50,Good place for visiting,Was happy to know more of Getty and Los Angeles. Many interesting things to make you good. Like it and my family was too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909sergeim
50,Beautiful...must visit,"On a recent visit to LA, we decided to visit the Getty Villa. First you go online to secure a free reservation. Having said that we did not need to verify this when we arrived. Second we decided to take Uber which was very convenient.The villa has so much to offer. Great views, lovely gardens, amazing architecture, and art. We went on a weekday and crowds were minimal. The staff was friendly and helpful. The café had great food. The idea behind the Villa clearly emerged during our visit. A very educational and peaceful visit...wow!! Love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSQRD1
30,Must Pay $20,This place makes you pay $20 to park unless you get dropped off. They will stop you and not allow you to walk in. They advertise they are free and it does not tell you that on website.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmarie83
50,Incedible museum in a beautiful setting,"Unlike the Getty Center, you can see the collection at the Getty Villa in one day - and still have time for lunch. Parking at the Villa is limited to reserve (and pay for) your parking before you go. Besides the permanent collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan works there is also a special exhibit of interest. Usually, it relates to this permanent collection - but it can also be a collection of Mayan or Aztec artifacts. The restaurant offers sandwiches and meals: you order at the counter, are given a number on a little stand which you place on your table, and the food is brought to you.Besides the collection in the museum, stroll around the property and you will feel like you are visiting a Roman villa, transported back in time ..... or transported to Italy. And, don't miss the herb garden adjacent to one side of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GareThere
50,An immersive experience,"My 18YO son has long enjoyed the history of the ancient Greeks and Romans and learned a lot about them in his Latin classes in high school. The Getty Villa was a highlight of our trip to the LA area and especially meaningful for him. The location and buildings are beautiful, overlooking the ocean in the distance. The detail of the gardens, the paintings on the walls, everything, was amazing. It's free to go but you need timed tickets and you will pay for parking. The food was expensive and not plentiful so I recommend eating before or after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelgirl88
50,"Hidden Gem, buy your tickets to go.","This is well worth a visit if you are in the area but you need to book your tickets before you go. Parking on site cost $15. There are stairs but we used the elevators which are provided. The outdoor gardens, fountains and pools of the Villa dei Papiri (Reimagined) are beautiful and inside there is an interesting collection of classical art and architecture from Greek and Roman times. It was a lovely museum to walk around and we spent just under 3 hours visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Honeybun51
50,GET RESERVATION. DEFINITELY A WORTHWHILE STOP.,"Daughter had one rule on vacation: No Museums. Drove by and said ""hey lets see whats going here its supposed to be nice."" After asking if we had reservations, they let us in anyway, best of luck. We spent hours there and had a great time looking at the gardens and art. Top 10 SoCal to do. Daughter said ""its ok to break the rules sometimes.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/424bradleyv
40,Beautiful and Great Food,We enjoyed the museum but did not care for the audio tour. The first part was rather ridiculous and seemed like it was for kids but it did get better. The food in the cafe was fantastic. You order from a line but then they bring it to your table. There is both inside and outside seating. We originally had champagne and pizza as a brunch and then dinner items later. It was all excellent. The gardens and the views are so relaxing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsPickle
50,Outstanding Museum,We spent several hours here enjoying the collections and the villa itself. The setting is amazing. It is remarkable that one man collected all this stuff. The museum is manageable to see thoroughly in a day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mamjensen
40,Beautiful,"Located in Malibu the villa is worth a visit. I got there when it first opened and it was very quiet. This was a week day. By 12pm it was getting busy, with school trips and visitors. Lots of lovely things to see within the villa. A lot of Greek art pieces. The villa itself and beautiful to explore. It’s worth a half day visit. Lovely gift store with some very beautiful pieces. Admission is free. I got my ticket online the event before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ero40
50,Small but worth to visit,"There are many pictures of the Getty Villa in tourist attraction websites but I still find this place is much smaller than I expected.It has a main building as the museum, a side building as a gift store and a cafe. Definitely amazed by the quality of the collection because it has antique vase and sculptures which made thousands years ago. Don't miss the guided tour. All guided tours are free. We went to the exhibition tour talked about items excavated from Villa dei Papiri after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. It was very interesting and informative. Two tours a day for this topic, 12 noon and 1 pm, accept to register to the tour 15 minutes before the tour, easily fill up. The Percy Jackson tour is a plus. It is a audio tour, very good for children.The cafe is great, with tables indoors and outdoors, and the food is not bad.The collection at Getty Villa is very different from Getty Center. If you interested in Greek mythology, it is definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Einac_Uhc
50,Better than the Getty centre,I went here after visiting the Getty centre (which I didn’t like). This is far more interesting as it’s his actual villa. Make sure you pick up an audio guide - it’s easy to miss.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HaysConly
50,Amazing and Unique,Loved our visit to the Villa - the combination of the building and the attention paid to it's construction together with the incredible contents was amazing.We did the architectural tour and also the garden tour - both excellent.We spend approx 4 hours there and it wasn't enough!If this is your type of thing don't miss but don't forget to reserve the (free) tickets in advance,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ItchyFeet319
50,Stunning,Great day out with adults. Don't think it would be suitable for young kids though. Magnificent spot and interior design. Worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CerysM27

50,"Awesome, inspiring and humbling You have to go there","I had already visited the Getty museum on my last trip to LA. My son and his partner who live in LA had never been to the Villa so we went with some friends. This was an amazing afternoon, wandering through the beautiful garden, and the villa that is so beautifully presented, No detail missed and all the art from as far back as 1000s BC. The statues carving pottery and the amazing hand blown glass. And if you love jewellery, the pure gold pieces will blow your mind. It should be on your bucket list. AND FREE admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BellaGoldCoast
50,Incredible Museum,"The Getty Villa is an incredible place. Everyone who go Los Angeles should visit it. The building is really beautiful.

For instance.there is a Roman mummy, and old papyrus recovered from Pompey.The Caffe is also exceptional.You pay only the parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/590cristianc
40,Great place to visit,"Apart from access to the site, which is pretty poor from the main road when traffic is heavy the venue is great. The artefacts are amazing and the guides are very knowledgeable. Everything in close proximity so not too much walking. Certainly worth a visit and venue is free apart from car parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillf562
50,"A special oasis above Malibu; tranquil gardens, world class antiquities","Enjoyed a lovely couple of hours here. The collection has been reorganized since we were here a dozen years ago, and we enjoyed the exhibition of objects found in recent years at the Italian site at Herculaneum, on which this Villa is modeled. The guided tour of the collection highlights was informative, though it went a little too slowly for our taste. The cafe food was very disappointing--pre-fab pizza and such--while also being very overpriced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sprout15
50,Good 2 hour tour,We did the self guided tour which was good for our group of 5. The gardens we beautiful and the exhibits were well presented. Tickets were free and easy to get on line.

50,Beautiful Villa,"Villa Getty is one the place I always bring friends and family who visit us in LA. the grounds are spectacular and the and the recreations of ancient Roman architecture and gardens is impressive. From mosaic fountains to indoor courtyards to the garden landscaping, it truly does have an authentic Roman domus feel throughout.The exhibits are always interesting and the sculptures and statues are just awesome. Feels like stepping into an alternate era while you're there.Access is free although you do have to make reservations and pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcoFDD
50,Bible tour,"We loved coming here and doing the JW Oasis Bible tour.It was super informative, we leaned so so much about history and world events played out from the Bible - just fascinating.The grounds are spectacular.

50,Travel Back in Time to Unknown Luxury,"Paradise the moment you drive onto the villa property! Glorious gardens surround you as you make your way up to the free Getty Villa, housing beautiful statuary indoors and out, all authentic from the Greek civilization of ancient times. Impeccably rendered pottery in classic orange and black, some over 2’, await your perusal and plenty of classic benches to sit on between works of art, indoors and out, bronze works and tiled fountains and pools. Handicap access was excellent with elevators in all locations. Entrance is free; pay only for parking. There is a small cafe on the top floor with light meals and beverages. A beautiful view overlooking the ocean and an herbal and floral garden downstairs. You feel as if you’ve gone back in time and living your own life in this outstandingly beautiful villa.

50,Beautiful gardens and museum!,"A group of four of us went on a Saturday afternoon and reserved free tickets the day before (there is $20 parking but entry is free besides that). The gardens and grounds are beautiful and full of lush plants, fountains, and Greek statues.

50,Stunning villa overlooking the Pacific,"On our third visit to LA in 5 years, we finally made it to The Getty Villa near Malibu on an overcast and cool day in June. You need to reserve your (free) timed-entry tickets online although when we arrived, no one asked to see our tickets. I did question this and was told that it wasn’t a busy day so there was no need to check tickets.There were many artefacts in several rooms on 2 floors in the villa. The highlight was the stunning pool and wonderful planting all around the grounds including the herb garden. A shame the sun wasn’t shining but at least it wasn’t raining. We had planned a whole afternoon here but actually ended up spending around 90 minutes. Parking is around $20 but we used Uber. This is definitely worth a visit and can easily be combined with a few hours in Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElMundo66

A really nice day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbnyla
50,Great Place to Visit,Beautiful villa with lots of great pieces of artwork. Great views. It would be nice to be able to walk up or down from the base area.

50,Location location location,"This lovely Roman styled villa with antiquities is perfectly located near Malibu. Great docent led tours make for an enjoyable time visiting the villa.

We were there when there was a live human art exhibit during our visit, and that added to the charm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kashgo
50,Marvelous Museum,"This is well worth a trip to Malibu to see the Getty Villa. The day I went it was rainy and it was still amazing. The museum supplies visitors with umbrellas which I did need since a majority of this attraction is outside. there is a charge for parking but the entrance into the Museum is free with reservations. Once inside all the tours are free and worth your time. I went on the garden tour and learned so much about the beautiful Villa gardens. The tour was only 30 minutes but well worth it and that allowed plenty of time to look around the museum. The views of the Pacific oceans are breathtaking so be ready to take some photos. If it had not been raining I would have stayed longer, overall a great visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BDarst

50,World Class Attraction,We took a short trip to So Cal and this was the star attraction of our trip. An absolutely stunning property with historical significance. Every view from the property is amazing. The detail and the quality that went into the build is beyond compare. I have toured all over the world and this is special. You basically will need to book tickets online that are free in advance. I believe the parking carried a modest fee. Property is really peaceful and calming. It is just like stepping into a history book.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayfieldParrish
50,Worth the drive alone... or make it part of other Malibu Adventures.,"Great artifacts with great descriptions. A beautiful garden too, as the building and grounds we always meant o be an integral part of the experince.One could enjoy a short visit along with other Malibu attractions, like beach, hiking, and/or dining. Also worth the drive to just visit the Villa.FREE to visit, like the other Getty is, just make a reservation and pay to park.I went on a Theatre night - I saw the SITI Co, perform ""The Bacchae"" Check the schedule for shows. If you buy a seat to see a show in the Amphitheater, the entire villa will be cleared out of visitors and only open to audience members. Support the arts... get there early and it's like having the entire place all to yourself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat
50,Simply Amazing,J Paul Getty as mast a large wealth. He was an art lover and started collecting. He started storing his collection at the Getty Villa location. he then decided to build the magnificent structure which is a re-creation of the largest Roman private home have a sound. It was destroyed in the eruptions of Mount Vesuvius but Getty persevered and recreated it down to the statues with no eyes.this was where his collection of art remained until the Getty Museum in the hills of Los Angeles what's built. I took one of the walking tours with one of the doscents that was just filled with information and it made you appreciate what you were seeing with your amazed eyes. I highly recommend coming to this incredible retreat so close to the action of Malibu and yet 2000 years away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlainB2394

If you visit the Getty Center first you can obtain a free parking pass and tickets for entrance to the Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F8314LTjackf
50,A trip to Ancient Greece,"Went to the Villa after about 25 years since my last visit. It’s even better than I remembered. The whole villa and grounds have been so updated and are greatly improved for the visitors. Parking, elevators, trails, etc make it super accessible. Of course the main attraction are the treasures housed in a perfect “villa” straight from Greece. The treasures inside the Villa are spectacular. The way the exhibit is so well organized that you are traveling to antiquity in a time machine. Every piece is an aw treasure. A visit to the Villa is good for all ages. If interested in the evolution of western civilization it’s great, if interested in war in ancient times, or family life, or art, etc. One can find something of beauty. The fountains and gardens are a wonderful peaceful place to enjoy open spacers. If any one planning a trip to Greece visiting the Villa prior to your trip it would be a great primer. Enjoy it, take your time and soak in the sunshine and the beauty",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ikemx

Not only does it have a fascinating history it looked to be a beautiful place to visit.The staff were absolutely adorable when we turned up early in the morning just after opening time. We hadn't booked but were lucky to be able to wander around all for free.The place is truly special, filled with art works and sculptures, it is serene and peaceful.The gardens are kept impeccably well by gardeners. You will soon be hoping that you could live here.It is definitely a place I was surprised at how much I enjoyed seeing it. I would be adding it to my list of things to see in LA.Make sure to check online and book a ticket, as we were just lucky as we are such early birds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyA207
50,Amazing grounds and collection of ancient artifacts,"History buffs of the ancient world will love this place! Because you must have a pre-reserved ticket, the # of visitors is strictly controlled, so it never feels crowded. Having been to Greece and Pompeii, I really enjoyed being inside the villa and seeing all the antiquities. Parking is $20, but the villa entrance is free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UAprofessor
50,Beautiful place,"The park around the villa is just outstanding.Everything is so beautiful and so well arranged.Green trees, flowers, the statues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlaHazout
50,Pleasant environment & peaceful surroundings,"The Getty Villa is just that......a recreation of a villa of ancient times in Naples. Our morning visit was perfectly enjoyable & relaxing. Strollinng through the villa inside & out is very enjoyable. The exhibitions of greek & roman are very interesting & the interpretation & information is easy to understand especially for visitors who may not have been to these cities. There are school groups also wandering around with instruction on the history by teachers, but in no way causing any intereference to the public. Even meadering through the herb garden was pleasant. Tour guides are free as is the entry.....has a good cafe & lifts to everywhere including parking bays. Accessable by all including wheelchair visitors. The exhibitions on display are beautifully presented .....at this villa there is no art wkork collections mainly pottery, statues, glassware, jewelry all from the Neolithic through to late antiquity 500Ad.The admiration & wonder of how this legacy has fostered so much in philanthropy & is an ongoing gift to future generations in a country so far from where the history developed is amazing.I cant wait to visit the Getty musuem on my next visit at a different location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soothedtraveller
50,MUST SEE IN MALIBU JUST OFF PCH,The Getty Villa is a must see in LA. The place the history the setting. I am so happy we went. This is a museum that is a re creation of a Roman Villa. The art work is Ancient Greek and Roman. The gardens and the pools. I just cannot even explain the place. The cafe was actually really delicious and we had a Mediterranean chicken wrap. You really feel transported to another place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cymcym
20,Ugh,"I was told J. Paul lived here and I was really looking forward to seeing his living quarters. No such luck. The ranch house where he briefly lived has been converted into offices. There's nothing to see.The Villa is an excellent replica come on but I didn't come here just for that architecture. I came here for the collection. There were far too many broken pieces. I'm not sure if he was giving bad advice, or if you just had undemanding taste. It was no single spectacular work of art.For my son and I, this was sort of like a collection of rejects that museums refuse to buy. Skip it, you won't miss anything other than the $20 you have to pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyMan1963
50,Wonderful hidden gem,A last minute find on trip advisor turned out to be a highlight of our trip to California. Peaceful beautiful and educational. We had a relaxing and pleasant afternoon ! Highly recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I7128MEmarym
50,Nice to visit,"Must visit if you are in LA. Is like you are visiting a rich friend's house, a star of Hollywood. The villa looks amazing from inside to outside. Plenty of people places to eat or to sit. I spent there about 2 hours. The entrance was free but Parking must be paid at location $15",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/checkoutmiami
50,Overwhelming!,The number of visitors at any given time is limited. Tickets have to be obtained online ahead of time for a particular time slot. Parking does cost. See the website. This Museum contains an unbelievable number a beautiful and fascinating artifacts. To understand it and what it offers it is probably best to look it up online and browse. The setting is gorgeous. The building is gorgeous. The Landscaping is gorgeous. Allow at least 2 or 3 hours to browse the collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbear43
50,This one is a must...,"Amazing architecture, gardens, artifacts, etc. Visit a must. Entry is free after paying parking fee $20",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikhailD743
40,Nice building,"The roman villa reproduction is a great place to walk around with the gardens the highlight. The antiquity collection isn’t very big or well organised but has some great stuff but it only kept me occupied for an hour. The villa’s easy to get to on bus 534 from Santa Monica but then they won’t let you walk to the top, you have to wait in the sun for a rickety old van to take you up. Free entry and I booked online but no one was checking tickets so I think they’re only used at peak times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
50,Absolute Must Do on the way to Malibu,The Getty Villa a museum dedicated to the arts and cultures of ancient Greece and Rome. The villa has a huge collection of antiquities dating from 6’500 BC to 400 AD. The property is beautifully located in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of L.A.. Go on your own or join one of the daily guided tours. You won’t regret it! Admission is free but on-site parking is $20.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MontyStoller
40,Nice morning out,"A nice place to visit. We went on a beautiful day. It was pretty crowded. But we had a nice stroll through all of the galleries. The fog cleared, and we got a great view of the Pacific Ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/delingei
50,Hidden Enchantment,The Getty villa is a wonderful day excursion to get off the grid (turn off the phone) and enjoy a secluded garden and some cool art work as well. My wife and I visit about once a year and always find something new and interesting to see. The grounds are spectacular and the pace is your own...parking is a breeze with reservations and the whole experience will be memorable. First rate in every respect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billiebear1
50,MUST SEE,"This place is out of this world! If you are interested in history, antiquities and architecture, go to the Getty Villa! It's free to get in (parking is $20) and you will see some of the most amazing artifacts from ancient Rome and Greece in the USA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/987mollyl
50,A beautiful stroll in Malibu,"Once you see it, you won’t forget it. Beautiful architecture, nice art collection, wonderful views of the ocean.If you pay entrance at Getty Center, you can use same ticket to visit the villa.Worth the visit even if you have only 1/2 hr to spend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellec747
50,"Stunning recreation of the art, architecture and gardens of first century Naples",The Getty Villa is simply gorgeous. The beauty of the grounds and the architecture far exceeded my expectations.The setting is amazingly pastoral and they have done a great job shielding the site from the surrounding LA bustle.The collection itself is first rate. The British Museum's Elgin Marbles are more spectacular but the breath of the Getty collection and the surrounding architectural experience makes for a remarkable experience. Even the reproduction mosaics and castings in the gardens enhance the feeling that you are in a Classical Roman estate in ways that originals in glass cabinets can not.The entire experience was delightful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrailBlazer822019
40,Lunch overlooking an Italian Villa,My friend had the salad and I had the chicken wrap for lunch. Both were delicious and the large patio was able to accommodate large groups. It was great to eat and overlook the stunning museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolmW560JA
50,Nice way to spend a morning in Malibu,You must purchase your free tickets ahead of time online. We went for the 10 a.m. ticket. We went through the villa. It's amazing how much was collected. It's all Greek and Roman art. The setting itself is also nice to see. We went through it in about 2-2.5 hours. We then had lunch in Malibu and then went over to the Getty Center. You can definitely do both in the same day with lunch in between. Just watch your time carefully. Highly recommend the Getty Center as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TW-444
30,A Day Trip of Expanding the Mind,"The entrance to getting there is underwhelming due to the construction. This also leads to congestion in getting in and out of the place. There is a $15 parking fee but aside from that, it’s free. The only other things you would buy are the gift shops or the cafe.The cafe is obviously overpriced but not TOO bad for the quality. I suggest either eating before you go or bring some small snacks to tie you over.When you walk into the property, the fragrance of the flowers is nice. However, we did go at the wrong time, most of the trees and flowers were still dormant which again made it underwhelming when it came to the visual aspect of the gardens.The tours are a nice touch but our guide had a thick accent which made it difficult to understand what she was saying. I did like some of the knowledge she had of the place but some of her pronunciation was definitely incorrect of some of the Greek characters.The architect of the buildings are gorgeous and the displays were quite amazing. I can see the place being annoying when the place can get crowded but it was fine this day.All in all it was nice and would recommend it if you wanted to have a nice stroll and some intelligent conversation about artworks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hwhytee
50,"Excellent combination of grounds, building and art","Given that admittance is free, although motorists pay to park, The Getty Villa is a gem. The villa and museum are wonderfully sited overlooking the coast and incredibly well laid out. On our visit the management and staffing were excellent too. Whilst antiquities are not our thing,one had to admire the property, its contents and grounds.Incidentally our party of four took a picnic lunch to eat in a shaded area of the grounds, which worked well.This experience was one of our highlights of our visit to Los Angeles. Strongly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129DavidA129
50,We could have stayed for days,"The art is nice, but the building and grounds were what we loved. The courtyards, pools, fountains, gardens, views - everything maintained with extreme care. The docents were knowledgeable and helpful, and the free audio guide was very good, adding to the already good signage. Very easy to get to from Santa Monica. Not too crowded on a Wednesday morning, but there were many school kids, all very well behaved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/architect_ed
50,Tough taking the family -- I could have spent the whole day reading EVERYTHING,"Art dating well back into the Renaissance was well-represented in the Getty collection -- even my 13 yo found works that spoke to him. Of course, its $2.2bn endowment has made for quite a collection, and quite a wonder museum layout to present it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AaronDial
50,Roman architecture and antiquities,"First some business: it’s free, but parking is $20. You must pre-order the free tickets online to gain admission. Wonderful replica of tickets first century Roman Villa. Very fancy as you might expect. Although smaller than the Getty museum, plenty of antiquities. Two free hourly tours of gardens and architecture. We particularly enjoyed the architectural tour with many interesting facts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TB_Rays_fan_NJ
40,Gorgeous villa filled with antiquities,"We spent about 3 hrs at the villa including time for lunch. First we watched the short movie telling the story of how and why the villa was built. There are 2 floors of ancient greek, roman and etruscan statues, sculptures, pottery, art, frescoes, mosaics, jewelry, useful objects and even a mummy! You can borrow a free audio device and headphones at the desk and enter the number of any object you're interested in to hear more about it (you couldn't do this for every item or you'd be there for days!) There are also guided tours focusing on specific areas of interest but we were happy going at our own pace and sometimes listening in on a guide's description. The outdoor spaces are lovely and offer a great place to rest and admire the beauty all around you. It was amazing to me that there was no entrance fee, just like at the main Getty center. However, parking was $20 and lunch was fairly expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eldoradogirl
50,Great,"I've to this place many times in the past. Beutiful. And very interesting. Kind of hidden. If you plan on visiting... make sure you won't miss the entrance... otherwise... you'd have to drive far to find a first place to make a u-turn. Has a lot of paintings, sculptures... tea house... very quiet... and a lot of trees.. definitely place to visit when first time in LA. I like Getty villa more than Getty center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alwayztravel
50,Top notch antiquities art museum,Amazing collection in an exquisitely beautiful setting that recreates a palace from Pompeii. World class art experience!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasmY6358DP
50,Always Amazing,"This was my second visit here and it was just amazing as the first. I love this place, could spend hours there.The building, the gardens and the art are great, everything is well done here.The cafe as well, has great food in both areas so you can spend the day there, it is just amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/das1234
50,"Restored and beautiful, perfect reconstruction of an ancient Roma's Villa","What a great experience , it's wonderful to enjoy the real architecture of Ancient Rome today and walk through it 's beauty ! The"" Italian garden "" is also amazing and makes you realize that even the ""Versailles Palace"" has been inspired by the Ancient Rome architectureA must go if in town",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariaCristinaHeller
50,Stunning place,"I visited the Getty Villa twice during my trip. I ordered my ticket online for my first visit. I knew my husband would want to see the display of antiquities here, so on his only free day during his convention, returned with him.Whether you are interested in antiquities or not, I imagine most people would be wowed by the sheer beauty of the Villa itself and the exterior grounds.Lots of school trips were here, but after 1pm the place was quiet as I imagine a lot of the kids had left.Go here, you will love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrWagnerMilton
50,Such beauty!,"First of all, the drive on PCH to arrive to this destination adds to the enjoyment of the day. The Getty Villa is not only filled with fascinating antiquities, but gorgeous gardens and architecture. As a gardener I enjoyed the grounds as much as the museum. I found the exhibit on Palmyra to be my favorite for the explanations of the funerary sculptures from the ancient city of Palmyra in what is now Syria. There is a bit to learn about the lifetime of the deceased through the symbolism behind the sculpting details. The views from the balconies are beautiful and the ocean breeze so pleasant as one walks the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gardengal61659
50,Visit the Villa,"The Getty Villa has an amazing collection of ancient artifacts. I took a tour and really enjoyed it very much. The museum is located in Pacific Palisades just of the Malibu beach area. I took a tour on Saturday and the a lot of people were visiting, but it was not over crowded. I highly recommend the Getty Villa as place to visit. They have a café, gift shop, audio tour, and lunch area for picnic lunches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VRJ714
50,Billionaire's Retreat,"Stunning property with amazing museum of ancient artifacts covering 1,500 yrs. Please note that visitation is by reservation in advance only. Tickets are free via on-line but days can sell out quickly. You will have to pay for parking in their multi-level parking garage but it's worth it. Gardens are superb and I recommend going early as you will spend no less than 3 hrs on the property. Take both the garden tour and the architecture tours. Free and with earbuds and receiver to ensure you hear the guide. They also have a nice cafe with relaxing views overlooking the villa. While the Villa is a modern creation mimicking one discovered in the 1800's in Italy near Pompeii, it still gives you the sense of awe. All of the museum artifacts are the real deal, collected at great expense by J. P. Getty over the years. Many of the statues on the grounds are replicas but the herb garden and flowers are impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jolangfo
50,Wonderful Experience,"The Villa is magnificent, with a fascinating history. Take the Architecture guide (free) before the Garden as the building is so interesting and you are introduced to many beautiful statues and designs, as well as seeing the amazing Etruscan and other, artefacts We found this a place with beautiful photo opportunities too. Highly recommended for adults, it may be less attractive for young children although they are welcomed. Many school trips go there, it is easy to get around and not overwhelming in size. No entry charge but book in advance as they do not allow overcrowding. Plenty of shady spots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatHel7
40,Beautiful building filled with ancient art,"This lovely setting was created as a home for the collection of ancient Roman artifacts of J. Paul Getty. It consists predominantly of statues and ruins from the early Roman Empire. In addition to the building and art, there are lovely gardens and outdoor areas. A few hours is probably enough time to see all this venue has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel92253
50,Roman Villa facing the Pacific,"A short trip away from the sometimes surreal LA you will feel transported back in time at The Getty Villa tucked into the beautiful Malibu hillside. Choose from one of the free tours offered onsite; the Villa or the Gardens. You'll pick up points on classic architecture and see how well the old blends effortlessly with new additions completed in 2006. Feast on stunning Greek and Roman artwork, courtyards, landscaping and beautiful views. Admission is free, but important that you reserve on-site parking in advance if coming by car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franced347
50,Guided Tour,"My wife and I went to the Getty to have a guided tour that was hosted by Oasis Tours. Our friend Doug was the guide, what a great time we had. Doug is very knowledgeable and made the time go by fast but at the same time be informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M5572XQchrisc
40,Worth a visit,"My husband and I spent a morning here , it is quite amazing what a person with money can surround himself with the villa is an amazing reproduction of remains found in Pompeii, we did the garden tour which was very informative. If you are intending to be there all day take a packed lunch as the food is very expensive. Also we didn't book just turned up and they let us in .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lillyKent
50,Lovely place to visit,"To people in the UK this is familiar from the TV series 'Trust'. At the end of this the model of Getty's villa was wrecked as he was criticised by the press for it's architectural failings. One suspects, reading the life of JP, that his personality somewhat affected their judgement. The villa is built as a pastiche of a villa near Naples destroyed by the eruption that finished off Pompeii. To be entirely accurate, it IS therefore a pastiche, a copy, of something original. However, it is a beautiful building, set in beautifully maintained grounds, and is rather a nice place to visit. The art collection is excellent. Not so extensive that one gets 'Art-Fatigue' looking at it, but containing representative examples of the best art that it is of interest even to a person not overly 'arty'. We spent a very pleasant morning there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianp896
30,OK.,"It was OK. Certainly not what I expected. The villa was amazing, no doubt, but I found it boring. Should have visited the Getty Center as others told me! I was also told to reserve tickets online for this 'attraction' but once at the Villa, no one checked any tickets and staff were just chatting around with each other. Won't be visiting it again when I return to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orcadas
40,Worth a visit even if you're not into the art...,"This is certainly a good museum to visit if you're into ancient Greek or Roman art (i.e., sculpture, pottery, etc.). But even if you're not, the museum location alone is worth a visit just to check out the view and the surroundings. It's quite peaceful and tucked away - reminds me of the Cloisters in NYC. A nice way to spend an hour or two on a random afternoon. Note that the website does specify that you need to book free, but timed, tickets for entry - though in actuality I didn't have anyone actually check when I arrived.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vichy
50,Wonderful American Treasure!... a must for your bucket list,"The Getty Villa is a wonderful adventure! Plan the better part of a day for this experience. Visiting the villa is free, but you need a ticket (to reserve your arrival time slot) and parking is $20. There are four different free guided tours: Architecture, Gardens, Exhibition, and Collection Highlights, and/or you can spend hours self-touring. It's a fascinating villa modeled on the Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum that was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. There's a cafe with good, but relatively expensive, food. If you're ever in the LA area and you like ancient history, this is definitely worth a day of your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidfD5435VJ
50,Lovely gardens,"We stopped in during our Spring break with a 15 year old along which made for extensive art viewing not all that viable. Nonetheless, we all appreciated the beautiful gardens, buildings and grounds which were truly lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmericanexpatKL
50,"Returned 35 years later, the same only better","The buildings and exhibits have not changes in 35 years, but new items have been added, and the building expanded to include an outdoor amphitheater, parking garage, etc.The interior beauty is only superceeded by the outdoors setting.A great way to spend the day.FYI, we arrived a half hour late and they didn’t bat an eye.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsCasualTravelor
30,Not What We Expected,"This was not at all what we remembered from the 70's and it is not on par with the Getty Museum. But it was worth an afternoon on our way South from Santa Barbara.Go online to make a reservation for parking ($15) to assure entry to the museum, which is free. It's built into the hillside, so there is a good bit of walking on ramps and stairs or elevators. My first impression was disappointment at the modern-looking , sleek, reproduction of what was to represent an ancient city.We stopped at the info desk for maps and to ask about guided tours, and the young girl was curt and not very knowledgeable. We then proceeded to the guided tour area, where we were instructed to return 15 min. before each tour to ""sign-up"". Fortunately, these do not fill-up like at the Getty Museum, so we were able to enjoy both the Architecture and Collection Highlights tours. Our guides were very experienced (26 & 31 yrs guiding) and able to provide many interesting behind-the-scenes details and answer all questions from our small groups.Lunch was $29 to share a brie burger w/fries ($18), 1 water ($5) and 1 lemonade (3.75).We're glad we stopped by for the 4 hrs, but also happy we didn't make a special trip to see it, and won't return. We much prefer to spend 2 days at the Getty Museum and other sights if we head to LA.FYI, We had had made dinner reservations at Gladstone's across the street at the beach to avoid traffic, but left early and cancelled that part.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bchgrl9
40,Extraordinary recreation of a villa from Pompei,"The most sumptuous recreation of a palatial villa partially excavated in Pompei. It is filled with extraordinary statues, precious objects and fascinating information of the ancient civilisation of Greece, Rome, Egypt , the Etruscans etc. The gardens and pool are truly glorious.The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was because a precious( to me ) broach , which I foolishly left on my coat when i checked it in to the cloakroom wasn’t there when I went to put it on 30 minutes later. It had a safety catch so couldn’t have fallen off. By then we were at Malibu pier and on calling it was closed. Next days enquiry was negative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/macy220400
50,An amazing recreation of an Italian villa,"Another amazing offering from the wonderful world of J Paul Getty.If you love the museum, then you’ll find the Villa a hidden gem.Modelled on a villa (possibly owned by Julius Caesar’s father in law) in Italy that was destroyed by Mount Vesuvius, it now holds an incredible antiquities collection of Greek, Italian and Egyptian art, sculptures and artefacts.Set aside a few hours and enjoy a leisurely wander around the museum and gardens.Free entry and a cafe on site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mmoo73
50,SO worth two hours of our time!,"All built with J Paul Getty's money (no government support), this lovely villa was made as a museum for his expansive collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan treasures. Free admission - get digital tickets online before going - but parking before 3pm is $15 ($10 are 3 pm). Huge parking structure with lots of steps (or use the elevators). Very well organized, serene, and a wonderful way to spend a couple hours in the afternoon. Cool sea breezes outside, and a good map of the floorplan and exhibits to guide you as you wander inside. Pleasant and helpful docents, too! About a 20 minute drive up the PCH if you come from Santa Monica area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CleopatraBunny

It’s worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ceedeecee

40,"Loved the Gardens, outdoor statues, and Villa",Was less impressed by the statues inside the Museum.Arrived 9:35am--was so glad they let up park early...was able to see the gardens undisturbed...The house/museum with statues opened promptly at 10am.By 10:30am 100 screaming school kids had arrived on a Friday morning... time for me to leave.I had had my lovely quiet experience here in Malibu--so reminiscent of my two visits to Pompeii and once to the incredible excavated ruins of Herculaneum.Good for a one time visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittlePrince1977
50,A sacred space dedicated to art,"“To me my works of art are all vividly alive. They are the embodiment of whoever created them – a mirror of their creator’s hopes, dreams and frustrations.” – J Paul GettyBillionaire oilman and art connoisseur Paul Getty first unveiled his vast collection of Classical and Renaissance era artwork for public viewing at The Getty Villa in 1974. The Villa is located at the eastern end of the Malibu coast in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles.The Getty Villa was designed in line with Getty’s conviction that classical art deserved a building that referenced classical tradition. In the event, what he finally created in the form of The Getty Villa is no less than a sacred space dedicated to art.Getty’s team of architects – Robert Langdon, Ernest Wilson, Stephen Garrett and Norman Neuerberg designed the museum at The Getty Villa as a reimagining of Villa dei Papiri, a Roman seaside estate near the town of Herculaneum which was buried by the Mount Vesuvius eruption of AD79.Villa dei Papiri or Villa of the Papyruses was partially excavated in the 1750s. Along with statues in bronze and marble and wall paintings, over a thousand papyrus scrolls were also found - hence the name.The result of the architects’ work is a grand two-storeyed building with an inner peristyle and an outer peristyle of Doric and Corinthian columns around a landscaped courtyard that has a reflecting pool and statuary. The galleries within are opulent with fine stone finishes and shining terrazzo flooring.After its opening in 1974, The Getty Villa went through a nine-year long renovation programme after which it reopened in early 2006 housing only Roman, Greek and Etruscan art. The rest of the Getty collection is housed at The Getty Center in Brentwood (please also see my August 3, 2018 review of The Getty Center).The Getty Villa houses a mind boggling 44,000 art pieces from Greece, Rome and Etruria of which over 1,200 are on view.Thanks to Paul Getty’s imagination and the painstaking execution of his vision, what we get to see today is ancient art placed in a setting that recreates a first-century Roman villa. The antiquities collection at the museum spread over two floors displays art spanning seven thousand years from the end of the Stone Age to the fall of the Roman Empire.Galleries display Greek art from the Neolithic and Bronze Age to the Hellenistic period - that includes sculptures, figurines, jewellery, mummy portraits, glassware, as also art from the Roman Empire. The earliest pieces are Neolithic clay figures dating back to the sixth millennium BC. One of the most prized items is an original Greek bronze of the Hellenistic period known as The Victorious Youth.Apart from the classical works of art, there is a quirky contemporary art gallery which irresistibly draws attention and provides a stunning counterpoint to the art of ancient Greece and Rome.Just as vital as the architecture of the Villa and the priceless art it houses, are the gardens that were designed and laid out to complete a magnificent picture of the first century Roman villa. The Villa has four gardens that blend Roman architecture with open spaces and Mediterranean plants.On Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays, 40-minute guided tours of the gardens are available starting 10.30am – alternatively, you can just choose to walk around and discover the gardens yourself, as we did.The Outer Peristyle Garden is the largest and most elaborate – in Roman times the outer peristyle was used for conversation as also for contemplation in solitude. This garden is dotted with bronze replicas of statues excavated at Villa dei Papiri. There are also wall paintings and frescoes. The center of attraction in this garden is the 3 feet deep reflecting pool. Mediterranean plants line the sides of the pool. Doric and Corinthian columns add to the beauty of the outer peristyle.The Herb Garden on one side of the outer peristyle has plants of the Mediterranean species – herbs used by the Romans for cooking (mint, thyme, oregano, marjoram, thyme, sage) and medicine, plus flowering shrubs and fruit trees. Apart from providing seasoning for cooking, plants were grown for their medicinal qualities, fragrance and colour. Papyrus and water lilies are planted in the central pool which is also ornamented by a waterspout.The Inner Peristyle Garden is a square shaped walkway lined with columns and adorned with marble floors, walls and ceilings. Just as in ancient Rome, at The Getty Villa too, this is the first open space that meets the visitor’s eye. This garden has a small pool in the courtyard’s center, flanked by statues of young women. Apart from this, the garden also has four busts. Ionic columns form the colonnade, and there are square marble fountains at the corners of the courtyard. Comfortable benches allow one to sit and just soak in this garden’s atmosphere.The East Garden is a relatively small but very artistically designed tranquil space. It has two fountains shaded by sycamores and laurels. Though small, it has a very relaxing ambience perhaps because of the pleasant contrast between the lush green plants and the ornately worked fountains. There are also a couple of polished stone benches to take the weight off your feet and take a breather.Admission to The Getty Villa is free but a timed entry ticket is required – this can be booked online up to two months ahead. Parking is $15 per car or two-wheeler.As The Getty Villa is located in a canyon, mobile signals tend to be rather patchy. The Villa does have Wi-Fi but signal quality depends on your location.Photography with cameras, video cameras and camera phones is allowed in the outdoor spaces as also in the permanent collection galleries.Strollers and wheelchairs are available free of charge on a first come, first served basis.Although the café sells beer and wine, alcohol cannot be brought into the premises. Smoking is totally prohibited in all areas of the Villa.Food is available at the Café which offers both indoor and outdoor seating, and at the Coffee Kiosk across from the Café entrance.Gift items, collectibles, apparel, books etc are available at The Getty Villa Shop which is open right through the time the Villa is open.The Getty Villa is closed on Tuesdays. On all other days the Villa is open between 10am-5pm. Closed holidays are Thanksgiving Day, Christmas and New Year Day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
50,Beautiful grounds and fascinating art.,"We spent an afternoon visiting the Getty Villa. The grounds are very enjoyable to stroll around. There is a fantastic collection of Roman sculptures and artifacts, a sad but moving tribute to Palmyra, and fascinating pieces from the Neolithic and Bronze Age in Greece. Absolutely worth a visit. Parking is $15. The museum is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HKfromAK
50,One of marvels,"If you had not been there, you had not seen the best of Los Angeles.Built with fenomenal taste in the style of Roman villa (but there were no Romans reach enough to build such a villa with such treasures inside), this museum contains artefacts that would give a credit to the greatest world museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zeituni
50,Wonderful place and artifacts,"This spot is beautiful, the view is tremendous and the grounds are well cared for. The antiquities are amazing and some are more rare than you'd see anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovestoTravel129
50,Beautiful grounds and an outstanding art collection.,The Getty Villa is worth the drive up from LA. The villa and grounds are well maintained and really transport you Italy. It houses a very diverse collection of art. You can easily spend a half day there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alleng51
50,Thorough Presentation of Items from Antiquity,"Modeled on a villa destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius, the grounds and rooms are beautiful. The villa was built to be a museum and is well designed for flow through the exhibits which are predominately sculpture and pottery. There are audio guides available, but we did not use them. The information presented with exhibits was generally thorough. Displays of smaller items such as jewelry, stones and coins had screens that showed magnification as well as written info. The 3-year-old with us did pretty well as his mother made a treasure hunt of finding items shown on the brochure. There is also a family room with hands-on activities that he really enjoyed. Lunch in the Cafe was very good. We were on the property from 10:00 until 12:30.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parrishh2013
50,A wonderfully romantic location,"Yes it is a re-creation of an ancient villa in exquisite detail and a wonderful antiquities museum, but it is done so well it is truly a romantic location. And if you are there when the sky is clear, the view of the Pacific is wonderful!And upstairs, outside of the cafe, is this cart with the most wonderful scones I have ever had!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/549donc
50,Amazing gallery,This gallery is beautiful inside and out. Their collection is outstanding and the restaurant is work a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaRepublic
50,"If you can't go to Rome, at least come here.","Spent the afternoon here on a lovely day and enjoyed the two tours that we took: The Architecture and The Gardens. My wife and I have been lucky in that we are able to travel to the places that produced the antiquities and that is my preference to see the masterpieces in their original settings. But the vision of J. Paul Getty, as miserable of a person as he was,(ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD) is quite exceptional in its beauty and see the art how it was originally seen by the Roman elite is a wonderful gift, even though we were not walking around in togas and drinking wine. The only admission cost is to pay for parking, $15.00 and then you are on your own. Do i all on-line. I think I prefer the Getty Center in Santa Monica, but have always felt a visit to the Villa would be worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twomartinilunch
50,Outstanding Attraction!,"The Getty Villa, situated above the sea in Malibu is a reconstruction of a Roman villa in Herculaneum which was buried during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.Getty had the structure created in the 1960s according to archeological records. The villa, coined Papyri, because of the papyrus which grew around it was first discovered in 1750.What has been created is a gallery whose design and architectural characteristics closely resemble the original facility, including the gardens and terraces which surround it. The attention to detail and the quality of workmanship throughout is exceptional.The museum pieces are exclusively from the ancient Mediterranean world, with Greek, Roman and Etruscan artifacts predominating. A few of the artifacts are from the actual villa. Many of the sculptures are reproductions of pieces found on the site of the original villa.There are a variety of free tours, such as, architectural, garden, and exhibits. They typically last about 45 minutes and are recommended as an introduction to the various facets of the villaThe amazing fact of a visit to the Getty Villa is that it's free! There is a $15 charge for parking, but no entrance fee. The Villa recommends that one get advanced tickets, because the capacity of the facility is limited. On our first visit, we did not have tickets, but were admitted, as they had not reached their limit. On our second visit we got advance tickets online, a simple process.There are three sites to eat; a small coffee cart with beverages and snacks, and what the term ""Tea by the Sea"" with a limited open period, and the Cafe which serves a variety of very good, reasonably priced meals. Wine and beer is available with meals.Access to the Villa is very easy. It is located about five miles from the junction of I10 and the Pacific Coast Highway, and is well signed off the PCH.Overall, an excellent attraction, well worth an enjoyable day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/913alg
50,Great Afternoon at the Villa,"The Getty Villa is free of charge to visit but you pay for parking and because the parking is limited you need to reserve the parking time slot online. You can take an uber without a reservation. We were renting a house within walking distance and walked over, the gaurds made us show our rental agreement to ensure that we did not park in the residentual neighborhood surrounding the villa and walk over. Once we did that, they sent a shuttle to pick us up at the bottom of the hill. Once you get there, there are several free audio tours and docent run tours all day. I have an 8 year old and he discovered the ""Percey Jackson Tour"" and was thrilled. The tour is on the audio guide and it takes you to the areas that are related to the book series, itis very well done and informative. It was so well done that my 8 year old took several other audio tours after the Percey Jackson tour ended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFSD
50,A fantastic getaway,"While in LA, was looking for a nice attraction and was recommended to go for a visitWas told to make an online reservation, which was a great ideaEntrance is free, parking is 15$We headed there and got early, around 11:00The place is magnificent and the villa is beautiful , in a relaxed atmosphere with beautiful viewThere are many art collection and one can get an audio guide in order to hear some highlightsWhile strolling, we were told by another visitor that the parking ticket is valid for the Getty center as well, if used on the same day.It was not our intention to visit there but the villa was breathtaking, and we wondered what the center would look likeA great place to visit, especially on a bright day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rantlv
50,BREATHTAKING is an understatement!,"My wife and i have been wanting to come here since we toured The Getty Center a few years ago. I had looked up pictures of the place and it looked astounding. We planned to be up around L.A in the New Year so my wife booked tickets for 11am on January 2nd. They will not admit you without tickets booked online and admittance is free. The entrance to The Getty Villa is not easily visible when you are motoring at 50 mph along the Pacific Coast Hwy so keep your eyes peeled. Parking is onsite in a multi level carpark for a fee of $15. We hit heavy traffic and didn't show up until 11.30am but they let us in no prob when they saw our tickets. The car in front of us was turned away....no tickets. We went up a couple of elevators until we could see the ocean again from the high elevation. There is an option for a headphones self guide tour but we decided on the chaos method....go here and oh what's that up there! We walked up and down a lot of stairs. We saw lots and lots of amazing artifacts that defied my imagination. At around 1pm we decided to take a lunch and coffee break upstairs on the huge observation deck which served as an outdoor dining area. There is a pretty decent cafeteria to buy lunch and an espresso bar with $25,000 robot espresso machines. There is a gift store on the lower level where we bought a fun book for our grand daughter. After resting and recharging our batteries we recommenced our pilgrimage to view more ancient objects of art. It is too hard to put into words how beautiful The Getty Villa itself is.....an architectural wonder for the ages no less. We had an amazing experience but eventually ran out of gas. If you want to do something truly great in your life then visit this wonderful place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/677nedk
50,Ancient art - easy to view,"At a friend's recommendation, we decided to spend an afternoon here. While I'm not much into ""art"" in general, I did thoroughly enjoy walking the grounds and seeing much of the sculpture and other artifacts J. Paul Getty brought to his Villa. The outside grounds were delightfully done as well. It's certainly worth a trip if you've never been there before. We could have spent much longer there (were only there a couple hours), if I'd really wanted to read every display, etc. Strongly recommend one view the introductory movie at the beginning of the ""tour"" to get a feel for the overall location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1166HBkevinr
50,must see in LA,Awesome place on the ocean that is free!! Incredible manicured grounds. Take the time to see it.Just up the coast from Santa Monica Pier. Easy to do both the same day. Only pay for parking. Great display of J.P.Getty's incredible collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beachblind
40,Deserves more time than we gave it,Stopped in at this impressive museum en route from LAX to points north. Didn't have enough time to truly savor the buildings and their contents but got a wonderful glimpse of the stunning gardens and were left with a taste for more. The museum is free but parking is paid. I don't know if you are allowed to hike up the hill and enter on foot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfindysz
50,Extraordinary Villa. An absolute must-see,This extraordinary villa that was reconstructed by J.P. Getty is a visit that should not be missed. This gem is a delight for all senses. Get there early for easy parking and to avoid the crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeannem52
50,Must do,"A must do in LA, even better than the Getty Centre.Interesting exhibits, lots of tours, great grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsBG
50,Definitely a top LA destination,"It was peaceful, accessible, BEAUTIFUL...and free! If you love incredible views, architecture and art, you must visit this place. It is NOT a duplicate of the Getty Center and stands on its own as a must-see in LA. Advance, online reservations are required, so plan on that...but they are free. I think parking was $20.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessepisors
50,Stunning Villa with Wonderful View of Santa Monica Bay,"This was the first location for the Getty and is a stunning replica of a Mediterranean villa overlooking the sea. The Greek and Roman antiquities are quite special and very beautiful. The gift shop is one of the best I've visited offering a range of very nice items. The parking is excellent, but be warned you pay for parking while there is no admission to the museum itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deniseo632
50,A gorgeous museum,"Nestled in the hills of Malibu, the Getty Villa is accessible by Highway 1 along the Malibu coast. It is free. However you need to reserve your tickets online ahead and pay the 15$ parking fee. There is a covered parking structure with plenty of space to park. Afterwards, you need to walk up (or take the elevator) to access the museum. Next to the museum’s entrance there is a kiosk where free guided tours are posted. There are plenty starting each 30 mn with different themes. But you can visit on tour own just as well. The villa is a copy of the villa dei papiri in Italy. The rooms around the inner garden house the museum’s permanent collection while the 2nd floor rooms are used for temporary exhibit. The antiquities collection is impressive but centered mainly on the classical periods except for the Cycladic figurines from Greece.However, the most impressive view is the one overlooking the pool. The landscape resembles that of a village in Italy. Plenty of photo points from this vantage point.Beware that we didn’t have any cell reception while there (on TMobile).The cafeteria is nice and offers standards and daily dishes with an upscale twist. And not much more expensive than other museums or attraction parks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hanancha
50,Absolutely Amazing,"Astonishing views, awesome recreation of an ancient villa, and great works of art. Truly an escape from the traditional LA attractions.Get your free tickets online at least a few days in advance (earlier if you feel your date will be popular). Try to get an earlier entry time, though we went at 1:30p and saw nearly everything in which we had interest by closing at 5p. We arrived about 30 minutes before our entry time (1:30p) and got in fine.Take the free tours, great way to see the property, and learn of both the original site’s history as well as the history of this facsimile.We ate at Duke’s Malibu for lunch, prior to going to the Villa (arrived there at 11:30a). It’s about 4 miles to the west on the PCH - Pacific Coast Highway (California Route 1). Check it out if you have time.Finally, make sure you take some ocean view photos!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealDoubleM
50,Wow,"What a wonderful experience we had at the Getty Villa, just for the cost of parking-$15. This is a museum that is housed in a villa based on a place in Italy that Mr Getty knew and had recreated. Although it contains only a small portion of his acquisitions (the Getty Center is much larger) it has alot to see, free tours to take and a beautiful garden to enjoy. This is a place not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/898kayes
50,Must See in LA,"The Getty Villa is an amazing, FREE museum featuring ancient works and is a stunning recreation of an ancient Roman villa. Parking is $15, but if you go to the Getty Center in the same day, you only have to pay once to park in both locations. Doing both the Getty Center and the Villa is possible in one day, but it will be A LOT of art and scenery to take in. That being said, the Villa is a great destination and 2-3 hours is fair of time to take in the grounds, gardens, and the interior galleries. Art and history lovers could easily spend more time here. There are FREE guided tours offered throughout the day - the architecture tour was especially good and informative. Additionally, the Villa offers FREE audio guides with a photo ID. The audio guides are iPhones that you can easily enter the artifact number to hear explanations about the history and significance of particular pieces. Overall,visiting the Villa is a great experience and should be on everyone's list if they are visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lostsmoothie
40,Interesting artifacts in lovely setting - don't be put off by the parking fee!,"Having been to the Huntington a couple of days earlier, we decided to see a cultural collection from a different era by visiting this beautiful purpose-built villa-cum-gallery.We were a bit put off by being asked at the drive entrance for a $15 parking fee, but when told that the museum/gallery itself was free to visit, it made it a very good bargain for two people!The artefacts are housed in a series of rooms over two floors with lovely outdoor garden areas (beautiful fountains and pools give a cool atmosphere) to stroll in; if you are interested in Roman and Greek antiquities, then this is a good place to see a manageable collection.Pleasant café and separate outdoor coffee shop - former a little pricey, but given there's no entry fee, nothing to complain about.A postscript to our visit is that when we got home from our holiday in California, I had recorded a TV series called Trust, which was the story of the Getty kidnapping events of the early 1970's. I was transfixed to see in several episodes lingering shots of the scale model Mr Getty had of the villa (in his home in England) which was being built at that time to house his collection - and I had just been there!I was also saddened to hear (if the plot was true to life) that the critics panned the building upon completion, much to his disgust; I guess with the hindsight of 40-odd years, we now appreciate that Getty had the wisdom and vision to plan and construct this lovely villa; the critics were so wrong about what he has achieved here!Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJ-Whippet53

You'll be fascinated by the details and wealth. A place with a special history. Just don't expect a nice meal at the outdoor snack&food stand, food is not that great. But come for the beauty and tranquility in the hills of Malibu and an estate out of the ordinary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moeller_CPH
50,Incredible! Must see!,"The villa is huge! The garden tour and the architectural tour provide you with the history and information you need to understand “the why” behind plants, materials, etc. The pizza at the cafe was awesome and they serve Menabrea beer, imported straight from Italy. Getty’s collection of ancient art and collectibles is huge so give yourself plenty of time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keegs3225
50,Stunning! A MUST visit,"We visited the Getty Villa on our return to San Diego from Santa Barbara. The drive from the 101 through Topanga Canyon was gorgeous and the villa’s just down the PCH when you arrive at the ocean.We didn’t have a reservation but there were slots available and we were allowed in. The Villa was so much more than I expected... highly recommend the 12 minute movie highlighting Getty’s vision.We thoroughly enjoyed the visit, architecture, art, gardens and the (sunset) view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/db7477

50,What a wonderful villa,"At the Getty museum, we learned about Getty Villa. We obtained free tickets to go the next day. It's a beautify villa and immaculate garden, beautiful architecture, and if you likes photography, it offers you beautiful backdrops for some nice photos.

Parking attendant said it was best to have them to ensure entry.The grounds of the villa are serene and beautiful. The architecture of the villa is divine. We did the class scavenger hunt to answer questions regarding Roman, Greek and Etruscan antiquities. This was fun however look forward for a return visit to do a tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/menhb
50,Beautiful Place!,"We visited The Getty Villa shortly after opening on a Saturday. I went in knowing nothing about the place, but armed with the memories of a prior visit to The Getty Center in Los Angeles. The Villa is home to most of the antiquities in the Getty collection. You won't find paintings here, but the statues, frescoes, mosaics, etc. are beyond impressive.We watched the 12-minute orientation film before taking the ""Highlights"" tour of some of the most popular pieces in the collection. Our tour guide was well-informed about the pieces and their history. I enjoyed how the Villa was built as a replica of what was believed to be an ancient Roman villa that was destroyed by a volcanic eruption. The museum, gardens, pools and grounds are beautiful. The Getty Villa is not the Galleria Borghese in Rome, but it is very nice none-the-less. And the price can't be beat. Admission is charged in the form of a parking fee of $15.00 per car. After that, the only other things you pay for are food or items from the gift shop. All tours are complimentary. Well worth a visit if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jvptravels

In the summer some they can book up, so I recommend getting your tickets a day in advance.If you love Italian architecture, this is a great place to visit. The villa was made to resemble a villa in Herculaneum, Italy. The grounds are beautiful, ranging from a Mediterranean plants and trees to a reflection pool. The villa itself is impressive, with art and sculptures Mr. Getty collected over the years.The ocean view from the top by the gardens is amazing as well.The restaurant is a little expensive but has good food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/britinyf2018
50,"Rome Villa Vibes... wow, wow, wow!!!","Stumbled across The Getty Villa from the Getty website. I did not even know this gem existed in So Cal and I’m so glad we had the opportunity to see it. It’s so close to Malibu and Santa Monica.We booked our timed ticket online for 10am but showed up around 10:30am. There was no issues and not crowded at all. When we arrived at the parking lot, there were less than 10 cars. When we left after 2pm, the parking garage was full and it was a weekday.After seeing pictures online, I was only interested in the architecture of the Villa and garden area. And when we arrived, we felt we were in a Roman Villa! The garden area had so many photo opportunities in their inner and outer peristyle. It was truly a place to converse! Also the reflecting pool and north wall are a site to see!I don’t want to spoil too much about the beauty of the place and it has to be seen in person!Located right off of highway 1, I recommend visiting this place. If you can’t visit Rome anytime soon, this is the place to be. It’s free to visit but parking is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustJayDon
50,Old world tranquility amidst the bustle of Malibu,"It was like being transported back in a way to old Italy... The peace and beauty of the gardens and courtyards and walking thru the corridors seeing items used by Romans of old rich and poor..getting glimpses of what may it have been like to live at such a time...arrive early to beat the crowds and take a walk around the gardens , bring a camera and spend a couple of hours admiring classic art. I have also been to Getty center but I find the villa prettier and more intimate...You have to get a free timed ticket to get in ahead of time due to limited parking and there is a parking fee of $15.00.

50,Beautiful gem on the coast!,"I have been to the Getty Museum (which is incredible and gorgeous) and had the opportunity to go to the Getty Villa last month...I was so impressed and surprised at the beauty and size of the property and the collections. The property is very Roman in style and based on a villa in that area prior to the eruption of Mt Vesuvius that buried Pompeii and Herculaneum. There are collections from that era, as well as several gardens. The ocean view from the property just adds to the great ambiance. If you have a couple hours, make a stop here (you have to reserve a FREE timed ticket ahead of time; you present that at the gate and pay a $15 parking fee for the underground lot). The museum also has a coffee/snack cart and a cafe (which was very good). There is an amphitheater for productions. We really enjoyed the museum and the overall property.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c_dimeg_b
50,Just as Good as Getty Center!,"The Getty Villa is just as good as the Getty Center, if not better because it is more intimate. There is nothing comparable to the views from. The center, but the Villa has gardens and courtyard that are much much prettier. Art is subjective, but we also found the collection at the Villa a lot more accessible and classic.We visited early on a Friday and it was perfect & quiet before the crowds bean arriving later in the morning. Clean restrooms and an acceptable gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodelagain
50,Very cool and original tour and museum,We had a great tour guide on Saturday explain the history and architecture of Getty and the Villa. The $275 million budget can be seen with the intricate details and quality of work.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brandenmickan
40,Worth a visit,"There is free entry to the villa which is nice but you have to pay for parking, $15 per car. It’s a gorgeous location and driving there is one of my favorites (beach and cliffs). The villa is great, nice surroundings, there is a coffee shop, restaurant and gift store, a nice herbal garden which I enjoyed the most. There is no direct view to the ocean. The displays are nice although not sure what portion of it is the real deal and what is a replica. Well presented overall and definitely worth the visit, especially with the free entry per person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAss787
50,The Getty Villa,"What can I say,the Getty Villa is totally awesome, and it's free. Wonderful exhibits, wonderful gardens, wonderful views, good food. And, parking is free if you show up on a motorcycle. How awesome is that?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobP405
50,Always amazing!,I always take my out of town visitors to the Getty (one or the other). I took my nephew when he was 14 years old. This year he came to visit with HIS 14 year old daughter and he specifically asked if we could go to the Getty. I was so pleased that he remembered his visit over 20 years ago. The Getty is memorable! The artwork and the architecture are equal to the story of the museum's creation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladymcbeth2017
50,Definitely will go back.,What a fabulous museum and property. It is beautiful and has very impressive exhibits. We were there on a specific guided tour and only saw a quarter of the displays. So we will definitely be back. It is better to stay a little inland because the hotels are extremely expensive there in the area. What a gem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/500joel
40,Beautiful views and gorgeous grounds.,We arrived without reservations at 3:30. Luckily they had space for us. $10 parking after 3:00. Be mindful it closes at 5:00. I enjoyed the beautiful grounds. Lots of photo opportunities. The collection did not take more than an hour to view. Go on a nice day. The drive along to coast to get there added to the delightful day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gmanbumpy
50,Improved Getty Villa Now Showcasing Antiquity.,"Having previously visited the Getty Villa back in the early 90's when the exhibits were crammed into all of the rooms. I finally got around to visiting the much improved ""Villa"" after numerous visits to the ""Center, that is also spectacular. Having so many exquisite artifacts on display here makes perfect sense. Weekdays are less crowded, yet the groups of noisy school children on a field trip that happened to be there on our visit were gone by the mid afternoon.Elevators are plentiful if the many stairs up and down to get to the entrance don't appeal to you. Along the way at the security desk they WILL be inspecting any purse, bag, or pack you bring, just so you know. Do see the 12 minute movie playing in a small theater at the entrance. The padded seats are a welcome relief after the long walk from parking. The good news my friends is that the pools and fountains now have water in them. Those soothing sounds and the glint of the sunlight off the sparkling surface have returned, for now anyways.The exhibits are grouped in a timeline, by region and collections that are displayed in a manner that allows you to appreciate similar types of artifacts together, sculpture, pottery, frescoes, mosaic, metalwork, and glass. a lot of thought went in to these layouts. Not everything is ensconced in protective acrylic cases, so please show respect and keep fingers, cameras, etc 18"" from any exposed relic. Also read the photography guidelines on their website, and look for the exceptions & restrictions in some areas. The docents are vigilant and will politely remind those who forget.Plan on spending 2 to 3 hrs, more if you need to analyze every little detail. The audio guide for the self tour is free and very informative. The various guided tours are free. There was only one small area of the second floor that was closed for the coming soon exhibit. (Underworld:Imagining the afterlife). I found the maps of ancient world in the various rooms that highlighted developing civilizations, with the accompanying timeline below informative. I had no sense of clutter as spacial considerations and context make the layout of any one room inviting.The gift shop and the cafe are a nice part of the new ""Villa"" experience. Spacious with gorgeous views too the ocean. Of course it's pricey food is all great tasting, especially the cookies. Free refills on the sodas were a nice surprise. Merchandise is immaculately organized and clearly priced, with friendly helpful staff. You can buy most products online as well. Walk the herb gardens and the peristyle surrounding the pool. Relax in this lovely place at your leisure. Benches and areas for sitting are practically everywhere.Go to their website and PLAN your visit. Do not just try to wing it and show up. Follow the instructions when processing tickets and make sure to click on the zero and input the number of your party that are 16 and over. It prints a receipt that will show zero dollars, then print each individual ticket with a barcode. They collect these at the time you pay the $15.00 per vehicle fee. I did not see them ever scan these. Don't worry if your early or late of the time you selected, just arrive on the correct day.The entrance is only accessible off PCH northbound, they have barrier posts in the median, so if you are coming down Topanga Canyon, or from points north. You will have to make a U-turn further down. There is a right turn pocket lane and you will want to slow down to enter the wall opening. A road sign before, and a black sign with an arrow pointing in so you don't miss it and go to the West Coastline Drive traffic signal, (see U-turns further down). When you come to the two arches is were you pay and hand in the tickets. Remember, cash makes the world go much faster. The road is rather bumpy and steep. Follow the directions of staff and park in the nice, safe, clean structure. When leaving watch your downhill speed, and as you exit turn left..I can't emphasize enough you thoroughly read all the information on their excellent website. If you have to call the number with a question, a human being picks up the phone, yeah! Lots to love about this place. Great So Cal weather- even better!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maitaimike2015
50,Roman Palazzo in Malibu,"Different than its sister museum the Getty Center, also in the Los Angeles area, this museum is dedicated to displaying and studying the arts and cultures of ancient Greece, Rome and Etruria. There are over 44,000 antiquities from 6500 BC to 400 AD, including an extensive Bronze Age gallery, ancient coin display showing evolution of coinage, marble statues, among others. Grounds are beautiful and the view of the Pacific Ocean spectacular. While we were there, several groups of middle school students were listening attentively to their teacher/guide. We eavesdropped and learned as well! Admission is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LG964

50,A Roman Villa in Malibu,"This is a great museum built by J Paul Getty. It is modeled like a Roman villa that was buried by Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. This museum houses Greek, Etruscan and Roman artifacts and is nestled in the Malibu hills by the Pacific Ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarasP5467OR
50,Grand Adventure,"Had a wonderful brunch at Taste Restaurant (just minutes away) prior to our ""Grand Adventure"" at the Getty Villa. We took the architectural tour it lasted about an hour and gave us all kinds of wonderful insight as to why it was built the way it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hairmasterbarry
50,This is a very interesting and educational museum.,"If you are interested in history around the Mediterranean, you should not miss this place.Check out the website for a detailed description. I spent several hours here with a break for lunch. Early in the day there were quite a few groups of young students going through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3555OFsteveh
20,Watching 'All the money in the world' is my preference.,"OK may be it's my fault but I was expecting something on the lines of Hearst Castle. But what you get from the Getty Mansion is basically a museum of Antiquities rather than a mansion someone lived in. If your thing is statutes and artefacts then you'd love it. It's not mineThe highlight is definitely the outside space, the pools and gardens but these are surprisingly small and dare I say it relatively plan.I leant that this was never intended as a home and is a replica of a Roman Emperors villa who Mr Getty thought he was the reincarnation. Actually I got this from the film, All the money in the world' which was a more enjoyable way to spend 2 hours than visiting the Villa.On the plus side a visit is free, except for the $15 for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/researcher59
50,A surreal experience!,"What a gift to the world! Some of the rooms were being renovated, so we must go back and experience the fully renovated Vila!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bradyfam2015
50,Beautiful villa and so much to learn and understand about history,"First I thought spending 2 hours at the Getty villa would be hard to do, because of it's coziness, but after 2 hours I realized that we had only seen half of the villa grounds. There is so much history to explore. The works of art and many sculptures are amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcox5289
50,Clearly one of the best museums in North America,"Fantastic. The Getty foundation is incredibly rich, and they have acquired wonderful pieces of art. Check out the website and decide for yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/350christophb
40,Experience Ancient Greece and Rome,"Getty's collection of priceless antiquities and reproductions is an education and a thrill. The setting couldn't be more serene and exhilarating. Don't miss all of the plants, flowers (roses), shrubs and trees (olive trees) Getty wanted grown as in days of old. Lovely couple of hours off Highway 1 in Malibu. Get tickets free online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patient111
50,Amazing,The facility itself is something else with beautiful views of the ocean in the distance. The art work is also world class with so many important pieces from antiquity. Marvellous collection in a spectacular surrounding.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timv811
50,Ah-Mazing,The Getty Villa is magnificent. The museum is not too large but the grounds are splendid. The artwork is also a treat. The tours are approximately 3 hours but well worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michellee67
50,Beautiful museum,Wonderful place to visit and experience. The collections are well worth it. The cost is free. You must make reservations online with a time selected. Parking per vehicle is $15.00. Free tours are available at certain times covering different aspects of the mansion. Collections in the museum are extensive. Plan on spending a couple of hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pepe574
50,"Unique, breath-taking and worth a visit!","Located on a bluff overlooking Malibu and modeled after a grand residence that was buried in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D., the Getty Villa is simply one of the most beautiful settings to view ancient Greek and Roman art that you could ever imagine.There is no admission fee but you must book your free tickets in advance online. There is a charge for parking (currently $15 US). If you get hungry, there is a café on the level above the museum store. Free guided tours of the museum are also available.The architecture and the grounds are simply stunning, and the exhibits are very well-organized. It is an intimate museum, one that you can easily cover in less than two hours. Even if you are not necessarily a lover of Greek and Roman art, just strolling around this beautiful setting will make for a delightful day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruinDan
40,Rent,"The Getty Villa is available for rent to private parties for private parties, and it's a terrific venue for that purpose!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
40,"Ambience, Art and Archeology","What a lovely spot! High on the hill overlooking the ocean, this space is an elegant and tranquil way to relive history. The restaurant serves a nice selection of expensive items and the cafe offers a more casual approach. We enjoyed a snack on the patio before our guided tour. There's also a self-guided audio tour one can take but we didn't do that this time. We wandered the gardens in the late afternoon until they kicked us out at 5:00 p.m. The staff we encountered as we drove in weren't forthcoming with information and since it was our first time here, it was slightly confusing. That said, this museum has a wonderful selection of artifacts in a beautiful setting. It's not so large you're exhausted when you leave. The gift shop is a good size and has a nice variety of items. Good day out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RetroFan
50,How the other .1% lived,"First of all, you need to reserve a car park. We didn't know about this, but the very friendly attendant waved us through. And entry is free! Getty was fascinated by ancient Greece, and this recreation of a villa from the now-ruined Herculaneum is a testament to his dedicated fandom. There is a certain merit in showing what an ancient ruin looked (and felt) like when it was a vibrant living environment. Somehow this feels more authentic and justifiable than whacking up recreations of European buildings in Vegas. Of course it's all about money, which Getty had truckloads of, but if you leave your socialist sensibilities at the door (and as a New Zealander, I definitely swing to the left) this place is more than worth a visit. The collection of Grecian artefacts is also impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Destination82975
50,Great museum and tea - be careful of parking restrictions,"We went to the tea by the sea, which is a great and romantic experience that is worth the reservation wait. Even with a food allergy, they were very accommodating. Afterward, we got to go on a fun garden tour with a small group and enjoy the parts of the museum that were open. If you go on a tour, make sure to ask about the back story of the museum.Both times I have been to the Getty Villa have been great, but parking and access is always interesting because of the location. The Villa is in a residential area so the neighbors are incredibly sensitive. Thats why you can't park in the neighborhood and parking access is weird because the Villa gets in trouble for guest behavior. If you are going to walk or Uber to the Villa, call ahead first to avoid problems. If you are driving, you can only access parking from the northbound lane of PCH and can't U Turn near the Villa. So, if you are coming southbound, go down to the next light and U Turn there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/748geoffp
50,Getty Villa worth a visit,"We originally just purchased tickets to see the play Bacchae at the Getty Villa (not to be confused with the Getty Center) and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it also included touring the museum before the performance. The Villa, just off Pacific Hwy 1, built by Getty, is modeled after an Ancient Greek Villa buried by Mt. Vesuvius in Herculaneum and showcases his Greek and Roman antiquities that he collected. Walking through the gardens will make you feel as though you’ve been transported into the past in a Greek Villa. Visit their website for details and ticket information. Admission to just the museum is free but you will need to get tickets in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwjohn
50,One of the Best,This is a great museum if you love Greco-Roman culture. The property is built like an Ancient Roman villa and the artwork is fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globetrotting-elissa
50,One of the Best,A lovely museum built around the plans of a Roman Villa. It overlooks the sparkling Pacific Ocean. It is a treasure trove of ancient sculpture and artifacts. I particularly love the Cycladic statues. Even the drive up the hill is beautiful with cobbled drive and a brook. Luckily there are elevators everywhere as the museum is on several different levels. I was there recently for the production of an Ancient Greek play “The Bacchae” using one of the Roman buildings as a backdrop. While you are there walk around the grounds and by all means eat in their restaurant. The museum is a private one and the food is fabulous. Admission is free and parking is $10. Helpful hint..make sure you are headed North on Pacific Coast Highway and the museum is a simple right turn.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skyros7
40,Beautiful visit,So much to see at the Getty Villa. Antiquities and gardens are spectacular. Parking is $15 no additional admission fee. Love the way the museum is laid out with smaller viewing rooms. It allows visitors to stroll from room to room without trying to view the exhibits shoulder to shoulder. Reservations required. Go early and leave early. Traffic is terrible otherwise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/297PaulaL

50,Beautiful and short,Went with 2 friends after we discovered the museum was closed. The gardens are amazing. Beautiful walk through 2 different areas. The inside displayed a fair number of antiquities and replicas. Took about 2 hours. Free to get in $15 to park. We had a great time. Highly recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesliet913

50,"Worth spending couple of hours, if not a day","This museum is located at Palisades and has a beautiful collection of artifacts. Almost every item on display has it's details also displayed, which makes it interesting. Items are spread over 2 floors and takes the visitor back to Greek and Roman era. One must spend at least 4-5 hours to do justice to the items on display. The Victorious Athlete in Bronze or Venus in marble etc. will charm anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Royadip
50,Exceeded expectations - be sure to take a tour.,"Replica of an ancient villa owned possibly by Caesar’s father-in-law plus museum artifacts. The entrance is free you just pay for parking. Make reservations in advance. Reservation tickets are collected as you drive in. It wasn’t clear to me if you could get in if you did not already have a reservation. Once inside, I recommend the architecture tour. Line up approx. 10-15 minutes before start time, as the tours are popular. You are given an earpiece to make it significantly easier to listen to the tour without needing to stand around the tour guide. We learned a lot that would not have been obvious by just walking around on our own and the guide was excellent. After leaving consider visiting the Self Realization garden less than a mile away up Sunset Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinaNtravel
30,You must definitely book online first,"It is a beautiful place for sure. But you should book online first. There is not much parking space and even if you come as a pedestrian, security still asks you to book online first. If you happen to come from an hour drive away, and even if you park your car not on the neighborhood- it is forbidden- but the metered parking on the beach, you might still be denied access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sakaerka
50,Magnificent!,"The peristyle, which is an outdoor pool surrounded by statues and walkways was modeled after a Roma Villa. I never understood the Roman idea of Elysian Fields as a paradise you go to after death. Being at the Getty is a view of what paradise must be like.The art is fabulous, the setting magnificent and the atmosphere was comfortable. We took our 10 month old grandson and ever guard, instead of being grumpy, smiled and enjoyed seeing a nice little kid.Wonderful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phillips3675
50,Beautiful museum,This museum is not as large as the Getty museum in Los Angeles but it is very interesting and has lots to see. It is also on the hill above the beach. Very enjoyable day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Winkylee12
20,A lot of fuss about very little,"Was hoping for more of a Hearst Castle experience, so perhaps that's on me. Was cool for a half hour or so, but I don't think you need more than an hour to really take it all in. Getty Museum however is phenomenal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaneof

50,ROME IN THE GETTY VILLA,"Put the Getty Villa on your list of amazing museums to visit!With its small quaint rooms filled with antiquities and gorgeous court yards with its contemplation ponds...you feel as if you’ve stepped back into time and into Ancient Rome which is what Getty intended.From Hercules to Venus, jewelry and glassware...and a few modern LA installations...you’ll want to come back again and again.You’ll want to reserve the day and time online along with hiw many guests you’ll have.It’s free admission but to handle the crowds they space out the entry times.Parking is $15...worth every penny!We saw deer wandering the property and you’ll see the ocean view and literally feel like you are in another time and space.It’s easy to get around, elevators are available for easy access...nice restaurant and museum store.Of course they have guided tours and audio tours...very informative and makes it a very interesting and fun time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ojaip2016
50,Amazing place,"Hard to believe, but in my 20+ years in LA, I had never been. Yesterday I was invited to an event. The Getty Villa is J Paul Getty's 2nd museum in LA nestled in the crest of the beautiful Pacific Palisades. Here houses over 40,000 pieces of artwork from the Greek, Roman, and Etruscan era - and above all a beautiful venue with lovely grounds at the gateway to Malibu. A great historical landmark, open and spacious, lovely afternoon local adventure without all the logistical issues - and, good to know - also open for private and business events.Entrance is free. Make sure to make your reservation online before you go as entrance is limited. Parking is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuidoKarp
50,Pretty tax break for an old man,"The is a great marble Roman villa replica with tons of ancient art and artifacts. Getty loved his money so much he had creatively found ways to keep it by collecting and building this “home”. Nice views, garden and great artifacts. Go early or late if you plan to drive here, otherwise traffic getting in and out is annoying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinSuz
50,Wow!,"Our friends brought us to this wonderful place when we were visiting them in June. I thought the gardens were beautiful, and I left wishing I had more time to study the exhibits. However, we were on our way to Malibu Beach so who was I to argue?If you like gardens and art exhibits the price is right. It was free, however, I think our friends had to pay something to park the car. This is an amazing collection of antiquities, and if you have the time I recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irishjayhawk2016
40,Nice Collection,"This is a nice collection of Jay Paul Getty's art and antiquities. Part of the experience is to understand him, which is a very interesting story. He built this to be a replication of Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum, which was destroyed. Getty built this from England, and never got to make it to the Villa, as he became afraid to fly in his later years. He has graciously set up a trust for the Villas which allow you to see it free of charge - you just need to book at ticket on line to reserve a spot. The Villa houses a lot of Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities from 6500 BC to 400 AD. I recommend getting the iPhone guide to provide additional in-depth analysis of the works of art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sondraw221

40,A wonderful place but this time my experience was the worst!!!!!,"I loved this place so much, so I want to bring a church group here for the experience.But this time it was a total disappointment and frustration. I booked a week ago and reserved parking for 3 cars. I really had a big complaint against the entrance guard. We were the first car to arrive at the designated time and gave the my first name, ""No"", my last name ""No"", my address ""No"", my email address ""No"" , our church group ""No"", she was so rude and agitated, she ordered us to leave right away and would not even tried carefully to look up on her list. I tried to park close to the corner and walked out to call the office on my cell phone because the signal was so bad. They ran over and frantically screamed at the top of their lungs at us and demanded "" no one get off the car !!"". It was so loud in such a quiet and romantic place, it sounded like we were terrorists or some kind of criminals. We were stunned and did not know what to do and had to drive off the premises. On a Saturday afternoon, the traffic on Pacific coast Highway was terrible. We could not turn right or left and as soon as you got out, you had to drive all the way out of the area in the traffic before you could make a u turn to come back. The signal around this area was really bad, I called the office numerous times and had long waiting time plus constantly lost connection in the middle of a conversation and after much tries, finally I got hold of the office and they solved the issue, and I did had a reservation. I was so nervous about the other 2 cars behind me, fearing they would receive the same alarming treatment. I tried to call them and warned them but with no effort. Finally after an hour solving the problem, we drove back to the villa and to my surprise, my other 2 groups were already inside the villa. They said they had no problem of getting in. They were right behind me, not even 1 minutes behind me. So it meant someone found my name on the list and let them in before I contacted the office and they claimed the guard was a younger lady, so in the meantime, they changed the other older lady shift. My heart rate could not get back to the normal for a long time I came here to enjoy a beautiful artistic villa and in return I got a terrible experience, it took me another hour before I could settle down. I lost the interest of checking out all the artifacts and gardens. Please respect all the visitors, they came from all over the world to view this pristine location, and don't give them a horrible memory of USA. We are all regular citizens and this is just a touristy place, a welcoming smile and patience would go a long way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itcheetam
40,Enjoyable recreation of Roman city with great views,The villa offers a recreation of a roman city with interesting art and antiquities collections overlooking the Ocean. The villa offers a variety of interesting landscape areas with special herbs farms. The villa includes an old outdoor roman theater. Even though there are multiple levels the buildings have plenty of elevators to make it easier for visitors to move. The compound includes an elaborate food items cafeteria with indoor and outdoor seating. It would be an enjoyable one day outing with impressive views. The villa is free but you pay $ 15 for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/614abdelghanie
40,"Not nearly as impressive as actual historic European villas, but interesting enough and free!","As someone who has visited almost every European country, I found the Getty Villa itself a somewhat bleak, one would almost say ""Americanised"", attempt at pseudo Italian/Greek architecture. For example, you may notice that the courtyard is just flat concrete, painted as if adorned by Greek columns, and that Roman statues replicas have ""eyes"".What was truly impressive, however, was the rich collection of authentic artefacts. The Palmyra section was a particularly pleasant surprise and it is heart-warming to see such an exhibition given the recent tragic fate of this lost city.Overall, there is enough to see there for a couple of hours and given that it is free and very few things in LA are free, I would recommend a visit to the villa. Just be mindful to book in advance. A reservation is required and initially we were turned back at the gate despite the villa being essentially empty at the time of our visit and for that entire day. We literary stopped 50 yards down the road, made a reservation for 30 minutes later, went back and they let us in. Weird.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hristoz2014

50,A marv day at the Getty Villa.,"We are regulars to LA, as we visit every summer from Germany. We have 2 boys aged 12 & 8 and have introduced them to quite a few attractions in the greater LA area. However both were impressed by the Getty Villa (as well as their parents). The location in the hills is beautyful and clearly reminds of the Italian coast around Naples. The Museum is spacious, well organized and the staff very friendly and helpful. The building is beautyful and not crowded (clearly a result of the limited access policy), therefore you can enjoy the collection, read the provided info with no rush and relax in the marv gardens. The cafeteria provides some good quality food for a nice break and the Museum store had some great selection, (did get a few books). A most pleasant day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dirk747

40,Delightful,"The Getty Villa, unlike the sprawling Getty Museum in the San Fernando Valley, is a compact classical Roman Villa, like those scattered all over the Italian countryside, where it houses a great collection of ancient, Roman and Renaissance art, sculpture, tapestries and formal gardens. Visiting the villa is a wonderful way to spend a lazy summer afternoon as the exhibits are easy to appreciate, often displayed in the open air. Since I have a hard time with enclosed galleries, I greatly appreciate the fresh air and ocean scents from beaches below. I also enjoy the café, which offers a wide variety of sandwiches, salads and drinks plus some heartier fare such as pastas and meat. And did I mention beer and wine? All in all, it is a great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lollydepaulo
50,Most impressive collection of items of antiquity,"The Getty is a must see. The items of antiquity baffle the mind and the detail, artistry and ancient craftsmanship are superb. Many examples from different cultures are on display and I strongly suggest going slowly and lingering.The grounds and gardens alone are peaceful, beautiful and offer a welcomed respite from the often crowded galleries. I suggest getting there early to avoid the crowds because once the tour busses start rolling in it becomes tedious.I have attached several photos because words cannot adequately describe The Getty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelgyspy
50,Nice Family Visit,We went for the afternoon with my 14 month old grandson. We had a wonderful time. Very stroller friendly. We had lunch there and the food was excellent. We felt like we were on vacation in Italy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frany57
50,"Incredible situation, impressive site, outstanding antiquities!","We had to choose 1 museum to visit during our short weekend trip to Los Angelos and we chose the Getty Villa. We were not disappointed. The drive up to the Villa on the Pacific Coast Highway was lovely with it’s impressive cliffs and stunning beaches. One you enter the Villa grounds you will have to pass two guard shacks. Please be advised that you have to have a tim d ticket to enter the garage or if you take an Uber or public transportation you will need a printed copy of your ticket to enter the grounds. The driveway up to the Villa is made of paver stones that mimic those of the roads of Ancient Rome. The Villa itself, is a simulation of a Villa that was in Naples and was destroyed by Mt Vesuvius. It is an impressive structure; with incredible attention to detail as well lovely gardens. The antiquities within are amazing. We had a 2 hour private tour and then we spent another 2 hours exploring, we could have spent even longer. We ate lunch at the cafe and all of our food was good. It was, however, pretty expensive. While there are elevators at the Villa, if you choose not to take them, you will be climbing many stairs. Wr all loved our trip to the Getty Villa and would return again. (That includes 2 teenagers!!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coloradofam2018
50,Absolutely beautiful,"I enjoyed my visit. The weather was perfect and view was amazing from every direction. I made reservations online about a month prior. You must have tickets if you plan to visit. The only disappointment for me, was that The Villa is not open to the public. I appreciate Getty sharing his love with us so generously. (I also recommend visiting The Getty Center.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristinaN5
50,180 from the Getty Museum but just as awesome,If you go to the Getty museum you can get free tickets and parking for the villa visit the same day. There is a lot of history there and it’s in Malibu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwmeyer31
40,Beautiful grounds,"The grounds are simply gorgeous. If you live in a metropolitan area and have been to museums with Roman art or been to Rome or other areas of the world that actually have these artifacts then this isn't as exciting. It is rather amazing that one man owned all of this, but I wasn't thrilled. I just loved walking around outside his gorgeous museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellyn56
40,Nice free museum.,"Enjoy the nice scenic drive up to the villa. Remember to reserve your free tickets in advance or you'll be turned away at the gate. Parking is $15, but there's plenty of parking. Beautiful villa, worth visiting. You can spend a couple of hours there and enjoy a bite to eat at the cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soniebaloni
50,A Roman Villa,"The Villa itself is inspired by a Roman Villa and houses an excellent collection of Greek, Roman and ancient art. The entrance is free. You have to pay $ 15 for parking. If you visit the Getty Center as well on the same day you are advised to have your ticket stamped at the Villa and than validated at the Center. If you do so you do not have to pay again for parking at the Center.If you want to visit this beautful building you have to obtain a slot on the internet before visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronaldd1988
50,Amazing,"The Getty Villa is a free attraction in Los Angeles. You have to secure tickets on-line. Parking is $15.00 for all day. The grounds, art displays, the classical architecture, and buildings are indescribable. If you're in LA with some time to spare, go here. You'll be glad you did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelP179
50,"Free museum, reserved parking $15, a must visit!","This is our favorite museum, thank you Mr. Getty! In September, classical plays are performed in the outdoor amphitheater. Lovely trip to ancient Rome to walk through Roman style gardens and homes. We ate outside in the cafe. It was an easy drive west on Sunset Blvd, north on the ocean road and you are there. We had 10:30 AM parking reservation. Plan on two hours at least for your visit and see the introductory film first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinr516
30,Some Staff Unfriendly,"Overall this is an amazing site that reflects in detail ancient Roman culture and architecture. The recreations and original works are worth seeing.I did however find a staff member quite annoying. When in the Loss and Remembrance hall I walked by two members obviously in a deep discussion among themselves but didn't pay any mind to it. That is until I pointed to an artifact to explain to my son that he could still see some original colouring on it. I was a good 10inches from the work but suddenly I was approached by one of the staff members and told not to point at the artifact. I stared at him in shock at being told not to point. He went on to assert I was too close. He obviously was too involved in his discussion with the other attendent to see I wasn't near the item and just over reacted. I've travelled the world many times and visited countless real archeological sites and museums and never have been reacted to this way. However, if they are truly that over reactive to people pointing at an artifact they should encase it in glass like they have other items throughout the property. Or at least stop talking to each other and pay attention to what is going on in the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/binajimster
50,Beautiful setting,"If you love the Greco Roman time period and mythology you will love this place. I can’t believe admission is free! You do need to precook an entry time online. The headset audio guide is a great tour guide, we kept missing the guided walking tours but the subjects were very interesting. We spent half a day here, could easily have spent longer but our brains had had enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/likes_to_travel1200
50,An amazing place,I was expecting a museum within a house but was bowled over with the site. So much thought had gone into the architecture of the visitors center around J Paul Getty vision of a roman villa in Malibu. Allegra was an amazing guide explaining the planning and execution of the building. The artifacts are beautifully arranged and kept in pristine condition. I loved it and found it just as interesting as the real thing in the Bay of Naples and considerably less dusty!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25judithv
50,A recreation of a Roman Villa with a wealth of ancient art for those who cannot visit the real thing.,The villa reminded us of the villas in Herculaneum which was the purpose. There is a wealth of ancient art all related to the different ancient civilizations and their geographical location. Well worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/solarrichard
50,Even the non-artsy people among us (like me) will enjoy this,"I genuinely enjoyed the Getty Villa because of the history and the grounds are beautiful. The atrium, the inner and outer peristyles, the gardens, and the exhibits were fascinating. So cool seeing artifacts that date back 2,000 years or more. We also took an architecture tour with a very passionate docent (wish I could remember her name) who really helped us view the grounds in the context of what Getty was trying to achieve.And you can't beat ""free"", just get your timed ticket in advance online. Yes, you have to pay for parking, but I can live with that. The café was surprisingly good, and outdoor tables (many of them shaded) allowed you to view the villa as you ate. Take note that it's a little tricky getting there if you are coming from the north - you can only get to the entrance from the south, so if coming from the north as we did you have to go past it and look for a place to do a U-turn.One negative: the Plato in L.A exhibit, especially after the magnificence of the villa, was a letdown and didn't seem to belong there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoadJunkie
50,A slice of Italy and Greece in California,"Who doesn't love a drive up to Malibu? This is a fun change of pace if you're staying in LA. Pay $15 to park and everyone in the car receives free admission. I am a fan of Italian art and artifacts and found the Villa offered different insights into Italian and Greek history than the museums in Italy. It seemed a little more Greek than Italian but overall it's balanced. Do not compare this to places you have been to in Italy. It's not the same, but you will see many statues, artifacts such as wine goblets and water jugs, jewelry and paintings. There is a cafe that serves snacks, espresso, wine and beer. There are some beautiful ocean views from some points on the property. Children under 15 might be bored unless they're history fanatics. Great place to go for a date. Plan on about 3 hours to see everything, including stops at the cafe and gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bailarina5678
50,Extravagance Beyond Comprehenion,A beautiful drive up to the villa... Only $15 parking and free access. An awesome experience... so many different areas of interest and tours available to explain and share the many exhibits...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesZoland
50,History and Beauty,"Wonderful place to visit and see history with Roman and Greek artwork. Beautiful grounds and a great place to spend half a day on a clear, summer day in Los Angeles. You can even see a bit of the blue ocean on a clear day. Staff very friendly, easy on line reservation and free tours is also a plus. Our docent showed us were to take pictures 2nd floor by the elevators the door leading outside has a great view with the fountain background. Perfect place to bring our family visiting from Boston.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brychewilliams
50,A visit to the past,"The Getty Villa is a magnificent re-creation of an ancient Roman house. The villa was painstakingly built to resemble the inner courtyards and gardens of the Roman upper-class. The museum is free, but parking is not, and you will need to book this online before your visit. There are free audio tours, as well as docent led tours on architecture and antiquities from different eras.We particularly liked the galleries that showcased the Grecian urns. Many wonderful treasures here, worth a trip anytime you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_ivypruett
50,My family more like Getty Villa over Getty Center,"Getty Center is kind of modern architecture. Getty Villa is more triditional life style. The valuable collection well back to ancient greek and Roma time. The service is the same as Getty Center, free wheel chair/stroller, free audio guide, and many free tours. The beautiful gardens, It is easily spend a half day there. We love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnH976
50,So much history - so much beauty!,The tickets are free you just have to order them online in advance. When you enter the Villa you have multiple gardens and exhibits to visit. The buildings are spectacular and the artifacts are mind blowing. Beautiful atmosphere to expand your horizons.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsK45963
50,Antiquities and architecture,"This museum never disappoints! It is free, but it’s recommended to book your free tickets online ahead of time. Then all you have to do is pay for your car to park. The Villa is gorgeous and is modeled after a real villa in Italy that was covered by volcanic debris. It’s so relaxing just to wander around and take it all in, filled with so many ancient antiquities from sculptures to pottery to frescos. You can take a number of free guided tours throughout the day, and we really enjoyed the highlights tour and architecture tour. The audio guides were also wonderful and very extensive.. However, as a blind visitor, they were unable to tell me how to make the touchscreens accessible. Since they were on iPods, this should be very doable using Voiceover, and I hope the staff will address this. The café was also excellent. This is a must visit if you’re in the LA area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaymtravel7
50,Wonderful Visit and Weather,This was my third time at the Getty Villa and it never disappoints. We took a combined garden and architecture tour which was excellent and then had a great lunch outside in the shade. We loved the glass and jewelry parts of the exhibits. The gardens and pool were so beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeannieD_12
50,A wonderful collection of ancient treasures!,"On our last day in Santa Monica, we decided to visit the nearby Getty Villa, where we had been over three decades ago. I wasn’t overly enthusiastic, as we had recently returned from Greece and Italy, where I so love not only visiting the museums, but seeing artworks in their original settings. However, this museum does not disappoint! Within the faux reproduction of a Herculaneum villa, are a vast array of stunning antiquities, displayed in a manner that makes sense of their context in the classical world. The special small show on Palmyra is also very moving.Despite the questionable nature of how many of these works were acquired, I highly recommend a visit - it’s free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/16R25D
50,Wonderful!,Wonderful Museum and Garden! We booked the free admission tickets online. We had the tickets for 10:30 am. We got to Getty Villa at 9:40 am. The officer let us in early. The museum is beautiful. The arts are amazing. The garden is wonderful. The building is well maintained. The staff are friendly and helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BangkokSachse
50,Incredible structure/ Great to be rich as Getty,"The free museum is an incredible experience. The setting with its view of the ocean is so serene. The reproduction villa was equally is enjoyable as the xhibits themselves. The very informative docent led architectural tour was educational about Roman life, building techniques and values. There were particularly interesting descriptions of how some of the statues were repaired and acquired by Getty himself. We had a very pleasant lunch on the shaded veranda by the museum cafe. We took an Uber toand from as the parking is limited our twenty year olds also enjoyed the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marthaannm2016
50,Majestic Villa,"Spent a wonderful afternoon at The Getty Villa on a warm summers afternoon with two young adults! We all agreed that we need to return and spend at least a whole day enjoying and exploring the wonders of this beautifully appointed and designed replica of the original villa located in the hills outside of Naples.Parking was a breeze but remember to book it online and if you visit the Getty Center and park there too be sure to visit the main parking office as they will offer you a free parking voucher for either once you pay for whichever location you visit first.While the Getty Villa is more intimate than the Getty Center it still teems with fantastic works of art, frescoes, statues, busts and furniture dating back 2000 years and beyond. Allow yourself ample time to stroll the herb garden all the way down and catch the spectacular view of the Pacific Ocean on a sunny day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyman2015
50,Lovely Place and Interesting,"I hadn’t been here for 30 years, and it was still as special as I had remembered.The Villa and Gardens are just beautiful and easy to walk around. Plus there are places where you can sit and rest. I was there on a Sunday in the middle of Summer, and there were people there, but to wasn’t overly crowded.The tickets are easy to get. You just need to reserve online, and they are free. They never asked for my ticket, but I am guessing they would if it was busier.The art is very interesting...if you read the banners in each room. It provides a historical perspective to the Roman Empire and more. There are certain highlights, including the Palmeira exhibit. But that is up to your taste.One thing to know is that it used to be a lot of walking just to get to the Villa. The changes they have made during the renovation has made access a lot easier.They also have a cafe and parking, which I didn’t use. They do have a good place for Uber to pick you up.All in all it is a lovely place to visit for the more discerning visitor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globaltravelfan
50,Oasis brimming with antiquities in Malibu,"Beautiful place to explore. Was pretty busy the day I went (4th July) but, like the Getty Center the architecture and collections are amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7430BYsarahh
50,Outstanding,"Whether you live in Los Angeles, or are here on a vacation, this is a MUST SEE very memorable experience. Plan to spend several hours enjoying the historic building and artwork. It's rich with so much history and beauty it will be an everlasting memory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judysinger
50,Surprisingly Good Visit!,We really didn’t expect such a good visit at Getty Villa! It blew our minds to see the historic times before our eyes. It was worth every minute there as it really brought us so many years back in time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripreview777
50,The Original,"The Getty Villa is the setting of the former Getty Museum, now in Brentwood, and still worth a long visit for art lovers and history buffs alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottagordonsg
30,Quick Stop in Malibu,I didn't realize that you needed reservations. I waited in a long car line for the parking only to be turned around. I decided to just leave because I didn't care to wait in line again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c9017
50,Just Pleasant,So nice to visit the Villa this time of year. Fewer people and the weather is just fine. What an exceptional experience and free of course with paid parking. We enjoyed the Palmyra exhibit and were saddened to see the destruction of the ruins.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoboTravlr
50,The West Coast Frick,Easy to navigate through the various cultures of antiquity. Beautiful ground and the museum itself is spectacular. Good for 1 1/2- 4 hours.Very easy to find and park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Racer
50,A Moment in Time,"Love the Getty Villa. If you love Italian and Greek art, don't miss a visit here. Large selection of antiquities. The outside garden is beautiful. Food in the cafe is excellent. The Villa doesn't require much walking. It's not nearly the size and scale of the Getty in Los Angeles, but truly a gem by the ocean.It's a plus that after all these years, they still don't charge admission. Just wish getting to the entrance off PCH, from the north, would be easier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolsN3221VQ

50,Amazing,"I was skeptical about this place but it turned out to be amazing place. Great time, very informative and it was all free except parking of course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3980VWpeters
50,A great way to spend your birthday!,We got lucky because we learned the famous pool featured in many iconic photos of the Getty Villa was just recently restored! Many National Parks in areas where there are droughts showed support to their communities by emptying their fountains as did the Getty Villa. The fountain cracked severely and had to be replaced - the work was completed and the fountain filled with water just a few weeks ago! The flowers and gardens are amazing and the art and history are even more fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HapaCubbison
50,A tranquil retreat,"A visit to Los Angeles will be enhanced by a visit to the Getty Villa. Although I enjoy the collection, the setting is the real draw for me. I recommend taking an architectural tour, which is free and was offered every hour during our recent visit, for history of the villa and insight into J. Paul Getty's interests. The museum is free, reserve tickets in advance, and parking is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ojerio
50,"Beautiful, educational, and free!!!","The Villa has a lovely collection of antiquities in an absolutely beautiful setting - don't forget your camera!!! Depending on how interested you are in the exhibits, you can spend anywhere from an hour to three hours at the Villa. There's a lot to explore, but given that it's free, you're welcome to just sit by the pool and enjoy the weather, as we did. Fair warning that you do have to pay for parking. It was $15 for us, and then from parking, it's a short walk to the Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rachel_Marie_Be
50,A remarkable oasis in the hills above the coast,"While driving to somewhere else on the Pacific Coast Highway, we saw signs for ""The Getty Villa"". That piqued our curiosity, and we stopped in one Wednesday at about 2:45 pm. What a find! The Villa has both gardens and a museum on site, but we were quite content to just walk around outdoors for a couple of hours and enjoy the beautiful Roman peristyles surrounding quiet and relaxing courtyards.The's actually a large parking garage for visitors ($15). Since we entered so late on a weekday, there was no issue with not having reservations; we got right in. On taking the elevator (around the corner from the information desk) up to the 3rd level, we went through the first arch. There, turning right, we were presented with a catching vista over the trees out toward the ocean; turning left, we entered the lovely little herb garden that lays on the west side of the long ""outer"" courtyard. The garden contains all kinds of trees, herbs, and flowers that could be found in Italy (including papyrus and grape vines). We had to share the garden with some birds and quite a few (harmless) honey bees. At the top of the garden, an entryway on the east side opened into the long courtyard, with a colonnaded porch around all four sides, lovely clear pool in the middle, nicely trimmed shrubs and trees, and some statuary scattered about. It was a real delight to walk around and also to sit on one of the benches and just take in the peaceful surroundings. A smaller square courtyard could be reached through a doorway on the north side of the large outer courtyard (the indoor museum was that direction too). Everything around looked tidy and well-tended. All too soon, closing time at 5 pm arrived and we had to reluctantly take our leave of our pleasant surroundings, and its remarkable juxtaposition of old and new. Perhaps the museum indoor exhibits are excellent too, I don't know. But one thing for sure is that the grounds of the Getty Villa are a treat that we look forward to stroll around again on a future visit to the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kay-cee-1138
50,Goregous and historic setting -- takes you back to ancient Rome & Greece overlooking the Pacific Ocean,"Beautiful setting. Nice place for quiet lunch and cultural experience. Call in advance to secure parking reservation. And then watch ""TRUST"" about JP Getty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mweston2017
50,Enjoyable & Educational,"What a treat for a half day get-away! Mr. Getty's idea to recreate a Roman villa with a museum that explains the early Western civilization era was breathtaking. You realize the intricate craftsmanship of making vases, earrings, necklaces, ornaments, cups and religious incense carriers. A film to show how it was all done (12 Minutes) is well worth seeing. Our treat was the herb garden and walking at our own pace through the landscaped areas. Relaxing, educational and most enjoyable! **Get tickets (free) ohn line --pick the time and date. Free!! Parking is $15.00 . Make sure you bring your printed out tickets from your computer to gain entry after paying the $15 parking charge. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U2871JYrobertm
50,"AND, it's FREE!","The Villa is surprisingly large and the antiquities are outstanding. The grounds are fabulous. We went for the new Plato exhibit and it was quite interesting. It was our first visit to the site, but it won't be our last. The docents are very knowledgable, but they also have iTouch devices so that you can take your own guided tour. The best thing is that it is FREE, you just have to pay $15 for parking. We will be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/919greggr
50,A great place to get lunch,"I love coming here, the grounds are absolutely beautiful. I live in the area so its very accessible to me, but also also accessible via bus.

50,Lovely afternoon with jaw dropping architecture,"Spent the afternoon of our “girls weekend” looking at pillars, busts, sarcophagus’, intricate gold jewelry, fresh herbs, the most incredible garden featuring a stunning fountain in the middle.When you walk into the museum be sure to wait in line for the 12 min orientation video as it helps give a little history, background, and context of what you’re viewing and allowed me to appreciate all the hard work that went into this gorgeous museum.The best part is that this museum is free to the public as long as you reserve your time slot! Parking is $15 but allows you to go up to the Getty Museum about 30 mins away, so if you have time for both definitely take advantage of that! So glad we decided to spend our afternoon overlooking the Pacific Ocean and roaming around this incredible museum! Don’t miss out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anikaiko

This museum combines world class art, artifacts of the ancient world in a beautiful setting. Take your time and explore the many different exhibits. Afterwards you can dine at the in house cafe or take short drive to Gladstones for food and atmosphere. Best of all there is not charge for the Getty, however, you must make a parking reservation also at no charge. Usually not a problem for same day visits. Also note that this is a favorite destination for kids on field trips. So go roman and have a great time. HAIL CESAR!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunsetbeachbuddy

All the exhibits of Roman and Grecian antiquities are terrifically interesting. A wonderful way to spend a Saturday. Go early to beat the traffic. They keep the numbers down by using reservations so parking is very good. I didn't know that you could have a ""tea by the sea"" for lunch $39++ and docent tour of kitchen garden. When we go back, we'll definitely do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTraveler0109
50,Getty Villa A Refurbished Masterpiece,"The Getty Villa is tremendously different than the Getty. If you are a museum go or you should definitely see both.Like the Getty, The Villa is impressive not only for the collection but perhaps even more so for the structure and the setting. Mostly on display at the Villa are Greek and Roman Antiquities don't come here if you are expecting warhol's and Picasso's. That said, it is a masterpiece of LA and should be on the must-see list for tourists to appreciate classical art and architecture.The recent movie all the money in the world makes it even more interesting as it shows a true story about Jay Paul Getty who of course was the creator and owner of the villa. What a strange and seemingly unhappy billionaire he was. I appreciated that some artifacts from this episode are presented at the Villa and the story is presented factually not tainted in favor of the former owner.Suffice it to say, the Villa is another example of how those who say la has no culture are just flat wrong.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwangers
50,A Bit of Ancient Rome in LA!,"I went here last week and I’ve forgotten to write a review for this place after the four times I’ve visited over the years! The property is an actual recreation of an ancient Roman villa that existed in Herculaneum before being buried by the eruption of Vesuvius. The gardens and architecture are lovely and there’s always a nice breeze with it being right by the ocean. The collection is excellent and I’m impressed with the renovation that has everything categorized chronologically which helps make sense of the cultures behind the making of the artifacts and their context. If I had to nitpick I wish there were maybe a few more security guards near the artifacts during my visit as I did see some little kids touching some of the ancient sculptures while their parents didn’t seem to care, which I found off-putting. Overall, a lovely visit to one of the more relaxing oases in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
50,5 Stars -- Italy in LA,"What a treasure this museum that focuses on Greek and Roman art is! Once you go up the hill (hardest part), you're transported into a Roman villa and village that has fountains, olive trees, a herb garden, a lotus pond, an amphitheater, café, restaurant, giftshop, and an awesome collection that's worth visiting many times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
40,Very interesting,"For those inclined towards the historical, this fine collection of antiquities will be a spot you will want to visit.Set in beautiful surroundings and situated just down the road from Malibu, this would be half a day well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shapeyourworld
50,Magnificent treat,My husband and I visited the Villa early Monday morning so the crowds were thin. Our tour guide or docent as they are called was fabulous. We had a one hour architecture tour and a shorter garden tour and both were so interesting. We couldn’t believe entry and tours were free!! You just pay $15 for parking. We also had lunch there and the Italian menu and food was so in keeping with the Roman theme. Don’t miss this treat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janel357
50,A really lovely way to spend the afternoon,"We were particularly curious to see this museum after watching ""All thevMoney in the World"". This replica of an Italianate Naples villa is an architectural marvel. The Gardens are stunning. The collection of antiquities is amazing. However, what is remarkable is that EVERYTHING is free. No admission. Free audio guides. Lots of staff to answer questions. The Getty vision of sharing his collection with the world is perfectly realized.Oh, and don't miss the introductory film just inside the Atrium it is a great overview.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristinaMingay
50,Barretts do culture!,Had a great morning wandering around the Getty Villa. Beautiful. Bookings must be made in advance. I'd advise getting the first opening slot as it wasn't so busy. By the time we were ready to leave it was starting to get crazy busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S3131ZMpaulab
50,If you can't go to the Mediterranean...,"When I finally went to the Getty Villa, as I had wanted to for years, I was sad at reading it was all ancient Roman, Greek, Etruscan and so forth, art. BUT, as soon as I stepped into the villa itself my heart exploded in amazement, wonderment, and humility. Boy, was I wrong. It converted me in an instant and my favorite art is now classical, hellenistic, cycladic...oh we could go on. Mosaics, sculptures, amazing works of art and explanations of history you just wont find anywhere else. And it's in a beautiful villa. The grounds amazing! Each room gorgeous. It's worth it! I went in the afternoon so I saw the sun setting into the ocean from gardens. You wont be sorry!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilya779
50,"Great, great museum!","We've been here several times now and really enjoy the marvelous antiquities collection. The building itself is a work of art as it is a replica of a villa in Italy. I highly recommend taking one of the free tours of the museum and grounds as the guides are very knowledgeable, and have answers to all the questions. Museum is free but there is a $10-$15 charge for parking but considering what you get, that's cheap. We took the blue bus from Santa Monica making it even cheaper and easier. There is a wonderful restaurant on site you should consider trying as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rduinc
50,Favorite Museum,"The Getty Villa is my favorite museum in the United States if not the world. The minute you step onto its well-manicured grounds, you are transported to the Italian seaside, basking in the mediterranean sun. Situated in the hills of Malibu, the villa is replicated after the Villa dei Papiri in Italy which was destroyed in the Mount Vesuvius eruption. Everything from the museum itself -- its beautiful gardens and architecture -- to its vast collection of Ancient Greco-Roman art make for the perfect day trip.To fully enjoy the museum and its grounds, definitely take advantage of the many complimentary tours they offer on the hour. If time permits only one tour then I suggest the garden tour as the gardens are truly the highlight. Furthermore, the food offerings at the museum are great, so try not to eat lunch before! For those of you with kids, the villa has an interactive children's center which even adults may find fun. The one downside is that my favorite exhibit, the one going into depth on the Roman-Egyptian afterlife, had their mummy on-loan to the Getty Center.The one important thing to know before going is that you must must must make a reservation online before visiting. If you do not have a pre-reserved time to visit with a print-out ticket, they will deny you entry at the parking kiosk. This is, however, a major benefit in my eyes as this policy ensures the museum is never overly crowded. Furthermore, admission is technically free, but parking costs $15. So, if you wanted a ""completely free"" visit, you can take a cab which can you drop you off for free in their designated drop off area. For those of you staying in Malibu, you cannot walk to the museum -- they turn away pedestrians for some reason -- so make sure to either take public transportation or a taxi. Also, there is no direct entrance to the museum heading south down PCH (the entrance is on the north side), so this makes things quite tricky when driving there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yelp_is_better
50,A “must do” in Malibu,"One of the best antiquities collections in the world in a fantastic atmosphere. And it is free, except for $15 to park. Make a reservation just in case it is crowded, but I did not need to show mine on a Friday afternoon. The architecture of the villa is 1/2 the enjoyment. See the 12 minute film to get the background.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543scotth
40,For art and architecture lovers,"It’s definitely worth an effort to come to this place not only to admire very nice collection of Greek and Roman art, but to admire very pretty villa and it’s surroundings. Entrance is free of charge (with prior online booking), car park is chargeable though. Last appointment suppose to be at 3pm, but visitors arriving after 4 pm, were allowed to enter as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_Nobody_1979
50,Beautiful setting for an interesting museum,"The Getty Villa sits high atop a hill in Malibu, amongst beautiful formal gardens and an amphitheater. It's an intimate setting for a museum despite it being a replica of a grand Italian estate. The Greek and Roman antiquities are set out in chronological order, which helps the museum goer get a feel for how art developed over time. The cafe is pleasant although on the pricey side. Very much enjoyed my visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ann7788
50,excellent experience,"Well worth the drive up to Malibu to see the setting, the collection and the place. We go several times a year and always take guests here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chingachgook
50,A must visit if you appreciate Greek and Roman antiquities,"Still in awe of the Villa. J Paul Getty's personal collection is extensive! The 'guides' are knowlegeable enough. You need not join any of the tours within the Villa if you prefer. Visitors are free to roam around, take pictures and buy souvenirs. A must for a different kind of experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boots5758
50,Stunning!,"I had been to the Getty Center, twice,so my expectations for the Getty Villa were very high; they were exceeded. The collection is certainly of the finest in the world of Antiquities collections, and it is set in one of the most beautiful, serene, and appropriate venues imaginable; a reproduction, done exquisitely and tastefully, of a Roman palace, every detail loyal to the original designs. The buildings themselves are remarkable, and breathtaking, and the exterior designs, from the ornamental gardens, to the herb gardens, to the reflecting pools, are just as beautiful. There is a lovely outdoor cafe here with very well executed food, with a small beer and wine selection. It's easy to spend an entire day here, and still not want to leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nefelokokigia
50,Exquisite,"A trip to The Getty Villa is unforgettable. Indeed, it is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. The Villa itself is lovely, surrounded by lush gardens and fountains, and has a spectacular view of the Pacific Ocean. Even for those who are not fans of ancient art, a visit to The Villa is a joy, if only to experience its one-of-a-kind beauty.I strongly suggest taking one or more of the guided docent tours. We took the architecture tour, which was fascinating. The docent was very knowledgeable and did an excellent job of explaining how The Villa was reconstructed and how it reflects the architecture of Ancient Rome. We would have missed so many details had we not taken the tour!There is much to see, and the museum is best experienced at a leisurely pace. Plan to come early and spend at least a half day. If you want something to eat, the on-site Cafe is your only option. Fortunately, food at the Cafe is quite good, and the prices aren't as ridiculous as those found at some museums.The Villa is somewhat of a pain to access, and parking is $15. Take an Uber to avoid the hassle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pricelinetraveler
50,Viva la villa,"What a lively place to visit. I travel to Italy often so wan't sure what to expect. It exceeded my expectations: I enjoyed the film, cafe, gardens, and Greek and Roman collections. Don't miss the memorial to a pet dog upstairs! The reflection pool and fountain have recently been renovated and reopened, so enjoy. My favorite part was the gift shop: terrific museum store! Be sure to make a reservation though. Sometimes it will fill to capacity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roaminginrome101
50,Beautiful and amazing,"Way above our expectations. This place is simply beautiful. We went to Pompeii in Italy few years ago, and everything in this building is connecting with roman history to a level we never expected. And the art collection displayed there is just amazing. I can't believe this is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/294dannyv
50,Pacific Ocean meets history,"The Getty Villa is a jewel of Los Angeles. Located off PCH (Pacific Coast Highway), perched on a hill, the recreated villa is home to greek and roman antiquities. The villa is modeled on a roman house and is in excellent authentic condition, making you feel like you're walking through a time warp. OK, so it's not the ""real thing"" but you have to give it to the world's richest private museum, they know how to showcase art.The gardens are also lovely and you will have many photo-ops.The cafe offers a good selection of Cali fresh food, good wine selection and multiple seating options.Check on their website for events, sometimes a panel discussion or a play or a performance. Most of these are either free or for a minimal charge.Tip: lots of stairs and walking, so wear appropriate shoes. Sun protection suggested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoShoEli
50,Brilliant villa,"Great place to visit. I recommend watching the intro video as it explains the background in a nutshell.2nd floor had 2 great, i.e. Informative, videos on glass blowing. About 2 minutes long and highly education, especially if you have kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arr_1k
50,A Gorgeous Must-See,"The Getty Villa has something for everyone. If you like beautiful scenery, architecture, classical art, history, nature, glamour, IG photo ops, etc. this place is for you! Unfortunately it was pouring rain the day we visited (our luck) but the museum provided free umbrellas at all the entrances. The gift shop has some unique finds. I highly recommend this place if you're in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arissalovesart
40,Gorgeous!,I loved it before the renovation (use to own a house next door) and I love it even more after. A place for All ages!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isobelg725
50,A Hidden Gem,"My friend spontaneously mentioned we should go here whilst we were in Malibu having lunch.To my surprise I was overwhelmed by this trip back into time... Who would have thought such a place existed in West Coast, with memories of Rome and Greece tucked away in the hills.I thoroughly enjoyed walking around the villa and gardens learning about the construction and the man behind the idea, Getty himself.I highly recommend everyone to visit this place, when out in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deexo
40,A small museum about Ancient Rome and Greece at the end of Malibu Coast.,Admission is free but you have to read their webpage about the access to the villa and make a reservation for tickets in advance.The staff is kind and helpful.A nice interesting but small place (compared with other museums especially in Europe) worth visiting for people especially who are interested in ancient history of Rome and Greece.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/440ekine
50,Much More Than Expected In A Fabulous Setting,"Stopped for a visit with my son on a Sunday afternoon. What a fabulous place. This is J. Paul Getty’s first LA museum that grew out of a small collection he set up in his beach home back in the 50’s. With more money than he knew what to do with, he set out to recreate a massive Roman villa to house his growing collection of ancient Italian, Etruria and Greek artifacts and he did a hell of a good job.The massive villa is nestled in a valley with s beautiful view of the pacific. Even if you have no interest history this is picturesque place to bring a lunch snd just hang out got the day.Supporting the villa is the modern designed parking garage, reception center, cafe and gift shop along with a large outdoor theater space that serves as central courtyard most of the time.Admission is free but you need to reserve tickets. Parking in the garage is $15 but I believe it’s cheaper after 3 pm.As with Any museum there is a lot of walking and because of the elevation of the mountainside setting there are plenty of stairs. We did a relatively brisk walk through and it took about 2 hours. We were lucky it was not too crowded which made for an enjoyable experience.Being it was early spring, there was not much plant life in bloom. Also, they were working on the villa courtyard so there was limited access to the fountain. This appears to be a very beautiful place.I suggest you bring a couple of folding chairs and pack a lunch. Find a good spot to hang out and enjoy the scenery. Whether you like ancient artifacts or not, you should stroll through the exhibits and view the history. It really is incredible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsachanda
40,Beautiful Scenery,Absolutely gorgeous scenery modeling Roman housing and architecture. Also greatly enjoyed the historical aspect with the statues etc. Impressively laid out and a real gem. Get there early to beat the big school crews and crowds! You’ll be glad you did!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dreww238
50,MUST DO when visiting,"We live in LA, but when our family came to visit we decided to go to the Getty Villa in Malibu and wish we would have sooner. It is very affordable (only pay per car $15) and just stunning. There are multiple tours you can join in at no extra charge and an audio tour you can complete at your leisure which we did and I recommend. The grounds and structures were beautiful. There is a lot of stairs, but many elevators if access is needed. My husband has a bad knee and got around with no troubles. The restaurant there is also wonderful and has a phenomenal view. We can't wait to go back!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mollys393
40,Impressive collection,"Very impressive terrace landscaping with a very well done art museum. Mr Getty had quite the impressive collection of Roman artifacts, mostly marble. I was disappointed because I actually thought the “villa” was a private home tour. The structure is all well done and beautiful. The layout from the parking structure to the actual museum is considerable. I would be strategic about where I dropped off a handicapped person .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bgdg1962
50,Stunning and Incredible Art,"The Getty Villa is definitely worth a visit when in the Malibu/Pacific Palisades area. Built by John Paul Getty, it is styled after a villa in Herculaneum, Italy that was buried by Mt. Vesuvius. The gardens are stunning, the buildings impressive and the art is truly amazing. The Getty Villa houses all of the antiquities, where the Getty Museum has the more modern style art.The Getty Villa offers free tours and I suggest you pick one or two and take them. The guides are extremely knowledgeable and you get a very good overview and education on the collection.The Getty Villa is free, however you do need to go to the website and get tickets. Parking is in a parking garage and is $15. There is a nice cafe offering outdoor seating with incredible views with the Pacific Ocean in the background. The photo opportunities are endless. If taking a camera, read on the website the guidelines for photography before going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beetrvln
50,Worth a visit for sure !!!,"Admission is free, you just pay $15 to park. Facility is modeled after a Pompeii Villa and we enjoyed listening to the story behind it. Greek, Roman & Etruscan artifacts are what is featured here. There is some remodeling going on, including the reflecting pool which was closed and drained for repair. Take the walk down to the overlook anyway, it is beautiful once you reach it. We spent a good couple of hours here and were glad it was open on a Monday (the big Getty is closed on Mondays).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/americanjim
50,Must-see if you have any interest in ancient sculpture,"The Villa was designed as a copy of a villa in Herculaneum that was buried by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE. Located on a hillside above the Pacific, it feels as though it were in Italy. The sculpture collection, including Greek, Etruscan and Roman works, is quite splendid, and the explanations are very helpful. The Museum does not charge a fee, so that $15 for parking, plus whatever you buy in the cafe, at the coffee cart, or in the museum shop, is all you pay. If you have any interest in ancient sculpture, you must visit this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/operalover939
50,Great landmark with gorgeous architecture and grounds,"When in Malibu California, i highly recommend visiting The Getty Villa.It has great artifacts and beautiful gardens and grounds. The pool is being renovated, and some of the exhibits are closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maijr1119
50,take the free tours,"Currently (check their website for dates) there is work being done on some of the exhibits, but it's still worth a visit if you are in the area. I highly recommend taking one or more of the free tours offered, they give you wonderful insight into Getty, the collection, the museum architecture..... and a more rich experience overall. Plan on staying for lunch - the food is fresh and well prepared, delicious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaeRae99501
40,"Not essential, but still nice to visit","Museum tickets are free, you only have to pay 15$ for parking.The villa is beautiful and features some beautiful architecture and restored works of Greek and Roman art. It actually feels a bit phony because everything is so modernized and pristine! If you are in the Malibu area, it’s worth a try, though definitely not a ‘must-see’.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franciscopcoutinho
50,Lovely Coastal Museum,"The Getty Museum is a copy of a Pompei Vill, and is located along Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. A lovely drive along PCH to the hilltop villa. The collection is set in a recreated villa andset in lovely gardens. Go and enjoy a casual lunch and a glass of wine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmptrips
50,Exceptional facility,In addition to the quality architecture and antiques this extraordinary museum offers splendid views of the Pacific Ocean. Reading a book about the contents and history of the Villa will greatly enhance your experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bog999999999
50,Great place to see a play!,"We saw Iphigenia at the Getty Vila, and it was a wonderful experience. Seeing a Greek play in the setting of the Villa was amazing. The performance was excellent. The actress playing Iphigenia was sensational. There was one memorable scene that brought tears to my eyes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellin_Paul
50,Amazing Museum!!,This is one of my favorite museums of all time. I love the sculptures that are there and especially the ones regarding mythology.The view of the Pacific Ocean from here is a good photo op.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissCG84
50,Stunningly Beautiful,"The Getty Villa is very very interesting and incredibly beautiful. Our docent led tour was very informative, and after I lingered in the gardens imagining that I was indeed in Pompeii! Note! You should have reservations for parking before you come, or you may not be allowed in. Entrance is free but parking is $15. The highlight for me was the plants, but of course the architecture and relics were stunning. I highly recommend the Getty Villa for a good 1/2 day....or longer!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b0raas
40,"Limited in scope, but high quality in its collection","As anticipated, the collection was limited to Greek and Roman antiquities. In an absolutely beautiful setting, try a docent led tour of the highlights of this collection. Entrance to this museum is free, but there is a $15 parking charge. A breathtakingly beautiful setting, this exhibition and collection offered a wonderfully intriguing a peaceful hour or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denverrjd
50,Riding the coast line,"This was a great find while we were riding the coastline in California. Beautiful setting, lovely art pieces and does not take more than 2 hours if you have places to go. The cost was only to park but you need to reserve before going in case the lot it is full.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanmariepagani
50,Fabulous collection in Malibu,Came here on Presidents' day so it was very busy but the venue is large and accommodating. The foliage was rather muted as this is winter but the gardens are excellent. The art is beyond compare. Be sure to see the film about J P Getty's plan to build this fabulous building for his magnificent art...a gift to the people,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C134FWmichaelk
50,Beautiful grounds and museum,We had a wonderful visit to the Getty Villa. The grounds are absolutely beautiful. The museum collection is very interesting. There is not an entry fee. You do need to go online to reserve your ticket time. It was a perfect day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/509breem
40,"Beautiful grounds/buildings, sophisticated art collection","As others have noted, admission is free but you need to book online ... you'll show your free ticket (printed or on your phone) at the parking entrance. Parking is $15.The mansion that you see on the hill from the Pacific Coast Highway is NOT the Getty Villa. The Getty Villa is just beyond that. The whole property has been built to mimic an archaeological dig ... you go down from the parking area to get to the various buildings containing the art collections.The art is primarily Greek and Roman with much of it being anatomically correct, if you catch my meaning. The collections include paintings, sculptures, jewelry and other artifacts which were painstakingly sought out by Mr. Getty (who, by the way, died before seeing the completed complex).Definitely take one or more of the guided tours and also watch the 12 minute video ... this will help you get the most out of your visit in the shortest amount of time. Our volunteer docent, Louise, was terrific and we learned things we wouldn't have otherwise.The only reason I am giving the Villa 4 stars instead of 5 is because many of the exhibits/collections were closed during our visit. And while there were children there, the collections are very sophisticated and probably more suited to adults. That said, it appears that they host many school children during the year. Just something to consider depending on the interests of your own children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1TNtraveler
40,"Beautiful place, free admission","Didn't really understand why we had to order $0 tickets online, but pay $15 for parking at the gate and nobody asked us for our reservation/ticket info. But, regardless, we enjoyed seeing the Getty Villa. The buildings, art, gardens were all very beautiful. The only disappointment was the reflecting pool, which is the centerpiece of the garden, was under construction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KAHLJH
50,Beautiful Museum along the Coast,"With reservations online and plenty of parking once we arrived in mid afternoon, we explored what exhibits were still open as many were being rotated or changed. They have very old pieces, sculptures, jewelry from BC. We only spent an hour there this visit but we loved the grounds and the exhibits we did see. I cannot believe I have never gone here before. When the visits are full again I will return and spend more time there. ,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965rickn
20,Getty Villa by bus - don’t,The Getty Villa itself is lovely with a very interesting collection.Getting back to Santa Monica by bus was impossible and really marred the overall experience.We successfully caught the bus TO the Villa. On leaving we just missed a bus then waited 45 minutes by the busy main road for the next one only for it to be full and not stop for us or other waiting passengers.We eventually caught an Uber. I strongly suggest Uber or a taxi if you don’t have your own vehicle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnaM17173
50,Little Athens in Los Angeles,"Sometimes one visit is enough to understand the scope of their collection, but at the Getty Villa the displays are ever evolving to adding new items. While I have been there before, I focus more on the gardens than the collection. This trip was on a windy cold day, and it felt good to be inside away from a February cold snap. I saw more clearly the transition from the Egyptian to Greek art because I had time to study it in Athens. The later Greek braided hairstyle seem settled after seeing the Porch of The Maidens there and head in this collection. This is a little unsung gem that is a study in making a masterpiece collect as Mr. Getty did!Make time for this one!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustinaTucson
50,Beautiful,"Even though some of the gardens were under redevelopment, I still really loved this place. Great art collection and architecture. I saw the resident wild deer heard playing together next to the East Garden. Coffee was good, as was the bread pudding ! Will return again when the gardens are reopened.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaScott1977
50,Getty Villa by the Beach,"I've heard a lot about the Villa. At one point it was under construction, so I wasn't able to visit. Getting a ticket is required and free. Parking is $15 and saving your parking receipt and taking it to the front counter will get you free parking at the Getty Center on the same day.It was a very well designed Villa. The museum aspect blends real life artifacts and collections with some items that were reproduced to add to the ambiance.You can bring water and a picnic. Leave the food in your car, or carry it in a backpack. Then enjoy the surroundings with a picnic.They offer many guided tours with regards to different aspects of the museum.If you get there early enough, you get an ipod to use through the museum where you punch in numbers of the exhibit and there is a mini video about it.Comfortable shoes helps.I'd recommend it for family, friends and couples.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chillin247365
50,History,"The Getty Villa exhibits an ambiance of Roman times. I can only imagine watching a small intimate performance in the amphitheatre and courtyard. The gardens were carefully designed; and the art work is similarly of that time predominately.The Getty Villa makes for a very good day; one filled with serenity, and takes one out of the fast pace of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justme54481
50,Beautiful villa and galleries,"A beautiful replica Roman Villa, complete with amphitheatre. The Getty Villa has lovely formal gardens and cool inner courtyards. It houses an extensive collections of Roman mosaics, statues and other relics. A “must” for anyone interested in classical antiquities. The setting is perfect with beautiful views. It is easy to find off the Pacific Coast Highway at Malibu.Car parking is free if you visit the Getty Centre in the same day - perfectly feasible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gilld360
50,Amazing,"Went to the villa after the Museum. What an amazing collection of art. It boggles the mind knowing one man collected these pieces and, seemingly, loved every one. The collections were varied and beautifully displayed. And very different than what’s in the Getty Museum. The gardens were lush and lovely from what we saw. Renovations were underway so parts were closed off. But it was so worthwhile seeing this beautiful villa that I highly recommend putting this on your bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/houstontravelingfool
50,History,This a great place to hangout with friends that like art and history. Love the outdoors. Visit Totally worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdanBelmont
50,Lovely gem,"I've always meant to go to the villa and never gotten around to it until recently, as it was somewhat off the beaten path. That is one of the things in particular, though, that makes it such a nice place to visit. Tucked into a beautiful canyon with a glimpse of the ocean in the distance, it's an idyllic retreat from the bustle of LA. Add to that the incredible art, lovely gardens and the fascinating exhibits, it's the perfect place for a day out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmBentley
50,Feels just like Italy!!,"Had an amazing time at the Getty Villa. Its a beautiful place with great views and I felt just like I was in Italy! All of the staff was incredibly friendly and I liked that besides the $15 in parking, admission was free. Definitely book ahead as it gets really crowded!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleyelpern
50,Take a docent lead tour!,"Friendly docents give tours everyday starting at 10am. Take a tour of the gardens, the galleries or the architecture of this recreated Roman villa. It's fascinating!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heathercliff
50,Lovely and Free,"We chose to visit the Getty Villa because we’ve been to Pompeii and thought it would be interesting to see the replica of the ancient Villa de Papyri, which was buried by Mt. Vesuvius at the same time. It’s absolutely perfect and really brings the ancient world to life!We were delighted to learn it was free (timed tickets required) with $15 for parking. We went on a Thursday at 11:30 am. There were several school groups there for about an hour and then the place emptied out.The Villa was under reconstruction during our visit and some of the galleries were closed, but there was still more than enough to see and experience to make it worth the trip. (We spent 5 hours there!) We took two free tours: the architecture tour and the garden tour. Both were educational and interesting, lasting about 40 min each. The pace is very slow and good for seniors who may need to sit occasionally.There is a cafe and a food cart - both are very expensive (two sandwich combos and two beers cost $50).One thing I highly recommend and nearly overlooked (show in photos below): On the second floor of the museum, there is a small room with coins and amulets. There are touchpads next to the displays where you can select the item from the case and view high resolution images of them with the option to zoom in. The tiny details are exquisite! Don’t miss this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/444candim
40,Nice garden,"We were a little disappoint at this once famous garden because the pond/fountain were completely dry due to drought condition in SoCal. Summer in SoCal is extremely hot, we were hoping to get some mist from those fountain...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanbgiang
30,Nice and free,I can't give it 5 stars because I've seen better but it is very nice and it's free. The other Getty Museum location is a true museum and one of my favorites with amazing views.I've been to The Getty on the other side of town many times and finally decided to visit the smaller one. Nice gardens and mosaics. Nice outing but it won't blow your mind. It's worth visiting though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jazzSt_Louis
30,Well kept museum and interesting if you love greek and roman antiquities,We visited here with our kids because it was rated high. Good thing it was free. If you are in the area might be worth it but I wouldn't go out of the way to visit. Tickets for entry are timed. We took a garden tour and I lost interest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlyssaH118
50,Magnificent Museum on Pacific Cost Highway,"We had a wonderful visit to the Getty Villa. We haven’t visited in 10 years. The Villa is FPA RT of the Getty Trust establishes by J Paul Getty as his legacy. The Trust is dedicated to the arts and humanities. As part of Getty’s requirements, there is no admission to the museum. However, the community limits access so there is a fee for the limited parking. You MUST make a parking reservation.Located off Pacific. Coast Highway a few miles north of theSanta Monica Pier, the property offers beautiful views of the Pacific, including Catalina Island.The Villa was the home to Getty in the 1930s. He commissioned the building of the museum as the home of Roman and Greek antiquities. The museum was finished in 1974. But Getty never saw it. He spent the last decades of his life living in London, never returning to the US. Upon his death the Getty Trust became and continues to be the wealthiest Museum in The world.Start your visit with a tour. We enjoyed the video of the museums history, the general tour, the Herb Garden tour and the architectural tours. The docents are excellent. You can use an iPod free of charge to roam the Museum galleries. There are rooms full of Greek and Roman statues and art, including well preserved Hercules and Baccus and many other gods.Stroll through the gardens and enjoy the beautiful fountains. The museum is modeled after an ancient palace at the foothills of Mount Vesuvius in Italy. When Vesuvius erupted, the ash covered the building which was only unearthedThe Villa was designed as An archeological excavation site on multiple levels.We enjoyed a fabulous lunch of Risotto with scallops, flatbread pizza and a burger. Visited the shop and bought some interesting things.This is a must see for museums and antiquities and all things beautiful and historic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrKatieRN
30,Free entry but $15 for parking,Perhaps the story of the getty family is more intetesting than the villa and collectables. Some of the rooms had not opened on our visit and the pool was drained. So not quite as impressive as ut could have been.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joewJ2225DN
50,Beautiful Visit - Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous !,"John Paul Getty was the wealthiest man alive in his day. Visiting his home overlooking the coast gives us a glimpse into the privileges of incredible wealth. Breathtaking views , majestic construction and peaceful nature high atop pacific hills...and all just a short walk from the beach. The art collection is interesting, and impeccable maintained and displayed. This is a well organized and well kept museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFYUL
50,Truly magical,"I find this one of the most enjoyable museums in the USA because its setting is simply unrivaled. The museum is an attraction, all unto itself. The landscaping complements the statuary and I loved the special mosaic exhibit. Unreal. A little crowded with out of state tourists and didn't appreciate the $15 parking but considering the admission tickets are free, there is very little to complain about. Do not miss this spectacular venue if you are interested in ancient art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfdann
40,"very unique but small, need to see once","Another one of our things you should do once, after years of living here. Wanted to see something we never did previously, and we already went to the big Getty, so we tried this.Although it was interesting, and something to do if you are into old artifacts, it is rather small but interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikesI6999GK
50,Incredibly Beautiful Property; Mosaic exhibit is stunning,"Most people are drawn to the famous Getty Center main museum at Mulholland Pass.... but if you have time in your schedule while visiting LA or rediscovering LA as a resident, be sure to go to the Getty Villa.Prior to 1997, this was the only Getty collection we enjoyed and it has always been a treasure!!The Villa now houses the antiquities collection of statuary as well as many fine arts and exhibits.We just saw the Mosaics of the Roman Empire and it was exquisite.The gardens are also beautiful and so much renovation has been done in the last 15 years. Addition renovation work and new installations are under way now in late 2017 and into 2018.The cafe is lovely and the gift shop is really wonderful.... I wish we had had mire time, but we had squeezed in the both the main Getty Center as well as the Villa all in one day which is quite an undertaking.Regarding logistics, this information is important when deciding to go to the Getty Villa:-YOU HAVE TO GO ONLINE AND SIGN UP FOR AN ADMISSION TIME-It’s free (as is the main Getty museum), but YOU HAVE TO BRING AN ADMISSION TICKET FOR A SPECIFIC ENTRY TIME by going online and signing up at the GettyVilla.com- Parking is available in the Villa’s garage, however, if like us you have been to the main Getty Center earlier in the day, bring your your receipt from the paid parking from the Getty parking garage and you’ll get to park free at the Villa!! It’s a two-for-one deal!!-Just don’t forget to bring the printed admission passes for your entry time. Don’t worry if you’re a bit early or late due to traffic. It’s a ballpark entry time when driving in LA!!Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2beans2000
50,"Beautiful architecture, great exhibits","For the price of parking, you get to enjoy a wonderful setting with lots of ancient Roman, Greek and Etruscan artifacts. Tours are provided, as well as an iPod Touch for self guided tours - headphones are provided, or you can use your own. Pack a lunch and eat at the picnic tables. Note that you can only get here from north-bound Highway 1. Cellphone signal may be non-existent depending on your carrier (T-Mo has no reception here) but free WiFi is available at most places. Don't miss the marble sculpture (replica) that you're invited to touch located at the south end of the Villa, at the end of the Outer Peristyle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theimmc
50,Peaceful and informational at the same time,"Lovely gardens and historical museum of ancient times. Spent a couple hours exploring and looking at displays. Gorgeous setting. Make reservations online (free admission), parking $15. Renovations taking place right now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CocoWashington
50,Beautiful Villas Some Renovations In Process,"We made reservations (free) on their website to visit the Getty Villas on the day after Christmas instead of the normal shopping routine. The Villas was approximately half hour drive from our hotel in Redondo Beach. Part of the drive was along highway 1 which takes you by the Santa Monica Pier and a number of beaches. Had the day been nicer (smog or haze from the Santa Barbara fires?) then we could have gotten nicer photos of the Pacific Ocean from the Villas.Once we arrived, we waited in a queue on a slight incline. At the gate, I gave the first person the printouts of all of our tickets. The driver in the car in front just showed their phone so printed tickets may not be required as outlined In the email confirmation? Once verified she passed us to the next booth where we paid the $15 parking fee.We were then directed to park in the central structure nearest to the entrance. There were a lot of open spots that day.We decided to climb the stairs to the Villa but you can also take the elevator. At the top there is an amphitheater and you just walk down to the main entrance or turn to the right to walk through the herb gardens. The garden was nice with a small fountain good for photos and a view to the pacific ocean at the end. We entered the villa through the outer peristyle but the central pool was under renovation so we were not able to take any good photos. We found out this also affected a number of galleries as the Getty were making changes that will be completed sometime in Spring 2018.Once inside the Villa there is a smaller peristyle and a lot of people were taking photos here or just socializing. Galleries were located in the corners and there was one for kids. Each section has Gold Roman numerals on the floor to tell you the year that the exhibits came from. There were good signage and descriptions of the displays and period that the audio tour was not a necessity. The highlights for us were the mosaics which had been removed from different Italian Villas. On the second floor there were more displays mostly focused on statues, jewelry, etc. The east garden was quiet and people were seen reading on the benches. There was also a nice fountain and mosaic inlaid structure that served as a popular backdrop for group photos.Overall we spent about two hours here. It kept both adults and the teens occupied. Definitely will come back again after renovations done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wireless_in_CA
50,Christmas Visit - Spectacular & Not Crowded,Must have a reservation (to park) but free once inside the gates. Amazing collection of antiquities dating back to collections before Christ that were acquired by oil tycoon - Getty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charlesmdawe
50,Mommy daughter day,"It was our first time going and we loved it! It’s free to get in just go online and print out your pass, yes people print out the pass! Pay for parking and enjoy. My daughter and I enjoy a good museum, especially when it has views for days. Plus it’s such a short distance away. This is a great place for a lunch and watch the sunset, you can bring food and chill or they have a cafe to grab some grub. The museum itself is beautiful, you can spend some great time looking over everything. I really enjoyed my time there and will definitely be back with my boyfriend to watch the sunset. Expect to spend make a day of it there is a lot to see!!! I won’t give it all away you have to see it for yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nenaluv
50,Great place to visit if in LA oR near Malibu,"This is a wonderful place to visit, the staff and the docents all do a great job at telling the Getty Story just as he would have wanted it to be told. We took three tours and each was excellent & well worth it if you have the time. A great place to take children too - less costly than a trip to Paris or Rome to see and learn about antiquities. Plan at least 4-5 hrs if you want to do all of the tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drastler
50,Go back in time!,"We were glad we took the time to visit the Getty Villa. It's beautiful and amazing. I don't know if I would take my grandchildren, but my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the many displays and especially the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeannieJacobson
50,Getty Villa is amazing but not worth it while renovations take place,"The Getty Villa is one of my must do’s in LA. Whether to see the exhibit or listen to a lecture or just stroll in the amazing gardens. That said I don’t recommend going until renovations are done. When I was there 11/17 all the downstairs galleries were closed, all Greek and Etruscan work was closed and the most of the garden. It really was 1/3 of itself.The website said some would be closed but I never imagined so much.Getty Villa is a treasure. Go when it can be treasured...not now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjkalish
40,A slice of the ancient world in Malibu,"This was my second visit to the villa while I was on a tour. It had been overhauled since I first saw it about 20 years ago. Sadly, this time around, we could only see about half of the art exhibits because the galleries are being redone so it is advisable to check the status of the renovations if you're coming primarily for the art (if you're been to Italy and other Roman sites or to European or American museums like the New York or Boston collections, you probably won't be particularly amazed). But the site and the gardens are lovely (serious warm climate gardeners might find the plant list of interest) and it is an unique example of what a rich person can do to create a special place. We had a very good introduction to the site by one of the docents. The cafe's menu is limited and in the opinion of one of my fellow travelers, unsatisfactory. I was pleased to see a special area for schoolchildren, who clearly are getting to take advantage of this unique site as part of their education.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KVTraveler
50,Ancient Rome in Malibu,"The Getty Villa is a transformative experience that will take you back 2000 yrs to ancient Herculaneum (modern day Ercolano) with breathtaking architecture copied from the Villa dei Papyri buried by Mt Vesuvius in 79 AD. Save yourself a trip to Italy and visit it in Malibu. You can take gallery tours, architecture and garden tours or do NOTHING and just enjoy the cafe and views of Malibu. The docents are experts. You only pay for parking and if you are in Los Angeles this is a MUST do. You can bring kids but in my opinion this is more adult, nevertheless kids LOVE pretending to be Hercules or Achilles. There are no lines, you just drive in and park then descend stairs into the theater area. You can book group tours as long as you have more than 10 or just join any of their hourly tours, or do your own with an audio guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loveairplanenoise
50,I love it,Another great surprise in LA peace of treasure in Malibu for free part of Getty experience is a must! Parking can be for Getty center and villa if you have a full day visit both grate arquitecture and gardens volunteer elders lovelly plus kindnes and help,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaMartz
50,Fascinating!,"The fact that this entire set of buildings was intended as a copy of a villa in Hercanuleum, which was covered after Pompeii, only makes it more interesting. Getty and his builder did an amazing job of recreating the spaces. And, oh the wall paintings. They are such a beautiful alternative to the heavily painted European ones that came later. Be sure to look up -- and talk to the docents. We would have taken a tour but for time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sewkap
50,The Getty Villa,Wonderful collection in a recreated Roman Villa . Must do the tours the get all the insight to make this a superb visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmm2355
50,Great lesson in architecture,The villa is worth a visit to see the grounds and attend the architecture and garden tours. Cafe food is so-so.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/769tanyap
50,Don't just go to the main Getty - stop here,"You'll have to navigate the weird parking situation, but you will see some amazing artworks from the ancient world. Beautiful location and views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kenpasadena
50,Feel like a roman,"The museum is just beautiful!Getty wanted the visitor to feel as if he was in an Roman Villa and that is just the feeling you get when you enter the grounds.The artifacts are great too, but the buildung and the gardens steal the show.If you arrive past 3pm parking is only $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThomasMBall
40,"Lovely gardens and views, but many sections closed","There is no question that this property, replicating an Italian villa near Pompeii, is beautifully designed and in a lovely setting, but when we were there, several exhibition rooms were closed, and the garden was undergoing renovation. There are definitely some lovely, authentic mosaics, but a number of pieces in the museum are replicas. Having recently visited Italy, I enjoyed seeing more of what I experienced there, but I wouldn’t put a visit to the Getty Villa on the top of my list of museums. Also, given LA traffic, it’s not an easy drive to reach this location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betsy1224
40,"A nice visit, but a bit disappointing","We were so excited to come here as it was mentioned as it being one of the must see cultural destinations to visit. We called to make our reservation(the museum is free) and they gave us a liberal window of time. Driving in California can be horrendous! We paid our $15.00 parking fee(there is no admission charged for the museum), but we did not know that the entire 1st floor was closed for renovation except for the gardens. The gardens are all beautifully landscaped giving a nice peaceful feeling. There is no view of the ocean from the villa but it is in a tranquil location. The villa is modeled after the Villa dei Papiri in Italy. There are sculptures and antiquities on display. Several dining options and a nice museum store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PepperNewJersey
40,The Villa @ Malibu,"The Getty Villa is located in Malibu, CA off of the Pacific Coast Highway. It is out by Arnold's place, so you can stop and say hello !!I had not done sufficient homework to know that this was not Getty's villa, as in a place that he lived. It is a recreation of a Roman villa based on plans that were found in the excavations in Herculaneum near Pompeii, Italy. This truely is a unique place!!!!The tour is excellent with a very nice gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCIrish1944
50,On a recommendation,"My wife was given a recommendation to visit this museum and we are certainly glad we acted on it.It is out of town but worth the effort I would suggest taxi which can drop you off at the entrance if you don’t have a car. Uber is cheap.It is basically Paul Getty’s house that has been turned into a museum and is fascinating. It is a villa built as a replica from the Pompey era and is so detailed it’s hard to believe.There is a short video in a small theatre you can view which details the history so I won’t spoil it for you.It is immaculately looked after and all the staff are very friendly.To say it is unique is an understatement, I am not a regular visitor to museums but enjoy this ver much as did my wife.Plan up to 3 hours for the visit as time just flys as you go around.There are two places to eat a restaurant and cafe and the prices are not exuberant.There are many exhibits with artefacts that are astonishing.There are rest rooms dotted around so no worries there.All in all a real eye opener and so glad we visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwardm887
50,Lovely place with great view,"The Getty Villa is located on Pacific Highway. It was commissioned by the Oil Giant Mr Getty. He never got to see it finished though. You could book tickets online and I think it is free. Once you are at the premise, there is a documentary video explaining the history of The Getty Villa. The outdoor garden has a great view of the Pacific Coast. There are many artifacts collected by Mr Getty while he was in Italy. My suggested itinerary if you have never been to the Getty Villa is 1) visit the Getty Villa in the morning 2) go for lunch at Nobu or Dukes 3) Roam around the Malibu Pier 4) there is a shopping mall near Pepperdine University (ranked number 1 most beautiful campus in the USA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockchic2017
50,unique museum and gardens,"I always thought museums were a place where you went to look at artifacts from previous eras, that were meticulously labeled, laid out, and exhibited. I also thought there were house museums, where you could see original structures as well as period or reproduction furnishings. After the Getty Villa, I am coming to understand that there is a different type of experience, one that has an emphasis equally on museum-level objects, as well as an emphasis on the exterior gardens, and how people interacted with them. Slightly overpricced but high end food. Didn't know you needed to have reservations in advance. Stunning views, wish I could have come back and just sat and enjoyed the gardens without the pressure to see everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cecesimms
30,Bit of a let down after all the hype,"I love Italian and Greek antiquities and was told this is a must visit to experience an amazing collection. After battling the Malibu traffic (not always fun on a sunny weekend) and navigating the somewhat tricky entrance to the Getty Villa, I spent about 45 mins wandering around the many levels of the museum and associated buildings. Its an impressive structure - the many levels and layers do evoke the architect's vision of exploring a big dig near Pompeii, but overall it was a bit enigmatic. Most of the art work was replicas and not originals and many of the exhibits were closed for renovation. I'd probably be more upset if we'd had to pay to get in, but still, time is short and when you make a half day travel commitment to something that is not what you expected its annoying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AKDut
50,Really great museum,Went to the Getty Villa in Malibu today. Really great museum. Unfortunately parts were closed for repair.The cost is free but parking is 15.But if you do both the villa and the center in 1 day you only pay once.They do require you to get reservations. Just go on their Web site and pick a time. You also have to print it out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BCRON
50,"Educational, enlightening, and fun","About half of the villa/museum was closed for rennovation when we were there, but we saw a lot and enjoyed seeing everythihg. Strolled the gardens and had a very nice lunch in the cafe. Pefect weather too! And while there is signage all over the place we still found ourselves getting lost. You enter at one level, then go up and come down to get to the museum. Many helpful docents along the way.BE AWARE: They want to take your tickets as you arrive at the parking ""guard station,"" which we were not prepared for. So we had to move out of the line, unpack a bit, find our tickets, and then enter the entrance drive. That was awkward (we were expecting to have to hand our tickets in, on foot, when we approached the villa).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W7905RGpetera
50,Lovely villa and grounds,"The Getty villa has a spectacular setting on the hillside near Malibu. The villa itself, Roman in style, is quite lovely. Although Neo, a great deal of attention has been given to detail with some beautiful and peaceful inner courtyards. The collections are extensive, with many Roman frescoes.currently there is an exhibition of Hockney portraits which is interesting to view. Admission is free but you pay for parking. This is halved if you visit the villa and Getty Centre on the same day, which is what we did. A great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gilld360
50,A National Treasure,"The Getty Villa is truly a national treasure. A perfect place of beauty, solace, inspiration and awe. The Villa itself is an experience they transports to a higher level of appreciation of creativity and the priceless works of art are not only protected and preserved but also beautifully displayed. Numerous descriptions, lectures, workshops and such make the experience even more rewarding. Music and theater in the courtyard and amphitheater complete the experience. A perfect place to visit soon and often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TedL222
50,Beautiful,"I loved this place. It was peaceful, not over packed and interesting. The artifacts were nothing less than stellar.Although the main garden water feature had a big tent over it, it was still enjoyable. The herb garden was a dream.There were many small groups of children so this is a perfect learning experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeRenee
10,Only because we never entered...,"I was so excited to visit, we registered, printed the tickets, everything was fine until the moment we reached the gates. I have to mention, we are europeans, we walk everywhere, for us it is an option to walk even 10 miles just to get somewhere. We stayed at our friends house that night, which was not so far away from the Villa (""not far away"" by our european standards) Unfortunately, the guards told us that we can only enter if we drove a car, had a bus ticket or presented a bike as a proof that we haven't parked a car somewhere in the neighborhood. As we mentioned we walked, they asked us to prove that we stayed at friends house by printing out the water bill. How absurd is that? Of course we get the rules, there is a city law not to park in the area outside Getty but we found it so funny that it is so hard to believe we just came here walking. It doesn't even make sense to question whether we came from a friends house just around the corner or from a beach from Santa Monica. That's our choice to make. Isn't that supposed to be encouraged in America (I mean, walking), where one third of the people or even more, I believe, are overweight and Los Angeles is covered by thick smog because of so many cars there? Anyway, sadly, we visited Los Angeles for a few days and were very disappointed that we had to be treated as liars near the gates just because americans don't walk anywhere and for that reason weren't able to enter the Villa. I felt really discriminated. I can understand that US has it's own culture (driving so much everywhere) and I don't want to come across as being rude towards that but I believe that such cultural places, museums should be more open minded towards people that came to visit by traveling half of the world and weren't able to have this experience just because of their ignorance. Instead of letting us see the beauty inside, the guards kept on going about the parking laws, treating us badly as if we were criminals, though we didn't even have a car at all and being from Europe, never even imagined that you can be prohibited to enter because you walked there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anaismalli
50,Beautiful ancient art and building,"The beauty and quality of the ancient roman statues, mosaics and art was impressive. The building and gardens were great reproductions of ancient Italy. The self guided tour was easy to use and informative. Liked the video at beginning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ros_Mel2014
50,SPQR in Malibu,"For a avid Roman fan this is highly recommended. The Roman relics on display, the museum has 44000, outshine museum collections in Italy. But for me the star of the show is the museum building which is a true copy of a Roman villa. It was wonderful to get a feeling of what the originals must have looked like. Oh yes access is the cost of parking your car. So a bargain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gustaafw2014
50,"Beautiful villa, wonderful exhibits","Perched up on a hill overlooking the Pacific, this place is just amazing. The garden, the flowers, the exhibit. It's worth a drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OliviaQ
40,Beautiful re-creation of Roman Villa and Gardens with much ancient artwork,"This is a beautiful setting of a Roman Villa and surrounding gardens, housing an extensive collection of Roman Sculptures and Mosaics. The Greek and Etruscan collections are in the first floor galleries, which are closed for renovations, and the pool in the largest garden is also under repair, restricting access and causing much noise. The docent tour was very good - the people at the front gates need some customer service training. Watch out that you don't miss the poorly marked entrance on Highway 1. You think you need to go to the stoplight, and that is too far. Not as great an experience as I was expecting. The Getty Center was better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/230jerryj
30,Getty Villa,"The Getty Centre is my favourite place in LA to visit , this was my first visit to the Villa down the road , beautiful location and if you're into roman artifacts etc it's the place to go. Mr Getty's copy of some roman Villa is bit naff in my opinion - more money than sense .That said the gardens and water features are lovely and you have some lovely views of the coast.You can visit The Getty Centre for no extra cost , there is no admission charge but the parking is $15The Villa is better value when visited alongside The Getty Centre . NB The Getty Centre is closed on Mondays",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisjoanneh
50,"Beautiful place, worth the visit",Loved the visit here. I hadn't been since I was a kid and it was just great! Slightly bummed that the main outside pool is under wraps for reconstruction but I got over it. The grounds are beautiful and the collection is excellent. Parking is $15 but tickets are free to enter. Well worth the visit in Malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwobkk
30,Interesting,It's a beautiful location and modeled after a villa buried in Pompeii. Unfortunately the gardens are under repair and the main floor exhibits are being redone. But the admission is free except for a $15 parking fee. You need reservations too.The grounds that are open are nice and there is a very large herb garden.The second floor is open and has a nice exhibit of statues and frescoes. We enjoyed what they had on display.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jgchicag

40,Returns time after time,"The renovation of this beautiful part of the water dam, and of course limits the overall impression. Certainly, it gives more time to study other parts of the content.One late afternoon one hour before closing, you have almost the whole area for yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,Great Place to Spend a Morning or Afternoon,"Beautifully situated above the Pacific Ocean in Pacific Palisade this museum is very different in style and in its collections from the much larger Getty Center. Be sure to pick the right museum if you are interested in a particular collection, otherwise, do both! There is a nice cafe on site which we enjoyed thoroughly as well.Tip: if you visit both the Getty Villa and The Getty Center (about 30 minutes from each other with light traffic) you can use the same parking pass - just be sure to have it validated before leaving the first museum you visit. 2-for-1 - can't beat it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boeing747-8I
50,Must see in Santa Monica,"We planned a visit here for many years. Made it!We had a garden tour with lovely Christiane who was very knowledgeable and absolutely charming.Unfortunately the splendid front pool area was under repair, but I guess all things need repair. Such a pity not to have seen the reflections, however that didn't detract from the whole experience. Again, most unfortunately the lower museum area was also being reorganised, and again although disappointed it was still a great place to visit. Lots of interesting people, exhibits and dear Charles a volunteer who was a really lovely man who chatted to my husband. Getty you have a great place here, and really lovely people throughout. Don't miss this - oh! Get your tickets free first as they have timed entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannaaustralia
40,Great visit back in time,"Make sure you get your online tickets before you go. We arrived from the north so you need to pass the Getty and make a U turn at the first light. Beautiful grounds, herb garden and views of the ocean. Currently the large pool is under renovation but will be beautiful when finished. WE went for extra credit for my junior high daughter's art class and they will give you a written credit for that. The downstairs galleries are under renovation but we spent about an hour walking the grounds and the upstairs galleries. The kids really liked the smells of ancient times display and had fun with that. Since you get parking for $15 you can also go to the other Getty about 30 minutes away and they validate your parking so you don't pay another fee. It was a full day doing both museums in a day but doable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z0H
50,Spend a nice afternoon!,Visited on an afternoon. Nice place to visit on a date for a couple of hours. The museum is really nice and their restaurant is a great place to relax and chat for lunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MirnaC2
50,More intimate than larger Getty center,"The Getty Villa requires reservations- it's still free but since its smaller than the larger center, is based on time of entry (but they allow you to stay as long as you want). The centerpiece is their museum/villa and the garden. Take a free guided tour to get a better feel about its history. (parking is $20).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loveDCA
30,Nice spot,The Getty Villa is a fun spot for a stop to enjoy some nice art and also a beautiful setting overlooking the Pacific Coast Highway and the ocean. Great stop while visiting Malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
40,Interesting look at ancient Roman art,"Beautiful campus of villa and gardens and ponds and fountains.Sculptures and art work of ancient Rome are displayed, but most interesting to me was the architect detail of the villa itself and the manicured grounds.Tip: There are several hills and steps to navigate. There are several elevators - look for them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALH972
30,For devotees of Ancient Rome,"A number of galleries were temporarily closed for renovations so my rating and review may not be representative. The villa itself is a wonderful building constructed on a hillside in the Pallisades. It contains a large collection of sculptures, mosaics and artefacts from The Roman Empire, all beautifully displayed. Entry is free. Parking $15. Weekends are busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevoHughes1
50,Breathtaking,"A wonderful reconstruction of a Pompeian villa complete with Mediterranean gardens, fountains and theatre. It is a museum as well with items from Naples Bay area including frescos and statues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabercas
50,an afternoon with the gods,"We spent a beautiful Sunday here and Im glad we went early. Summer was just warming up and traffic on Pacific Coast Highway was heating up too. Six of us, all different ages experienced a very pleasant morning looking at the gardens and ancient art. The house in the museum was done to resemble an actual mansion from Pompeii.There are docents to lead and answer questions. There are many steps but also an elevator. An herb garden is a sweet smelling walk. There is food(expensive)available, but bring your own picnic.There is no fee to the museum but you must pay for reserved parking so call ahead for reservations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wilywizard
50,A gem in Malibu,"The Getty Villa is a great place to experience history. The only problem is we didn't allow enough time. Beautifully located just off PCH. The exhibits, gardens, and tours are excellent and worth coming multiple times. Check their website for special events throughout the year. While entrance is free, be aware that parking is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UtahTraveldude
50,J Paul Getty's Museum of Antiquities,"This is the smaller of the two Getty institutions in greater LA and also on the site of his original museum. Both institutions are similar in that they offer free guided tours staffed by volunteers. The tours at both institutions were excellent.The Villa is currently undergoing some major rearrangements which are understood to be driven by the new curator's vision. As a result, much of the 1st floor was closed off. There is, however, things to see in the 2nd floor and the multiple gardens in the complex. The gardens and inner courtyards were the highlights as they went well with the theme of the facility and the weather was really good on the day.They seem to have a few events and in the day, we were able to make perfume as they did back then which was interesting. Will have to make a return visit to catch the sights of the 1st floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DABSMO
50,"Lovely and elegant gardens, fountains, antiquities","Love this place. Feels so spacious and beautiful. Love the tiles and outdoor fountains, fruit trees, and gorgeous art. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable - the food at the cafe is pretty good though not as scrumptious as I was led to believe. The salads were best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maracujagirl
40,A peaceful stop despite current renovations.,"A beautiful place, but if you have the option I would wait until the renovation is done and the Roman pool is filled with water. If your only in town for a short time still worth the stop, was very quiet and peaceful on a Monday morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamaP5
50,One of THE Best Museums in the LA Area,"Old Man Getty was one of the last of the Robber Barons. Who followed form and donated a large part of his fortune to Civic Improvement.What he gave to us is just a marvel of what a Classic Roman Patrician Villa would look like during the Augustinian Age of the Roman Empire.So if The Early Empire Stage of the Romans is of any interest. Than I most highly recommend coming to this beautiful, well set and run Museum.Now for some advice. Go during the Weekday between say 10 to 3 pm. As the Traffic getting there can be a nightmare.Make sure you have reservations otherwise you will be out of luck.Wear some comfortable shoes and pace yourself. As while the place looks small it isn't.Also stay fluid as the beach area there can dry one out. Sunscreen is another good idea.They also have a very nice and reasonably priced Gift Shop with some interesting books and other nicknames for sale. I got a lot of Xmas Presents there for Family & friends there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlB7915GV
50,A Stunning Must See On the Coast Of Malibu,"The stunning Getty Villa is an easy must see while you experience the amazing Ca Highway 1 drive north, or south. Located in a great location you are walking distance to Will Rogers State beach, food, and fun. Sunsets are among the finest in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
50,Nice and worth a visit,Very impressive collection displayed in a beautiful surrounding. Absolutely worth a visit when in Malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaoneh
50,Fascinting Recreation,This is definitely worth your time to see how a roman villa was created in CA! A beautiful setting with fine art and gardens.Being there does feel a bit like you are in Italy where such palaces first existed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Getitright212
40,Relaxing experience,"The Getty Villa is situated on the eastern end of Malibu Beach, LA California. It is one of two Getty Museums in LA. Built by the famous philanthropist Paul J Getty , the Getty villa provides a relaxing outing for the family. However Malibu itself is famous for bumper to bumper traffic and getting to the Villa can be time consuming so plan accordingly.The museum has many interesting artefacts and the display is done very systematically. There are audio and video guides also available.The location provides a great view of the ocean as well.Do carry snacks and water as everything is a tad expensive inside.Overall it was a very good experience for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nazimk2014
50,Wow! Just Wow!,"This is an absolute must for a trip to Malibu! The art work, statues, structures and Gardens!! Just breathtaking. Be certain to get your admission tickets in advance. We truly didn't want to leave. It felt like a European museum. Very impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/491JoL491
30,Worth visiting if you are heading to Malibu,"A nice museum to visit and spend few hours there. It's a free admission, but you need to pay for parking ,$15 .Kids will love going through it, especially the brief show about the history of the place.The only downside of the place was the contradicting instructions and rules you have to follow by the staff there. My selfie stick caused more confusion that in any place I visited, which didn't allow the stick that extends. I was told no to extend it, other staff told me not allowed at all. It was frustrating despite not extending the stick, and abide with whatever they wanted visitors to do. They should have more words to their staff on what's is allowed and not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/769fawzib
30,Depends on your interests!,"Visited the Getty Villa based on a recommendation of ""things to do in LA""The history of the Villa and the philanthropic efforts are notable but this wasn't really an attraction for me.We wondered around for an hour, looked at a few interesting artifacts and left.In the end this is really just a replica of a number of historical items and houses in Europe. To be fair there were a few genuine artifacts but overall meh!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rod102au
50,Bacchus uncorked,"Great series offered at the Getty Villa. Attended the ancient Brews evening. Strolled the villa grounds first. Then went to the auditorium and listened to an interesting lecture about what kind of alcoholic beverages people drank in Europe in earlier days. Then we sipped brews (some made especially for the evening by local breweries) based on ancient European recipes, out on the upper deck. Great appetizers and conversations with the lecturers. Interesting brews. Perfect night out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judy92015
50,Great Greek and Roman History,Get reservations and just GO. This is a must see place in the LA area. The garden is fantastic. Even the gift shop is good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simimike
50,Getty Villa,"Beautiful Mediterranean style Villa converted into a museum. Just make sure you reserve online, it is free but online reservation required. I think the best way to visit is through joining their guided tour. It was wonderful learn so many amazing things from their tour guide. I never knew what ""museum"" means. It is coming from the word: -muse( inspiration) and museum means house of inspiration. What an amazing description..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freedom725693
30,Overrated,"This is a huge roman style villa built by Mr Getty to display his Greek/Roman ancient art collection. The villa is a reproduction of a Pompeii villa. If you have ever been to Italy or any museums which has Roman/Greek arts, the villa is not worth visiting. If not, go for it as it is a good preview of what Roman/Greek architecture is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P4INTKILLR
50,"We really enjoyed the villa, as did the children.","We weren't disappointed by the exhibits, displays and villa. Unlike some who failed to look into it before their vista, we knew what to expect. Despite what's been written by some on here, their website clearly states that parking is $15, that you need to orebook your tickets, and that there is one specific entry point for the few visitors who arrive on foot. When you book your FREE tickets online, all of this is explained quite clearly.All of that aside, we really enjoyed the exhibits, found the audio tour informative and quite funny, and the staff friendly and helpful. It's probably nit the kind of place that we'd keep going back to, but we're really glad that we went, and enjoyed our 3 hours there.Getting there early was a good move, as we'd pretty much finished before the place became crowded. The staggered entry surely helps with that. The security checks were thorough, and unexpected, but due to the staggered entry, this was all done without delay or lines. We found the museum to be well set out and well managed, and the staff to be efficient and friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dromomaniac
50,Visit,Beautiful property. Be sure to make reservations ahead of time on weekends. Took a guided tour of the mosaics. It was great. Looks like it is a great venue for concerts that they hold. Staff was very helpful. Really nice exhibits of early Roman and Greek artifacts. Very nice garden.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Connector276887
50,Hidden gem,Beautiful place combined with a museum and peaceful gardens. It is not crowded even on weekend so you can relax and spend a day for all the antiques. Guided tour is available for easy understanding of the villa. Remember to book your ticket in advance,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/openyoureyes369
50,Such a beautiful place,Gorgeous artwork on display. Beautiful grounds. Amazing buildings. I think I liked this place better than the Getty museum. they had several displays closed for renovation but there was still plenty to see. Quite an enjoyable visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krisgils33
50,Antiquity heaven,"Spent a day here and could easily have come back the next day and done it all over again. Huge car park where parking is $15. The higher you drive up, the closer to the entry point (this is counter to most places). Free entry to villa. You can do guided tours but I opted for the iPod self guided tour. This gave me the freedom to meander around in an unstructured way. That said, I would definitely recommend the short intro film in the theatre. It provided a great overview of J Paul Getty, the Villa, The trust and more which was especially useful for an ignorant person like myself. (Thank you Charlie - volunteer - for recommending how I maximise my time.)This is a remarkable place. The artwork is impressive and I like the way the site is dedicated to the antiquities. The building, structure, gardens, presentation - impeccable. I found the stained glass fascinatingly intricate - it is amazing what these artisans could do with so little so long ago.The Getty Villa is a very inspirational place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerryk615
50,"restful gardens, beautiful antiquities.","Great place to escape the hustle and bustle of LA. The Getty Villa is full of priceless antiquities housed in a Roman-style villa, complete with Mediterranean gardens. We went on a Monday and it was pretty quiet and peaceful. You must book tickets in advance though or you will be turned away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/176leonie
50,Nice Roman sampler,"The Villa is a lovely spot to visit including lunch at the Cafe. You will get to see a decent collection of mosaics and artifacts from the Roman era. Quite a few halls are being renovated now, but there is enough to see during a visit now. Don't miss the walk in the Roman Aisle and the herb garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mahakavi
50,Weekday visit - not crowded,I went on a Thursday. It was crowded but not enough to cause problems with seeing the beautiful artifacts. Remember to read the signs about the rooms that hold the items. The rooms are also replicas of different houses in Italy. The audio tour was helpful and gave more background info about the different areas of the villa. Also - vets do not have to pay for parking in the summer!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goyeaux
50,Worth It,Parking is $15 but the museum is free. Getty never saw the Villa completed. Good for a couple of very pleasant hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dunn45
50,Beautiful place to visit,"I went to visit Getty Villa in July 2017. If Mr. Paul Getty was still alive, I would write him a letter, thanking him how generous he was for sharing this beautiful property and priceless collection with public for free (the only fee you pay is parking for $15).There were some repair in progress and some galleries were closed as they were reinstalling the collection. Still, with the collection that I was able to see, I personally could be there for more than 3 hours if it wasn't for another event that I had to attend.The property is located right across from the Malibu beach which makes your visit even more enjoyable with the ocean breeze cooling off the temperature during summer time.Visit the website for sure for instructions and obtaining tickets before you just drive up there (you need to print the ticket in advance).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/705faridag
50,"Spectatcular in every way, on top of being FREE!","If you are looking to visit the Getty Villa, please make sure you program your GPS correctly, as the Getty Center (or Getty Museum) is not far away and is a different attraction entirely. The Getty Villa is a built from scratch replica of an Italian villa that was excavated near Pompeii that had been covered by volcanic lava from the Vesuvius eruption 2,000 years ago. John Paul Getty built it to house his personal extensive collection of antiquities from Greek and Roman times. It is a superlative and impressive collection of sculpture, mosaics, and other artifacts presented in an absolutely incredible setting of buildings set into a hillside at the southern end of Malibu that overlook the Pacific Ocean, which can be seen from the higher elevations of the villa. All of the grounds are equally spectacular with fountains and gardens literally everywhere. Apart from the $15 parking fee, this attraction is free to enter. There is a nice café on the grounds, so if you spend the day or several hours you can take a break and eat and drink. We toured the villa with my 90-year old mom, who has mobility difficulties, but the facility is friendly to such individuals in that it has elevators and ramps that provide access to those who require such conveniences.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blackie411
50,My dream home,In the gift shop I offered to buy the villa and put it on my credit card but offer refused. LOVE this place. Would volunteer if we lived closer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andromedagalaxy
40,Beautiful location and collection,This is a fabulous place to visit for an hour or 2. There is no admission charge - you just need a timed ticket. Parking is $15. The cafe offers nice selections - not inexpensive but certainly tasty. The gift shop has lovely and unique gifts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q8730YMsharonm
50,Exceptional Antiquities Collection in Stunning Setting,"It's an easy and beautiful drive Along Highway 1 to the Getty Villa in Malibu, best approached from the south. Book your tickets ahead of time otherwise you'll be turned way if the garage is full. We were able to park free with our paid receipt from the Getty Center garage where we were earlier in the day. The villa is a replica of Roman villas unearthed in Pompeii and Herculaneum, with gorgeous gardens, a reflecting pool (empty at the moment) and rooms full of Greek and Roman art. Many of its galleries were closed for reconstruction when we were there so we didn't see the entire collection, but what we did see was very impressive. I imagine it will be even more spectacular when the renovations are finished. Still very much worth a visit, even with its current limitations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RCSColumbus
50,Beautiful views and perfect to roam around,this is my first visit here and was astounded by the roman mosaic exhibit as I have been to both greece and italy including pompeii/rome. it was not overwhelming and plenty of space to view the different rooms and exhibits. be sure to roam the gardens and enjoy the wind coming off the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmbunl95
10,Unbelievably rude people and not worth it,"I visited with two other young women and we were absolutely horrified by how the parking and security guards treated us. Rather than helping us to enter properly (since it is for some still-unknown reason impossible to walk into the grounds on foot), they simply yelled at us and laughed maliciously at our discomfort. Some other visitors saved us by offering a ride into the grounds. The art is fine and the gardens are decent (although I did find the villa pretty tacky), but none of that made our truly scarring interactions with the guards worth it. They yelled at us again on the way out when we tried to figure out where to have our Uber rescue us from (no signage about it, yet you can't have them pick you up near the parking garage). I really don't understand how they found a collection of staff with so much hostility. Wondering if they train them to be cruel so they don't have to deal with crowded spaces on the grounds. Good luck if you decide to go. Maybe book an appointment with your therapist for the day after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94acb
50,Beautiful,This is an amazing beautiful place. You cannot even tell you are in the middle of Los Angeles. A must see for visitors to LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/questionsc

50,Stunning Museum - Gardens,"A stunning building, gardens and complex. Shows no expense spared. It's free to visit but there is a $15. parking fee. A reservation to visit is required. The place is not over run with visitors. Stay as long as you want. Building and decoration is patterned after a Roman villa. Combined with the exhibits its a great museum experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/358ea
50,"A trip to Rome, back in time!","When you visit the Getty Villa, you take a trip to Rome in the style of living of the rich and titled, with the reproduction of a Roman villa filled with antiquities and having a beautiful garden as it would have looked in 1000AD. The staff is helpful, the parking ample, though you do need a reservation. Great fun to test the amphitheater for it's acoustics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valerieh256
50,A MUST SEE,"I know that there are many must sees along the PCH but The Getty Villa stands out. Not only are the antiquities and art of the very best, you are outdoors most of the time in settings that only Roman emperors experienced. Beautiful, peaceful, astonishing and fun. As I said, a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Armen1968

50,Had to see the original Getty,"My mother-law has enjoyed this place since before the Getty Center was built and because of this I've always wanted to come here. I have been to the Getty Center, but the timing never worked out toVisit the Getty Villa until now. So glad I finally got here. The buildings, the grounds, the views, his collection of Greek and roman antiquities is amazing. Highly recommend you watch the history of Getty when you arrive. We had reservations and I appreciated the way they manage crowds. We felt like we had space to look at the things we wanted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sutrotower
50,Stunning!,"What a gift! While entry is free, a ticket is required to limit the number of people on site at any given time. So grateful for that! It made strolling the campus and looking at the antiquities so relaxing. There is a lovely restaurant, but they also have a picnic area, so you can bring your own. Be sure to check out the video about the history. It's only 12 minutes long. Stroll the gardens and soak in that you are looking at art that is thousands of years old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E9838ZYchristines
50,A gem in Malibu,"Went in without a reservation on July 4th weekend, free entry, parking is $15.

40,On the Hill,We were tracing north on the Pacific Hwy and saw the Getty Villa from the road. But we arrived too early in the morning and could only see the outside. It opens at 10:00.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/502deborahr
50,Incredible,The place (architeture) is unbelievable! the history and marble pieces from mitology are amazing as well and the gardens.....wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!you have to book your visit on their website but you can do just one day before the visit. 2 or 3 hours are enough at the place and worth the visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisandra11
50,Enlightening,"This was my first stop on my agenda the day i landed in LA. Located off the Pacific HWY in Malibu. I thought i needed a ticket for entry but the free ticket was provided at drive entrance.. did pay for cover parking though. The Villa was enlightening, like stepping into different era. Getty even has stage for theater plays outside. Enjoyed the history of ancient Greek & Romans. Got pic of Venus, Goddes of Love ♡. But be aware, no cameras with a flash allowed inside the building. The botanical garden placed me in their times. Sadly the pool was out of water due to conservation (pic) Great educational museum. Do recommend as a tourist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynCeeG
50,Getty Villa,This was built before the Getty Center. It's beautiful and definitely worth the visit. Make sure you go online and get your free tickets beforehand. Take your time going through it. If you love pants and architecture - this is a must.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25huyd

The actual villa is stunning, and dozens of gardens are gorgeous as well as revitalizing! Handicap friendly and just the right size where minimal walking is necessary. Pack a lunch or plan a picnic to enjoy alongside the Coy pond. I highly recommend visiting this local gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bnajar16
50,Lovely Place!,"After visiting both Getty Center and Getty Villa, I found the Villa more manageable than the Center for a day trip (not to discount how much I love Getty Center, though, i just wish I had more time in the Center).This villa is very beautiful with unique gardens. There are still plenty of exhibitions in the galleries that kept me occupied for a full day. The visitor center provides in-depth self audio guide on iPhone, which you can easily loan it for free with a valid driver's license. The docent-led tours are hit-or-miss, depending on who provides it. I had a wonderful, interactive, and informative garden tour, but the architectural tour was so dry and boring that I decided to drop out in the middle.The place is located a short drive from Santa Monica, or, if you are adventurous like me, a bus ride can still take you here. Definitely plan a day to visit this place, it's a hidden gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cellowu
50,Very Nice and wonderful place to see,"This used to be the location of the getty museum until it moved many years ago to west LA, it is the original home of J Paul Getty, and a great place to see.. I think this is a must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeinMalibu

50,Wear your toga,"This space has the ability to transport you back in time to the splendor that was Roman country life before Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE. Picture yourself walking these colonnades with Caesar's father-in-law (so they say). We visited on a sun-drenched CA day (first in a week) and the sights were spectacular. Although the view of the Pacific is interrupted by quite a few trees, the feeling of gracious country life is palpable. There were wandering actors, a ceremonial sheep (on wheels), jugglers, all creating a wonderful atmosphere. Entry is free (amazing) with a $15 parking fee. Reservations required.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmjc
40,Beautiful!,The Getty Villa is beautiful and is perfect for pictures. There are museums in the villa as well so you can definitely spend an hour or more there. We arrived after 3pm so parking is only $10 ($15 before 3pm). There is no admission fee but you do need to make a booking online first before you can access.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cpcch0i
40,Beautiful location but limited exhibits,Visiting the Getty villa is a good way to kill 2-3 hours in Malibu. The grounds and the building are beautiful but it gets a bit hard to appreciate this when it is crowded. The intro film is very interesting and a must see to get some context on what a Roman style villa is doing in Malibu. The collections are a bit limited but interesting but the gardens are definitely the biggest draw.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NarenG
50,A great place to visit.,"After seeing the Getty Museum, a few years ago, we wanted to see the Villa. It is a beautiful estate residence that has now been made into a museum. The grounds, flora and fauna and artifacts help place you back in time to a Roman Villa. And if the weather cooperates you can be transformed in time and space to another era.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliotr977

Its not technically in Malibu but it doesn't matter. Must have reservations, parking costs $5 I recall, but there's NO ADMISSION charge. You can show up without reservations if you've taken the bus. Lovely art antiquities and nice grounds. Not to be confused with the Getty Center, this is smaller in structure but more eloquent in its architecture and sizable in acreage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632
40,A rather unique museum experience,"While the Getty Center houses vast majority of Getty's collection, the Villa provides a unique experience to the visitors that most traditional art museums don't: you get to experience how Roman live.Compared to the Getty Center, Villa maybe a more interesting place for young children to visit, since it has beautiful gardens to explore with less restrictions. It is delightful to walk through the herb garden surround by the herb aroma, and imagine how Roman lived 2000 years ago.Do take the guided tours. I did both architecture and garden tour back to back. Good place to refresh lessons took on Greek mythology too.If going to the Getty Center on the same day, don't forget to ask one of the staff for a parking voucher by showing your paid parking receipt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/icedmocha_L
50,Stylish Gem,"Roman-inspired architecture and original artwork awaits you in this quiet gem close to the Pacific Coast.We took the 45-minute free architectural tour which was very informative and inspiring. After the tour, we walked through the premises. Gardens and buildings are very nicely done. The galleries on the top floor would have been interesting, but were not accessible. You can buy food at the café or bring your own to the picnic area.It is probably a good idea to go mid-week during the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wolfhomma
20,WAS CURIOUS TO SEE,Stopped past the Getty Villa given a recommendation to do so. There was a modest museum and outdoor garden to tour. You could barely hear our tour guide going through the garden. The only good thing is we got there early to avoid long lines. Glad we went but definitely something only worthy of an one time visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Trippermonth

50,Wonderful...,"This was an unexpected highlight of our LA trip.The entrance/parking fee of fifteen dollars is well worth the experience.The villa has a beautiful setting with views of the ocean. The museum pieces on show are beautifully displayed, well labelled and organised. There are four stunning gardens to enjoy - the East Garden, the Herb Garden and the Inner and Outer peristyle gardens. Staff are knowledgable, polite and respectful. You can wonder for as long as you wish.The visitor centre is clean and modern. We didn't use the restaurant but the cafe offers drinks, fruit bowls, hot dogs and panninis at average prices. The shop offers books and souvenirs are average prices too.The vistas are stunning from every angle. A photographers and historians dream!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweetjustine
50,Beautiful History Lesson,The Getty Villa is beautiful. The Villas has an intimate atmosphere and is so relaxing you will want to stay all day. We took a guides garden tour which was very informative. I preferred this location over the Getty Museam in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture8371018
40,Under construction but still good,"There is a lot of the villa closed to the public at the moment, so if you are a local, it's probably best to wait a few months. But if you're visiting from out of town, don't let this put you off. The gardens are beautiful and the collection on display is still worth a visit. Try to join on of the tours for extra insight into what's there and the history. The cafe isn't bad too.Free entry, free tours, $15 parking. Very good value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niceguy1966
20,Overrated,"While I hold a great interest in art history, I felt the few artifacts while being very unique, interesting small collections.. not worth the visit.Parking is $15.00 before 3, $10.00 after 3.. felt like I was donating to the Getty oil tycoon fund.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tennislefty
50,"Even with Construction, Lots to See","Driving through the extreme traffic of the PCH, one thinks, this better be worth it - and it definitely is. Even thought there was a lot of construction work underway at the museum, there are still tremendous works of art to see (everything is over 2,000 years old our docent told us) and the gardens are magnificent. I took lots of pictures hoping to transform my yard into something a fraction as grand as these gardens. As other posters have indicated, you must go online and reserve your space, parking is $15 per car and there are bag and purse checks (backpacks must be checked in). This is an adventure that will absolutely make you take a deep breath and relax just a little bit - a welcome relief from So. Cal traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineess
40,"Nice, quiet afternoon","One of those museums you can see in just an afternoon. Lots of close up exhibits and check for special visiting art. Also check for live drama in the outdoor theatre. Skip lunch here - limited Cal-deli sort of food. Instead, hold your hunger til you can get down the hill (at Topanga) to the Reel Inn for a casual fresh fish dinner!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zumablu
50,Awesome Day at Getty Villa,"Most places were closed on Mondays, but The Getty Villa is open.It is closed on Tuesday.You pay $15 to park in their garage and the rest of the experience is free!There are guided tours to take, self- guided audio tours(free), and gardens and grounds to explore.The Getty Villa has a cafe.The food is good but pricey.It closes at 3 do get there before then.The Getty Villa stays open from 10 am-5pm.We spent the whole day here and loved every minute.Of course there is a medium sized gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmlaque
40,Amazing place,Amazing place to visit if u can squeeze in all the other attractions that LA has. We spent at least 3 hours doing guided tours n enjoying all the beatiful artefacts n arcutecture plus gardens etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/611DavidP611
50,What an Experience,"Such a beautiful place and wow, so much history. This museum is so nicely done, truly. I just can't say enough about how lovely everything was done. Part of the museum was closed during our visit but what we saw was great. Some beautiful pieces of history here. If you appreciate history at all, it is one you should add to your list. It's more than just the pieces themselves it's how they have placed them and the grounds and museum itself. Just amazing.This attraction is free but you do need to get advance tickets, which you can do on line at their website. There is a $15 parking fee though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4Bug-a-Boos
40,Piece of history,"We did not expect to visit a museum during our visit with a friend in LA but were pleasantly surprised. Taking in the short film before the visit is a must as it puts everything into perspective. This ""Villa"" has a lot of history and what Mr. Getty accomplished is admirable. This is a relatively small museum so if you want some culture but don't want to spend hours and hours in a museum, it is worth the detour. The grounds are absolutely wonderful. Tip: go early in the morning, you won't need to book in advance, and you'll be out before lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MapleandTango
50,Lots of free and interesting tours!!,Thanks you Ms Lucy for spending close to 1 hr showing us all the 4 gardens in Getty Villa. It was interesting and educational. We also joined their Architecture tour and Curator tour.The staff are all passionate and eager to share their knowledge of the place to you. Even though the 2nd floor was closed when we visited we still spent half a day there.Try to save on the $15 parking fee by going to Getty Center and Getty Villa on the same day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WT_Tong
30,Kind of disappointing,"The first time I went here was 20 years ago, missing the huge concrete auditorium, restaurant convention centre type bolt on it has now. It had charm, a little run down perhaps and gave a really feeling of what a roman villa would have felt like. It is now slick, entering requires you to drive or come by taxi. There are two check points to negotiate! It's very busy. Feel they are now better off back in Greece, Italy and Egypt. This is a pointless establishment, without a purpose.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N5900XOkeithm
10,"Boring, not much to see","Very boring, not many antiques. No paintings just sculptures and vases. I don't recommend going far to see this. It took me 20 mins to see everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinewood523
50,Wonderful way to spend an afternoon,"Free to visit the villa, but $15 to park. Reservations are usually required, but we showed up and they invited us to enter without reservations since they weren't busy. There is a 12 minute introductory movie. Then just spend your time wandering through the rooms and appreciating the art collection and the beautiful setting. There are tours available as well. Don't miss this lovely place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988pamm
50,Beautiful vires,It's worth a visit. I believe it's free and it has beautiful grounds and views of the ocean. We went near closing time so didn't have time to read and learn everything about it but the grounds alone are worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soraya47
40,"Peaceful, beautiful visit to Getty Villa","We had a very pleasant 2 hours at Getty Villa. An impressive array of Greek, Roman and Etruscan treasures are on display. The second floor is closed so it was easy to check out the lovely gardens and treasures in the Villa. The second floor cafe was very good and admission is free. Easy to get to and easy to park. Just make reservations in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASB2006
40,Classical Art and Architecture Meet Stunning California Coastline,"The Getty Villa houses antiquities dating back thousands of years in a recreated Roman Villa. The experience of wandering through the gorgeous gardens and viewing phenomenal works of art and architecture are enough to make you feel transported to Rome herself. I would recommend a visit to anyone (from scholar to sixth-grader) interested in Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities. Tickets are free and must be reserved ahead online. Parking ranges from $10-15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessSwanTraveler
50,Wonderful. Reservations required.,"It's free to enter although it cost $15 to park. Reservations required. We took both the garden and architecture tours. Each lasts about 45 minutes. There is quite a bit of overlap between the two. I would probably take the garden tour over the architecture if you were choosing only one. There is a 12 minute film on the making of the Getty Villa. While it opened in 1974, Getty never visited the Villa before his death in 1976. He was quite involved though in almost all aspects from a distance. While I liked lots of the collection, I was very taken by the beauty of all the different colors and locations of the marbles. There is one room, #CIV, which has mostly a display of many kinds of marbles. There is a cafe on-site. We had bean soup and the Mediterranean platter. I am sure there are much better choices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chitownsam
40,"A lovely place to pass the afternoon, splendid villa, nice cafe","We went over to this well known museum in Malibu, yesterday.A tasteful display of antiquities ( Part of the personal collection of the oil tycoon Paul Getty), it was designed ( Using the original plans)and built to house the Getty art collection, recreating the Villa dei papiri, in ancient Herculaneum, which was buried when Vesuvius erupted.Parking is limited, and it's better to call ahead to avoid disappointment, costs 15$ ( Inclusive of same day parking at the Getty Center) while admission to the museum is free ( Advance, Free, timed entry tickets online enable easy access if there is a rush).No walk ins are allowed, and if reaching by public transport the driver has to give you a note certifying this!!! ( You have to submit a receipt along with the free ticket if a taxi drops you off)-something about an agreement between the museum and the residents of the neighbourhood.The is a short introductory 12 minute film,( viewed in a small hall to the right of the entrance, just beyond the portico of the villa)which explains how the museum came to be, and the story behind its vision and construction.The exhibits which include marble statues, terracotta vases and delicate metalwork, are beautifully displayed in cool and exquisite, marble floored and walked chambers. Exquisite marble panels!The architecture of the villa itself is to be marvelled at, the recreation of the splendour in which the aristocrats among the ancient Romans must have lived The lovely pools in the courtyard gardens flanked by the colonnaded peristyles evoke visions of a bygone era.The view of the sea from one end of the villa is splendid.The museum exhibits can be covered in about 2 to 3 hours. And don't forget the herb garden ( could have been cared for better)with a collection of herbs used in Roman times, many which we still use today.You can have decent food at the Cafe in the Villa, or bring your own ( Or at least some seemed to have), to enjoy in the lovely sunlit area that we did.All in all you could find worse ways to spend an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshokP900
50,Wonderful day trip,"If you have never been - go! Words cannot describe what a unique experience this is. Even having been there before, it's always an enjoyable day. The gardens, architecture and art make this place one of my favorite memories of my trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattib59
50,Lovely,"$15 parking with online reservation buys a few hours in paradise. Go at 10 when they open, then take your parking receipt to the new Getty and get free parking there. Well worth a day for both, have lunch at the villa or in Malibu at Gladstones for a complete SoCal day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scubamax59
50,World-class tourist site,"Putting aside the fact that JP Getty was an all-around not-nice-guy and an anti-semite (he was Hitler's guest at the 1936 Olympics), this place is magnificent! The glory of ancient Rome -- right here in L.A.The grounds are spectacular, the exhibits rare and worthwhile, and the free guided tours interesting and entertaining. You can spend anywhere from a couple of hours to a whole day there, depending on your interest in Greek and Roman antiquities.Just make sure you make a reservation -- cuz you won't get in otherwise!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drucksterino
40,Worth the stop,The Getty Villa was beautiful and we were free to walk the grounds at our leisure. You must reserve a spot before going. We spent about two hours here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolm976
30,Worth seeing,"If you love ancient history this is place for you. Well laid out with gorgeous gardens, intimate display rooms and magnificent marble floors and walls. Free. Parking $15. Easy to access. Well designed. Views of the ocean were spectacular. But. Very clinical/collector style of presentation rather than informative. Details on the providence of the piece. I guess it is showcasing an amazing collection not a museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiceylulu
40,"Lovely place to visit, but try going to the Centre too","Lovely setting with art and sculptures, the $15 allows you to get into both if you show your ticket.Makes a change from the normal tacky tourist trail!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peppermint
40,Very good although Center is a touch better,"I visited the Center first, going there for 2 hours then down here for lunch. It's only 25 minutes between the two and the parking charge of $15 covers both if you register with the office.Its a beautiful spot and with a nice layout and a good cafe, but to be honest I was a little disappointed. There was refurbishing work going on and not an enormous amount to see, with the Center being considerably larger.But, it is free and it's a beautiful spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jordan1964
50,Wow,Wasn't sure we would like this place. But it is truly amazing. The views are spectacular. And the galleries are unbelievable. A must see if you in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steveb0029
40,A place for contemlation,"Undoubtedly an attraction worth a visit, even for the not completely art history versed.Beautiful historical objects in original or well-made replicas.Stylish park complex, however, lacks water in its pool facility",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,Beautiful Roman Villa with antiquities,"If you're into seeing art in sito or in its natural environment, or you want a fabulous space that the visionary J Paul Getty created to house his amazing personal collection of antiquities, go to the Getty Villa. You need to go online and reserve your entrance time. The museum is free but the parking is $15 per vehicle. After you print out your free ticket you can enter. We went in April and there was availability on the same day basis. Check the weather in Malibu, it is different then Los Angeles as to when the fog comes inIf parking in the left-hand structure, I would suggest parking at the very top of the parking structure, so that will get you where you will exit the parking garage. As you walk along the walkway to the museum, look to your right to some amazing views of the ocean through the narrow canyon that the Villa is situated in.Because they want you to explore the Villa as if it were an excavation site. You start at the top and then have to take an elevator or stairs down to the Villa. There are free tours – architectural, garden, and special highlights that take about 40 minutes and are free. They are located just across from the gift shop. Just be aware that the special highlights tour only looks at a few pieces but it looks at them with a lot of detail. Right when you enter the Villa, to the right is a small theater that you can see a 12 minute video on J Paul Getty and his inspiration for re-creating a villa exactly as it was discovered in Pompeii. There are also headsets.I took the architectural tour. It was led by a lively woman named Phyllis who provided all sorts of detail to the life of a Roman living in the Villa.Unfortunately. A large part of the collection is currently unavailable to see until Spring 2018 because the top floor is going through a collection adjustment – previously the collection it was thematically arranged and they are going to change the way that the collection is presented. The upstairs is not decorated in a villa themed environment, more a standard museum environment so you're not losing any of the Villa my not going to that partBut the bottom part of the Villa, and all of its villa decorated rooms and the iconic pieces of the Getty Villa are all on view.There is a large interior courtyard with the long water feature – it is dry because it is not cool to have excessive water when we had a drought for seven years in Los Angeles. Even though most of the drought is over, they still have not filled the water fountain. What I did learn from the architectural tour is that this pool in the original Roman villa was 8 feet deep and housed fish for eating. At the end of the courtyard is another beautiful view through the canyon to the ocean if you are there on a day where the fog has lifted.The museum also has an upscale somewhat pricey cafeteria available and a coffee cart outside. I found the food to be fresh and quite good. There is indoor and outdoor seating.After a leisurely lunch and wandering through the collections, I had a refreshing day near the beach with a beautiful view looking at unbelievably amazing antiquity pieces.I probably go to the Getty Villa once a year with friends or family visiting. It is a unique space not only for Los Angeles but for the entire country – nothing really like it anywhere else outside of ancient Greece and Rome. Even in the ancient world, it is not in pristine condition. On a previous visit, I came with my mother who had just come from Greece and Turkey. She wished she had seen the Getty Villa before her trip so she knew what all the antiquities really were supposed to look like in their day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbiLyn1
40,Amazed,Remarkable opulent collections of art & sculptures. Take plenty of time to appreciate the entire surroundings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LimChenL1
50,Wonderful half day visit with young children,"Having seen the original villa in Herculaneum, it was wonderful to see this recreation. Entry is free although parking is charged. The villa itself has beautiful gardens and quiet areas, and the small rooms contain a variety of antiquities. A family room had lots of activities for our young children, including decorating Greek vases and creating a shadow theatre. Lots of people on hand to answer questions. There is a cafe and a small, but well-equipped shop. All in all, we spent about two hours there - a lovely morning and one that we will all remember.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lirac
40,A Roman Holiday Worth Exploring,"There is no question The Getty Villa on PCH, the original Getty museum, is one of L.A.'s premier destination landmarks. The relative recent addition of an authentic Roman Centurion villa, complete with slave quarters in the basement, is remarkable. It was recreated from a recently unearthed Centurion ""estate"" in Italy. As magnificent as this domain is, they did not have air conditioning and dentistry had a looong way to go. My last visit and my only qualm was the tour guide spoke over the heads of most folks in attendance, assuming we we all had PHD's in cultural anthropology. They should know most tourists do not and I would have appreciated a more colloquial narrative. One would do just as well with headphones where you can go at your own pace and interest. The grounds and landscaping are magnificent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266PaulR
50,Museum,The Getty Villa was an amazing experience. The Italian influence is everywhere. The food at the cafe is also a treat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredraymond522
50,"Easy to get to on the 534 bus to Malibu, from Santa Monica","You must have a ticket booked before you arrive, unlike the Getty Center. The bus driver will give you a ticket which you show to the security at the gate, the send down a van to pick you up. The garden is exquisite, for me it is up there with Villandry in France. Easy to get back to Santa Monica on the bus as the bus stop is just outside the centre",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMANBRAD
50,Could be in Italy!,"The Getty Villa is a reproduction of an Italian summer villa complete with sea views, herb gardens, and long pool garden. Upstairs are amazing mosaics and the whole grounds are sprinkled with Roman statues. This is full of Getty's personal collection, which outgrew his original house. This place was custom-built to show off his collection of Roman artifacts. The grounds were renovated to include an amphitheater and many levels upon which to view the villa and grounds. The museum is free, but parking on grounds is $15, but $10 after 3pm. You can't park in the surrounding neighborhood so don't bother. There is a good cafe on premises, along with a gift shop. Great place to spend the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TartanCat57
50,Beautiful Place To See,This is such a beautiful place to see. The paintings and sculptures are magnificent. It somewhat gives you an idea what Pompei and other Greek cities were like back in the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dear_maryyy
40,A Beautiful Vision Fulfilled,The Getty Villa is the culmination of J Paul Gettys re-creation of an Italian villa in Malibu. It is superbly built and furnished with many museum pieces inside and around the grounds.Admission is free but a reservation is required. Parking is $15 per car.Just off the PCH north of Santa Monica it is a great visit and should take a couple of hours to see everything.Moderate walking with some stairs is required though ramps and elevators are available if needed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rsglmg0714
40,Good Clear weather event,"Per the web site, you make a reservation to access the Getty Vila but as we came on a weekday and I think maybe 15 cars were in the lot, they did not pay much attention to the time we arrived. The place must be a zoo when the lot is full, we found it great to have it so empty so weekdays may be the key!We walked around and ask about the deal with tours as we had signed up for a tour. Seems they have a move to get ""the story"" and depending on timing you can do that when every you have time, it runs all the time so no big deal. You will not screw up life if you do a tour without having done the film yet.Seems the experience on a tour depends a lot on who does the tour. They are done by volunteers and the program is ....somewhat flexible. We did an architecture tour and it was very good. Guess we got a good egg.Later, we did the garden tour and he went on and on about mythology and we thought it may talk about oh maybe plants or you know, gardens. Oh well, you pay for parking and not tours so you get what you pay for.The place is very nice, has great art and is not huge so you can wonder around as you like. I might skip it if it was a rainy day as a lot is outside. We did this the day after the Getty Center and liked it much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smokeater55
50,Fascinating - so much to take in - and beautiful!,"Spent a few hours here, could have spent the whole day. Take the time to join in the guided tours and see the video; it all enhances the experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmelP200
50,Well worth a visit,Wow what a treasure trove! It was a pity that the upper floor was closed on the day of our visit. We could have spent longer there but were on a tight schedule. Would love to return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaymiller
50,Stunning,"Loved everything about this museum. Truthfully the grounds alone are worth the trip to Malibu. The parking is $10.00 per car, but admission is free. Parking is easy, you may want to call in advance or online to see if reservations are necessary, but we drove up on a weekday and it was no problem. Once out of the car, you immediately begin the experience. The outdoor vistas are incredible. The interior of the museum and the exterior of the museum flow so effortlessly in and out that it doesn't even occur to you that one moment you are looking at incredible antiquities and the next moment you are staring at a stunning mosaic fountain or a beautiful herb garden. Truly magnificent, I would highly recommend this venue for every age group. Lots of walking required, but wheel chair accessible as well. Very modern. Don't miss the Venus prayer statue or the incredible herb garden. You can also enjoy a bite to eat there if the weather is nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeanette713
50,An absolute gem of an experience!,"We love the Getty, and live close enough to go there often! Parking is the only slow down, as you need a reservation. Most days it's easy to get an online reservation that very day... excepting holidays. We love the permanent exhibits of ancient Greek and Roman art, but as good as the art is the museum. It's a replica of an ancient Roman Villa buried in the ash in Herculaneum after an eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. Perfect!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudithK19
50,Exceptional,Beautiful & Amazing. The art and architecture are beyond the imagination. The gardens are a site to behold.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FireDaddy69
50,Love this place,Great collection of Greek and Roman artifacts in an absolutely beautiful location. The grounds are spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenrG9539DU
50,Go to the Getty,Currently under renovation but if your in LA I still strongly encourage you to go the Getty. It's just beautiful and it transports you to a different world. Be sure to get the free iPod tour. Museum is free too but parking is $15 per car. Go to the Getty!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alicias655
40,An impressive ancient art collection in spectacular settings,"My kids learned about the Greek and Roman empires in school this year and therefore impressive collection at the villa had much more meaning than a usual museum visit. The location and grounds are very pretty and the parking structure is a convenient feature. The 2nd floor was closed for renovation but the ground level is composed of several rooms with dozens of amazingly preserved art from 100–500 BC. The exhibits are not extensive but this is perfect for teens because the museum wasn't overwhelming. There's a hall dedicated for some nice hands-on activities like drawing on pottery replicas, dressing up in Hellenistic consumes and posing for the camera behind a screen projection, rub-on textures and other crayons fun. The complex includes a nice cafe and a gift store. It was grand catching some afternoon sun rays in the outdoor terrace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDCA312
40,Beautiful views despite construction going on,"I have been to the Getty Center many times but I had never visited the Getty Villa. The Villa is significantly smaller than the center, however it has some spectacular views.I was a bit disappointed that when I was there, the giant reflecting pool in the main garden was empty. Also, we were told that they are doing some construction on the second floor of the museum in an effort to rearrange the way the artifacts are grouped (something about chronological vs. thematic).Currently I would say you only need about 1.5 hours to walk through the gardens and see the exhibits that are not under construction. There are several gardens, some very beautiful fountains and wonderful views of the ocean. Still worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillianChamberlain
50,Don't miss this.,The location is superb with a wonderful view of the Malibu hills and the Pacific Ocean. The ambience of the villa itself and the artworks can have one oohing and aching for hours. This is such a wonderful place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allIdoistravel
40,"Nice visit, highly recommended if you're in the area","Came here on sunday early afternoon, not to busy, nice and quiet environment and pretty interesting. Nice collections to look at, we did the special perfume making event, and it was quite interesting, if you're in this area, definitely check it out!Free entry, just pay for parking",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badwolflibrarian
50,Eye Opening,"If you love art and history, you will love the Getty Villa. The Getty Villa was owned by oil tycoon John Paul Getty and when he died he left his lavish home, together with the Getty Centre as a museum to the public. It's situated on top of the cliffs at the eastern end of Malibu where the views are striking. It's just beautiful walking around the villa and it's surrounding gardens viewing all the art work and sculptures. We spent about 2 hours roaming around before we went to the Getty Centre. We booked our free tickets on-line before we left Australia (you can't visit without pre-booked tickets). The parking costs $15, and if you head over to the Getty Centre on the same day you can use the same parking ticket for free. (you just need to get it validated in the foyer of the Getty Centre). A full and interesting day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/norma_gordon
40,Beautiful Walk Through a Roman Villa!,"It's a gorgeous setting to stroll through and view Greek & Roman sculpture. Stepping back in time, you can imagine what it was to be a wealthy family in Pompeii.The sculptures, marble, mosaics and art are simply beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dknable2017
50,goregous,This is such a good place to see. It is far enough from all the noise and crowds in LA so you can relax while look at the exhibits they have. There are also gardens where you can sit and unwind. On a sunny day it is an amazing spot to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanimirc2014
40,Beautiful grounds,"We went to the Getty Villa in March, so the gardens were not full and lush yet, but still beautiful. It was fun to walk around and view the sculptures and indoor exhibits. There is a special area for young children where they can draw, which is a nice touch. The upstairs was closed and it seems that we were there on field trip day, so it was a little crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyElizabeth67
50,Great,Really enjoyed visiting today in the morning with live actors and jugglers...parking is only $ 15 cash or credit cards...a great 1/2 visit...free online tickets...great cafe and gardens to walk through,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelshooter71
50,Fantastic Recreation,"Imagine walking the path of ancient times in a recreation of a first century Roman country house. I imagined Pompeii before the volcanic eruption. Beautiful grounds, intriguing interior rooms and sculptures. Wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathyBJax_FL
50,Unbelievably beautiful!,"Amazing what you can do with money and a vision! Uncompromising realization of a dream that was only completed after Paul Getty died, spectacular ocean and canyon setting, a life acquiring Greek, Roman and Etruscan treasures, designing and building a replica villa overwhelmed at Herculaneum by Vesuvius, attention to all the minute details, having that dream impeccably administered and operated 50 years later makes for a unique place on earth!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/northernneckinn
50,What a gem!,Went here for a tour with my daughter who recently moved to LA. We were so amazed. What a beautiful facility. The tour was wonderful. We sat on the patio after and had a glass of wine and appetizer while the sun set....we will definitely be back,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BookReader31

40,To get a taste of ancient noble life...,"The villa is located atop a bluff with a grand outlook across the Ocean, at Pacific Palisades (close to Malibu, Zuma Beach, Santa Monica). The villa whilst rich man's folly, contains an exceptional collection of authentic Greek and Roman art, is successful in providing a unique experience to sit and absorb a junction of wealth, grand visions and beauty - what a joy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CultureCoacher
50,A Spectacular Roman Villa,The Villa itself a piece of ART - this recreation of a Roman Villa lost in the volcanic eruption of Herculaneum invites visitors to go back in time. The property is gorgeous inside and out. Inside rooms display artifacts from ancient mediterranean civilizations. Outside magnificent gardens and reflecting pool welcome visitors to sit and watch the modern world go by from an ancient perspective. Tip: If you visit the Getty Centre and then go to the Getty Villa get your parking receipt stamped at the centre to enjoy parking at the villa on the same ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brodie52
40,Pleasant Way to Spend a Couple of Hours,"The Getty Villa is modeled after a Roman countryhouse and currently hosts a good collection of classical artworks, including the Landsdowne Hercules. Parking runs $15, but once parked, everything else (except for food in the cafe) is free. Guided tours of the architecture are available, and school tours are also welcome (at least three were there the morning my friend and I visited). The grounds themselves are attractive, and you can wander at your leisure without being bothered. Staff are friendly and helpful. Unfortunately the second floor of the villa is undergoing renovation, so we were not able to see any of those pieces. But overall well worth the trip to Malibu!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyA56003
20,Very Disappointed,"After seeing the great Getty museum with all of the fantastic art work we had high expectations of the Getty Villa. We must have visited out of season.After traveling extensively in Europe around Italy and Greece there was absolutely no resemblance and looked like a very cheap imitation, not what I would have expected the Getty's would have wanted.The herb garden was dried out and no aroma coming from the small amount herbs that were growing.The fountain had been drained and did detract from the overall impression of the building.After reading up on the life of Paul Getty we were really disappointed as we thought the Getty museum would express and be a true reflection of the period in history it was trying to show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimandkaz63
20,Nothing to see,"Poor exhibits in a nice building. The landscape is the nicest part of it. As a museum, well below what I would consider ""museum"". Couple of pot here and there. The garden was nice though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victorlT1647XQ
40,Nice thought Mr. Getty!!,"The place is spectacular to say the least. Having grown up in the austere 40's, 50's and 60's, it is totally refreshing to see dollars that were directed to the promotion and preservation of architectural excellence. The second floor was closed for renovation and the ocean view was obliterated by an afternoon fog so we missed a lot, but we shall be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ANOUL
50,Incredible,"This is an exact replica of a villa that was near Pompeii in Italy. You literally feel like you're in Italy, and the Villa itself is stunning. The grounds are even more beautiful. We had such an awesome time there- it was hands down our favorite thing that we did in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/233mariak
50,Trip back to ancient times,"We thoroughly enjoyed spending 6 hours at the Getty Villa last week. Even though some of the exhibits are closed for renovation there was still plenty to see. The tours are interesting for the general museum goer. My husband, who was a classics major in college, wished they went in to more detail but he still loved our visit. The setting of the art collection in a reproduction of an actual 1st century Roman country villa was very effective. We enjoyed a delicious lunch at the cafe. We stayed at a hotel near LAX airport and found Uber to be a convenient way to get to the Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FMAB78
50,ONE HUMAN-GREAT CONTRIBUTION,"Paul Getty gave back to society this wonderful museum. A person of wealth can give back - this is an bright example.A fantastic museum,small compared to to the large ones like LOUVRE in Paris or The HERMITAGE in St, Petersburg,both of which I am privileged to visit,this one speaks of the vision and determination of one person.Fantastic small collection,only two floors,mostly roman,but with a lot lot of passion.The ground is very well kept.It is free , but you have to register before visit.All transportation from gate to exit.Very well behaved staff.A lovely visit for about 3 hours.It is located at start of Malibu, at outskirts of Los Angeles. Travelling to it and return to L.A. needs a bit of research.I tried Uber while returning, but they did not bother.So I had to wait for the return bus for about 45 minutes.But it is worth all the troubles. Fantastic is the only word.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sanjaya58
40,"Beautiful art, lovely views","The Getty Villa is really cool. The art is mostly Greek and Roman and has lots of helpful information to put the art in context. I love that a lot of it is outside. There is a patio with lots of cool horticulture and a garden with lovely edible plants. It's a cool place to visit. It's also free to get in, you just have to pay for parking. You sign up for an ""entry time"" and are able to enter the villa up to one hour before your time. We had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishakelley
50,Even on a misty day this was a great tour!,Visiting the Getty Villa was like making a return trip to Pompeii! The lady giving the tour was very knowledgeable about both the Getty collection and the replica of the Italian villa it was designed after. The gardens and grounds were lovely. It was amazing that an individual could amass such a collection of artifacts. Can't wait to go back and check out the larger Getty Museum in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F108KYelizabethb
40,Elegant and Impressive,"Other reviews have mentioned the $15 charge for parking, followed by free admission, and the fact that you can't just show up - you need to schedule your visit time in advance. That said, those are just about the only rules you'll need to keep in mind as you meander the lovely grounds and the antiquities collection in the Villa itself. My big take-away: that this experience was created originally by one private citizen who, rather than hoarding the collection away from the public, wanted to share his passion for heritage and art with everyone. That's a fine example of generosity, especially in today's self-important world. We were there when several middle school groups were touring; which allowed us to linger next to the students and listen to the knowledgeable staff teach. Great afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethCentennial
50,a sin if you miss,"make a reservation in advance, get your free ticket at home and enjoy the beauty, the peace, the esplendor of an unforgettable attraction",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccristalli
50,"Wow - take your time, stroll and enjoy this place of antiquities in a restored setting","We went at 11:00 am on Monday. Few crowds, easy to park ($15 fee) and a lovely sunny day. Lots of children on field trips from elementary schools, which I loved to see them getting exposure to classical pottery, sculpture, mosaics and architecture. I liked watching the 12 minute introductory video. We did not take the guided tours and as I watched the tour groups, each guide was very knowledgeable. A small gift shop and a restaurant with a large seating area indoors and outdoors. Plan at least two hours so you can walk the gardens, gaze at the collections and breath in the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joela111
50,well worth it,"An outdoor museum beautiful! Very interesting, well worth the drive, plus it's free, just the low cost of parking,! They have an on site cafe, with delicious food, and gift shop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dran58
40,Enjoyed tour time here.,Enjoyed a leisurely stroll through the museum & gardens. Very nice & loved the symmetry. The main water pond was not filled when I was there but still enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/On_Da_Road1
50,This is one amazing place,Went there 30 years ago. Big change. The staff is top notch. Exhibits are wonderful. You don't need more then 90 minutes. The food at the cafe is good and not over priced. Glad we went,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chienee
50,Roman Villa in Southern California,"We called on a Friday for a visit the following day and were able to get an assigned time. Parking is $15 in a very spacious parking lot under the Villa; entrance is free. We watched a 12 minute movie about the Villa and its history--a must. We then took a 1 hour ""Architectural tour"" that was very worthwhile. Afterwards we visited a few of the galleries and also toured their garden. What was very impressive was how well maintained the Getty Villa is. Their gift shop was very nice. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarmerRK
50,Great Tour,"I've been here several times before and I loved my visit each time. It's changed since 30 years ago, but it's timeless and classic. A must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orchidrosem2015
40,Interesting,Interesting reproduction of a Roman Villa displaying many of the ancient artifacts collected by J Paul Getty.It was of interest but I would not rate it a must see unless you are a real student of antiquities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lawrenceb133
50,Superlatives Aren't Enough!,"After having visited several art museums in southern California, we went to the Getty Villa on a weekday. You have to call ahead to get a reservation for a time to visit; parking is $15.00 (you can use your parking ticket from the The Getty in LA if you visit both on the same day). There is no way to describe the beauty of the villa: both the collections and the architecture are breathtaking. Designed to look like an ancient Roman villa, the grounds and building showcase Roman, Greek and Etruscan art. Each small gallery contains treasures from antiquity; the descriptions are well-written. The upstairs gallery when we went had an exhibit of Roman mosaics - unusual and beautiful. The gardens and reflecting pools are highlighted with statuary and lovely walkways. Truly a feast for the senses!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/952lindag
50,Fabulous collection,"This was our 2nd visit to the Getty Villa & Center – our last visit was a number of years ago & we wanted a refresher of the Villa after having visited Herculaneum a few times. This incredible faux villa (a reproduction based on Herculaneum’s Villa dei Papiri) houses J Paul Getty’s fabulous collection of Mediterranean antiquities.There is much to see – displayed artifacts (dated between 6,500 BC and 500 AD) are organized in theme rooms (if this is your 1st visit, I recommend starting in room 113 (maps of Mediterranean civilizations with art each created). Among our personal favorites are the Etruscan collection & the 2,500 y/o statue of Aphrodite.Admission is free via required timed booking (you can book online at the official website) and the parking fee was $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denver60
50,Well Worth a Visit to See Getty's Collection of Antiquities,"We visited Getty Villa on a rainy Saturday, the fifth visit in the last year. It is truly a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours in a magical location. The Villa is magnificent in and of itself, and the placement of the antiquities within the Villa is very special. The Getty Center in the Sepulveda pass (off of 405 freeway) has all the other Getty art and furniture. You need to make a ""free"" on line reservation for each member of your group, and these reservations are timed. We find that arriving at 10:30 am is better than 10:00 am, when the villa opens to the public for the day. This avoids the larger groups who arrive ""first thing in the day"". Parking is 15.00, and they are VERY strict about checking your reservation tickets for admission. The neighbors do not want tourists and locals spending time in THEIR neighborhood, so the number of visitors is timed and parking is located on site. You cannot arrive by uber, taxi or lift unless you have a free reservation to enter. We enjoy taking a 45 min to 1 hour tour, offered again for free, by Getty. Look on line at what tours are offered. There are multiple options depending on your interest. Also, I strongly suggest that you catch the seven minute movie which runs continuously when you arrive. It gives you the facts and history about the Villa. While the food in the cafeteria is good (and expensive), we prefer to time things so we go to lunch or dinner at either Moonshadows or Duke's, ocean front in Malibu, after our two hour visit to the Villa and a short ten minute drive up PCH. You could also head to the Getty Center after lunch, and not pay for parking, as long as you show your receipt from the Getty Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdbgoldfamily
50,One of the best getaway experiences in L.A. without leaving the city,"You would have the regular museum experience admiring an amazing collection of Greek and Roman art, but also you could have a picnic in one of the most beautiful public gardens in Los Angeles. They have various gardens with fountains and the type of plant from the Roman era. It feels like if you were in a time travel machine, relaxing in a Roman Villa with grapes covering from the sun and contemplating the Pacific ocean. Best part; entrance is free you only have to pay 15 dollars parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdrianaJoh14
40,Relaxing Sunday afternoon,"The Getty Villa has gorgeous grounds overlooking the ocean. Driving there is a bit of a hike but once you get in, it's easy and relaxing. There is no cost to get in, though they prefer you've printed out a ticket, and parking costs $15.The museum itself includes beautiful Greek and Roman art as well as statuary, murals, fountains and a botanical garden around the outdoor areas.There is also a small cafe to grab some food and water while walking around. It's nice for a quick visit on an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allisong339
50,Stunning,This is one of my favorite places in Southern California. The views alone are worth the trip. The museum isn't huge but it is filled with fabulous art and artifacts. They are currently working on a part of the museum but it is still a great place to visit.Admission is free- you can't beat that! Reserve parking ahead of time and enjoy! Best to be seen on a lovely day as you will enjoy it all the more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobynY_12
50,A FULL day!,"We arrived at opening and we were the last people out with security guards closing ranks behind us. Amazing Etruscan art, architecture, and gardens with a really lovely restaurant and gift shop (museum gift shops ALWAYS rock). We indulged in two tours (free) that were totally fascinating. Do not plan on less than a full day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oohl
50,A Wonderful Walk Through Greek & Roman Histroy,"I will start by saying how incredibly beautiful and well maintained the grounds, structures, buildings, and contents of the Getty Villa are. I have been to many museums around the world, the Getty Villa is among the absolute best and most beautiful.Your experience begins the minute you enter the lower driveway onto the property where the lush plant life greets you as drive through the gate. Once you have parked you step onto well maintained grounds and begin to see the magnificent beauty that surrounds you. The staff at the Villa is polite, professional, and very well educated on both the grounds and the art content in the museum itself. The Docents are amazing; their depth and scope of knowledge regarding the overall history of the period, the individual artists, the political climate, and general economic issues of the time is comprehensive and colorful.The Villa is truly one of most valuable and beautiful national treasures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinsF237EC
50,Spectabulous!,"The Getty Villa is a must-do. We loved our time there. The museum is a museum both inside and out. The buildings and the grounds are museum pieces in and of themselves. Inside the museum is a fantastic collection of ancient art, mosaics, pottery, etc. We took a 50-minute walking tour of the mosaics that was very interesting. The Getty Villa exudes quality, and you will leave with a richer understanding and appreciation for antiquity and Roman times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brettmI2598CL
50,Unlike any place you've ever been,"The Getty Villa is a must see if you enjoy, well, let's see: art, architecture, culture, history, relaxation, learning, food... It's just a completely unique experience that allows you to do as much or as little as you'd like, in one of the most unique settings in the world. And don't miss the bookstore, full of wonderful, unique items that are sure to please.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ponydoc1
40,Amazing space above Malibu - And free!,What a lovely space to have available in LA. Like a little Oasis.You are literally welcomed into 50BC by the charming guys who work there.Beautiful space with a really great audio free guide to help guide you around the space . The gardens were the most special place for me.A must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAH3653
50,Amazing Experience!,The Getty Villa is not just a museum of art but a place one can walk around and enjoy the beautiful landscape. Our visit was very relaxing since it wasn't too crowded and the placement of the sculptures and artifacts in the museum made it very easy to see everything without feeling like we were in a museum at all. Highly recommend visiting this museum at least once in your life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianausa
50,"The Opulent Villa Overwhelms, and the Art is Exceptional","As I walked these grounds and through the galleries of the villa, I couldn't help but imagine J.P. Getty doing the same. Shame that he never lived to see it open. Such immense wealth, and so much attention to leaving a legacy that would make others do as I did...take it all in, marvel at his vision, and express gratitude for creating such a marvel to make the living never forget him. As for the art, it is an intriguing and remarkable collection, and the interpretation is first-rate. A day well-spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/381LarryM
50,Beautful,"An outstanding collection of Stone Age, Greek and Roman art and antiquities in an extraordinary setting. The gardens alone could stand alone as their own attraction, but add the art and this becomes a one-of-a-kind museum. Be sure to watch the short video on the earthquake proofing technology the museum invented.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artholt494
40,A Wonderful Place to Visit,"Getty Villa is a wonderful place to visit. Unfortunately on the day of our visit it rained and rained and rained. Despite the rain we enjoyed the Villa and plan to visit again next time we are in LA. The art and Architecture were wonderful. From the floors to the ceilings and the sculpture and artwork in between. The Villa is a gem. The sculpture was inspiring. However I did miss not being able to get great views of the Architecture, Gardens and the surrounding geography. Oh, I almost forgot we all enjoyed lunch in the Café at the Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A6847QPmarcs
50,Grand,"The original Getty. Beautiful restoration of one of America's finest museums. Easy access but you need to call to reserve parking. Right on famous PCH, perfect for any half-day trip. Or, linger for the day among the beautiful gardens and well considered art choices inside the villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BadBlake
50,Better than the Getty Museum,"Step inside the unique, personal collection of JP Getty housed in his private museum built for all his amazing treasures. It's built as a private Villa from Italy to showcase all the beautiful items but also to show how the wealthy lived and entertained in that period.Take the tours (free) to listen to the inside scoop from the docents.This was the private residence of the richest man who bought 64 acres of ocean view in Malibu and expanded it into a museum to share his collection with the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomPolitowski
40,Great way to spend 1/2 a day!,"Parking is $15, visiting is free - be sure to make parking reservation ahead of visit so you're not disappointed. They do have some exhibit closures at this time, but it didn't really affect our visit. The main pool outside has signs that it's ""undergoing maintenance"" at this time, but that's really not true....there's a drought so they're not filling it and got tired of complaints that it wasn't filled. It's been empty for at least a year now....oh well.Nice exhibits and the location (Malibu) is fantastic! We combined our visit with lunch at ""Malibu Seafood"" (about 13 miles west on PCH) as that makes a perfect end to the day. :)Cheers! :D",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AvidTraveler507
50,A must see for fans of Roman life,"If you enjoy classical history and roman architecture, this is a must see location. My wife and I had visited Pompeii and Herculaneum, so it was especially interesting to see the fully ""restored"" view of the preserved ruins we had so recently seen. And I have to say that I found their recreation to be spot on based on what we saw in Italy.I will also highly recommend taking the free architectural tour they offer.Please note that you must get tickets ahead of time. They are free to get, but there are limited entries for any given time and day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianT787
40,"lots of historical artifacts, mainly Greek","this is a very nice museum good for a one day visit. not a lot of regular art work, but a lot of antiquities",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ferdferd
50,Amazing Place but come by Car!,"The Getty Villa differs from the Getty Centre in that it is a collection of items from antiquity, mainly Etruscan, Greek and Roman objects. If you are interested in the ancient world, this is definitely the place to come as the entire museum is a reimagining of the Villa de Papyri from Herculaneum, buried in the eruption of Mt Vesuvius in 79 CE. The collection has been set out within the Villa and within the gardens which are extremely beautiful and extend around the outside to the front and out one side. There is also a small traditional Greek theatre which stands above the main entrance doors.Entrance is free, but it is necessary to book a timed parking ticket (which is also free) to ensure that space is available to park when you visit. Accessing the Villa can be difficult as it can only be entered turning right from the Pacific Coast Highway from Santa Monica towards Malibu. This means that it can be difficult getting a ride from Uber, as it appears that the drivers can be sent to the rear entrance, which is not accessible to the public. In addition, cellphone service at the Villa is terrible unless you are on a specific carrier. Trying to call a taxi can therefore be problematic. There are pay phones available near the Visitor Drop Off Point, but it can take 30 minutes or so for a taxi to arrive.Transport issues aside, the Getty Villa is an oasis of calm and tranquility (except when the local parrots are having an argument) with animals, such as deer, roaming wild around the outskirts of the property. In 2017 the Villa is undergoing renovation with some galleries closed, but is still well worth the visit to get a glimpse of a spectacular collection in an amazing setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MareeC164
50,Serine Surroundings,"We visited the Getty Villa early in the morning. It's a lovely place to go, the gardens are spectacular, while there are some amazing sculptures and paintings.You have to pre-purchase tickets(they're free), however we got there at around 10am and it was quiet so we got to enter.There is a lovely gift shop, filled with well made presents for those back home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrincessStephanie01
40,Worth the trip,"The Villa has a great deal to recommend it, many wonderful examples of the art of antiquity. The ""Getty Boy"" himself is worth the trip. However, it is, in my experience of many vistis, a somewhat off putting museum. Not a place for relaxed meditation. But I do keep going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnN121
40,A great place to spend a sunny day on the coast,"You only pay to park at the Getty Villa. So park on the street if you can find a place and want to save some money. The Villa itself is lovely and worth the trip. I took many wonderful pictures of the grounds and the views. The exhibits are interesting, but not particularly noteworthy. On the second floor the exhibits change and I saw an interesting display of ancient blown glass and mosaics on the day I visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/632carltonh
50,"Put this on your ""To Do"" list",We spent a morning here. Lots to see and read up on Greek and Roman cultures and history of Paul Getty. And how he put his collection together. You need to apply on-line for Entry passes. The tickets are free but parking is $15 / vehicle. It appears that they limit the entry in 30 minute increments to monitor and control the traffic comming in off the PCH. Without this it would be a zoo I'm sure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesUKUSA69
50,Should see,"Although not as good as it used to be after repatriating many statutes back to Italy, the villa is still well worth seeing. It is a replica of a villa in Heraculeum (north side of Vesuvius) and has many beautiful marble mosaic floors, ancient coins, glass, and pottery. If you like antiquities this is THE place in the US to see. Requires reservation for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6094HFjank
40,3D art,This museum is definitely worth a couple of hours. Take a tour to better understand the architecture and the grounds. Everything has a reason for being there. The art collection is interesting and not overwhelming.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drjas1958
50,Fascinating place in just the right size,"Very well done, but not so huge that you're exhausted by the end. Perfect for a couple of hours. Fascinating collection - top notch in a truly lovely setting. Our whole family enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yahoosuz
40,Great for archaeology fans,"This museum is excellent for people interested in Mediterranean archaeology. Displays of Greek and Roman artifacts and the background and history of the pieces are excellent. I enjoyed all of it. I do recommend the advance time ticket for busier times. Parking fees apply, but the museum is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Eagles
50,Definitely a must see for locals and tourists alike,"A great way to spend a day, especially if you have friends or relatives visiting from out of town. Great cafe, too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
50,Reproduction ancient Roman villa and classical art collection,"I had no idea what to expect on visiting the villa, and I was honestly quite impressed. The villa is a painstaking reproduction of an ancient Roman villa, down to the exact measurements and orientation on the land, and the kinds of plants in the landscape. The villa offers multiple docent tours per day, which are very informative. The cafe on the grounds offers a perfectly serviceable lunch. The permanent collection contains many wonderful examples of classical Greek and Roman art, and there are visiting exhibits as well. At the time of our visit, the temporary exhibit was Roman mosaics. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaSPDX
50,Great Visit,We booked our visit in advance and had a smooth visit. Our kids enjoyed walking through the gardens and touring the museum. The views of the Malibu coast our beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sapoypato
50,Greek and Roman Art,If you like the ancients you will love this place. It is a replica of a Roman Villa. I can spend all day there. The museum is being worked on at the time I went. I would go back again and again. I love this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferjS3881WJ

50,"The ""Other"" Getty Museum","Beautiful property, with wonderful gardens. The whole theme is ancient Rome. This was Getty's ""Ranch"" but he never lived here, but stored art. He loved Roman antiquities.There are rooms of ancient mosaics. We took the culinary tour of the gardens that included foods eaten by ancient Romans. Also included some history, and art. Take one of the several short (free) walking tours to get the most out of your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manders2016
40,Getty Villa,"The Getty Villa is different and in a separate area from the Getty Museum. I like the museum better than the villa. The villa has pottery and antiquites, not exactly my kind of interest. But did have some interesting stuff. Very nice facility. Great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saminkc
50,One of my favorite places to visit in LA,"Museum is free. Parking is $15 which you must purchase in advance as they only let so many cars in at one time. You can easily do this online. This controls the crowds and makes a very pleasant visit. If you love antiquities, sculptures and architecture this is a must see. The vie of the Pacific is extraordinary. There are gorgeous outdoor areas, planet of places to sit and enjoy the view and a little cafe for food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAHarleygal
50,Beautiful place!,"This is a beautiful museum of antiquities from the John P Getty art collection. The architecture of the buildings are unique and beautiful. The art work is of the quality that you would only find in a vey upscale gallery. There is also a magnificent herb and flower garden of ancient plants. You can purchase seeds, plants and bulbs of many of the plants in the gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gadgetier
40,Interesting Roman history and a beautiful spot,"The Getty Villa is modeled after a first-century Roman country house, the Villa dei Papiri in Herculaneum, Italy. The detail is amazing and the views are incredible. The attraction is free but you have to pay for parking and have a reservation for parking in advance. Get here early - when it first opens and come on a nice sunny day. The views are amazing. The gardens and architecture are beautiful and you can spend hours looking at ancient artifacts from the Roman and other eras if you are inclined.They also have free narrated tours. We did the Garden tour. You need to line up for a tour at least 30 min ahead of time in a crowded day as they limit the number of people on the tours. The tours are about 90 minutes and very interesting. If you have some time afterwards, the guides are happy to answer questions. For example, there is a lilly pad fountain and the wall behind it represents the various layers of the earth. That was explained by the guide when asking about the fountain.It's a fun thing to do in a very expensive area that won't break the bank. $15 per car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clubnev
30,Beautiful Grounds But A Bit Basic For The Location,"A gorgeous landscape with gorgeous sculptures & installations throughout. But I felt, for a museum on the beach, more importance should've been placed with views of the ocean so you can feel the way it blends with the art. The only notable view is from the steeple patio & while we were here, the main reflecting pool happened to be drained so we didn't get the full experience.TIP: So best to plan a visit during the summer or spring months to ensure the pools are running.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deka8990
50,Amazing!,This is a really great way to spend the morning. It is an incredible slice of the Roman world in CA! I'd go first thing if possible so you can beat the crowds. Also a coffee on the terrace is always fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JakeF596
40,One of the Best Spots in Malibu,This museum houses the Getty antiquities collection. Fascinating pieces include mummies and huge mosaics from ancient palaces. Well kept and surrounded by beautiful grounds overlooking the Pacific. Their café is excellent. We shared a charcuterie and a cheese board with a glass of wine. Well done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/346billf
40,Spend a half-day in the Roman world,"This is an exciting venue where J. Paul Getty attempted (with some pretty impressive results) to recreate the Roman estate, the villa de Papiri, which was buried in the explosion of Mt Vesuvius in 79 AD. Thank you for making this a free museum (be it noted, with $15 parking fee; but no complaints from us). We had been to Pompeii twice and viewed some of the villas and streets in that city, but if you can't get to Italy this weekend (and who can --), this is the next best thing. In the film describing the recreation of the site, the architect admitted that when Getty approached him with his idea, he had never heard of the Villa de Papiri. However that may be, the construction team paid good attention to detail all the way down to the driveway (note the uneven gray flagstones of the road, typical of the Romans in that era), to the Greek-style lunettes in the ceiling, to the herbs in the garden (similar to what the Romans would have grown). One might not expect that a private collector would have enough items to fill up this building, but Getty did it without breaking a sweat. Do not miss the introductory film as you enter the main compound. The Landsdowne Hercules of course is the centerpiece of the whole venue, but also good are ""gods and goddesses"" (104), ""women and children in antiquity"" (check out the women's hairstyles) (207), arts of Greco-Roman Egypt (206 -- look at the funerary masks), and ""coins gems and jewelry"" (212).You can easily do a half-day here. Enjoy!Check out too the sarcophagus with the scenes from the life of Achilles (110) -- wow...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kenpasha
50,Magnificient!,"Very nice property and museum, very interesting. Free except parking ($15). Must go! Kids enjoyed it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T8875XUpierrea
50,Perfect for Kids,"We took 2 young children to see the museum. Before hand, we read them myths and a little history and then they were able to relate to something in every room. The food in the cafe was good, even for the picky eaters. Each exhibit room is small so the kids didn't get bored. They liked the gardens too. Obviously the museum is great for adults too! The education areas with books and short movies are helpful for adults and kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LNLew
40,Retreat nestled in hills of Malibu,"The Getty Villa is an interesting little gem, nestled on a hillside in Malibu.The Villa itself was inspired by the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum with additional details from several other ancient sites. There is some Trompe-l'œil's representing architectural details of Greek/Roman times. I found the Roman mosaics the most fascinating and the greek vases. Although there is no entrance fee, apparently you must make reservations on-line ahead of time or pick up tickets at the Getty Museum (which is 15 miles away). Luckily we were at the Getty Museum the day before and one of the docents noted our interest and informed us about the ticketing requirement and provided us with tickets. There are docent tours, pretty regularly. Of course the Getty Museum is the more magnificent place to go for European Art and Architecture, if you have to choose.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janetmreynolds
50,Free museum,My family and I went to this architectural wonder. It was really entertaining. We went on the architectural tour and were informed about the magnificent building. The tour guide was really nice too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jason_and_Tania
50,A gem!,"We went back for a second visit during our 10-day vacation. Beautiful, tranquil villa. Very knowledgeable guides. Lots to look at. Spend an afternoon there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidDavidDavid
50,A must-see museum,"I have been to this museum a number of times. Every experience has been great -- the buildings, the artifacts, the gardens, the setting, the concept, the concert venue. The guided tours are a must. The cafe is very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorne29
50,Getty villa and Christmas Day.,"Getty villa was open on Christmas Day so my wife and I decided to pay a visit to this place. And what an experience this was. We took a guide (she was extraordinary - she happened to be a top notch professional) - she was able to bring life to whatever she choose to show us. I recall her description of one of the roman mosaics...I was impressed by the Greek and roman sculptures, the reflective pool, the forum ... and of course the view from the villa. I know I will remember this visit. I recommend a visit to this beautiful place. You will need at least 3 hours once you arrive. Parking ($15) was the only expense.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henryl727
20,"Closed, rude guard","We pulled up to the museum entrance, only to be waved down by a guard. I figured he wanted us to pay for the tickets there, so I waved down my window. He then harked “turn around,” and we thought he was “helping” us park but he was yelling at us to get out of the lot. I asked for directions to the museum entrance, and he said we couldn’t go. After prying for information, we found out we couldn’t visit without reservations (but he hadn’t explained this simple fact). Very disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoSeeGlutenFree
50,Stunning villa with incredible ancient art collection,"One visit is probably not enough to take in all there is to see here. The architecture, tile floors and walls, murals, reflecting pond, gardens are impressive enough, but all the extensive collection of ancient Roman and Greek art and artifacts and you have a terrific, enjoyable, educational afternoon. Magnificent ocean view add to the ambiance and the introductory (optional) video is well worth the 12 or so minutes to learn about why and how J. Paul Getty built the mansion. There is an amphitheater reminiscent of ancient coliseums but I'm not sure what sort of events happen there. There is a minimal parking fee but otherwise, no cost to go here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EileenL171
40,nice collection of ancient greek and romain sculptures and artefacts,Having in mind that this collection is one of a private collector and one of the richest families at the time in the US makes it even more impressive. Together with the getty center the Getty Family has created something truely magnificent that will teach people about past cultures and will last for a long time. Having seen the real places in europe for a european the collection is nothing special but having history in mind it is grand and worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imErnst_
20,It's Free For A Reason,"We were excited to visit the Getty Villa especially after visiting the art museum. We thought the Villa was where Getty lived and how cool to check out the rooms much like the Hearst Castle.Alas Getty never even stepped foot at the Getty Villa and just about everything is a replica of the original work done in Italy. There is no villa, just some corridors, herb gardens and a gift shop. $15 parking and free admission. We took the 40-minute guided architectural tour and was perhaps the worst 40 minutes spent at an attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LGspartan
30,Good for ppl who is interested in art and painting,Good to visit in spring time. They have a beautiful garden and the beach view from the garden is beautiful... They don't have much of art works here when compared with Getty center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/997priyak
50,Do not miss this museum experience!,We recently visited the Getty Villa museum and it was an amazing experience. My husband grew up in this area but had never visited the Getty. I can not believe this is a free museum. The exhibits are beautifully displayed and the grounds are breathtaking. There were a lot of families visiting and all ages seemed to enjoy it. Parking was $15.00 and easily located on the grounds. What an amazing gift to the state of California and to out of state visitors!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzeeski
50,a great place to visit,We are into the history of the Pompeii area and that area in Italy. We have seen several museums with items from there. This was a pleasant surprise. It is a reproduction of a villa from Pompeii. When you have endless amounts of money you can do a good job. The antiques are awesome and easy to view. I highly recommend this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveSilverman
50,"OK, Wow","There is nothing not great about this museum. It's a museum of antiquities and I, for one, am grateful that Mr. Getty was kind enough to decide to share his amazing collections with the world, for free (except for parking - that's $15). We started with the introduction video then we did the self-guided audio-tour, which was well done and very informative. We spent about 2 hours wandering around the exhibits and learning a little about the antiquities on display. I certainly had a wonderfully educational time. We went on a Saturday in the late morning during December and the place wasn't at all crowded, so we didn't have annoying tourists trampling us. Definitely worth the visit. Plan to spend at least 3 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristineB7
40,Great Free Activity to Spend an Hour or Two,Went in the afternoon on a Friday and didn't know tickets were needed beforehand. Thankfully we were allowed to enter the property. So I guess that is something to do before going if you are adding this to your list of to-dos in Malibu. The collection is quite extensive especially since I had no expectations for the place. The grounds are just spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KylaE_12
40,Catch a show in Out Door Theater,"While we could not make the visit in day time to this sister museum of the more visited Getty Villa, we did make it for a show in outdoor amphitheater. The drive to the location even at night is quite good. The multistory parking lots are sufficiently huge to cater to the theater crowd.We watched Haunted house party- a modern take on Roman comedy which was very good. More than that it is the buzz and atmosphere at the Outdoor theater that really captivated us. The crowd was well behaved, refined and having a nice time without making too much of a noise to disturb the neighbors as requested by the performers.All together a pleasant experience- do make it if you find some interesting show going on at the Getty Villa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UNNIMAYA
50,A visit I will carry with me a long time,"One late afternoon a few hours before closing bestows well-being.The environment is captivating, art of sublime quality. Works of art from all three ancient civilizations including statues, mosaics, pottery, glass work, and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,Step back into time!,Phyllis was our guide for the architecture tour and she explained some of the amazing history of the villa. Don't miss the mosaics!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyB_Htown
50,Greco-Roman museum in Malibu,"Modeled after a Pompeian villa and housing an impressive collection of ancient sculptures and artifacts, the Getty Villa is well worth the visit.They have some strange requirements for parking, which seem to be designed to prevent parking issues in the surround area, or perhaps to guarantee some revenue. Parking is $15 and you have to park onsite. If you take a bus to the location, then you need some sort of stamp from the bus driver.Once you're there, the entire property is beautiful. The grounds are well maintained and have plants which are native to Italy. The museum will keep you occupied for at least an hour. I've read that the cafe onsite is quite good, but we didn't eat there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U4404CXchrist
50,"If you are in LA, visiting the Getty villa is a must","If you are in LA, visiting the Getty villa is great idea. It's beautiful, architectural and informative. The drive to Malibu and dinning at nobo along with the villa visit is a perfect day spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Purvakewlani
50,Reserve tickets in advance and take the architectural tour,"The Villa requires advance reservations but we lucked out and got in without any because of some cancellations. I wouldn't recommend counting on that. I would recommend the architectural tours, especially for those like me who are not that interested in extensive collections of antiquities. The tour highlights how Getty modeled the building after a villa in Pompeii and you learn both about Getty's interest in antiquities and how a Roman villa once functioned. Very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahsF2082UF
50,Fun trip to a reconstructed Roman villa,It's fun just to walk around the villa and experience the architecture and grounds. The villa also contains some nice exhibits. We particularly enjoyed the exhibit of ancient glass.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamB440
50,Thankful to J. Paul Getty,"After seeing the short movie and walking through the first few exhibits I really appreciated that J. Paul Getty shared his love for antiquities with the world. Normally one would have to travel to Europe or a stuffy museum to see anything like this. It was so nice to enjoy the gardens and see the antiquities in a seamless, relaxed manner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelc850
50,Very nice place,"It is a very nice place, the architecture is astonishing together with museum. A lot of Greek , Romain arts . Suggested",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabioborsoi
50,"Wonderful, A MUST SEE","Beautiful Villa, really worth visiting. We did one of the free guided tours which was very interesting. Would definitely recommend a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterbM8452HS
40,Beautiful museum for Roman antiquities,"I'm not a fan of ancient artifacts. So going to a museum with Roman antiquities would probably be last on my list. I'm more of a modern art type of guy. But I'm always game for interesting architecture. And I must say, the Getty Villa is one of the best looking museums I've seen. The designers ditched the shoebox layout and recreated Villa de Papiri, a first century country house in Herculaneum, Italy. And the result is gorgeous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmmedel
50,A must!!,"This place succeeds on many levels. First, it's free except for parking! How great is that? Then it's wonderfully run with great tours and organization. Thirdly, it's a phenomenal structure giving you the best understanding you will ever get of what a Roman villa looked like. Lastly, there are the amazing art works from Getty's collection. This place is world class.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scott8147
50,A Must-Do in Malibu!,"What a gem this place is. Not any old museum with mostly Greek and Roman antiquities. Lovely gardens, mini amphitheatre; patio restaurant; book & treasure shop; ocean views and an historic villa. Great place to spend a few hours just to take in the ambiance. There's no entry fee, unless you are parking on site and it is worth it, though we still see folks enjoying the walk up the hill on a pretty day. Check the website for events, outdoor concerts, author talks, etc... Plan your day, you will not want to run through here in an hour - its just too beautiful to rush. A great treat for mothers day, birthday, book club, luncheon date - always a hit with my out-of-towners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorandtheMrs
50,"Reproduction of Pompeii Architecture, gardens, art","The villa is a gem if you're interested in Roman villas, sculptures and gardens. Admission tickets may be available at the entrance, but don't take any chances. Making an online reservation is highly recommended (admission is free). On-site parking costs $15 per car.The villa is a reproduction of Villa dei Papiri in Pompeii before being buried by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Free guided tours of the grounds are available throughout the day.Fountains, sculptures, architecture and gardens are a photographers' paradise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alec1949
50,"If you like museums, you'll love this one.","My husband and I spent an afternoon at the Getty Villa, wandering it's beautiful gardens, marveling at it's open structure and enjoying the view of the ocean.Admission is free, however you need to make sure you reserve tickets online, prior to your visit. Parking is, I think, $15. Also, check the website to verify business hours, as currently, it is closed on Tuesdays, but open the rest of the week.The antiquities are creatively housed in a replica of an ancient Roman Villa, so you not only get to see the statues, mosaics and other antiquities, but you also get a glimpse into how an aristocratic Roman may have lived. My favorite part was wandering around the gardens. It was peaceful and relaxing, and just beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allysonw963
50,An Amazing Gem of Ancient Art and Architecture,Our friends live nearby so had a pass. You must make reservations otherwise and can not walk directly to the entrance. So a wait for a shuttle to and from. But so beautiful and we enjoyed all of it. We also had lunch at the cafe and that too was quite good. A pleasant way to spend a hot late morning and early afternoon immersed in so interesting history and Getty wealth. Quite a spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackiebr63
40,Fabulous1,"We spent a fabulous 4 or 5 hours at the Villa, strolling the buildings and gardens and immersing ourselves in the well created atmosphere of a distant time in history. We took advantage of 2 of the free guided tours, one took in a sample of the collection, and the other a tour of the spectacular gardens. Both guides were informative and entertaining and really brought the place to life. Overall it was well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NauticalDreamer3010
50,TRAVEL BACK TO 79 AD ROMAN COUNTRY VILLA REPRODUCTION,"You usually need to go online and get reserved admission tickets (free) and then pay for parking when you arrive. We had some time in the area a decided to stop in only to find that there were admission tickets readily available for us to get and then to proceed on to park ($15/car/day). I wouldn't recommend just driving in without reservations during the tourist season or on weekends. Anyway, the Villa is just beautiful and is the exact replica of the Villa dei Papiri as it was prior to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. This self supporting facility (via Getty Foundation) contains art/sculpture/jewelry/coin collections of the periods prior to 400 A.D., so think ""old, real old"" stuff. There are tours/events that change daily that are all free for visitors. A nice cafe and patio are in an adjacent building to the Villa. We enjoyed the garden tour learning what fruits, vegetables, herbs, medicinals were grown and how they were used. There are programs for children as well. Most of the crowd were either older types and school children on tour. Close to the ocean the temperatures were comfortable and with the gardens full of olive trees and pomegranates it seemed like a true Italian countryside. Well worth the visit... bring your camera! They even have umbrellas used for both rainy days and for hot, sunny days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B5026OSjohng
40,Stunning Mediterranean experience,"The whole place is really beautiful. Access is great and everything is very well taken care of.My recommendation is spend time in the gardens! they are fabulous.

It's open for visits but we didn't have time on our schedule so took a right up the street just past the entrance and if you bear left and then do a 'U' you'll end up looking across and down on the Villa. It's a quiet street so you can park up for a few mins to take some pics/video against with the Ocean as a backdrop!If you found this helpful, please comment. Thanks",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pontefract
50,Unique and Beautiful,"The Getty Villa was one of the only major galleries open on a Monday so we took the drive out to Malibu and was so glad we did.

50,A great place to learn about Greco-Roman culture!,"Admittedly this museum is not for everyone. It exhibits an extensive collection of ancient objects related to the Greek and Roman history and culture. Obviously there are lots of museums in Greece and Italy that have more objects to show, but in the Western US, it is simply a unique outstanding, specialized collection. This museum provides an opportunity to expose middle- and high school students to the basis of Western Civilization.On the other hand this is not a place to visit with small children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincent-dirks
50,Amazing collection and fabulous gardens,The villa is a must even if you aren't a big museum person. It is a reproduction of a Greek villa featuring a wonderful collection of antiquities. GETTY did everyone a big favor by sharing his wealth with generations to come via this spectacular attraction with views the Pacific. It's a great cultural and educational experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/820MarkT
50,KW Cultural,"This is a must if your are in the area. The villa is amazing and the artifacts stunning. You can also go around with a guide. at the end of your tour visit the cafe/restaurant, excellent quality. we really enjoyed it.You have to book on-line and it is free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kwaterton
50,Pictures don't do it justice,"You have to reserve tickets beforehand, they do this to keep the volume of people down. It's free to get in, but you do pay parking. We took our 10 year old, she really got into it. She's been an art lover for as long as she could hold a crayon, and when I told her if she wants to be an art major in college, she'll be learning about the things we saw, she lit up and said that's what she wants to do. I've never seen a child stare at the statues and architecture like she did, it's a beautiful place. I'd share pictures, but they honestly don't do the place any justice.

You'll learn all about Getty and his art collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OurEdventures
40,Gorgeous place!,You really need all day to see everything. I was so tired after a few hours though..we did sit and have a cafe mocha...they really need more food options and better prices and seating is difficult to find and when you do..you have to clean it yourself it seemed. A lot of steps. My fave was the pool areas. Gorgeous views and photo ops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lgwuk7
50,World Class Opulence,"Drive up the gorgeous Pacific Coast Highway to a gorgeous museum. The Getty Villa was modeled after a villa in ancient Herculaneum and is big and luxurious. It houses a large collection of ancient Greek, Roman and some Turkish art. The place is just as fantastic as the artwork. I recommend going early in the morning when they open, before the crowds. There is a coffee kiosk on a terrace, and you can take your snack away and sit in the garden peacefully. Tickets are free and in advance on the website, parking is $15 and can be used for Getty Center the same day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/171maryjaned
50,Very cool museum,Spent a day in the Malibu area and decided to go here. We were not disappointed. Absolutely beautiful grounds. Getty did some job putting this place together.

40,A Pleasant Way To Spend A Day,"The Getty Villa museum, which holds literally thousands of Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities, some of which date back thousands of years, is enormous. I was not expecting a structure, built by Getty to house his art collection, to be so large. The gardens are also worth exploring, though they will be far more beautiful if visited during a non-drought year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelhK707KC

50,Antique in Los Angeles,"If you're into Roman and Greek history, this is certainly worth a stop. Although it is an interpretation, it is still worth a visit to get a feel what a roman villa could have looked like. A nice mix of gardens and exhibition areas creates a relaxed environment. Some of the exhibits are certainly worth a trip to the museum when in LA. The way the various rooms are themed work very well. The mosaic exhibition is excellent. Café adjacent to the villa serves decent enough food. They are typical USA dishes but of good quality. Note you need a booking BEFORE you arrive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/63GeertD
50,"If you came to visit Los Angeles and missed the Getty Villa, you had not seen Los Angeles...","I selected a great October day to visit the Getty Villa. It was warm with clear blue sky. I came down Topanga Canyon onto the stunning Pacific coast Highway where the villa is located. After making a U-turn on Sunset Boulevard, I drove right by the tiny entrance. Somehow I thought such a grand place would have a gated entrance larger than a regular Beverly Hills driveway.After the security inspected my ticket ( you have to get them online before the visit,) I proceeded up a cobblestone drive way to the garage ($15.00.) The short walk to the villa from the garage was dotted with olive and strawberry trees indigenous to the Mediterranean along mixed in with an ample array of amount of rose bushes.The Getty Villa has been extensively reviewed and my visit merely reaffirmed how lovely this recreation of the first-century Roman Villa dei Papiri is. It is well run, lovingly cared for and the artifacts, spectacular. For a relatively uninformed museum goer like myself, the Getty Villa felt intimate, cozy compared to the massive Metropolitan Museum in New York or the British Museum in London where one gets overwhelmed. It is perfectly sized for an unhurried, room to room visit. I had time to pause at every interesting display and never felt I had to move on or I would miss the next set of exhibits.I am obliged to write about the Cafe where I enjoyed a generous size $14.95 burger which was perfectly grilled to order and smothered with caramelized onion and blue cheese served on a homemade bun. It was complemented by a healthy helping of ballpark quality garlic fries to boot.So if the incredibly lovely setting and great exhibits aren't enough to compel you to make trek to the Getty Villa, may be the burger and garlic fries would...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965keitht

From the time I reserved my parking and bought tickets to waiting for short periods for tours and films, everyone was extremely nice. Though my interest in ancient antiquities is limited, I was very very happy with the tours that I took of the Garden and the building itself. The guides were terrific.

40,The Getty with a Garden!,"I wasn't sure what to expect when we first decided to go to the Getty Villa. I'd been to the Getty many times and driven past the villa many times, but didn't realize it was also a museum!J Paul Getty build this beautiful villa while living as an ex-pat in the UK. He built it to specifically showcase his statues and art from the days of Roman and Greek power and he never came to see it! It's tragedy in that is enough to see what the builder was never able to!The wife and I went on a Saturday around noon. They require reservations which are free, parking is 15 bucks and that's it for price! Very appealing for those balling on a budget! The reservations also keep it mellow! There's never a time where you feel crowded!The grounds are spectacular with a pool, herb gardens, grapevines and more. It's an Italian villa in Malibu! The museum itself is very similar to many museums specializing in antiquity, but the vibe and history is what makes this place special. If you haven't been to the Getty or LACMA, I'd still go there first, but the Getty Villa, especially if you're in the Malibu area is totally worth a go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessehendon
50,Totally worth the visit!!,Totally worth reserving online for entry. Amazing collection and architecture. The garden is also beautiful. A must visit place for arts and history lovers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wasabi_hater
40,Moms birthday outing,"I had been here before while in college, the art history class I was taking required us to visit and write an essay on an art museum. However, I was glad to go again for my mom's birthday this year. She had never been and is a big art and architecture person. Its a drive from where I live, about 45min-1hr but a relaxing and beautiful place.The ancient art there is awe inspiring, while the overall villa is beautiful over looking the ocean with an amazing garden. The only thing I was disappointed with upon this visit is that due to the drought in CA, they emptied the large and gorgeous fountain that runs the length of the garden along with most of the smaller fountains. The water aspect of this amazing place is feeling barren at this point, but the art, architecture, and garden foliage is still worth it!Also bring snacks! There is a snack cart and small restaurant but it's super expensive! Parking is all you pay for so keep it an inexpensive day outing and bring your own food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niqnak2289
40,Beautiful Villa overlooking the pacific ocean.,"If you are into viewing beautiful homes and learn about the life of the rich and famous, you are in for a treat. Overall, the Villa and the grounds are beautiful as well as the artwork around the property. But not much different from many other beautiful properties around California and the world at large.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElieB670
50,Amazing Collection,"Nestled in the Malibu hills, the Getty Villa is an indoor-outdoor museum of Ancient Greek, Etruscan and Roman art,artifacts and statuary. There are some truly amazing pieces to behold including Roman mosaics, Greek pottery, a mummy and mummy face art. The grounds are laid out like a Roman villa with great views of the Pacific Ocean.Admission is free, but is managed to keep down the crowds. You need to make a reservation online and print your ticket before arrival. Parking is $15.00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johnnymoondog
50,Superb,"A must do if you are near. A recreated roman villa full of interesting ancient Greek,Roman and earlier artifacts. The mosaics are so good to see.The site is beautiful and customer facilities - restaurants and rest rooms good.Don't be put off by the rules about how to get there and ticketing. It is really easy and so welcoming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevebrass
40,Unusual buildings,Very interesting layout with different levels. Lots of statues. I was a bit disappointed that the villa inside didn't look like a Roman Villa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MagicFlute
50,A lovely day,"The views from the Getty Villa are phenomenal. I don't know how many times I have been here, but I never mind returning. The setting is spectacular and the art stupendous. The restaurant is pretty good too. Try not to miss this place in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karensG4255ON
40,Beautiful and Interesting,"Although the property is beautiful and impressive, I can't say the same for the art. There are many replicas and what seemed like random artifacts taken from places with a lot of history. Due to the California drought, the fountains in the gardens weren't operational, which took from its beauty. It is free to get in though and it is located in beautiful Malibu so it makes for a nice outing with family or a date.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3794DGmichaelw
50,A beautiful day at the Getty,The whole venue is amazing. The grounds and art were worth spending the day at the Villa. Lunch was great. Had the special of the day and ordered wine. Matthew was a doll he made sure we had the wine we needed.. Make sure you check out the Getty Villa and stay for lunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenJen1865
50,Pretty Getty Villa,"If you want an entertaining & picturesque experience of Mediterranean antiquities and lovely staff - this is it.Only in America would they try to recreate a Mediterranean villa to view the arts. Nicely done. Lovely day for couples, solos and families. Yes food prices ok.Missed the Mediterranean high tea and outdoor amphitheater play which would have been good. We ubered in to villa easily without reservation around 11am Sunday. Could have spent the day here relaxing in the outdoor / indoor cafe between viewing strolls. Favorite thing was the garden tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorellec454
40,Lots of Greek relics,A pleasant place to visit. Well organised with very helpful and informative volunteers. Room after room of treasures mainly from Greece. Loved the gardens and herbs. Worth looking at website as they have performances there sometimes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Visi2rs
40,Wow,"Large gardens and many different museum rooms with artifacts that are hundreds of years old, from tools to mummy's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneB579
50,Very Impressive,"The antiquities collection here is terrific, and the setting and the gardens are stunning. Also, the restaurant (cafeteria style) is excellent. It is a very different experience from The Getty Center. They offer highlight tours, always informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanandjack2015
40,Italy in Malibu?,"This is an impressive museum. The grounds are just as interesting as the artifacts. If you are into mosaics and other Greek artifacts, the collection is fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellysp2016
50,Beautiful place,"The Getty villa is a beautiful place to hang out and walk around. Every time we have guest from out of town, we love to take them there. Is beautiful never too crowded, and the gallery/ exhibition is amazing! People will be happy you took them there. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morales2888
30,Interesting visit,"This showcases part of the vast expanse of historical artefacts amassed by the Gettys, which include statues, vases, gems and voins, particularly feom around the Roman age.On the second floor, they currently have exhibitis on glass making feom the ancient times, which was especially interesting, as some of the pieces look modern in nature.Do take the time to walk the grounds as well, and visit the museum store. Tickets are free, but must be booked online and printed in advance. Parking is available onsite, for $15. Do follow the instructions provided on getting to the estate - we used the GPS in the rental car, which led us in error to the back gate. It's basically along the PCH from the direction of LA towards Malibu Pier, and the entrance is about a mile after the intersection with Sunset Boulevard, on the right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orator11
40,Masterpiece,"We took an uber approx 40 minute ride from the Beverly Wilshire hotel. Beautiful ocean scenery if you drive on the coast. The villa wasn't to packed with tourist & even if it was the place is enormous. Lots of stairs and walking, they do have an elevator, numerous convenient bathrooms & food/drinks for sale. You can spend a few hours roaming the villa antiques & gardens. I am happy we didn't miss this history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SkysMommy4
50,Spectacular setting,Visited here with my Son and is Young family as they live close by we thought we would park in a side street and walk in we had timed tickets so did not think that would be a problem not so you are not allowed to walk up the drive (Health & Safety stated to be the reason back to the car re-entered in the car I think it was more about you having to pay for parking still all that aside it was a wonderful experience to see the collection of Artefacts collected by Getty by him and for him his wealth at that time was phenomenal what i did like there was interactive areas for young children allow 2 to 3 hours minimum overall a very enjoyable visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulineT780
50,I Wish I could give it Ten Stars,"We visited the Getty with our daughter. To me, it is the one of the absolute must sees in LA. The architecture is spectacular, designed to mimic an archeological dig. The collection of antiquities is breathtaking and the docent led tours excellent. In addition, it is all free, except for a minimal parking charge. Be forewarned, you need a reservation and you need to make it a ways in advance",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fletch1946
50,Unexpectedly Great for Kids,"We brought our two children, ages 8 and 11, here while on vacation. The building and collections are impressive. My kids are open to new experiences, and really enjoyed the grounds and the art work. They were most impressed by the age of the artifacts. We stayed about two hours which was plenty of time to see everything for them (an adult would definitely stay longer). Make sure to do your online reservation and print your tickets. They collect them from the car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationMom201
10,Couldn't get in,Apparently they require that you make a reservation on line before you arrive . Nothing shows up about that. Wasted an afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VNORVI
50,Beautiful art,"A must see! This place is truly a gem!. Take your time, stroll the grounds and you will be nicely surprised. The art collection is fascinating!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yorkav2015
50,"Impressive collection, gorgeous facility--and it is free (you pay parking only)","The Getty Villa was visited by us on a Thursday afternoon, after a lot of local schools had started.The Villa is situated in a very nice location: just off the Pacific Coast Highway, in Malibu Calfornia. It is up a rather narrow canyon, but has been build to take the location well.You will need to make sure you get free tickets, which you can print at home. Make sure you bring some money to pay parking (15$ at this writing). A cafe with good food is available on-site and there was an espresso/coffee cart available as well.The Villa is handicapped accessable, with a parking structure with elevators, and more elevators in the collection's buildings. When we visited, wheelchairs were available for use sitting near the elevators we took to go up to the Villa itself and wheelchairs were available at the coat-check area.There are many, many rooms with all sorts of collections of ancient glass, painted pottery fragments, pottery, actual wall paintings/decorations, jewelry, marble, ceramic and metal statuary and vessels, sarcophagi of stone and other materials, all of it quite beautiful and well preserved. I especially enjoyed the mosaic work that was on display.There are guided tours available. The Villa has various shows during the year that make use of their small ""ampitheater""; you can look these up on the Getty Villa's website.All in all this was a great place to visit. We were there only a few hours, but with lunch touring the complete grounds, you could easily make a short day of it.BE AWARE though: the traffic is pretty much horrendous, Los Angeles area traffic. Freeway travel will get you very near, but then you must drive surface streets to the Villa proper. Either way, you will hit traffic, and it is a crap-shoot as to how much traffic you will encounter. Leave time for traffic in your travel plansI enjoyed this very much and would like to visit again--if I could stay in the area for a night or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/713lmd
40,Well worth a visit,"The villa is really stunning although I couldn't help but think it is a bit of a rich man's fantasy. The gardens are lovely, although the current drought conditions meant that the fountains were dry. I was impressed with the docents, who really did a good job in explaining the history of the villa and pointing out the highlights of the collection, both indoors and outdoors. There is an upstairs cafeteria with lots of outdoors tables for lunch. Admission is free but it is necessary to book online for tickets. (Parking costs $15 but we got there very reasonably with Uber).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HannaH534
50,Wow!,"We live in Texas and this was my first visit to the LA area. As my adult daughter and I drove up to the parking area (it's $15 to park), we knew right away that Getty Villa is a special place. Our first sight was an egret in the pond area near the road.The property consists of a blend of closed areas and those that open up into the outdoors. The outdoor areas are beautifully done and many may be seen rain or shine because of the covered hallways surrounding them. During our visit, most of the water features were turned off due to the California drought.As with many lavish museums, all surfaces of many spaces: floors, ceilings and walls are worthy of viewing. I definitely suggest taking advantage of the orientation video, which is brief but filled with information you'd likely want before you walk around the property.We had a light meal at the cafe: soup and bread. The bread was good and the portion generous for the price, but the soup seemed rather pricey.We will very likely return and spend more time here...and also visit the Getty Museum further south.Interestingly, J. Paul Getty never saw the museum after it was completed. Its most recent renovation, completed in early 2006, reorganized the collection of artifacts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanAndJim
50,Truly stunning!,If you have time to see the Getty Villa then go for it. Two suggestions: buy your tickets ahead of time and get there as soon as it opens. It gets very crowded during the day. This villa is a replica of a Villa that Getty saw in Pompeii. The abundance of art work is amazing. My teenagers even liked it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sofigigi
50,Beautiful grounds and gorgeous art make for an amazing afternoon,This museum is beautiful. Give yourself time to get a bottle of wine and sit in the sun after you peruse the exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seaneenLa
50,A hidden art gallery with yummy food.,"My husband and I were driving the coast about 10 am and noticed the Getty Villa sign and turned in to check it out. (We are from Texas and visiting the area) First you need to get your ticket online, it is free. We did not, but the gate attendant had extra tickets and gave us two. What a treat to start off the day. The parking is underground, and cost $15, no problem! We walked to the Villa, wear something comfortable to walk in - there is lots of walking. We saw all the Roman and Greek art work, plus the lovely villa where it is housed. Lunch was available in the Café, and we thoroughly enjoyed the Mediterranean Platter and Spaghetti with Meatballs. Nice large portions. Wonderful find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blueyedsusan
30,Disappointing,"This was on my bucket list, but I was expecting something different or more. The grounds are beautiful, and the artifacts are displayed magnificently. The mosaics was gorgeous. BUT, if you've been to Greece or Italy, the artifacts are same old things, no pun intended, and there really aren't that many of them. We walked through and saw it all in about 30 minutes. If, HOWEVER, you are a history or ancient art fan, you'll like it a lot.There is a cafe for sandwiches and drinks, and a nice courtyard to sit and relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wacotx46
50,What a gem!,Really enjoyed our day at the Getty Villa. The informational movie and the complimentary tour head sets really added to our experience. The family room also helped engage my two nephews ages 10 and 6. We will definitely return and will recommend this attraction to friends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggieh75
50,Can't wait to go back again,We had a wonderful relaxing day at The Getty Villa. The gardens were amazing and the history was very very cool to see and read about. Next time we will take a picnic basket and have a nice lunch...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CandPtravel
50,"Quiet, reflective art space in Pacific Palisades","The Getty Villa is free to visit, however you need to book to go online ahead of time. The booking is easy to do and an email is sent with follow up information on how best to get there etc.This was our second time here and both times we have found it to be a superb place to visit. You can wonder around the recreation of a Roman country house, enjoying the architecture, garden and artwork.The cafe and kiosk are also good and offer a range of meals at differing prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelbTraveller22
50,"AMAZING place, so beautiful! FREE admission","I love love love love this place!Been here many times since they opened their doors in 2006. Every visit has been very nice! The grounds are immaculate and the garden perfected groomed and maintained. We were able to reserve tickets on the same day for admission on our latest visit which was on a weekday. We pulled up to the entrance and the staff wanted to see our tickets otherwise you can't go in. She even counted the number of tickets and the number of people in the car just to make sure. Pretty strict about that.We walked from parking garage to the museum entrance, and our bags and pockets were all thoroughly checked by security before entering. We walked around and went into a couple of the exhibit halls and saw some really cool ancient Roman statues, sculptures and vases. The works are very nicely preserved and beautifully presented. The information placards on each item was very educational and interesting.The garden area is my favorite part. The mosaic fountains and all the bronze sculptures around the fountains are absolutely stunning especially against the backdrop of the beautiful Pacific Palisades ocean view!Parking is $12. Bathrooms were very clean on a weekday, also no crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857irisw
50,Beautiful and Educational,"Beautiful museum, friendly docents, I have been many times and always find something I did not see before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mukdt29
50,Gorgeous,"This is a must see hidden gem. Perfect to spend few hours. Walk through the museum, grab some coffee and go back to the museum. Please note that reservations are required ahead of time. Parking is very easy (parking structure). Do not park on the highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/557yanam
20,Nice location overlooking the Pacific Ocean - artifacts were Okay,"The location in Malibu adjacent to the Pacific Ocean is outstanding. There is no admission charge BUT you need to make reservations (on line) and print out passes for each guest and you pay for parking when you arrive. There are many artifacts from antiquity but after awhile (unless you an ancient history scholar) it is more of the same.The grounds are nice but California is experiencing a drought so there is no water in the fountains and other water features and the foliage has also suffered. Given a choice the Getty Museum, I feel, has much more variety to offer and the landscaping and flora is much nicer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/062843
50,Great way to spend an afternoon on the PCH,"This place is free to get in, but requires a preprinted ticket that can be reserved on their website.Parking is $15 or $10 after 3pm.(closes at 5).There's so much to look around there you could immerse yourself for hours!Enjoyed the history lesson ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M2469RRdaveb
50,Visit and visit again,very interesting visits. Exhibitions renewed periodically and incredible quality and diversity. Good place for children too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etretatc
50,Preferable to walk through on your own rather than having a guide,"We started the garden tour and then left it after too many ga-ga comments about how marvelous Mr. Getty was. True, he collected lots of art with his fortunes from oil but compare this to Mr. Gates who helps so many disadvantaged people in the world with his fortunes from his company. The museum exhibits the items very well and since there are not masses of visitors, you can enjoy the art in peace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yasubec
50,4.5 Stars,"I love the villa. It's a beautiful site and the weather is always nice so close to the beach. The only thing keeping me from 5 stars is the amount of stairs. I went with my mom who is in a wheelchair. All of the elevators you need are there, but you are going to be using them A LOT.On one of the tours, the tour guide seemed unaware that we would need some instruction on where to go. I got very frustrated half way through and almost left the tour. We spent too much time trying to figure out how to get up the stairs the tour was on (it's not always obvious).If you don't have someone with you who has mobility issue, none of this will be a concern for you. If you do, everything is accessible. You'll just need to be proactive on the tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950brianz
50,The Getty Villa transports you to another time and place,"This was an amazing place to visit. For one, one can sit and daydream about how luxurious it'd be to live here. Alas, Getty never actually visited, nor lived, in the Villa.The collection of art and statues that we saw were fascinating. I am not sure if it's the setting or the collection that really fascinated me. I've been to many museums and seen many marble statues, but the collection here seemed more lifelike, you could almost see the humanity that inspired the statues. Plus, I feel like before visiting here, every marble male statue had the same face, as did most female statues. Here there are so many you get a great glimpse into what the townspeople looked like. There were mummies, glass blowing, little statues, larger than life statues, and so much more. The armor - you almost felt as though if you touched it, you'd feel the stories that it had to tell. (Don't try to touch it). Just a breathtaking collection. Now if you ask my kids who both saw the Villa years before I did, they'd just say ""Oh, the place with all the statues of naked people?!"" So there is a different perspective. #ThreeThumbReviews",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderwithsarah
50,The Getty Villa Experience,"I have been to this museum a number of times , but I am always blown away by the experience ( I cannot just explain it as a museum). You need to reserve about one week ahead as there is limited parking and the Villa wants to make everyone's experience is a pleasant one by not overcrowding. The parking is 15 dollars and well worth it!The walk from the parking structure to the Villa entrance is part of the experience as well. Do not rush it. I recommend as you enter the free museum to see the short intro video on the right. After that you can decide whether to wander around by yourselves as the exhibits are self explanatory or sign up for the hourly guided tours of the architecture or horticulture( garden tour). All are good choices.There is a very nice cafeteria and a gift shop to browse thru as well.You may decide to come back for one of their many other programs offered throughout the year, such as live Greek plays held in the evening outside in their Greek theatre ( highly recommended). The Getty Trust and the departments it funds have been very creative in offering art related courses and programs to the public and we should avail ourselves of their generosity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinkQ7630MZ
50,Stunning Location,"The Getty Villa is a lovely museum in Malibu. The collection is very interesting, however the building and gardens are stars in their own right. Simply walking around is an experience in it's own right. The gift shop and cafe are both very good, and the setting is outstanding. Take one of the short guided tours, they are very well done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilipandSheena
50,Beautiful small gem,Gorgeous gardens with the Pacific just beyond the garden walls. Beautiful ancient Roman art works in a breath taking villa. The weather was wonderful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Virgangulo
50,Great museum,"The Getty Villa is a must see if you are in the LA area. No admission fee, just $15 to park. Guided tours are offered, again at no charge, and highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/992sarib
40,Culture,It was worth to spend the 15 usd to get an idea how Getty lived. He and his fund invested for good reason to show all other people history!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Godfather666
50,A Fun Place to Explore,"My wife and I visited the Getty Villa on a Monday afternoon. We spent about 5 hours exploring the place, and there is still more to see. I highly recommend signing up for a tour or two if you visit. We went on a tour that provided information about the mosaic and tile collection. It helped me appreciate the artwork more. One of the great features of the Villa is the collection of little rooms or alcoves. These small spaces make the featured artwork all the more powerful by creating an intimate space that is designed to compliment the pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenjaminH989
50,Absolutely marvelous site,"This is the villa which houses many of the Getty-collected artifacts, mostly Greek, Roman and Etruscan. The museum and the site are stunning, the gardens enchanting. The café is an ideal place for a relaxing lunch after you tour the museum, with views of the surrounding gardens and the Pacific ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bahia123
50,Superb Walking Place,"Yes, you'll gawk at the wealth and well-manicured setting, but don't forget to just walk around, take in the beauty of the area, and enjoy a great view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chicoklanta
50,Short and Sweet~!,"I had a great time here; just as everyone says, it's amazing and beautiful. I was in town and needed to kill 1-2 hours, so it was perfect to do that.You have to make a reservation prior and there is a $15 parking fee.I also was in the first group to tour, so there was less people - I recommend doing that.I wish I had more time to see everything~!PS: The water was off due to water conservation / California drought.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justinkunimoto
50,great educational visit for kids,My family really enjoyed the villa. The visit was a success due to the lady who conducted the tours. I believe her name was Stacy. She did both the architectural and garden tour. Wow did she bring life to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfidalg0
50,A must see,This is the home of one of the finest collections of ancient art in the world. A must see if you are in the area. The villa format is icing on the cake. Their gardens are also incredibly well done. You can not get enough of this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kagatlin
50,This is a great place to visit if you are in the Los Angeles Area,"I have visited here several times and each time I come is like if I am visiting for the 1st time. Anytime I have friends from out of town I bring them here. 1st it's free admission. The only fee you have to pay is $15.00 for parking but it is well worth it. the grounds of the Villa are beautiful. You need to make reservations online and give an approximate time of arrival as they like to control the number of people that attend each day. There's so much to see that you cannot see everything in one day. The galleries have great pieces and the views are fabulous. I always take a Villa tour which explains the history behind the Villa. Don't miss the short film which will give lots of information about the construction of the Villa and how it all came about. They have excellent food at the Cafe on the grounds and a very nice museum shop. It is handicap friendly and accessible. If you enjoy the arts, history and beautiful views this is the place for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/216berenicev
40,Stylish escape,"A good basic gallery with fabulous food, views, and drinks. Good place for a stroll or group your to see the sites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeffreyliving
50,Tourists at home,My 7th grader and I decided to treat ourselves to some of our home state's attractions. This was the most spectacular place I have ever been in terms of art and architecture. The Ancient Greek and Roman sculptures are incredible and the thought that went into the buildings and grounds is immeasurable. My daughter's favorite part: the buildings and a statute of Venus you are allowed to touch. My favorite: the Herakles statue and herb garden.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellee827
50,"Beautiful site, with surprise entrance","My father and I enjoyed a great time both inside and outside the museum. It is very wheelchair accessible with easy ramps, elevators and a courteous, friendly staff. We saw the Roman Mosaics exhibit, and strolled the garden, terraces and pathways to Pacific Ocean peek-a-boo views. There is adequate parking and disabled permit parking close to the elevators. There are not many disabled only spaces.One surprise is how quickly the driveway entrance comes up on you as you approach from the northbound lanes of Pacific Coast Hwy. Look carefully for the modest black sign to Getty Villa BEFORE Getty Villa Drive. It's a long 20 minute loop back if you miss it, there is no access from south bound PCH. Free admission, $15 to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Resorteye
40,"Stunning, Short & Not for Little Kids","My first visit in over 10 years. Still a stunning location and an outstanding collection of ancient art Greco/Roman art. It doesn't take too long to see most of the exhibits. A more discerning eye might take longer to explore and read about various exhibits, but you can do this in a couple of hours and not feel rushed. DON""T BRING LITTLE KIDS. Unless you have awesome well behaved kids that can keep their hands to themselves. Besides, I think it would be boring (father of 3 and two under the age of 5).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/844jasonw
50,Just beautiful.,First time at the Getty Villa and loved it. The story and history of the place is fascinating. The art and the villa itself are just exquisite. It is worth the drive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabrielaCh
40,"Definitely worth a visit, dont forget to book tickets in advance","A free museum in a villa that was replicated from Hercolanum (the little brother of pompei). Nice pieces of art though the true attraction is the peace and calm of the villa and its gardens. We rented a convertible car (cabrio) to come here from Anaheim, where we had a conference. It was the perfect day off from a busy conference. Make sure you also visit the beaches, the hollywood sign, sunset boulevard and the celeb villas while you are doing your trip in the convertible :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katleen_12
50,Step back in time,"Reserve your free admission ahead of time. This is a beautiful, peaceful place, with wonderful views. The permanent exhibits are ancient Greek and Roman sculpture, art and artifacts. The gift store is amazing and not terribly over priced. The special programs, lectures and tours are totally worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poetrydancer
30,For me it's somehow weird to see all these masterpieces in the States,"Make no mistake, I don't say it's not beautiful and interesting. It really really is. And it's amazing what they've done to the place since the first time I visited in the 80's. The gardens, the restaurant, the exhibitions, the collections. All great. But still somehow misplaced. I love to see Italian art in Italy, French art in France, all the antic master pieces where they once were made. It's a bit the same with Hearst Castle. Amazing, but still... not quite. Something is not right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henna_mikkila
50,Fabulous,Great venue with incredible antiquities. The setting is magnificent. The collection is truly awesome. I highly recommend a visit here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stashu25
40,Nice to visit and quiet,This is a nice quiet attraction to visit. The villa is lovely and the design is cool. The tour guide we had on our tour was a laugh and she kept going on small rants and never finishing them but do not get me wrong she was good crac. Food and drinks are over priced. Views from some areas are cool. It is real handy to get to. You have to pre book to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Centrepunch
40,Beautiful and easy to do,"Right off PCH and near Santa Monica, this Villa has a lot of Roman artifacts. they also have some amazing gardens. i went in August and they shut off half the fountains due to the drought, which is unfortunate as they add to the beauty. But still a great visit and still my favorite museum restaurant with good food and good views",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hikingdude
50,"Relazing Grounds, not many crowds","If in the Malibu area, the Getty Villa is a wonderful place to stop and take in the grounds, art collections and period buildings. Even though I had returned from Rome the previous week I was still impressed regarding the display of the Getty collections. the views from the grounds out over the property was worth the detour.The admission is free, but you need to signup for an preadmission ticket online. The parking is $15, but after 3PM it is $10. If you are interested in also attending Getty Center, let the Information center know and you will only pay once for parking if attending both attractions the same day. A bargain!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Penta-Seattle
50,Relaxing Contrast,"The Getty Villa offers a relaxing contrast to the Getty Center with its traffic-centric location and crowds. The Getty Villa is located seaside on the edge of Malibu. While both museums are free to the public, the Villa requires reservations mainly for the limited parking. Visiting the Villa you will be transported back to ancient Roman times and experience residential life and the art and history of the era. As with the Center, the restaurant offers great food reasonably priced. For first time visitors, be sure to enter from the south coming away from Sunset Blvd as you cannot enter coming down from Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoboTravlr
50,Best antiquity collection in the U.S.,"I have been to The Louvre, The Vatican Museum, The British Museum - but this is it be best presentation of antiquities I've ever seen. The museum itself is much of that story, patterned after an estate in Pompeii. The curators have done a nice job taking this amazing collection and curating it in a way that tells a fascinating story of the ancient peoples and their art. The jewelry collections are in particular impressive, as are the mosaics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AggieJoe79
50,At day to be amazed,I have been to The Getty Villa several times and always recommend this stop when friends visit. The grounds are amazing. The view is stunning. The artifacts are beautiful. You could just spend the whole day walking around and taking it all in. Also the Cafe is great place to recharge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debster765
50,No time for a trip to Rome...? Get a glimpse of Roman antiquites and architechture,"Take a day trip to the Getty Villa and get a glimpse into history. There is a tremendous amount of Roman and Greek antiquities set in an replica of a Roman Villa.I took the garden tour and enjoyed learning about all about the landscape, history of the vegetation and how it was used and enjoyed the beauty of the gardens. There is short twelve minute film which is worth watching to give you an overview of the time period and Paul Getty. If you have time, eat lunch on the patio cafe. Made for a great respite between tours (there are quite a few to choose from running all day long).The museum is free but you need to print out parking tickets ahead of time. Parking is $15.00.Really, I had just traveled to Rome in April and it was fun to see such authentic representation of the villa and art here in the US. Thank you Getty team!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeniceP
50,Go here,"I like Places rather than Museums, so this was right up my ally. Came with 5 kids, and they did great. Amazing place to just walk and look around.Make reservations. Its free to be there, but is $15 for parking...I look at it like I paid $15 for my whole family to see a cool thing that makes them smarter and helps them learn about what they could do when they are big.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/walkerm029

50,A gorgeous piece of history,"We loved this villa. It's free and huge and so beautiful and full of amazing history. There is so much to see. Take one or two hours to visit this remarkable collection and see a great slice of history through the Mycenae, Etruscans and Greek remnants. You'll really love it as a family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizgoodyearjones
50,Very well organized museum,It is a nice museum with interesting exhibitions Very friendly to kids You should definitely choose some of the tours Don't forget to bring the tickets printed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamZ1193UU
40,Fun place to visit on our trip to California!,"We visited the Getty Villa on a Saturday afternoon in March. Coming from the northeast, it was a treat to explore the gardens in lovely weather, look out toward the ocean, and browse the galleries. We had brunch at Geoffrey's in Malibu before coming here. Great way to spend the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalRambler
30,A bit overhyped...,"First off, while admission is free (you do pay for parking though), you need to make a reservation in advance. I checked the day prior to Valentine's Day, and there were no more openings, but on a random Saturday in the spring, I had no trouble booking a spot. The villa is located off PCH, but it's a pain to get to since you can't turn left into the villa going southbound and have to drive down further and make a u-turn. Since there's a drought in the state, none of the fountains have any water, which is understandable, but a bummer. I stayed for part of the architecture tour and didn't find it too riveting. It's worth look around for an art-lover or someone out of state, but given the option, I would rather go to the Getty Center than the villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheLadyJess
50,A hidden gem !,"Hidden up in the Malibu hills the Getty villa is breathtaking , the gardens are beautiful with stunning views out to the ocean and they change what's on show on the second floor every so often and at the moment it's s Roman mosaic exhibition which is stunning . Alongside there usual display of Roman artefacts and Egyptian sarcophagus' there's plenty to see in lovely laid out air conditioned rooms . It's free to visit but you must pay $15 for parking which MUST be booked in advance on line .Well worth it .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinacs2015
50,Great Place. Great Setting,"The story of J. Paul Getty and this residence is worth the visit. Try to get reservations as parking is limited. If you like art, history and architecture, you will enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howardf736
40,Interesting place to wander around,Worth a morning visit if you like Roman architecture and artefacts. Beautiful gardens too. Free entry but $15 to park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisJP2806
50,An amazing collection!,"This is a gorgeous property with millions of dollars worth of ancient artwork and historical artifacts. It was like a review of Greek and Roman history, complete with the real objects in front of you. There is no charge to go in, but you do have to book a time ahead of time. Parking is $15, but that seems like a bargain these days. Because they regulate the traffic coming in, it never got crowded, although I would recommend going first thing in the morning, and then it's mostly empty. This is an important collection, and you will marvel at how Mr. Getty was able to amass so many important pieces. We noticed that there are a number of well-known individuals who have donated objects, as well, which makes sense if they want many people to be able to see them.This is a must-see for those who appreciate art, history, and beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyZ167
50,"Italian Country Manor replica, great exhibits","Saw the Cyrus Cylinder on loan from London. The curators were well informed and friendly. Go at your own pace, and don't forget to check out the Getty Center as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/183ng
50,Even the kids enjoyed it - go early,A fairly spontaneous trip to The Getty Villa but remember to book your free tickets online first. We visited on a Monday and I'd recommend going early to this tranquil replica Roman Villa. We arrived at 10 and took an informative and free tour of the building architecture. When we visited separate tours of buildings and gardens ran hourly on the half hour. Even the 10 and 8 year olds were captivated not only because they'd studied The Romans at school but they enjoyed wearing the tour headsets which allows you to listen to the guide and look around independently. When we left at2pm there was a much longer line of cars waiting to get in,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DomJohn
40,Great collection,"If you are planning to learn about history and archeological stuff, even for kids, it is the placeI only confused for the entrance door, managment should re-think about that since i drive like miles to make a U-turn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/attaf2016
50,Perfect museum to live within art as intended,"The Getty Villa used to house many of the paintings that are now in the Santa Monica Getty - many of us miss the ""old"" Getty Villa, when you could walk through the villa and pretend that you were walking through your own home, looking at your own art. The villa still is set up as though one is walking through a home, although now the art is focused upon Greek and Roman sculpture and pottery. The gardens are meticulously kept, including the sculptures throughout. Don't forget to explore all of the possible garden spots in the villa - there are side doors leading to small gardens and fountains which many visitors miss.If you are able to catch a play in the amp, do so! Highly entertaining, and the air from the Pacific makes the entire scene a joy. You can nab a snack from the cafeteria (my favorite is peasant bread with cheese and olives), or even grab a bottle of wine. Sitting in the piazza, soaking up the sun with the Pacific stretching out in front of you . . . truly, the Gettys have shared a glorious life with us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Persephone11032
50,Idyllic,"I can't believe this used to be J. Paul Getty's personal residence - sooo jealous! What a beautiful place to spend a few hours. Right at Sunset and PCH so convenient to hit up on your way to the beach or after cruising through Santa Monica. Beautiful jewelry collection, beautiful gardens. Very cool mosaic exhibit going on right now too. Note that the pools have been drained due to the drought -possibly the only downside at the moment. Best part = tickets are free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zack_in_CA
50,Best museum ever,This place is wonderful. Perfect place to take a date: the beautiful art and mild climate are the perfect escape from the traffic and summer heat of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y9073CKbarrym
50,Bigger than I thought!,Lived here for most of my life but had never been. Took a visit from San Fran friends that wanted to go to get me here and I'm so glad I finally visited. Just reserve parking and you're set! Beautiful grounds and the villa is based on actual ruins. They have a nice cafe and gift shop now. They offer architecture and grounds tours so along with viewing the actual art work itself you should plan for a long visit. Best part is that it was not overrun with people so it was easy to see all the items.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cdubbas
50,A must see if interested in ancient history,"You dont have to travel all the way to Athens or Rome to experience the creator of the unique exibition has built in Los Angeles. The Greek and Roman architecture , statues and hundreds of art specimens are wonderful to see and film. Furthermore the landscaping and grounds generally are beautiful. Many school childrens tours visit here on the day we went, its so educational. Need a car to get there. Most enjoyable",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterbD9553EE

50,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful",Had a terrific time walking around and we were able to see the architecture and garden tours which were very well done and informative. Lou Rosen did our garden tour and was very knowledgeable about all things plant related . Susan Quilan gave a very educational explanation of the architecture of the villa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommal2014
40,Lovely Place to Visit.,"Ordered our tickets online and printed them off. It's free but you have to book online. It is a hard place to get to because you cannot drive up into it. We took an Uber from our hotel and the fellow could not drive us in to let us off. It is on a very busy road so it was a bit frantic where he could safely pull over. You have to take one of their shuttles up to the main building. Lots to see, beautiful gardens, enjoyed our day immensely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leesat2013
40,Wow!!,"We went online to pick up our free tickets to the villa, but had to pay for parking. My friend and I hooked ourselves onto a garden tour for an explanation about all the different types of gardens and Ny some of the foliage was specifically chosen for each garden. The Getty collection at the villa is expansive and should probably be seen over more than one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darylmarx

50,Feels Like A Relaxing Time In Pompei,"Set back among beautiful landscape, just off of the Pacific ocean, you get the feeling as it might have been during Roman times in Pompei. Enjoy a bite to eat in the cafe' with surrounding views and then continue on into the replicated Pompei site with museum artifacts. The grounds are enjoyed by children as well as adults! Give yourself a couple of hours to meander around.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whiteshome1
40,Surprisingly beautiful,"We're SO glad we made the stop here. THe wonderful collection of Greek and Roman sculpture and artifacts was beautiful presented, and carefully explained. The setting, in a villa, includes some rooms that carefully combine recreations of authentic architecture and art. Tile works are wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mazalea2012
50,Free and fun,"A great museum perched high above the ocean near Malibu constructed to resemble an Italian villa from Herculaneum (near Naples Italy) featuring a nice collection of Greek and Roman statuary, mosaics and smaller items.TIP: museum is FREE as are the great docent-led tours. You MUST go online and reserve (and print) tickets-they are timed so it doesn't get too crowded.We went online a couple weeks ahead and easily got 3 tickets for 10 am (when they open) on a July Saturday. I was excited to see the special collection of ancient mosaics from Italy, Greece and France as well as some of the Roman statuary. We roamed around for about 45 minutes then signed up for the FREE docent-led ""highlights of the museum"" tour. Our group was around 20 people and we were given listening devices so we could hear the docent's commentary about key works in the collection.The 50-minute tour was a highlight of our two-hour visit. There are tours throughout the day and it would certainly be possible to take several during a visit. Other tours included a garden tour, an architectural tour, mythology tour (for families), and a tour of the mosaics exhibit. You just get so much more from a visit this way -HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.TIP: you have to sign up for the tour by the gift shop-you add your name and zip code to the clip board then are given a colored sticker for your designated tour.While the museum is free, there is a charge for parking, $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimRiesterer
50,Magnificent,Absolutely beautiful facility. The gardens themselves are worth the visit. Lots of volunteers and employees to help find your way. This place is worth an entire day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbanddick
50,A beautiful gem,"This was the last tourist spot I visited before I left LA and I'm so glad I took the time to do it.In order to get tickets (which are free), one needs to visit the Getty website and choose a particular time. This is great because it ensures that the villa doesn't get overcrowded at any particular time. Unfortunately I didn't have access to the printer but I called the Getty's customer line and was told by a friendly gentleman that it would be okay to show them the ticket on my phone.The Getty Villa itself is beautiful, clean and well-organised. There are a series of museums before one enters the villa which is great and gives you a good idea of the history of the era.I suggest that you take a free tour before you walk around yourself. The guides are very helpful and informative and will give you a good introduction to the villa.My review is titled 'A beautiful gem' because this villa isn't necessarily a popular tourist spot as it isn't known to many. However given the state of the villa, the museum and tours available it is as organised as any tourist location that expects a high volume of customers.Definitely a place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73natashaa
50,Great Collection of Greco-Roman Art,"The Getty Villa has one of the best collections of Greek, Etruscan and Roman sculptures in the world. Admission is free although you need to make a reservation and pay $15 for parking. The museum organizes the exhibits by themes including Greco-Roman gods and goddesses, Greco-Roman heroes and the Trojan War. An audio guide is available although even with the audio guide it doesn't take more than few honesty fully explore the museum. The grounds of the facility, a former home of the Getty family donated to the public, are also spectacular. I highly recommend this museum and plan on returning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidr151
50,My Number 1 in L.A.,"Great place for history lovers on the Malibu coast. Built by J. Paul Getty (although he never actually visited it) to house his art collections it now primarily houses his antiquities collections. Beautifully laid out, run to the most professional standard I have ever seen it is truly wonderful. I was never very fond of antiquities before I came here.The grounds are beautiful.The audio tours (on the supplied iPod) are informative.And it is all FREE.You must pay $15 for parking but nothing for entry.Fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albywon
30,Nothing too special,"The Getty Villa is lacking in a few areas. The grounds are beautiful and so is the villa itself but as for the museum aspect, I wouldn't expect much. A lot of the statues are replicas. Head over to the Getty Center or LACMA instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hydrati0n9
50,Great Collection In A Fantastic Setting,The Getty Villa is a place on the not to be missed list when visiting LA. The admission is free although you need to reserve a time on-line and pay to park. The buildings and the grounds are stunning and the views out toward the Pacific are as well.The real draw here though is the excellent collection of ancient art. World class exhibits housed in a building that recreates the setting of a Roman Villa is hard to beat. On our last visit they had a collection of mosaics from the Roman world that were breathtaking. This is one of the most instagram worthy spots in the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bccrab
50,Beyond the tip of the iceberg,"Having not been brought up in LA so therefore not benefitting from a school trip at a young age, I had no idea the piece of the Getty Villa visible from the Pacific Coast Highway had behind it an amazing local museum and wonderful gardens.Fortunately we were drawn to the Getty by an amazing cooking class or I never would have known it existed. Luckily the class included a guided tour of the latest exhibit and the gardens.Because of the class, we did not explore every corner of the permanent collection or the gardens, but I liked the scale of the place. It is not overwhelming and there is beauty everywhere you look. Take a guided tour. The fountains and pools are drained due to the California drought, but you can still get the sense of what it would have been like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwalker43

50,Great Architecture,"The renovation of the Villa to make all the art fit in the point of time it was intended is great. The tour guide was awesome, and it is a good idea to do this tour to understsnd the history of the columns, ceilings, tile and flow of the rooms with the sculptures. Some pieces are better than things I've seen at the Art Institute in Chicago. We drove from our hotel in Anaheim. Although it is about 45 miles, it took us two hours each way with traffic. The entrance is free and you must get tickets ahead of time. The cafe had very appetizing items with pletiful portions. Plan to stay two hours to do everything. Malibu Beach is a short drive from the Villa. There were some pretty views from the beach. The trip was worth it but the traffic was,annoying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanbP7196PY

But you'll pay $15 for parking and there's plenty of parking. The garden as usual was serene and well kept. Unfortunately because of the CA drought, the water feature in the main garden was turned off. But the bottom is blue, you can almost make believe there's water in it if you take your pictures at just the right angle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IkramHawk

50,A nice break from the LA craziness,"It's a nice drive up the coast. You need to approach from the south, so plan accordingly.The villa is amazing, as are the antiquities. The grounds, especially herb garden, are phenomenal. I'd love to see the grounds when the water is flowing in the fountains.I had a ticket at opening time. You can get in to the grounds early, but the villa doesn't open before the specified time. There was a line to get in by the time I left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericjrodriguez
50,The Getty Villa Is an Outstanding Peek into Past,"My wife and I spend early December in Los Angeles to visit various places on our bucket list and this was on my wife's since she worked for Getty Oil back in the '80s. I came here without much expectation.I learned that while a bit hard to get to and parking is not free (my only real complaints), the trip is a really education about the Ancient World of the Greeks, Romans and the Etruscans. There are works of sculpture throughout the grounds, beautiful garden and some interactive exhibits.While admission is free, you need to get a ticket to get in so that they are able to manage the size of the crowd on the campus at any one time. This turns out to be a great thing as you don't feel crowded or rushed and can easily spend the day (as we did).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6stanb
50,"fabulous space, excellent art","The Getty Villa is a wonderful and unique space. The art work is only antiquities and is showcased in a re-creation of a 1st century Roman villa. The surrounding grounds and the art spaces are well positioned in context and with excellent narrations. There are frequent and ongoing tours. Make sure you make a reservation before you go as you can't just ""drop in"".

50,Great collection of Greek and Roman art,First make sure you get a free timed ticket on line but you will pay $15 to park. This is located on the very busy Pacific Coast Highway so plan your trip along with the traffic. We spent 3 hours there to look at the exhibits which are located in a villa that represents places from Pompeii and other Italy locations. It's beautiful and our teen loved it. THe water in the large fountain pool is not filled right now due to the drought so you don't have that iconic photo to take.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BushkaTexas

50,A piece of Europe in LA,We just LOVED this unique find! The only cost is for parking and the place was so beautiful you could stay all day! This is good for families w its elementary and older children. We did not eat there but there is a resturant. They do not encourage eating and they expect you to help keep the villa clean. The are plenty docents to patrol and answer questions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vgillhooper
50,Stroll through an ancient Roman villa,"A visit to the Villa is a visit to another era. The building and gardens are reproduced from the plan of a pleasure villa destroyed in 79A D by Mt. Vesuvius. The gardens are authentic, although, sadly, in 2016 the fountains are dry due to the California drought. The permanent collection focuses on classical Greek and Roman, do not miss the ""Victorious Youth"" also known as the Getty Bronze, one of the few bronze figures to have survived. The cafe serves excellent Italian fare, the Villa Burger is great. Special exhibitions are always exceptional. There is an interactive kids room to keep the young ones engaged.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bonnieb289

50,Gorgeous setting; impressive Antiquities museum and recreated Roman villa,"The Getty Villa well-deserves its superb reputation as a must see in LA. It is easy to reach via the Pacific Coastal Highway and only 15 minutes from the Getty Center. Though admission is free, you must get a time-specific admission pass online in advance (this can be done the same day at non-peak times (but peak times may require advance planning) , and if emailed to your phone you need not print the receipt). Parking is $15 (receipt also permits parking same day at Getty Center). Inside the Villa houses Getty's impressive Greek, Etruscan, and Roman collection with extensive statues, pottery, glass, gold and silver, jewelry, and coins. There is also a small collection of earlier times). Outside is a theater and the full size reproduction of the Villa dei Papiri in Herculaneum from 79 BCE after Vesuvius, including gardens and statue reproductions, with the Pacific Ocean view as a backdrop. If unfamiliar with this period, room 113 gives a good overview of the overlapping timelines of the three cultures, with selected key dates. As at the Getty Center an iPod msy be rented (free of charge) which offers a guide to highlights of the collection, and there is a 12 minute movie introduction if you wish. Overall a very pleasant place to spend 3-4 hours admiring both a beautiful setting and an impressive collection of Mediterranean artifacts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelerSFBayarea
50,Beautiful and interesting gardens and buildings,"We really enjoyed the Getty Villa, especially the gardens. We took a garden tour (free) and it was very educational and interesting. The art was good, but not a good as the Getty Center. We toured the Villa in the morning, got a parking validation, then went to the Getty Center in the afternoon. See the Villa for beautiful gardens, the Center for art works.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckBrooks
50,Always a Favorite,This museum housing greek and roman antiquities is exquisite. One of my favorite places anywhere. Don't miss the gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tiz108
50,Simply a wonderful place to relax and visit time and time again!,"We are locals . . . so we have been to The Getty Villa several times. It never fails to delight! The atmosphere transports you to another place . . . the architecture, the gardens,the ocean view, the fresh and innovative salads on the patio .. . .you feel like you are in a Roman Villa. And, of course, there is the ancient art. Our most recent trip was to see Mosaics from Italy, Syria and Gaul .... . the mosaics are beautiful and the presentation interesting. One thing we decided to do was to take the 40 minute Garden Tour. It is free, like the museum, and was SO interesting! They use a system of bluetooth connected earphones so that it was easy to hear every on the tour. Our volunteer docent, Paul, was just a delight . . informative and amusing! We learned so much! We had not appreciated that the plants in the main garden were selected to be the same as would have been at the original villa in Italy (with a couple exceptions). We arrived early (10:30 reservation) and the place was not crowded at all. We had croissants and coffee on the patio, visited the garden and the mosaics, had a fabulous salad for lunch on the patio again . . . .and headed home. We spent about 4 hours. The grounds were becoming more crowded with tours in the afternoon. Note that you need to make reservations (on line) in advance. You get a timed ticket. Admission is free, although parking is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GandC71187
40,simply wonderfull,"we spent most of the day there, really great but you should book parking to be on the safe side, large display of antiquities, great feel to the building generally although pool did not have water due to restrictions, garden area good with fruit and vegetables growing, distant sea views and a breeze, good shop and wheel chairs available for those that need them",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/135charlesq
50,Stunning When the Flowers are in Bloom,Going in spring or early summer is the perfect time. It's still not too hot out and the flowers are all in bloom making a beautiful place spectacular. I did the architecture tour which was the perfect length to be informative but not boring. I would highly recommend it.I went with as a couple and it was so romantic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChloeRC92
50,Even better than I hoped.....,"We visited Herculaneum last month, and when our guide told us that the Getty Villa is a recreation of a famous villa there (complete with copies of statues in their findspots) I was intrigued. So we went, and I did experience some trepidation because a 20th century copy of a 1st century place is bound to be a difficult feat to pull off without looking like a cheesy Las Vegas casino, but this is really really lovely. All the statues I expected (drunken Bacchus, resting Hermes, the wrestlers) were there, looking a little surprised to find themselves recreated in Malibu. Inside, the collections were thoughtful, with some temporary exhibits (glass, mosaics) that alone were worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/attitudedevant2015
50,Don't miss this little jewel !,Make sure you make your appointment before you come here. Parking is $15 but it will also cover the other Getty Center if you visit both on the same day. Admission is free though.Its a pretty drive along the coast before you get here. The setting is very serene and beautiful. Lots to see even its a private place. Theres an introduction film and 2 levels of art collection displays. Gorgeous exhibitions and beautiful Italian garden setting and also a herb garden.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itcheetam
50,Getty Villa,Incredibly detailed Roman style garden. That alone is worth the visit. Permanent collection is also amazing. Restaurant is decent given the circumstances. Good visitor flow for a limited space. I would recommend a full day. Take the tours. I could only spend a few hours so I plan to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RandallF16
50,Amazing setting!,"We were on our way from LA to Santa Barbara and arrived at opening. The grounds were lovely despite the drought, the antiquities amazing, and the facility stunning. We did not visit the Getty Museum, and it will have to wait for another trip. If you like old statues and Greco and Roman architecture, make sure you stop by for a visit. We spent about 2.5 hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/505lisab505
50,Splendidly organized,Staying in Santa Barbara and visiting the Getty Villa is a serious undertaking because of traffic but we made it! The reward was hughe: what a collection and what a superb presentation. Everything was top notch: from the parking facilities to the audio tour and the cafe. A must,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonnyRDeinze
50,"Pompeii ""Revisit""","This day, in So. California reminded me of our visit to Pompeii. I especially enjoyed how Getty brought to life how the Romans lived by using herbs for medicinal purposes, and displayed how the Romans used engineering as part of the architectural design. Of course, the art and sculptures reminded me of our trip to Italy. ALL of this for the cost of parking, $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O182RZsteveh
50,Beutiful Romanesque villa with a matching impressive collection,"One of the 2 Getty museums in the LA area - this is focused on Roman era artifacts. It's not a large place, but holds many interesting exhibits. The Getty Center is in LA, and is more focused on 1600s+ exhibits. Entrance to both is free, but the respective cities charge for the parking on premise ($15). It's highly recommended to get tickets online ahead of time - getty.edu - for the Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mhectorgato
50,Beyond Words...,"The Getty Villa is a step into old Italy. The grounds, buildings, authentic Italian plants and trees set the stage for an incredible glimpse into the Getty passion for art and history. And to think it's all free of charge. Amazing. Just book your tickets online to get a spot, set aside the entire time allowed for a visit, then enjoy the splendor of ancient times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Char37
40,Incredible collection,"The collection here is incredible as there are so many rooms filled with beautiful pieces, but in my opinion the villa itself is worth the trip! The building is incredibly detailed, with the floors, walls and ceilings all beautifully decorated - it's truly amazing. When we visited the water features were turned off because of the drought, but the gardens are still spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C8137UUemmaw
50,This is one of the best things in L.A.,"Even if you don't care for art or classical antiquity, its the best place for lunch in L.A. The gardens are always changing (hopefully the water will return to the fountains and pools, soon). Every August/September new English versions of classical plays are offered in the intimate outdoor theater. I've been going for years, and it's always fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aefenspraec
50,Roman Mosaics,"We went specifically to see the exhibition: ""Roman Mosaics Across the Empire"" the day before Mother's Day. We were lucky that parking was free that day; otherwise it's $15 and you must make reservations ahead of time for your visit.We obtained a free audio guide to the exhibit. The rarely seen mosaics originate from different parts of the Roman Empire. This exhibition is definitely worth a visit and spending time on the getty.edu website to get acquainted with the museum rewards you with a treasure trove of information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/796ja
50,Spectatular Roman villa overlooking the Pacific,"If you take time only to visit the Villa for lunch, it is worth it. The site itself is sublime and and the cuisine is far better than one would expect at a museum.The villa however is the main attraction. J.P. Getty has created a magnificent copy of ""how the rich and famous"" lived in the time of the Roman Empire and filled it with beautiful examples of sculpture and artifacts from the ancient world.A stroll through the marble courtyards or the verdant gardens gives you the sense of being transported 2000 years back in history. L.A. seems light years away.It is doubtful that most children would enjoy the experience, but for adults, it is a feast for the senses.You do need to make reservations. Parking $15. Museum and grounds:gratis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennism303
50,Beautiful way to spend a few hours,Hard to believe such a beautiful venue is free. The Greek and Roman artifact collection is really wonderful. The gardens amazing. The onsite food facility was also really special. Great food selection and the views while dining spectacular. Would definitely return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dps_Sedona
50,Highly recommend,"This free museum houses amazing antiquities and has a cute cafe/coffee cart. I took the garden tour and it was superb! Getting there was easy using the public bus from Santa Monica ($1.75 number 534). Once you are dropped off at the bus stop, you will see the entrance across the street and a security guard will call a shuttle to come pick you up and drive you to the top of the hill where the entrance is. No cell phone service once on the property (I have t mobile), so I was unable to call and uber from the top to come get me once I was done. There is a shuttle to bring you back down to the main road too. It would be easy to take the bus back to town too, but since it only comes twice an hour just depends on how long you want to wait. Highly recommend this museum. Beautiful place to learn, marvel or just sit in the beautiful gardens thinking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/768katherines
50,Stunning and free outside of $15 parking,"Go early to get best parking and try to avoid the crowds of noisy school childrenThe villa echoes so when the kids are running and screaming, it's terrible on the earsThey have a new glass exhibitIt's a shame that they have turned off their main water fountainWonderful exhibitsGood food at the cafe",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/107cl
50,A spectacular museum above PCH,"A visit to the Getty Villa is well worth your time. Please note: although the entrance is right off the Pacific Coast Highway, it can be easily missed, so if you're driving from Los Angeles/Santa Monica, keep your eyes peeled for the entrance after you pass the intersection of Sunset and PCH. If you pass it, its difficult to find a place to turn around and head back. If you are approaching from the north (Malibu), you're going to have to find a safe place to make a u-turn since the entrance is not accessible from the north. I recommend turning into the gas station at Sunset and PCH and heading back to the entrance.Once there, it's like stepping back in time. Modeled after a real ancient Roman villa and gardens discovered in the resort town of Herculaneum, which had been buried by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in A.D. 79, the museum itself is made to look like an ancient Roman summer home for the fabulously wealthy. The galleries are filled with Greek, Roman, and Etruscan sculptures, coins, jewelry, objects or daily life, some frescoes, and more. The objects are beautifully presented and the object labels are informative and easy to read. The staff is very friendly and approachable in case you have any questions. Tours of the architecture and gardens and tours of selected items from the collection are available free of charge. Don't miss the gorgeous herb garden and the outer peristyle, which are wonderful spaces to stroll and utilize all your senses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bongito
50,"Far, far, away.","Many folks confuse the Getty Villa with the Getty Center. The Getty Villa is across the street from the Ocean right at the intersection of Pacific Palisades and Malibu. The Getty Villa focuses on ancient Greek and Roman art. The grounds are magnificent. Plan on about 2 hours there. Lovely restaurant including a nice wine selection. It's a good place for all ages. Even kids love it. The key is planning ahead. You cannot just drive up. You either need to make a parking reservation in advance or take mass transit. If you're planning on combining this with a beach visit, just be aware that the beach across the street is ok, but not spectacular. There's some great hikes within 2 miles. Los Liones Canyon. Or the neighborhood just North of the Villa is great starting at Castellammare Dr.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankiebeer
50,Fabulous collection of classical works in a beautiful setting,"This is a must-see spot for lovers of art, architecture, the classics, and ancient history. Many of the pieces are ""old friends,"" and there are some charming works new to me.Phone reception is iffy, which makes calling for a taxi (or the taxi using its credit card machine) problematic. Take enough cash for the taxi. Also be aware that some cab companies will take you to Malibu but can't come back to pick you up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/12trvlgirl
30,Not bad,The Getty villa is an interesting museum. The views are nice. Otherwise nothing special about this place. It is free though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeMoshDub
50,You won't be disappointed!,Lovely museum with lots of Greece-Roman artifacts. The museum itself is beautiful and the gardens as well. An extensive collection of artifacts. Make sure to view the video to start your tour. Such a peaceful place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amberr14
50,Worth Getting There,"...if visiting from another country. Yes, there are many choices of things to do in the LA area that are more convenient but anyone I have taken here is always happy they took out the time to do so. Tickets are easy to come by for most any time you want. Be sure to time your visit to take a free tour or two, which are the only way to go in my opinion, and that is all you need. Excellent photo ops with the Pacific ocean in the background. From the Villa one can continue up the highway to Malibu in 10+ minutes or take Topanga Canyon to visit the quaint back-in-time little town where the lovely Inn Of The Seventh Ray restaurant is located.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristiAnn818
50,Beautiful - You feel like you are in ancient Greece and Italy,"The villa is a recreation of an ancient Roman House. I would have been happy just to walk through the gardens.I love the experience of walking through the gardens before going in the villa. The views are great and the architecture is amazing. Fountains, arbors, reflecting ponds—the Villa's four tranquil gardens feature designs inspired by ancient Roman models and planted with species known from the ancient Mediterranean.I was ecstatic viewing the art.The Getty Villa houses the J. Paul Getty Museum's collection of approximately 44,000 Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities. Over 1,200 works are on view in 23 galleries devoted to the permanent collection, with five additional galleries for changing exhibitions.Plan your visit! You will need to reserve parking in order to park at the Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gmeredith
50,A Roman Villa,"One of the buildings at the Villa Getty is a reproduction of the home of Julius Caesar's father-in-law, and it is stunning. It also houses many hundreds of the ancient world's antiquities. If you love ancient Roman and Greek history and art you will find Villa Getty a fascinating place. There is even an outdoor theatre where actual productions are held in the fall, and the traveling exhibits are exquisite: I just saw an amazing collection of mosaics that are as big as my living room rug, and often served the same purpose. Don't miss this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesliemac1066
50,Just beautiful,Spectacular views and perfect in every detail. The villa showcases an incredible collection if Roman artifacts and art works. The staff is extremely cordial and knowledgeable. We were fortunate to visit on a clear day so the visibility was excellent. I was glad to see that the fountains had been turned off due to the drought. Good institutional citizenship!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJRAtlanta_Georgia
40,A beautiful museum and park,"This place is essentially a roman/greek arts museum on an attractive and beautiful villa. It worth a visit not only for those who loves art, but to all kind of people who wished to get a good photo! I am not a very art-fancy person and I still enjoy walking around the Getty Villa. There is a audio tour inside the museum but I never enjoyed such tours and rather read on the artifacts explanation. The garden is a piece of art and definitely worth a visit! Visiting this place requires you to book a time online for free; but I can't recall they enforced the booking strictly. In fact, no one check to see if we have a booking or not other than from the entrance to the parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duohungryhippos
50,Simply marvelous Roman antiquities collection - must see!,"This is one of the great museums in Los Angeles, and you can't beat the location. Right on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, the Getty Villa is a replica of an actual Italian villa that destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The architecture and the grounds are beautiful - cleverly constructed to mimic a Roman archaeological site. The collection of Roman and Greek antiquities rivals those my husband and I saw in Italy. On this visit, the Getty's usual fine collection was supplemented by a special exhibit of Roman mosaics taken from Roman ruins in France, Northern Africa and Italy. Most of the mosaics are part of the Getty collection - probably the most extensive Roman mosaic collection in the world. The gift shop and the restaurant are really good, when you need a break from the galleries. And one more thing: entrance to the museum is free - although it's $15 for parking. Tips: Go to the museum's website to plan your trip - reservations and printed tickets are required in order to control the number of people at the museum at any one time. Be sure to take advantage of the free guided tours that run every hour or so. We took the garden tour, the architectural tour, and the special exhibit tour (Roman mosaics). The docents were knowledgeable and entertaining - they really enhanced our experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzanne92107
50,Remarkable,"Spent nearly 3 hours touring the Villa and wish we could have spent 3 more hours as there is so much to see and take in and it is riveting.There are sculptures of all sorts, men, women, children. There's a mummy and a sarcophagus. The Mosaic tile rooms are mesmerizing as you behold the masterpieces on display.The glassworks section was amazing and to see the intricate artwork on the various vases and urns and wine cups was awesome.The grounds are marvelous to behold. There are flowers and herbs and shrubs and trees, very pastoral.Go and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigMac1949
50,Great museum,"I did not know what to expect before going there, however I was very surprised by the great quality of the expositions.The videos they had were very informative and even when objects were missing from display you where explained why they were missing.The gardens are stunningly beautiful.I can only recommend the Getty Villa!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincentdZ7833FN
40,Interesting & Unique,A beautiful location and a very interesting museum! Children would be bored but if you are into Roman history and Greek mythology- you will be captivated with the collection of artifacts!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/367LindaS
50,Beautiful,I think the grounds themselves are deserving of a visit. Such lovely gardens to stroll on a beautiful day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAHtravels
50,Unmissable unique,"We had been to the Getty museum a number of times which is a wonderful experience, but was surprised that the experience here was even more enjoyable. The approach is more modest than the museum, it is almost hidden in a narrow steep valley, but the scale and presentation of the buildings, gardens and exhibitions is a joy. The world of the Greek and Roman civilizations is memorably presented with great clarity and thought. It is a place where time seems to stand. Loved the gardens, each had its own interest and charms. All of the practical elements of a visit work well, the welcome, access, parking, food and drink, facilities, shop are excellent. Quite simply it all works and suits all ages",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Noel021
50,Incredible Museum and Gardens,I highly recommend this Museum for a visit. It was a wonderful collection of Greek and Roman art. The Getty Villa is well organized as it had undergone a renovation a couple years ago.The Villa itself is amazing and the Gardens are very impressive. Getty had a vision and you can be a part of it with your visit to the Museum. It is free to attend but you pay $15 for parking. We also booked online for a time to visit the Villa. We worth the trip! Enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philip2010
50,Beautiful Family outing for the price of parking.,Beautiful location and the grounds are stunning. You can spend at least an hour browsing the different installations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelaaN4135HR
50,Worth the stop when coming into Malibu,"If you love ocean views and architecture, this is a must see on your way into Malibu. A beautiful place to grab a museum bite and stroll around beautiful surroundings. It's a small garden museum, so do-able with kids. As a local, it's a great place for piece and quiet to take in the art, without making the hike to the other fabulous city-view Getty on the Westside. Parking must be reserved on-line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuxeValueTravler
50,A walk back in time,"This is a must when you go to LA. The Villa takes you back to a grand time in American History, its beauty is stunning. The art is pretty amazing also. Be sure to make your reservation in advance, no walk in's",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/883timf
50,A Splendid Place!,"I spent a morning here during a recent visit to Los Angeles and was thrilled by the sheer beauty of the setting. It was an easy drive from downtown LA to Malibu where the Villa is located. Parking is plentiful ($15) and there's no admission charge to visit the museum. The Villa displays Getty's fantastic collection of Greek, Etruscan and Roman art works and everything is wonderfully laid out and clearly labeled. What a joy -- especially with the ocean views in the background. Do not miss a visit here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/John2015
50,Feel like a Greek gods,"As soon as we entered the villa,, you will start to feel like Romans. I was dressed up in a simple gown too.. which fuelled my imagination. The courtyard , herb garden..and the auditorium.. I felt like I am running the palace",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsnMrKhan
50,Not to be missed!,"The Getty Villa is a free museum of antiquities carefully selected and purchased for all to see dating from back as far as 1600BC(from memory). Give yourself a day here - there is so much to see! it is a wonderful place kindly created and funded by the late J.Paul Getty. It gives us a look into the past that I have not seen elsewhere. There is a $15US parking fee which you pay at the gate, and you need to book your free tickets online and take them with you. Later collections are housed at the Getty Centre about a 15 minute drive away. If you start early you can get a free parking chit and take from one to the other on the same day. Entry to that site is also free. We were so absorbed by what was on display we spent the whole day at the Villa. Will be making sure we visit the other centre when back in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/580janc
30,Beautiful setting! Interesting Artifacts!,Wonderful setting for some very old antiquities! Roman pottery from AD and much more!Gardens are lovely but not a place for children under 12 or so! Nice cafe! Elevators but many steps for the ambitious!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/104BonnieB
50,Beautiful property and interesting exhibits,Spent a delightful morning strolling the venue and taking in the exhibits. The fountains aren't running because of water conservation which was too bad but the landscaping and building design are stunning nevertheless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CTaaB
50,History at it's finest!,"The Getty Villa is something very special, you feel like you are stepping back in time when you visit the beautiful grounds and museum. The exhibits are always changing so always you find something new to discover and learn about. Learn about history going back to ancient Roman times, admire coins, armor, glassware, frescoes, statues and so much more! This is my favorite museum in Los Angeles area and because it is located in Malibu you will also have a gorgeous visit to the beach, too!Grab a bite to eat there or lunch along the beach!Be sure to make reservations on line for parking and entry time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jellybean51
50,Drcadabce,The place is purely decadent. What the ultra wealthy can do this money. The tours are great and the history is amazing. We spent one day there and only touched on the place. It was during the drought do the fountains were not on but the place was still beautiful.We could spent a few days there and not get bored.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/336anild
50,The Museum by the sea,"The Getty Villa is a beautiful museum to visit alone, with your partner, with friends or your kids.It is reminiscent of Pompeii and its grandiose era. The replica is quite spectacular and true to form.The exhibits range from media to artists especially to the villa itself like the architecture, the gardens, the eats & the shop.The parking is $15 per automobile, make a reservation for your vehicle. The entrance to the Villa is free!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livic2014
50,The grandeur of Pompeii (before Vesuvius),"The Getty Villa was inspired by one of the homes in Pompeii. Seeing the Villa, which houses J Paul Getty's collection of Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities, is like conducting a thought experiment about what those homes would have looked like, if they were brand new--lots of color, with columns and architectural details intact. The collections are well curated, and there are a number of special exhibits. The formal gardens are well executed, although the water features were turned off owing to California's drought. We liked the herb garden with its little fountain (decorated by Silenus riding a wineskin). All the plants are labeled with their scientific names. The Pompeii architecture is juxtaposed against some modern buildings, but they play off each other well. Seeing the Getty Villa is free, but one has to make reservations on line. You do have to pay for parking, Food at the Cafe is not cheap, but very good. Get a seat outdoors (under an umbrella) and enjoy the view and the scent of the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/247agnesq
30,small museum and garden,"Nice to walk through and enjoy the pools and gardens. Quick museum to get in and get out. To avoid PCH traffic, plan to go mid day. The gardens are beautiful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/texandallas
40,Amazing setting but watch your kids,"This place is so beautiful. All the flowers and the view of the ocean is breath taking. The art is making. We loved this place.Each room held different types of art work. But since the art is opened without ropes my kids ran around since this place does look like a park.This did not go well with the security in each room.There is a kids corner where there's coloring, booklets for scavengers hunts. and a large shadow screen where kids can act out shadow plays.But beyond this it was not suited for our 6&7 yr old. I'm sure your kids are well behaved and will stand still while I look at art pieces. But my kids are active and loud.I had to keep reminding my kids to behave. But soon the security just followed us to make sure my kids didn't destroy their art.We soon left. So we'll be back when they are older.Free to inside but parking cost a few dollars.Entrance is right off the street so it's easy to miss.The gate and trees hide this place really well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m1ke2angie
50,No water in the reflecting pools?,"We have been visiting the Getty Villa for years and were so disappointed to see the reflecting pools were dry. We realize there is a water shortage, but there is a point at which the beauty of the setting is compromised.We always call ahead to get a parking confirmation number and arrive at 10:00 AM at opening when the crowd are light. Guests are handed an agenda of daily events upon arrival and most of these take one hour and are fascinating. It is possible to see the entire villa in about two to three hours and the exhibits are well marked and quite fascinating especially to lovers of Greek and Roman art.We always plan to stay for lunch on the outside patio. You order the food inside at the café and the servers will bring it to your table. We highly recommend the tasty hamburgers served with an oil and vinegar dressed salad.The Getty Villa because of the location overlooking the Pacific Ocean has a marvelous atmosphere and is quite representative of the Malibu location at its best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patgammon

Be sure to get the audio guide as it augments the exhibits. (Free) And, the Getty Villa is also free, but you must get your tickets ahead of time. These are timed so that the museum does not feel crowded. All you pay for is the parking.

50,Outstanding cultural treasure of LA,Houses the Getty antiquities collection -- in the form of a Roman villa; beautiful site and facility - a great way to spend the day -- and the cafe on-site is wonderful. Reservations REQUIRED for parking on-site -- but admission is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimmySee
50,Beautiful displays,"Getty villa houses various ancient greek,etruscan,egyptian and roman artefacts.Mosaics,statuary,pottery etc. are well displayed in the beautiful villa and gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsM3853UC
50,The best Roman display's and antiquities since Spartacus!,"The California weather and the location of the Getty Villa was a match made in the heavens atop mount Olympus. The Getty Villa is located in Malibu California situated on the hillside running along world famous Highway 1 PCH. Reservations is a must and if possible try to go on the weekdays so you avoid the crowds (except for Tuesdays they're CLOSED). The Parking is $15 and admission is free so carpool if you can. The Getty Villa is not as big as the Getty Center (off the 405 fwy), but what it lacks in size it makes up for in beauty! Walking the grounds really makes you feel like you stepped back in time. This is most definitely a do not miss, I've lived in Southern California all my life and i don't know why i waited so long to visit the Villa. Bring a camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gython
50,Visiting on a weekday? Go in the afternoon (and bring a lunch if you want!),"Though I live in LA, I'd never visited the Getty Villa. So when my visiting family members from the East Coast expressed interest, we all went together on a sunny weekday in April. Though it's a fine place for kids, we didn't have any with us, and I wish I'd known how popular it is with school groups. It's louder and more crowded, of course, but by early afternoon, the kids have all left, so plan your visit for noon or later if you're going on a weekday for a more relaxed experience. We took two walking tours during our visit: the garden tour and the architecture tour. They're both 40 minutes long and given by volunteers, one of whom had been volunteering there SINCE 1978! Excellent, in-depth info on both tours. We brought our lunches in small backpacks not knowing there was a café on site. The café staff encouraged us to eat in their shaded tables even though we didn't buy anything from the café. Whoever says LA people are shallow and self-absorbed hasn't met these folks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ivanabhip
50,Beautiful,The building per-se is absolutely stunning. The expositions are impressive. I took a couple of the free tours and they were outstanding! The restaurant was well-priced and food was delicious. A wonderful place to spend the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RGN_7228
50,Simply Stunning!,"Our trip to the Getty Villa was a last minute decision. We were visiting another local attraction and both the weather and time of day made it extremely unappealing. So one of our group members suggested that we visit the Getty Villa. It was the best decision of the day! We could not believe that it was free, much less as beautiful as it was. I HIGHLY recommend this stop to anyone visiting L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCCDiva
40,Greek and Roman Revival,"A wonderful museum for those who are interested in antiquities,mythology, art history; or are not able to explore ancient Greece and Rome.There are life size statues of the mythical gods, friezes, tombs, jewelry, warrior helmets etc.... .Walk around the lavish grounds of gardens and fountains. There is a magnificent pool that leads up to the main building. Unfortunately, there was no water in it; because of the draught situation in the California.Enjoy the gift shop. snack court; or enjoy a nice meal at one of therestaurants along PCH.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatH854
50,Fabulous museum and gardens,"Even if you have only a passing interest in Greek and Roman antiquities, I can’t encourage you enough to visit the Getty Villa. It is modeled after a Roman Villa, with peristyle and gardens, and does a premier job of showcasing its collection. We went on a Monday morning so it wasn’t particularly crowded. Several things stood out for us: the gardens are a delight, featuring Mediterranean plants such as would have been grown around a real villa. The Museum shop has an excellent assortment of books and other items, including plenty for children. The children’s area (Family Experience) is particularly well done, with pottery to draw on, a clever shadow theater and outside one statue of Venus that you are welcome to touch and examine up close (NOT the main displays). The audio tour consists of your own iPod where you enter in a number to hear about a particular piece, and very well done. Best of all, its free (well, $12 for parking). Important to note that they meter the attendees by start times, so you need to order tickets that cost $0 on-line to preserve an arrival time. This isn’t an issue on a slow day, but matters on weekends/holidays. The Getty Villa is closed on Tuesdays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/52chips
50,A fine museum in a lovely location,"We stopped at the Getty Villa on our way north from Los Angeles and greatly enjoyed the wonderful antiquities and the peaceful garden. Although you have to pay $15 for parking, entrance to the museum is free, and at an effective cost of $7.50 for the two of us, considering what most major museums around the world charge (or ask for as a ""suggested contribution"") this was agreat bargain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adanacsim
50,Wonderful art and views,"This is the kind of place you go to just to see what wealth can buy. The tickets are free, although there is a parking fee. What's amazing is the art collection and the way the museum was designed to take advantage of amazing ocean views. It is breathtaking inside and out from start to finish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TotallyMadeUpHandle
40,Excellent museum,"This was our not-part-of-the-conference activity during a stay in February 2016. The weather was warm and pleasant, perfect for wandering the outdoor patios and gardens as well as the indoor exhibits. The artifacts and displays are organized and each room is labeled clearly with the category of the items in it along with facts and details of the items. One can take a tour or simply wander at will.The gift shop has a variety of options with a large range of prices and the clerks there were very helpful and courteous. The restaurant has an exquisite menu with prices that are on par with eateries at other attractions.I would be happy to visit here again if I am ever in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avidbeader
50,A must do if you are visiting the area,It is on my nickle tour from LAX to to my house in Santa Barbara for all visiting friends from abroad. It is a unique place and I highly recommend it when visiting the LA area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/summerlander
50,Top shelf museum destination,"The architecture, the landscaping, the extensive exhibits, stunning artwork, the audio tour - even the restaurant rocked! Absolutely fantastic place - so well put together and maintained. Really told a story. Make sure you make a free reservation online!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pbernard9
40,Nice idea,The place is a must for Southern European civilization aficionados. It's a replica of a cute Villa die Papiri in Naples. I would recommend to reserve timed tickets online - they are free. The introductory movie is not very appealing but you get a glimpse of why etruscan? The Gardens are beautiful and honestly we have to appreciate the effort to have local Neapolitan plants. A great place to indulge the ancient Mediterranean style.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aburel
40,Beautiful garden and interesting exhibits,We are so used to museums in NYC and this is not quite like other museums. But it has its own cozy feel with gardens and cultural exhibition. Photos look great here with all those greens.Nice little visit which doesn't take up too much time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rubymommy
10,Rude Staff,"As we were staying in the local neighbourhood we thought we would visit the Getty as part of our vacation and parked on the road near the entrance.Having already booked our tickets online we thought it would be just a case of walking in and catching the shuttle bus. How wrong could we be. We were greeted by the man on the entrance as if we'd just arrived from a different planet. How rude and unhelpful he was, ordering us to go in another gate, sit until we were called and that we should have a blue card if we lived in the neighbourhood. He didn't really give us chance to explain that we were staying with family as he was more interested in throwing his weight around.When the shuttle bus arrived the driver was no better. He was also rude and couldn't understand why we didn't have a blue card. What a big fuss over nothing when it's free to get in and we also had printed tickets online. The issue seemed to be that we had arrived on foot and weren't paying the $15 parking fee.Inside the museum wasn't any better either. When we tried to enter the auditorium to view a film about the history of the Getty museum we were again rudely told that it had already started, was full anyway and that it would be another nine minutes until we could watch it.My suggestion for the Getty Trust is to have all staff go on a customer services course where they learn some manners and how to treat people with respect.Our day was ruined by the staff and we won't return any time soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/508MikeW508
50,One of the best collections of antiquities in the world,"Come here with time to linger. The collection is stupendous, right up there with what you find in Rome and the Louvre. The interpretive materials help bring the ancient world to life. And it's all packaged in a replica of an ancient villa from Pompeii, making a perfect setting for the jewels in this collection.Admission if free, but parking costs $15 and there is really no feasible way to park nearby and walk. The only other option is to cab or Uber it to the gate and walk the rest of the way in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Insouciant1
50,Perfect Half Day,"Absolutely amazing collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities! Gorgeous formal gardens and lovely herb garden. (Currently, garden ponds are empty due to drought.) A very special place, even the kids loved it. Food is good. Nice staff! Only unfortunate is that it was funded by oil money!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inspirationg
40,Beautiful gardens Excellent special exhibits,"We thought the Getty Villa was a wonderful way to spend part of a day. We spent 3 hours during which we visited the 4 gardens, the two special exhibits, took the architecture tour, and quickly wandered through all the rest of the museums rooms. You could easily spend several more hours if you go on more of the available tours and/or take more time to look at all of the art.A big thank you to the Getty Foundation for making this affordable (no entrance fee and $15 car parking).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/booptraveler
40,A Wonderful Place to Visit on a Sunny Day,"FIRST - Get your tickets BEFORE YOU GO (tickets are free, parking is $15). We were lucky - got tickets at the gate, but they limit entry.SECOND - There will be UGLY TRAFFIC, especially in the afternoon.Now that those items are out of the way, the museum was both magnificent and yet somehow not enough. The grounds are beautiful, covered with Mediterranean plants common 2000 years ago. The buildings are magnificent. The items on display are wonderful and intriguing.But I have two complaints. First, there is not enough. You see some great items, but there are really not that many galleries. I know there are limits, but I did left wanting to see more.Second complaint is that while this is supposed to be a villa from about 50BC, I'd like to know what rooms were what. Where would the senator have met his clients and had dinner with his guests? Where was the kitchen, and what did they make? Where would people sleep? Maybe I missed it, but just a little plaque in room would have been nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baldmongoose
50,Educate yourself while enjoying the art and the Villa grounds,"Focus of this Getty museum is on antiquities from the Roman and Greek periods with the villa and its grounds modeled after one found while excavating a cite near Mt Vesuvius. The gardens are pleasant and a relaxing environment though the water features( pools and fountains) are not functional because of the drought in CA. Several self- guided tours available for a fee, though there are also staff members staged at various locations to provide insights upon request. A restaurant area is situated on the second level(many tables outside) if you want to eat during visit. There is an $11 parking fee to enter the grounds. While admission is free... a reservation is required or you will not get through security.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichG531
50,Simply perfect for any occasion: always flawless experiance,"We have been going to Getty Villa for 8 years now. Once my child was born I started taking her there for a simple walk around the gorgeous garden.The staff is very helpful and always kind: they have free wheelchairs, strollers available. Once we had to wait in line to get to a parking lot- they waived us parking fee of $15 ( I didn't ask for that!).There is a great family room for kids to play with: multiple vases to paint on, toys to play with, a shadow theater. Very hands on. My three year old loves it!There is one coffee shop and one restaurant: at times gets busy but always worth the wait. Fresh and affordable.Be aware: you need to get free tickets ahead of time on-line and only pay for parking $15. The tickets are timed but you have one hour frame to get.In summer they organize ""greek"" style theater shows that are pricey but worth it. Very unusual and well staged.Multiple free workshops around the year for web site subscribers too.Our n. 1 place to got to get some fresh air and enjoy peace and quiet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Veronika8000
50,Unique!,"Getty Villa is an absolutelly uncommon museum. Located in a a breath taking enviroment in front of the Pacific Ocean. Make sure you schedule an appointment before you go, otherwise you won´t be able to get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosaide70
50,A Roman Villa replication of about 2000 years ago-Wonderful!,"This museum has much roman and greek statuary and art. The art goes back sometimes to 200 BC. Not only was the art fabulous, the grounds, the floors, the herb garden replicating an ancient Roman Villa (of an aristocrat) back in the time of Christ or before was really amazing. I would go back again in a heartbeat. This is a really must not miss opportunity if you are interested in Romans or Greeks at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valerier216
30,Saturday afternoon culture fix,"We had not been here for a decade or so and decided to grab some California culture. It's a lovely setting with tremendous history thanks to JP Getty. Reservations are a must to get in and it's free. Parking in an underground lot is $15.00. We started with a group tour that lasted 45 minutes. There are two: the Architecture and Garden tours to choose from. We enjoyed the Architecture tour as our guide was quite knowledgable and informative. Each person is given a headset for better listening. Since California is still enduring a water issue, the pools and fountains are dry. Lots of Roman-Greco antiquities with a side of Egyptian. You have places to stroll or sit and relax. It's a must see museum for locals and certainly out of towners/tourists. Outside dining is available and there are concerts in September in the outdoor arena. It's not an all day visit as you can thoroughly get your culture fix in about 3 hours. Go see it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/264kenf
50,Gorgeous Getty Villa,"For a wonderful look into the lifestyles of the rich and famous head to the Getty Mansion in beautiful Malibu. What a treat! Take the docent tours for the architecture and gardens and learn all a out the venue, but most of all, enjoy a terrific historic review of J.Paul Getty and the Roman influence on his life. The displays are tastefully displayed and since appointments are made online it is never overcrowded. As with the museum, admission is free, but parking is $15.00. If you want to do both venues on the same day there is just one parking charge. However, this would be cheating yourself as both places are best done at a relaxed pace and LA traffic can be a challenge. Take 2 days...and savor the experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857mkl
40,Lovely grounds!,"Visiting the Getty Villa is a lovely way to spend a chunk of the day. I especially appreciated the layout and design of the museum; make sure you watch the introductory film when you get there to understand the design elements. The art is all antiquities, which is not my favorite art, but it's still worth a visit. You have to make reservations in advance; the visit is free and parking is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abh345678
30,It was ok,"Upon driving into The Getty Villa we were stopped by a security guard asking us for tickets. Silly me - I thought you could by tickets at the entrance of a museum.I was scolded for not checking their website to see their times and download the free tickets to enter the museum. After my scolding she pulled out two free tickets and gave them to me. Then there was a 20 minute wait to go up the short driveway and pay my $15 in cash to park my car.We arrived at 3.05pm. The cafe was closed. The villa has nice views and a few artifacts, but overall I was disappointed.Aside from a map, there seemed to be no tour and very little information. The staff are unfriendly and seemed quite inconvenienced that we were there.There are more fun and exciting things to do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadiag0610
50,Nice Museum!,"Had a nice day at the Getty villa, they offer an architectural and a garden tour but for lack of time I only took the architectural tour (40 mins).The guide was very friendly and knowledgable. The museum is well organized and well preserved. It's worth the visit!. Entrance is free but you still need to go to their website to select time and date to book your entry tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Margaragomezm
50,Yes! I like it,I am an architect and this creation of a villa from Roman times was an idea from someone with a lot of money. Then? Well go and have a great idea how was one of that villas. The collection is impressive. You have to make a reservation online. Early in the morning is better. Lunch there a must!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpC6878JH
50,Classical Art and Tuscan Lunch,"My husband and I are both art lovers - and this museum is both an architectural, horticultural, and classical art wonder! It is small and easy to do in less than 2 hours. We both studied Latin in high school and enjoyed the architectural tour (40 min). It focuses on life in ancient Roman villas. The only downside of the tour was that the headsets weren't always reliable to hear the guide.We also ate a fantastic lunch in the museum cafe. The fare was a bit pricey but well worth it. I highly recommend the peasant bread!We then enjoyed a walk back through the gardens. Although I was disappointed that the fountains were drained to conserve water, it was still a beautiful stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcast27
50,"Amazing, must see for art enthusiasts","Incredible home in the hills of Malibu, all for the price of parking, amazingly low cost high return day in LA. Getty's Italian & Grecian treasures fill the villa ...like a trip to the Mediterranean. Lovely architecture, great self tour, nice restaurant on site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindawR9945MK
50,Excellent small museum,"My husband and I prefer smaller museums and The Getty Villa is one of the best. We saw an excellent exhibit on Ancient Glass and the objects in the permanent collection were interesting as well. The place itself is quite an attraction: beautiful gardens and setting to explore, sit and enjoy. There were numerous thematic tours to join: I've never seen a museum with such expertly guided theme tours. We also ended up doing the Tea (which you have to book ahead of time usually) and it made the whole thing a day-long super treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaRae
50,Great outing at amazing venue,The Getty Villa/Museum was a great side trip for us. We had already booked into Tea by the Sea online which is high tea using herbs grown in their own garden. (Only on Thursday and Saturday at 1pm). This was delightful but you must book ahead. The entry ticket to Tea by the Sea is your entry ticket to the Villa/Museum so no need to buy separate timed entry tickets.After tea we went through the fascinating displays in the museum. Greatly informative and well laid out. The surrounding gardens are beautiful and well tended. Currently because of the drought conditions most water features are not operating but you can still enjoy the view.Definitely worth a visit and not too far by car/uber from Santa Monica where we were staying.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolynL6
50,Unique architectural setting for antiquities,"Getty designed and built this this site to replicate an ancient Roman country villa, modelled after one that was unearthed during excavations of Herculaneum, which was once buried in the lava flows resulting from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The architecture is stunning and each exhibit of ancient antiquities is set, like a jewel, within a specially designed space. Be sure to look up frequently as some of the most beautiful details are in the lushly decorated ceilings. Surrounding the hardscape, is an extensive Roman style garden. The at armosphere is user friendly and serene. We had lunch at the cafe, overlooking the amphitheater and found the food to be inventive and very fresh, with a Mediterranean flair. It was a very,very enjoyable visit and I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrowzjones
50,"Beautiful grounds, excellent examples of Greco Roman art","The Villa was very well done. A true copy of a Villa in the ancient Italian countryside, the architecture was well done as well as the gardens. The art exhibited inside was also beautifully displayed throughout the villa. I believe if you enjoy Roman/Etruscan and Greek art and you are in the area it is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wyattalanc
50,A Local Jewel,The Getty Villa really is a local gem and a spot of solitude and beauty in Malibu. It's quaint enough to give you a real feel of vintage Malibu and what drew so many years ago to escape the city and enjoy the country. The permanent and traveling exhibitions are always a treat and their attention to provide a top notch collection is always appreciated. To have such a treasure left to the public to enjoy is extraordinary. Visit soon and take your time and enjoy The Bu at it's finest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422sh
50,Gorgeous,"Visited The Getty on one of my last trips to the area. You can't beat the beautiful views from The Getty. I recommend this to anyone visiting the area! Being an Italy, Greece and Europe in general aficionado, I was especially in love, but I feel that anyone could/would appreciate the splendor!Take the family, go with friends, or alone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/auntrah
50,Dont just visit the Getty - make a trip to the Getty Villa.,one of my favorite places in LA. Stunning - make the effort to make a reservation in advance. worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheriB444
50,"When in Malibu, You Must Do the Getty.","Fantastic. The most tasteful, well organized museum/art gallery I have been to.My recommendations:1. Make a reservation. 2. Get there when it opens. 3. Plan to eat in the cafe. 4. Make sure to hit the herb garden. Dont rush.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonsZ5078MT
50,Great museum,"I was surprised at the amount of Greek and Roman antiquities housed within this museum. This collection alone would rival any of the best museums in the US.The focus of the museum is clearly toward ancient Greece and Rome. Room after room of busts, sculpture, and other ancient artifacts fill this museum. There's also an extensive collection of European items (including art) that shouldn't be missed either.The courtyard and surrounding gardens are also fantastic, and fortunately the weather in southern California is accommodating enough to allow for outdoor touring year-round. If you want to grab a picture or two, you can do so without too much risk of other tourists constantly photobombing you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F2826XGjasont
50,Favorite from gettys,Make sure you make a reservation for the Getty villa. Unlike Getty center they require a reservation. You will love the collection and the view from the balcony.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/535sala
40,Beautiful and a must see,"Fabulous gardens, art and collectibles. Great history and worth a visit. Nice for families with older kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tessalovestravel
40,Europe in California,"The Getty Villa is a gorgeous escape from the Hollywood hustle and bustle. Overlooking the ocean in idyllic Malibu, the museum is worth visiting for the gardens alone. Take a picnic and hang out in the amphitheater, browse the artwork and feel transported to Greece or Italy. A great date place or for a family visit. Make sure to check out the theater schedule- watching plays performed in the amphitheater at night is truly memorable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrueTravels321
50,A wonderful museum,You should plan to spend a good part of the day as there is just so much to see. Do not fail to take a guided tour of the grounds and they are very nice and have a rich history. The on-site restaurant is good and competitively priced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JOBfromAK
50,I liked the Greek and Rome sculptures and the view,The Getty Villa is memorial Attraction with its Italian marble floors and the authnetic Greek poetry. The Villa is well taken care of and the tour last less than an hour.You can stand on the balcony and overlook the European garden below and see the ocean beyond. The bronze statute of David was smaller than I expected.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davepamn
50,Amazing Location,"Great place for a visit, free entry though you do need to book in advance, lots to see all in an amazing setting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cjguk
50,"Lovely location, easy parking, great collection.","To be honest, I love the Villa for its location regardless of its collections. It's an easy drive off PCH, easy parking and with wonderful ocean views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danv32
40,Nice - view is good,"The location along Pacific Coast Highway is nice and the villa is impressive. The exhibits are greek and roman - mainly statues, parts of buildings, jewelry and pottery. I personally find the exhibits a little redundant after awhile and it is a little sad that relics were scavenged from around the world from historic sites. Would definitely recommend this as a side trip if you are going to be around Santa Monica or Malibu. Don't confuse this with the Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/costaricagregg
50,A magical interlude,"It's amazing what a shed load of money and a vivid imagination can do, and this villa is one of those things. Wonderful of itself, and filled with some of the greatest art in the ancient world",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charlieat103
50,one of the best outing spots for tourists or locals alike in LA,"I have been to Getty Villa a few times already. It is still not disappointing. Although to conserve water, the fountain is not running nowadays, at least I assume so. But the garden, architecture, and surrounding ocean view are always impressive. The collection is ever more spectacular. Although it is not huge, it is certainly of highest calibre of its genre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Madeleineshi
50,Perfect way to spend an afternoon,"The architecture of the Getty Villa is amazing. From the house itself to the pool and grounds, it really was built to showcase the art and sculptures. The sweeping views of Malibu and the Pacific Ocean are just breath taking! But plan ahead - you must get tickets in advance. Well worth it! A true gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillTravel4Goetta
50,As excellent as ever and superb value for money,"We visited for the first time in 5 years with a friend who's as into antiquities as I am. Neither of us was disappointed. Beautifully organised and timed (planned parking slots = no lines and space to view the exhibits and enjoy the gardens). Though disappointing not to see the water features at their best, I applaud their decision to withhold all but those features that support life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ESB-UK
50,A Fabulous Antiquities Collection,"The villa is a reproduction of a Roman villa as planned and built by J. Paul Getty to house his antiquities collection. The entry is free but tickets are required so order them online early, don't expect to go there and get in. You will have to pay for parking but if you go to the Getty Center as well on the same day the parking fee will be for both places even though they are miles apart. The collection of antiquities rivals some of the museums I have been to in Rome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Texhusky75
50,Stunning,"Gorgeous! Lots of interactive tours for kids. Free admission with a $15 parking fee, but an advance, timed-entry ticket is required. The collection is outstanding, but the architecture is worth the trip alone. Umbrellas are provided to shade you from the sun outdoors. Our family expected to spend a couple hours there and ended up staying until closing. All the employees are knowledgeable and helpful. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/992elizabetht
50,"Lovely location, huge collection.",The Villa sits up on a hill overlooking the ocean and the building and grounds are beautiful. Even if you aren't into Greek/Roman artifacts go and spend time there. It's very relaxing. The gardens are labeled so you can tell what the trees and plants are. The collections are amazing with everything from a mummy to ancient glass to statues and on and on. It really could take days to look at everything. It's free to get in (timed ticket) but parking costs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyCampersNH
50,"Exceptional collection, well-labeled and arranged and it is free","If one plans on driving, one must telephone ahead in order to reserve a parking place because space is limited. There is absolutely no admission fee and one can enjoy both the permanent collection (mostly Greek and Roman art with one gallery devoted to Egyptian art--a real mummy and lots of exceptionally fine ""mummy portraits"") and whatever temporary loan exhibition is on at the time. The works of art are exquisite, they are well presented and labeled and there is a ""discovery gallery"" for younger audiences. And you can take all of the photographs you like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/590bobb
50,Outstanding - not to be missed - experience!,"This is one of those - not to be missed - museum properties. I truly wished I had scheduled more time to be able to enjoy the multiple tours available throughout the day. Such a beautiful, relaxing, highly educational experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J6738YMjeanc
50,"Beautiful views of the ocean, and ancient sculptures.","Many people visit the Getty Museum when in LA, but should also make time to see the Getty Villa, which is on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. I first visited the Villa many years ago as a teenager and recall the beautiful setting and sculptures. Today, the facility has been modernized, updated and expanded, so it doesn't resemble the museum it was 30-40 years ago. It is best to try to arrive early when it opens and beat the crowds. You can make reservations in advance. We took a chance and were able to go early without reservations and had no problem. There is a very nice collection of sculpture which spans from pre-Greco-Roman to the end of the Roman empire. Also, there is a nice collection of glass objects, which is not to be missed.

50,One of My Favorite Museums,"My wife and I live in Northern California but have visited the Getty Villa four times in about 35 years. It is a very beautiful museum in a beautiful setting completely filled with Greco-Roman antiquities. The Villa and the gardens are authentically patterned after a villa in Herculaneum owned by Cesar's father in law which was buried by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in Sicily. It has been tastefully developed over the years so it now has adequate parking, a good cafe and a large open entertainment area. The cafe menu is quite good. The personnel and docents are very friendly and knowledgeable. We spent two full days there this time, and will never cease to enjoy the villa. Anyone interested in antiquities should not miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TJFLG42
50,An Absolute Must See for Anyone Who Likes Art and History,"This is a serenely beautiful museum perched on the bluff overlooking the ocean in Malibu, just west and slightly north of LA proper. It is designed to reproduce an Italian villa from the Roman era and houses one of the finest collections of ancient art in existence. There are beautiful pieces from the Cyclides (the islands east of the Greek mainland that in 3000 BC were the precursors of Western civilization and the collection continues through the Roman Empire. I have seen a lot of Greek pottery over the years but nothing that can match this. The superb quality of the pieces and the explanations of them helps you to understand the interest in this art form. The sculptures are amazing and the museum is beautifully organized so that you get a real sense of Greek and Roman civilization. While we were there, there was an ancient glass exhibit that was wonderful with great short videos to show how pieces were made. There is a lot here but it is possible to look at a lot of it within a 90-120 minute period. The overall setting of the museum with beautifully maintained grounds and gardens is lovely and worth a trip by itself. The cafeteria is excellent. I would consider going in the afternoon. This is a popular place but a lot of the visitors had disappeared by around 3:30. You do need to make reservations in order to park there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimtons
50,Beautiful!,"Not only is this a beautiful exhibit of antiquities, but the grounds and architecture are amazing. There is a lovely cafe with outdoor seating and tasty refreshments. Highly recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dannlin
50,"Such stunning Surroundings, Exhale And Relax Here","This museum is a peaceful and relaxing day to be sure of. From the moment you pull in you are in this hidden world, almost a peaceful retreat. The museum is laid out both indoors and outdoors with various wings filled with artifacts. You can sit outside for a while and look at the sun glistening on the Pacific Ocean.Deer were just walking on the hillside grazing. You must have reservations to go to the Villa. Parking isn't cheap but admission is no charge so go and see it. I learned a few things today and that is always a good thing! You are never too old to learn something new!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovetogoCalabasas
50,Hidden gem!,"I didn't know about the Getty Villa as I planned for my trip to the LA, because it is out in Malibu, but it is definitely worth the trip! Remember to ask for a free multimedia player, which plays really entertaining audio commentaries of some of the important art pieces in the exhibition.When I went there the fountains' water were drained away because of the LA drought, which was a pity, because it would be a very nice addition to the beautiful landscape and architectural structure.Definitely a must-see for classical/ancient history/art lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emmabearx
50,Authentic,This property is an authentic reproduction of a Roman villa and is a terrific place to visit on a sunny California day.

50,Great day with my college son!,"We had the BEST tour guide for the architectural tour on Saturday around 11:30 am. The museum is so wonderful, and we enjoyed every minute.

50,Beauty in the Big City,"The Getty is a very nice stop to take a walk, enjoy architecture, see so many interesting pieces of history, enjoy the garden, eat lunch on sight and spend a good 4-5 hours.

50,"Incredible story, property, gardens, museum. DO NOT MISS IT!",The Getty Villa is one of a kind - developed and built by JP Getty to house and display his extensive collection of antiquities. His vision for the villa is astounding - situated in the hillside overlooking Malibu. Designed to replicate an ancient villa. You must make a reservation as they control how many people are onsite at a time. Admission is free but parking is $15. Accessible by elevators or stairs. Be sure to get the free audio tour headset for a more comprehensive tour. Lovely café with seating both indoor and outdoor.

Also for locals - subscribe to the Getty Newsletter as they schedule plays, informative lectures and classes each month.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lotusdipper
40,Lovely afternoon walk through the gardens,"The villa has beautiful foliage and views of the ocean. It is incredible that Getty built this for tourists - what a wonderful gift to the world. I really enjoyed the garden tour, which helped me to better understand how gardens were centric to the Italian lifestyle and how much more connected people were to the medicinal properties of herbs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irispiral
40,Stunning & tranquil,Loved the architecture & grounds. So clean & beautiful. The artefacts were well presented & made an interesting mornings visit. There was just a car parking fee & if you go to the Getty Centre in the same day you pay no more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mavwag
40,Young student day,"There were perhaps 15 groups of school children visiting the Villa on the Friday morning we were there. On one hand we were delighted that the children were getting the exposure of Italian and Greek antiquities. On the other hand, their exuberance and the total number of groups at one time really overwhelmed the museum and making it difficult for other visitors to focus on the exhibts. The grounds are beautiful. It was worth the visit. I would like to go back when there weren't quite so many youngsters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332ThomasS
50,World class museum and grounds,"The Getty Villa was built in 1970 to house J Paul Getty's antiquities collection in a magnificent building modeled on a Roman villa. There are two floors, several gardens, and a courtyard with pool, which, unfortunately, due to drought was dry. A restaurant and amphitheater complete the public facilities, but there are several buildings dedicated to private research as well. A world class resource for Classical Greek and Roman art. Admission is free, but parking is $15, and requires a reservation-use the website. Access is from PCH northbound only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerrillC_12
40,Beautiful yet missing the chadar feature!,"Granted I am cognizant that there is a drought, but the Getty Villa is without lustre due to its missing cascading water feature ""the chadar"" and the centerpiece fountain. These features make this place simply gorgeous and almost magical when flowers are also in bloom after being inside and viewing the antiquities. My family still enjoyed their first visit and it was a sunny and cool day. The Roman and Greek antiquities bored them but I enjoyed perusing them - I appreciate the refinement, artistry and history. However, the architecture fascinated them. And who wouldn't? I highly recommend but do remember to order your tickets online before visiting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeaceINdance
50,A walk through Antiquity,"Incredible recreation of a Roman Villa filled with Roman and Greek antiquities. Beautiful gardens and architecture take you to another place in time. Well done, short introductory video gives helpful context. Stunning views of the Pacific Ocean. Wonderful way to spend an afternoon for those who enjoy that period in history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariew702
50,Perfect day!,"First of all, if you are visiting remebr you MUST go one the website and get ""tickets"" for entry beforehand. They want to have a controlled number of people coming in at the beginning of every hour. If you choose to arrive at 3pm you MUST be there before 4pm.Malibu, first of all is just gorgeous! Then if I am able to visit the private residence and admire the collection of J Paul Getty; I'm in! We came here December 31st. Weather was perfect and sunny. The collection here is mostly focused on Greco-Roman art. The house looks ancient Roman as well. Lots of beautiful marble from all over the planet. It was a short visit maybe 1.5 hours, but it was worth it. I love seeing the homes of historical figures. The Garden was perfectly manicured of course and a great place for a stroll and fun photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saraho341
40,Cultural viewing with scenery,"If you are driving north out of LA, one of the spots to see is the The Getty Villa. It is just a 20 minute ride out of LA. You need to make reservations prior but, as I found, showing up at the gate, being pleasant, does get you in right away. It's a definite must to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericdS2777AC
50,"A Perfect Afternoon of Art, Culture & Beauty.","The Getty Villa will amaze you with not just the incredible outdoor location overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu, but the art and style of this museum. We really enjoyed the water fountain, the view and all the original art pieces and statues. They have excellent guided tours & the food is great, they even serve Italian beer! It is a perfect day activity for anyone who appreciates both Art and the outdoors. I would recomend to bring confortable shoes and a water bottle & hat if visiting in summer.

50,Most Beautiful Museum in the World? Maybe.,"The lush setting, the elevated site, the beautiful gardens and the refined architecture make for a uniquely sensual experience. My husband and I were struck especially by the authentic re-creation of a classical Roman villa. Every detail, marbles of different colours sourced from all over the world, inricately patterned floors - all demonstrate the extraordinary precision and attention to detail in the magical place. Getty loved antiquities and was an avid collector. Although he was an ex-patriot living in England, he envisioned and then commissioned the creation of this villa in California. He apparently never visited it. It was opened to the public in 1974, two years before he died but he may have been too old to travel then. What an exquisite treasure! The collection iof antiquities is fantastic, with excellent extended labels and arranged thematically. There were free tours - we went on the architecture tour which included the gardens. Everything free. There is simply no other place like this in the world. And, perhaps no museum more beautiful and cohesive. A memorable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoniqueW502
40,New Getty Villa-Museum has lost its original charm....,"I first saw the original Getty Villa over 30 years ago - and loved its ""small museum"" charm recapitulating the Villa Papyri at Herculaneum. It was closed for 10y and reopened in 2006. Its original entrance was much like entering a real villa - now the expanded Villa is more like a commercial space with a proper museum entrance, a cafe, a multilevel garage, and auditorium. The magic is gone, but the interior space and garden are still impeccably maintained as this is the wealthiest museum complex in the US. The current major exhibit is the watercolors of Edward Dodwell and his companion Simone Pomardi whose style is more like early photorealism - they visited Greece in 1805-06. The museum's collection of Roman, Greek and Etruscan marbles and artifacts are still excellent and the gardens are beautiful with a great view of the ocean from an overlook at the end of the garden. The cafe serves good food though the outdoor setting and decor can be improved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/117remyd

50,Beautiful,"Was able to make a reservation by phone the same day. Located right off the highway with a good size parking garage, which costs $15, but the villa itself is free. Took the garden tour, even in Jan it was very interesting and informative. There is also an architecture tour that I would like to take, next visit. Ate lunch outside looking out at the ocean. A very relaxing and lovely stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MOBX
40,Finally made it here!,"Drove past this place dozens of times while I lived in Southern California, and finally visited now that I live in the NorthWest!! Definitely a gem, though Greek and Roman antiquities are not my favorite art form. The buildings themselves, modeled after a Pompeiian villa, are worth the visit, even though the fountains and pools are empty because of drought.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azzure
50,Exceptional Museum and Environment,"John Paul Getty was not only one of the richest men in the world, he was also incredibly interested in the art and culture of the ancient Greek and Roman world. The Getty Villa in Malibu reflects his desire to recreate the atmosphere of a Roman Villa, not as a ruin, but as it would have appeared at the height of the empire.This idea works stunningly well in Mediterranean climate in the hills of Malibu just off the Pacific Coast Highway.The admission to the Getty Villa is free but you will need to reserve a time for your visit on-line. You will also need to pay for parking in the private lot. There are NO places to park a car on the street in this exclusive neighborhood. Access from the PCH is restricted to only the right-hand lane heading northbound from Santa Monica to Malibu.The museum is a visual delight. Not only the Greek and Roman art, the building itself and the grounds are photo-worthy is every direction. We spent more than 2 hours here and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorM
50,Continuity of excellence.,"J. Paul Getty would have been extremely proud to see his legacy strive and blossom in this sprawling ancient Italian replica. The organization it takes to keep a place like this running so efficiently is mind blowing. The villa sits yards away from civilization. Yet feels like millenias away. It is my recommendation that if you love architecture, history, art, or antiquities that this museum be on your to do list at least twice a year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/834emada
50,Gorgeous,"Amazing collection! Stunning setting overlooking the Pacific. Reminded me of a recent visit to the Alhambra in Spain, but on a MUCH smaller scale.

There were tons of interesting artworks to see, and the gorgeous grounds and architecture made it all even more enjoyable.

50,Unlike anything else in America,"The Getty Villa, along with the nearby Getty Center, are among the great museums of the world and should be at the top of any visitors list while in Los Angeles.The quality and vastness of the displayed collections is staggering, the buildings and gardens, the legacy of Mr Getty, are unique in America.Plan ahead as reservations are required, take the whole day and don't rush, eat at the wonderful cafe and enjoy a feast for the soul.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Konishki
40,Interesting Greek and Roman art,"While the views and gardens aren't as magnificent as the Getty Center, the Getty Villa is Italian-themed and features mostly Greek and Roman exhibitions. It's also smaller, but much less crowded.My favorite area is the main courtyard with the large fountain (although with no water in it due to the California drought on my visit) and a view of the ocean.Although the admission is free, you have to reserve your tickets online and print them out to get in. Parking is $15, and the museum is closed on Tuesdays.We went on a Saturday afternoon, and exiting the complex took a very long time due to the long line of cars. The stoplight allowing people back onto the Pacific Coast Highway only lets a few cars turns onto the street at a time, so it took about 20 minutes to finally get out of there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daniko8

50,A taste of Italy,"If you have never been to Italy this gives you an idea what its like.

The place is by reservation online, museum is free parking $15 per car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimmyJackk
50,A visit here is definitely worth your time.,"We were visiting from the St. Louis area and our host and hostess who live in Culver City brought us to visit the Getty Villa. Our docent, Mandy, was extremely informed and quite entertaining. She definitely brought us back in time. The art and grounds are spectacular. We arrived around 3pm and really needed more time to enjoy all of the rooms of art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosaleeE
50,Great Cultural Gem,"The Getty Villa is a cultural gem in the Los Angeles area. Please be aware that advanced reservations are required, but they can be made on-line. There is no admission charge to visit the Villa but there is a $15 parking fee. Considering the overall experience, $15 is an absolute bargain for this experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VetteGuy
40,Beautiful Gardens and architecture,"We began our descent to Pacific Palisades to tour the Getty Villa at 10AM. Because the Getty Villa was closed on Tuesdays, I had ordered our timed $15 parking tickets for Wednesday (very important to order ahead). Like the Getty Center, the museum itself is free. And like the Getty Center, the water was turned off on almost all the fountains due to the severe drought in CA.We took a tour of the beautiful Italianate villa constructed by oil magnate J. Paul Getty in 1974 because his home that previously housed his art collection, became too small to house everything. The villa was originally designed in 1968 to represent the famous Villa dei Papiri, a Roman country house in Herculaneum destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. This same villa was renovated in the mid ‘90s and finally in 2006 now exhibits Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities in its Roman inspired architecture and grounds. We took a tour of the beautiful gardens and detailed interiors but I do think we could have spent much less time at this museum than we did. I would safely say 2 hours is plenty of time vs a whole day at the Getty Center. The lunch food was cafeteria style at the villa and the selection was nothing that we cared for so we left to look for food elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kelleygirl2
50,"I like the tours and the building and gardens, not the art as much","The Getty Villa is a truly beautiful place. As you drive to the Villa, you see the beautiful coast and water, and the sunset when you leave. The Villa itself is beautiful, and my favorite part is the architecture and the gardens, which we saw again this time. I liked the tour of the highlights of the collection but we only saw four things and I was hoping to see at least eight things. There is very nice map to use and a self guided tour. We stayed from 10:30 to close and didn't really have enough time to see it all, but other people were gone after 2 hours. If you only look at the art, you could do it that fast. I don't really have a passion for the art here, also known as antiquities. I call them bowls and broken statues. That being said, these are the absolute BEST bowls and broken statues you will ever ever ever see. For me, the building and the gardens are truly the highlight. I heard the restaurant was good but I did not eat there. The gift shop had beautiful things for very reasonable prices, I could not believe it. Lots of people were making purchases because it was not overpriced like most shops. You have to go here, at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere
40,Mediterranean Beauty next to the Pacific,"This small but impressive recreation of a Roman villa used to house the Getty Art Collection before the Getty Center was constructed above Brentwood. It was closed for a few years while it was restored and reimagined to house the Getty's Greek, Roman and Etruscan art and antiquities collection. A gigantic car park was constructed and it can be a walk but it is worth it. The architects who reimagined the building saw the walk as the pathway leading to an archeological dig in which the villa and its neighboring amphitheater were ""unearthed"". Inside the museum you will find a lovely herb garden with statues that have haunting solid white eyes. There are plenty of historical treasures to discover. For children, there is an exceptional children's room with hands-on exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bruinjeepman

50,Beautiful Collections and Location,"Make sure you make a free reservation and print your tickets out before going. It's kind of difficult to get to, as you can only make the turn in from the northbound side of the PCH. The tickets are free, but parking is not. There is a cafe with some slightly pricey, yet large and delicious selections. The Villa has terrific collections and outdoor fountains, gardens, etc. Even if you are not a history buff or into that, you can just go enjoy the beauty of the place. There are also guided tours available. It was a very enjoyable way to spend a lovely afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellesA5885WD

40,Very Beautiful!!!,"I put ""Getty Villa"" on Google Map and it led us to the wrong entrance; therefore, I suggest whoever want to use Google Map to go there put the exact address in it. Getty Vila is FREE but you have to make a reservation in advance. (Parking is not free.) There are a lot of parking lots in the parking building. There is a video airing in the main building. This video will make you understand more about Getty Villa. There are many pretty paintings and decorations in different buildings and gardens. There is one mummy in the Villa too. Compare to Getty Center, Getty Villa is smaller but more elegant and has few people. It's a good place to relax and get some fresh air!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJessica522
50,Amazing property and collection,"The Getty Villa is a modern recreation of the remains of a Roman villa in Herculaneum that was buried by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. It has lavish courtyards, mosaics and gardens that truly evoke a sense of what these ancient estates were like, as well as providing amazing views of the Pacific Ocean. A recent renovation and addition is integrated nicely in the original property.The Villa also houses a terrific collection of ancient art that includes 5,000 year old Cycladic figurines and Greek and Roman-era statues, ceramics, coins, jewelry and an amazing collection of decorative glass objects in several dozen galleries.A number of tours are offered, including tours based on the architecture, the gardens and the collection itself. We took an architecture tour that was quite good.Admission is free, but parking costs $15. Also, there is limited access to the property and it gets very crowded and backed up within a few hours after it opens, so it's better to get tickets in advance and arrive early. It's definitely worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brend482
50,Must see,"We typically set asise no more than 2 1/2 hours for any museum. A perfect amount of time to see what you'd like and not get over stimulated/burned out. Beautiful grounds, buildings and art/artifacts/sculptures indoor and out. Make sure you find the statue of Venus that you are encouraged to touch. Beautiful herb garden. Be sure to visit the gift shop: I don't know any other museum you can buy a lavender, olive or rosemary plant to grow in your own garden! It was great to see all the trees and plants we wish we could grow (or grow year round) at home; lemon, citron, pomegranate, rosemary, borage, etc. Free admission with purchase of parking. The parking garage opens at 9:30am. We enjoyed being the third car there. Worth being the early bird.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Milwaukee6567

We went in December, so that the gardens were not as lovely as they might be, but the setting was still gorgeous.

50,"Fabulous collection, grerat architecture, nice views","The Getty is one of my favorite places in California, it is, in fact, one of my favorite museums in the world. Their antiquties collection is amazing, the architecture, views... all wonderful. I think I like the old Getty more in terms of ambience, architecture. Love the medeival gardens!The new Getty has a much larger collection, but it is a less intimate setting and less authentic (as the old villa had been moved over brick by brick). Still, the collection is fabulous and you can get a much closer view than you can at many of the great museums.I do not like the huge parking fees (which compensate for free admission) and concessions are very variable (better to get a drink before you go lost a lot of money in the vending machines... getting water was a chore). That was a minor kink in an otherwise very nice day.Though the gardens at the new getty are less of a focus, they still have some very rare ancient plants. They work hard on authenticity and consistency. It is a terrific experience. We go every time we are in the area and alays find something new.Love everything about it except the parking/ transportation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eswope
40,Understated Excellence,The Getty Villa is a wonderful museum based around a replica of a villa from Italy. Make sure when you go that you at least take the architectural and the garden Tuers. You will get more out of your visit. Also what people don't know is that you can get a self guided audio for free that comes with your admission you just have to ask for it so make sure you get that as well. I would recommend to others to visit the Getty Villa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kyllito
50,"The Getty Villa, one part of the Getty Museum",I had visited the Getty Museum a few years ago but had never visited the Villa which is a smaller space and very beautiful with gardens and interesting collections. It is part of the Getty Museum but in a different location. There is a cafe with outside seating. We visited with a baby in a stroller and it was easy to navigate. The admission is free but there is a reasonable charge for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shakleedistributor
50,Nice Collection of items of antiquity,"Getty villa admission is free, parking car is $15. Gardens and views are worth seeing but then the museum has a top notch collection of antiquity. There were some nice roman mosaics, frescoes, pottery and glass pieces. You might have to travel to British museum in London or museums in Rome or Naples to see better collections, I was very surprised by the Getty Villa. Food at café was pretty upscale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottsB4438AL
50,Beautiful grounds and a wonderful antiquity collection.,"The grounds are beautiful, and the collection of antiquities is well presented. I highly recommend that you get the audio tour. It will enhance your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilubliner
40,Super oasis of Mediterranean touch by the Pacific,"Super oasis of Mediterranean touch by the Pacific Ocean. Awesome flair with ""low cost"" art in a beautifully designed mention.For those that bring an open mind you will get a great lesson of history and art. Can't go wrong.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrqtrvDR
40,Lovely experience with so much information,We spent about three and a half hours at the Getty Villa. The film is worth watching at the end. The gardens are very sweet and the tour was very informative. We couldn't print the ticket but it was ok for it to be on a phone screen. You can bring a snack and buy coffee like we did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen-JMelb
50,Wonderful Educational Opportunity and Its Free!,"The Getty Villa is beautifully constructed in the fashion of an ancient Roman villa and is filled with artifacts dating as far back as 600 B.C. Built and designed by John Paul Getty, he passed away in England before he was ever able to see the villa himself.. The grounds are beautiful and the artifacts provide an educational experience that is totally unique to the villa. BTW, access is FREE, although you need to secure your ticket online at the villa's website.Volunteers provide free tours of the grounds and the artifacts, and visitors join and leave the guides as they move from point to point. Because the guides are volunteers, we found their quality to be a bit uneven. In fact, the best resource for us was the 12-minute introductory film offered at the villa's entrance to the museum. After seeing that, film, it was easy for us to guide ourselves from room to room.A short 20-minute drive up the coast from Santa Monica, the Getty Villa is a wonderful place where you can learn a lot in 2-3 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westsidecouple
40,Engrossing attention to detail with a painful amount of walking,"This used to be the Getty Museum before the giant location opened in Brentwood. This location is in Malibu, with an amazing view of the Pacific.This location houses their superb collection of ancient Roman and Greek statues and other souvenirs of the ancient European empires. They have some Egyptian, Phoenician, Cycladic, and so on. But the key parts of the collection are the statues and maybe the mosaics. But the villa itself is also an exhibit, made in every exquisite detail to make you feel like a wealthy Roman.This is not a museum with limited resources. Every bench is beautifully handmade of wood and leather. All the marble is perfectly detailed.It's worth a visit. But the parking is limited, so you need to call ahead for a reservation. There is a lovely cafe with decent food. The museum is free but they charge for parking.The parking is far from the museum, and the museum has a ridiculous amount of walking. We didn't see anybody with any kind of disability. It is so oppressive I wonder if it is by intentional design.As with any museum antiquities, it's hard to enjoy them without asking where they came from, and how they were acquired. The museum had, I think, a director go to jail a few years back. It's safe to assume a lot of their stuff is looted. Sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler2542b
40,"Fabulous architecture, interesting exhibits","This museum is worth visiting for the architecture alone, a great replica of an ancient villa found buried under the lava at Herculaneum (destroyed when Pompeii was buried). The exhibits of ancient Greek and Roman art, pottery, jewelry and more are outstanding. And there is no fee, it's FREE other than a small charge for parking if you travel by car. Definitely worth a visit! Tip: plan to spend at least 2 hours there and be sure to enjoy the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oooom
50,Trip in Roman Times,"I have lived in LA for over 35 years and had never been at the Villa. But after their renovation, I had to go and was I BLOWN away by it's beauty.I could not have imagined such a MAGNIFICENT place existed in LA. The gardens, the artwork, but most amazing of all were the fountains and the home. It was built as a Roman General's place would have looked like in ancient times and the plans were copied from a house found in Italy which was buried and therefore totally preserved.A MUST SEE...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThemisZG
50,Don't miss this,"The Getty Villa is the little sister to the Getty Center. It's nearly in Malibu, which makes it out of the way for many travelers, but it's worth the drive, especially if you like classical art from the Greek and Roman eras. A beautiful and relaxing location with beautiful gardens and some nice ocean views. Check what special shows they have as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acudoc411
30,In and Out Pretty Quickly,"The good - great views, right of the cliff looking down Pacific Coast HW, a pretty tight cafe to grab some food.The bad - its pretty small in things to see. You can easily knock out the whole thing in less than an hour. Sure you could relax in the garden, long pond area to read a book or something, but lets be serious you can do that anywhere.Misc - Entrance is free, but there is parking you need to pay for",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattlL2974HR
50,Absolutely Fabulous!,The museum is primarily a re-creation of a Roman villa near Naples. The art contained within makes this one of the world's foremost collections of classical antiquities. One of the best ever!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DowneastCornhusker
50,"The Getty Villa is not the Getty Center, it is still awesome !!!","If anyone in your group or you do not have the time or feel like taking on the Getty Center, this is an awesome option !!! Built to make you feel you are traveling back in time the entire experience is worth the minimal cost of parking and entry. Much effort and certainly you can google this, was put into making sure every detail was as authentic as possible.Walking down the halls one truly does feel that they have been transported back in time. Among the many artifacts are some replicas (some had to go back to the original countries) that are fantastic as well.Easy access if you have someone in your party who has any walking issues, plenty of places to sit, rest, reflect. Elevators too.Also if you are local a great place to come and contemplate life in any of the open spaces. Check out the schedule for special events in the open air theater, just great to sit and watch like the Romans once did.Also foo available, from snacks to full meals. You may also see students of art and history, as well as scheduled tours. Tag along, you can learn a lot !!!Would be at this place weekly if I lived in the area, it is a treasure.Family friendly and educational and totally NOT boring like many place can be.Air conditioning in various rooms and plenty of spaces to cool off if needed.Sadly due to drought the fountains may or may not be on, but still truly beautiful with or without.If you are so inclined take that novel you are working on or your sketch book or a note book and journal your heart out...this is an inspirational kind of place.Just as an aside, really little kids may not ""get it"" and that you will have to decide depending on your children, if easily bored they may not be too happy, head to Disney instead :)Would recommend as a must see if at all possible, worth finding it, it is in a neighborhoody so keep your gps on until you are at the gate.You can spend a few hours or the entire day. To do this place justice it deserves a few visits to absorb it all !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieTherese_11
40,The second of two Getty museums,"It is an extension of The Getty, it is a newer facility and had similar art and presentations. You can park for free if you visit the Getty parking staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longwayfromtexas
50,View and Garden even more remarkable than the art collections,The Getty Villa is worth planning ahead and making a reservation. Enjoyed the views and gardens immensely. Our family had delicious desserts and coffee and tea at the café. A lovely day all around!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Codatrek
50,Nice pad in Malibu for an oil man,I first saw Van Goh's Irises here. They moved it to the Brentwood museum. But the Villa is still an amazing architectural masterpiece packed with timeless sculptures from the masters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomrT3113SC
50,Skating backwards at the speed of light,"thousands of years into ancient Italy, this was Getty's dream for this museumTerrific intro film explains his concept and puts the setting and collection into perspective, and what a collection, some surprisingly impressive pieces from all over the old world and amazing how intricate and beautiful things could be made before the machine and computer ageAlso, excellent i pod audio tour and if you figure it out, you can avoid a lot of stairs on this cliff side villaDefinitely loses ambiance without water in the fountains",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steelydad2014
50,"Come before 3pm, don't pay for parking twice.","Tips:If you are going to both the Getty Center and the Villa (they are quite far from each other...) via car, you can pay for parking just once. You need a voucher from the first place you go to, however, so that you can present it to the parking attendant at the next place.We had 3pm reservations, which did not give us enough time to slowly enjoy everything. Once we got there, we stood in line for the garden tour, which lasted about 45 mins. (It was great, but minor feedback to the tour guide--when you cough, it reverberates loudly into our earpieces...). Once the tour was over, we really only had an hour to look at everything with the audio guide, as the museum closed at 5:00pm. So I would recommend getting there earlier.Anyhow, if you enjoy ancient greek and roman art, this collection is a must-see. The audio guide is great.Note: The fountains are all turned off in the Getty Center and Villa, due to the drought.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alilu007
40,"Hydrate, take some time to enjoy the many offerings","Worth a day, or half a day's visit, there's near too many pieces to appreciate in one visit. My beau, who's visited the other Getty, suggests seeing the two museums back to back, since this Getty no longer shows paintings he remembers from his first visit. Just an incredible collection. Updated grounds which include more food and hydration options: appreciated, as was the breeze coming from the Pacific, directly across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akcol

You can see one of the LA areas finest mansions, open to the public and the beautiful grounds that overlook Malibu. AND you can enjoy all the fine art on display.

50,Take a day at the Villa,"I've been twice just to fit in the landscape as well as the art. When I've recommended the Villa to friends and relatives visiting LA, they have returned with glowing remarks about this place on the coast. Besides taking in the view and seeing the collections, be sure to walk through the vegetable/fruit garden and open areas with sculptures. There are plenty of food and drink options as well at the cafe if you need a break. The Villa is a unique spot to relax, catch up or take a welcome detour from the usual.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tripmaker787
50,Magnificent villa with lots of art; and there's more at the Getty Center,"We arrived for the 10 o'clock opening after printing out the mandatory time reservations from the Internet. There three stops on the way up to the parking deck, which created a very slow-moving line: first, a stop to have your tickets checked; second, a stop for someone to verify and take the tickets, and third, a person to collect the $15.00 parking fee. The fee was a special bargain for our group of five, since there was no other cost, including a guided architectural tour and a separate guided garden tour, both of which we recommend. There are plenty of ancient vessels on display, and a bit of art, but you can find a far more extensive collection at the Getty Center, which we highly recommend as well. Certainly worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlieSGA
50,Very nice place to visit,Please note that you have to have your tickets in advance and they were free at the time we went. We did need to pay for parking ($15.00). The have a nice cafe. They have several tours which are free and I would recommend going on at least one of them. Plan on spending at least 3 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmt1234
50,Drive PCH and spend a few hours going back in history in Malibu,"I came here on a whim and I'm happy I got to enjoy the museum! The Getty Villa has an impressive collection of art and is worth exploring. I really enjoyed the architecture of the massive property as well! Although some of the water features and fountains were dry due to the drought they are beautiful nonetheless.I didn't check out the cafe but I popped in the museum store and they had a good selection of jewelry, right up my alley.The museum is free and parking is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMabsFoodie4Me
50,A terrific place,"Everything about the Getty Villa is a wonderful experience. The gardens and building surrounds are a highlight in themselves. However it is the art and artefacts that most people will go for and you will not be disappointed. Remember you need to pre book your arrival time, or run the risk of being refused entry. Off season weekdays just rocking up may work, but don't expect it is smart on weekends or during peak holiday periods. First up take in the short film about the centre and then just wander. A very rewarding visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emanpee
50,Beautiful remnant of a lost time,This villa houses Etruscan & Greek works of art. I particularly enjoyed the expansive outdoor courtyard laden with pomegranate and palm date trees bearing their fruit! - although not ripe for harvest yet :) The introductory video just inside the entrance way (a kind guide will show you the way) is a good place to start your tour. An exhibit of food & its festivals during Roman times was also particularly interesting. There are many benches about the property for resting or just sitting to enjoy the peace of the villa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oliveolives
50,A good addition to visiting the Getty Center,"J.P. Getty was an avid collector of ancient artifacts, particularly Greek and Roman bronze sculptures, and this museum was built to house his vast collection. The design of the museum was based on a Roman villa that Getty had fallen in love with during his trips to Europe. Getty died before the villa was completed, and it was soon filled to capacity with artifacts, so the nearby Getty Center was built later to house more of his collection.Plan on spending at least 2-3 hours at The Getty Villa. We visited the villa after spending most of the day at the Getty Center. We already paid to park at the Center, so we got to park at the Villa for free, but it was hard to squeeze both of those visits into a single day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnny1947
40,Good Collection of Art from Ancient Greek & Roman World,"We visited the Getty Villa as the Getty Center was not opened (close on Mondays). The Getty Villa has art pieces from the ancient Greek and Roman world dating from 6,500 BC to AD 400, and comprises galleries organised by themes. Entry is free but there is a parking fee of US$15. Definitely worth a half day visit if visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dannychan_sg
50,Herculaneum West ....,"The Getty Villa is an LA treasure which I've enjoyed repeatedly visiting since it was first opened. Nothing like it anywhere, except the original which is still lava encased. Call ahead to reserve parking (fee) but entrance is gratis.

50,I Just Love the Villa!,"I just love the Getty Villa. I can't go often enough. It is so beautiful and peaceful, unlike the mob scene that you often get at the Getty Museum off of the 405. The building itself is part of the appeal. It is built in the style of a Roman Villa with gardens and a reflective pool. I could spend hours just exploring the building. But, of course, there are also the world class exhibits which are not to be missed. I always enjoy having lunch at the cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom_of_Alex

50,Fun day with friends,"Wonderful property. We spent 3 hours on site but you can spend a full day. The garden tour was interesting. The cafe is good, we enjoyed a cheese tray and prosecco.

Its free (parking $15). The Villa and grounds are modelled on an ancient villa from Herculaneum it is quite authentic in many ways, it has a peristyle, open air auditorium, gardens and Roman road. The art inside the Villa is ancient Roman and Greek. There are regular tours of the gardens and the exhibitions. And there is an excellent Cafe.

50,"Superb museum, interesting replica villa, superb facilities and staff.","Genuinely amazed by the range and quality of Greek and Roman exhibits on display, including several pieces I was familiar with from book illustrations but which I had not expected to find in California!The house itself is interesting but is too adapted for modern use and with an improbable second storey for it to be a convincing reproduction. The gardens however are convincing (and beautiful) and the location in a small verdant canyon is a lovely evocation of rural Southern Italy.Staff are super helpful, parking is easy, the cafes and tea rooms are excellent, the book shop is outstanding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkLawrence33

The architecture was modeled so exact it takes you back in time to the Greco-Roman era! I definitely enjoyed it! This was my second time here, my sis and our friends had never been. Wow! They were blown away, even I! No matter how many times you come, you'll be so surprised how many things you missed the first time! Oh and the ocean view it the cherry on top!

40,Amazing attraction!,"What an incredible experience! This museum and gardens overlook the Pacific with rich history and authenticity. The entrance to the parking lot is a little tricky - it sneaks up on you and the signage isn't obvious, but once we were turned around and parked, all was good. Admission is free. Our tour guide was lovely and well-versed in both the original villas in Italy as well as the history of the Getty Villa. Due to the drought conditions in California, most of the fountains and reflecting pools are empty but we could use our imaginations. It was a breathtaking, educational and peaceful afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X4480PIchrisk
50,"Wonderful museum, architecture, and setting",Having been to Italy several times including Rome and Pompeii we were very excited to see a recreated Roman villa and the ancient art that is displayed here. This is as close as any of us will get to experiencing a Roman villa that is not in ruins! We were especially thrilled to see their Greek bronze sculpture as there are so few of these in the world and we fell in love with this art form at the Archeology Museum in Athens. So nice to have this excellent collection in the US!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lrising
50,good copy of an Italian Villa,"The only fee you pay is $15 for parking that is good for here and the Getty Center. There is no charge to get into either place.Getty was very interested in the ancient history of the area around Pompeii and spared no expense to make an exact copy of a villa outside Pompeii. The gardens have flowers and fruit trees that would have been used in those days. There are many displays of art, ceramics, and jewelry that Getty collected to be put on display. You can take a number of free tours that are very good.

40,"If you cannot go to Italy, you can go here, but go to Italy!","Nice recreation of the Italian villa home never fully unearthed in Herculaneum near Naples. Not an amazing collection of antiquities, but a nice one. If you have seen Pompeii or Herculaneum and their treasures, it makes this seem minor, but it does give one a perspective on the villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sspalmettobay
40,Stunning Villa,"We booked tickets on line and showed our receipt from our phone. The tickets are free but you pay to park. The museum houses a collection of Greek/Roman artifact.

40,"Beautiful building, a lot of kids","The Getty Villa is a must for anyone with an interest in Greek and Roman history. The building is a decent likeness of a Roman villa, but it's not really an interpretive structure. Each room is dedicated with a different theme (women, athletes, Trojan war, etc.), which is great, but you don't get any flavor of living in the villa. The place was crawling with school groups.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bentonian
20,Like being in Vegas,The property is nice but having spent time in Italy this Villa is more like the Ballagio. Some of the art is interesting but the place really doesn't know what it wants to be. Nice place for a wedding but not worth the trip for true art lovers. The fountain has been turned off along with other major water features including the main pool for water conservation efforts. Great place for a school field trip though at 15 dollars a head...maybe not. I would recommend that people spend their time and money at the Getty Center which is a site worth visiting if only for the spectacular views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stallegro
50,Beautiful Art and Views,"Nearly everyone has heard of and/or visited the Getty Center and museum, but not everyone has been the the Villa. Originally built to house Getty's growing collection.

The tickets are free, though parking is not, just like the Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J5918PUelizabethc

50,A Must for History or Art Lovers,"I recently spent a few hours at the Getty Villa, and I absolutely loved it. I typically hit up museums or historical sites when I travel, so when I read about this place, I knew I had to go. I've always been fascinated with Herculaneum and Pompeii in particular, and some of the items here reference everyday items recovered at those sites. The villa itself is a recreation of a Roman one. A portion of the site is outdoors, but the galleries are indoors.As others have mentioned, it's free to get in (but you must book in advance -- I did mine online), then it's $15 to park once you get there. Allow for 2-3 hours (or longer), and try to take one of their free tours if possible. I did the architecture tour, which lasted 40 minutes. It obviously covers some architectural details of the site, as well as touching on daily life for Romans who would have lived at a villa like this. My guide was good, very informative and knowledgeable.Definitely a place I'd come back to the next time I'm in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atljs
50,Ancient Wonder,"wonderful place to visit especially if you like Greek history, a must especially is you visited the getty centre, and if to pay for parking in one you park in the other for free, plus a nice drive through Malibu",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StratosMoutafis

50,Beautiful Museum,"Must get free tickets at the Getty Museum in order to get in. Pay only $15 for parking. The Villa is a recreation of an ancient Roman country house. Worth driving there in the Pacific Coast Highway. A smaller Getty museum with amazing ancient world - Greece & Rome, treasures. The collection has 44,000 Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities dating from 6,500 BC to 400 AD, including the Lansdowne Heracles and the Victorious Youth. Don't miss the gardens. Start with the short video and take the free audio phones for your self-guided tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Route66travel
50,Someone had too much money,"The entrance is free, but parking is $15. The grounds are nicely done and the docents appear to enjoy what they do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vao_Fefe
50,Go to the Villa for Antiquities,"I've been to the new Getty, which is fabulous and requires several trips to see everything. The 'old' Getty houses the antiquities, which are really remarkable too. That's what a Getty fortune will buy you. Read the book ""Chasing Aphrodite"" to get an inside look at how the Getty managed to assemble such an astonishing collection. Spoiler alert: some of it was stolen (since returned). We took the architectural tour and the garden tour, each lasting about 45 minutes. Would go back in a heartbeat to spend more time with the collections. Excellent, moderately priced restaurant to boot, with ocean views. And make sure you spot the pomegranate trees!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dakota1956
50,I'm a Getty pilgrim,"If you love art, particularly ancient classical art, this is a must. A most beautiful place in a fantastic location with an amazing collection of antiquities. You have to book tickets but it's free. Wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robin01
50,A journey through time and space,"First of all, we booked our tickets (it's free) previously, on the website. We never imagened what was behind the gates of the Villa, soon after getting off the 534 bus from Culver City, passing by Santa Monica. The pathway between the gates and the Villa was prohibited to pedestrians, there was a shuttle available. For those who have visited Herculanum and Pompeii (we did it), it was impossible not correlate the two sites. At this point, the journey had begun. I pinched myself, questioning if really we were in California or at foot of the Vesuvio. There was a seamless integration between the collection and the venue, so that one could even doubt that the building was built many years after the works inside. A special place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/723joset
50,One of a kind!,"The Getty Villa is a one of a kind experience! it's as close to being at a Roman Villa on the eve of the eruption of Vesuvius as you'll ever get. The architecture is exquisite, perfect in every detail. And then there's the fine collection of Greek and Roman art. it may not be the Vatican, but it's pretty close for good art and a broad collection. If you're nearby, it should be a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/professoressadarte
50,Getty's Kerb Address,"The 534 bus from Santa Monica dropped us on the kerbside of the Pacific Coast Highway right outside the gates to the Villa and as the shuttle wound its way through the Cypress trees to the crest where the Villa overlooks the sea, it was easy to imagine ourselves transported from Malibu to the Bay of Naples. This impression was only heightened as we strolled around the loggias and grounds of the immaculate reproduction of the Empire Period Villa, correct in every detail (and probably better!).Inside, the incomparable collection of mainly Greek, Etruscan, and Roman artefacts are tastefully displayed and not overcrowded. Interestingly, the exhibits are arranged thematically rather than chronologically, inviting rewarding comparisons between the treatment of similar subjects across the three quite distinct Mediterranean cultures. The room dedicated to woman and children provides perhaps the most evocative examples of this, but the entire collection is of such high quality it is difficult to rate any one part better than the others.The real highlight here is the Villa itself and in particular the spectacular peristyle garden and pool (no less striking for currently being drained due to the Californian drought)Like its sister venue, the Getty Center, there is no admission fee, the staff are helpful, the cafe is good and every care seems to have been taken to ensure you enjoy your visit. If you do arrive by bus, remember to ask the driver to hole punch your museum tickets as there is some sensitivity about arriving on foot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
50,Medea under the moon on a beautiful evening,The Greek play 'Medea' set in modern Boyle Heights was beautifully performed on a wonderfully warm moonlit evening. Venue is perfect and the acting was very professional. Only a few more performances left so DON'T MISS IT!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/815judithp
50,Villa dei Papiri Reimagined,"Visually it is a wonderland of beautiful gardens, architecture, and cultural displays of antiquity dated back to 3000 B.C. If you are in the area it is a must see! I personally, loved all the marble and gardens. I was overwhelmed with the collection of art pieces that Getty had acquired. You can take a break and enjoy lunch at the outdoor cafe. Great salads and fresh baked breads.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindajT7539QI
40,Getta Villa (September 2015),"I had a wonderful time at the Getty Villa. I have not been back here since I moved away from Malibu, CA. It was nice to see that the grounds and facility was maintained over the years. I was only sad to see the water shortage and drought in CA having the water features turned off during this visit. Overall, the parking was easy and since tickets on line was mandatory it was nice to pull up and park and go right in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orderdessert1st
50,a piece of Italy,wonderful day. so many fantastic things to see. gardens are beautiful and the cafe salads are really good. need a few more of the outdoor tables in the shade when ithis really hot,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/557sarahd557
40,Delightful house and gardens,Getty's reproduction of an Italianate villa and gardens is a delight and well worth a morning or an afternoon - you need 2 hours at least to wander around and take in all the works of art. Plus there is a nice cafe with reasonably priced food and drink.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lenp135
50,Wonderful recreation of an Italian Villa,"Getty's vision shines through with this villa. Our main interest was to see that villa layout and the wonderful gardens. Even though there was a passable crowd, you did get the definite feeling of peace and quiet. As the villa is located in a valley, the breeze was excellent, offsetting the 95 degrees. We could really have lived here! A tip for overseas travellers ..... there is no effective public transport to the villa. We took a cab and actually asked him to wait. What we should have done is taken our rental car a day earlier, as there is abundant parking. The cost of the latter is offset by the free entry reservation process.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meikant
40,A great time for low cost,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Getty Villa. The museum is FREE, but you need to request and print out tickets online before you go, and parking is $15. We decided last minute to go on Sunday afternoon. We got tickets, into the parking lot and out of the parking lot, with no issues whatsoever.The grounds are lovely. We were going to just walk around and look at everything, but we saw a gentleman with the tour sign, and we decided to take that route. The second best decision of the day. The tour was 45 minutes and FREE. We had Robert for the architecture tour. He was informative thorough and just amazingly lovely. His architecture tour was so great that we took the garden tour he was hosting immediately afterward. It was a hot day, however, the museum provides FREE umbrellas to protect you from the sun.The Villa is a phenomenal reproduction of an Italian Villa, it has a fantastic collection of artifacts, it has a beautiful tribute to our olfactory senses in the herb garden, and the staff was kind and knowledgeable.It is absolutely worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whome88
50,Go back in time,"The villa is amazing, and so are the guides. They can truly take you back in time as they can tell the story so well, not only of how the villa came to exist, but they also make you remember all that Roman history lessons back in school. I loved it. Also, the amount of art displayed there is so diverse and so well distributed. Definitely worth visiting, and it is free! Wonderful contribution to the cultural enrichment of anyone who likes this kind of things, like me!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marclaudi
40,Wonderful way to spend a few hours in a beautiful villa with lush gardens,"Together with a visit to the Getty Center in L.A., this is a great way to spend a full day at the museums and make full use of the $15 parking fee that can be applied to both museums on the same day.■ Admission to both the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades and the Getty Center in L.A. are free. For the Getty Villa, you have to book your visit online first. Don't just show up without a printed voucher/ticket and expect to be let in.■ Although I had a later time slot in the afternoon, they were kind enough to let me drive in an hour early.■ Since I had paid the $15 parking fee in the morning at the Getty Center in LA, I just showed the parking attendant a parking voucher which I had received at the Getty Center. See my photos for a sample of this parking voucher/ticket. If you visit the Getty Villa first and want to visit the Getty Center later in the day, you can pay for parking here and just make sure to visit their Information desk to get a parking voucher for your visit later at the Getty Center.■ Parking is in a multi-level garage (remember where you parked) that is safe, plentiful and easy to get in and out of.■ If you're driving, make sure you're Northbound on the Pacific Coast Highway (in the direction away from L.A.) to turn right into the Getty Villa. You cannot turn left into the Getty Villa from the Southbound lanes of the highway. If you're on the Southbound lanes, go further south until you can find a way to U-turn and be on the Northbound lanes.■ If you're interested in taking the different free tours (Architecture, Gardens, Collections, etc) at the Villa, make sure to check their tour schedule online and then use the tour schedule to help you decide which time slot you will take to visit the Villa. Although there's no time limit for how long you can stay at the Villa, it shouldn't take more than 2-3 hours to see everything - more if you're planning on taking a few tours. The Villa doesn't have as varied or huge a collection of arts and antiquities as the Getty Center but the beautiful gardens and landscapes more than make up for it.■ For the folks who are interested in something unique, the Villa offers ""Tea By The Sea"" on Thursday and Saturday afternoons at 1 PM. Go to the Villa web site to make a reservation for this Mediterranean-inspired dining experience for $36 plus taxes per person.■ We were there until later on a weekday afternoon when the crowd thins out and it doesn't feel as crowded. However, there are fewer tours in the late afternoon.■ To set some expectations - the Villa has emptied their main reflecting pool because of the CA drought. Yes, it's disappointing but every little effort to conserve water helps.In summary, the Villa is a quiet and beautiful escape from the hustle and bustle of L.A. and together with the Getty Center, makes for a wonderful (and cheap) museum day for the entire family..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live4Sights
50,Amazing collection and beautiful building.,"We visited the Getty Villa recently. We arrived expecting to spend two hours. We ended up staying five hours. We took the audio tour. I think we visited each room. We were thrilled with collection of stauary, vessels and jewelry. We ate lunch at the cafe. The food was good. The gift shop had a nice collection of books, jewelry, and tasteful souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goss_kay
50,Take the Highlights Tour!,"Much of what you need to know about the Getty Villa has been addressed by other reviewers. I'm not keenly interested in the Greco-Roman period per se, but the Getty is always a nice place to stroll through, perhaps picking up a bite to eat at their Cafe (provided you've had the foresight to make your parking reservations and stay long enough to make the $15 parking fee worthwhile). By all means, however, sign up for the free 50-minute highlights tour! Our tour guide took us to see four distinct pieces (all of which my eyes had glossed over earlier in the day) and really made us LOOK at them and discuss what they represented and why they'd been fashioned in a specific manner. Amazing! I'm not sure how often the subjects of the tour change (or even, in fact, if they do), but I will never visit the Getty Villa again without checking this out. The last tour of the day is 1:00, I believe, so sign up as soon as you arrive. You won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/750janeth
50,Venture back in time to Roman villa,"After visiting the Getty Center, we were convinced that we had to visit the Getty Villa in Malibu. Another stunning place with gorgeous vistas in Malibu. Unlike the Getty Center which was created after his death, J. Paul Getty lived in the ranch house above the current museum and also, had his hand in the location of the current villa museum prior to his death in 1976. The villa which is a reconstruction of a villa near Pompei houses a wonderful collection of Etruscan, Greek, and Roman art. Literally too much to see in a single visit. Take the free tours and see the overview in the orientation film. Great price-free although reservations are needed. Parking is $15.00 still a bargain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David116116
50,Gorgeous Italian Estate,"Fantastic reproduction of a 1st century CE Italian estate filled with a fascinating collection of Greek, Etruscan and Roman art. Gorgeous grounds, informative video and excellent staff. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94121travel
40,Greek retreat,A very nice relaxing place to visit to look at artifacts and artwork focusing on Greek mythology. They also host theatrical events for the public on certain days which I'm sure would be very interesting to observe as we say some actors practicing while we were there. The grounds are immaculate. Tickets are free but you have to get them prior to arrival. The only fee is for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princess123182
40,Tourist attraction spot,"Beautiful museum right next to the coast..... priceless!!Love the courtyard, Love the garden. Great place taking pictures.The Admission: FREE but need to make appointment on their website and print out the tickets.The Parking: Parking structure ($15)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
50,The 1%,"Getty Villa is a scaled down replica of an ancient Roman villa, filled with Greek, Roman & Etruscan antiquities. In addition to being an educational center and museum, it's also an example of what the 1% can do with their wealth. While it is free and open to the public, it feels very private with the one lane driveway upto and away from the villa. Just register online to get your free tickets for admission. There were free audio tours given by Robert. He gave detailed tours of the gardens and architecture.The man that envisioned and built this incredible museum is the same man that refused to pay his 16yr old grandsons ransom when he was kidnapped in 1973. He was held for several months. The ransom was only paid when his ear was removed. He was kidnapped right around the time this Villa was almost completed. Getty was considered at one point to be the richest man in the world. The whole time I was there, I kept thinking,"" This is how John Paul Getty would rather spend his money"". Sad considering what his grandson was going through at the time.Anyway, this place is worth seeing just to get a taste of Ancient Rome sitting right next to pacific coast highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beahurey
20,Getty VIlla - bring back the fountains,"I was so disappointed that the Getty Villa has shut off their fountains due to drought. All those thirsty little birdies and butterflies. And where are the Koi fish that have lived so beautifully there ? This was not the visit of years gone by - the large parking garage that was built on site takes away from the charm and the paintings were whisked away to ""the center""- alas progress. The guard standing sentry to the tour group, like those near by were encroaching on unpaid secrets was definitely tacky and unnecessary. The antique treasures were fun to see - but I won't be back until some of the relaxed charm of yesteryear is returned.. After all, doesn't that non-potable water disperse back to the sky to make the clouds rain? Perhaps you are adding to the drought rather that protecting from it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tenarobin
50,The Getty Villa,The villa is a museum all on its own. A piece of Roman history filled with such beautiful art work! I loved walking through the herb garden. The restaurant was lovely as was the day. I will definitely go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lm1109
50,Beautiful landscape,I visited the place with my family and I was surprised such a pitoresque place with beautiful garden and a lot of art inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meda_C
40,Worth a half-day (at least),"Although you can combine visits to the Getty Villa and Getty Center in one day if you don't want to pay the parking fee twice (the parking fee was $15 when we visited), for us it was not worth rushing through the GV in order to get to the GC. (Also, we wanted to visit the Malibu beaches in the afternoon rather than go to another museum.) We had a reservation for GV at 10 a.m. (the first available time--and make sure you reserve in advance to get your preferred time). We didn't leave until after 2 p.m., though that did include lunch at the cafe, so you could probably do the GC on the same day if you skip lunch or eat it en route.The building is nicely designed and the collections are fascinating. Another reviewer noted the artificiality or ""fakeness"" of the design, and that can be seen in the wall murals and some other design elements. Because of the drought, there were no fountains or other features, which made some of the photos less than perfect. But it is still a pleasant place to walk around and sit on a nice day, and if you are into antiquities you could spend a long time in the interior exhibits.The cafe is pretty good as museum cafes go, and it's nice to sit outside with a view of the GV and ocean in the distance. There is an interesting (and pricey) menu. The portions are huge, so you could probably save money by sharing a dish if you are not overly hungry. My husband had a very good Portobello Mushroom Caprese Sandwich. I had the Villa Burger with cheddar and bacon--it looked great but unfortunately was cooked medium-well, even though I had asked for it rare. The burger came with very good fries. We also had the Calypso Mango iced tea, which was good.I'm glad we visited the Getty Villa but probably would not feel the need to visit it again unless they had a special exhibit we wanted to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freedshop
40,Nice way to spend a lazy morning or afternoon,"I visited the Getty Villa on August 2015 with my family, which included 3 children ages 10-12 and my older mother. Last time I visited this place was about 30 years ago on a school field trip. I was pleased with the return visit. Please note that while entrance is free, you are required to make reservations and parking was $15 at the time of my visit. The reservations did state that we were required to print the tickets but I presented the tickets on my smartphone and there were no issues/questions. The museum has a nice collection of old greek and roman artifacts...It took the kids a little while to get used to all the nude statues...just kids being kids. While I did enjoy the short period of time there it was a lot of the same...statues, artifacts and more statues. The kids did start to get a little bored, but we found their children's area which let them get a little hands on and they really enjoyed it.They had a Greek band playing in the courtyard which my mother really enjoyed. They have free wheelchairs and umbrellas for your use on the nice sunny southern CA day which you can return on your way out. Because of our drought conditions the pool as well as several water fountain/features were turned off to conserve water. We had a nice lunch at the café...but the items on the kids menu like the pasta and the chicken did leave a lot to be desired, the pasta was drenched in butter and chicken was cold...however the other menu items were delicious the steak was especially good if you want to spend that much on lunch. Including lunch we were done touring around in about 3.5 hours, which was more than enough time. While I enjoyed it, unless you have a particular interest in greek/Roman history you'll be done in a relatively short period of time as it's a lot of the same but nice none the less. From some parts of the Villa you have a nice ocean view. While I hadn't planned for it.. I did stop at the beach right in front of the museum on my way home and let the children burn off some steam on the beach, so come prepared. Overall it was a nice very cost effective way to spend a Saturday. Take a stroll through the museum lower floors and gardens have lunch at the café, stroll the upper floors and then on your way home stop and catch some waves directly in front of the Villa. The 1st parking lot, if you make a left on PCH when you leave the Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAExplorer69
50,Great Museum with Stunning Views,"The Getty Villa is a beautiful hidden gem as you drive along PCH. It has picturesque views of the city as the coastline. The museum itself is made to resemble a Greek palace with tall Corinthian columns and marble statues surrounding you. It also has a stunning long water fountain in the center plaza. But because of the drought, the museum wisely chose to shut off most of its water fixtures.The museum features mostly Roman and Greek influences. Many rooms are filled with enormous ancient marble statues and paintings. They also have temporary exhibits like the European mummy. They actually show a short clip of how the mummy was made. In fact, what kept me intrigued is how they are able to keep these one ton statues in place during one of our famous California tremblers. The museum also shows us how they have a super smart design that keeps all the statues upright and free of Earth shaking stress!As for food, there's a museum cafe as soon as you get in. It serves both hot and cold food. It's reasonably affordable if you get the munchies. However, if you have picky kids like me, I suggest bringing a picnic lunch instead. There's a lot of seating and it's not prohibited to bring your own food as long as you don't eat or drink in the exhibit halls.The museum itself is free but parking is $10. Also since the Villa is limited in regards to space, they highly recommend making online reservations to secure your time slot. You are allowed to come in up to an hour before your time.It's a really elegant place to spend the day with your family or even just on your own to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pulido1011
40,getty villa,"The villa is especially great to visit on a beautiful day, which most days are. The summer evening plays would be great too, but the acoustics are very poor. If you sit in the upper tiers you will notice the audience in the lower tiers laughing at things you cannot hear. This has happened with all the plays I have seen there, every year. I keep coming back, thinking surely they will fix the problem. Since the theater is pretty small and the problem would be easy to fix with proper microphones, failure to do so seems inexcusable to me.. Ironic that the Greeks 3000 years ago were able to get the acoustics right but the Getty can't",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamalaga
50,We Love Visiting The Getty!,"You will need a parking reservation, so get it on line ahead of time. The museum is just the right size to do in a few hours, or in a day if you read all the descriptions. You will learn a lot about ancient art and sculpture. Exceptionally well laid-out. Staff is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Their Cafe is well above the bar as far as museum cafes go.

The let down is they have very limited parking that you have to make a reservation to park there. During the summer months and on weekends when there is beach traffic it can be extremely upsetting trying to drive to the Getty with all of the beach traffic which tends to get backed up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metrotorrance

50,Ancient Greece and Rome in the USA,"Getty built this amazing museum modeled after a Roman country house in Herculaneum that was buried by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in A.D.79. There are herb gardens ,olive trees and a beautiful lilly pond similar to a Monet painting. There is also a delightful outdoor cafe that serves wine , beer, lemon pie and various small bites. It is a delight to sit outside next to the pond and the great sculptures through out the gardens. There are other beautiful gardens you can take outdoor breaks to. The museums Greek pottery display almost over shadows the Acropolis Museum in Athens Greece. They are more artfully displayed and the whole museum flows better. The Roman exhibits are just as grand. Now to tell you about the grand paintings you will find. Renoir, Picasso,Manet,all the great impressionists and back to the 12th and 13 th century Dutch, Italian, French and the list goes on. It is a beautiful concept of making a museum within an ancient villa (replica) A must see for art and history enthusiasts. P.S.

40,Visited this place in July 2015,"I found this place really nice and fun to see however, due to the shortage of water the pools were not filled. It had a lot of nice items to see and I did it all in 2 hours and I was starting to get bored. I had seen the museum before and after spending 6-7 hours I could still go on, but 2 hours was enough for me here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rostam
40,Ancient Greece and Rome without a time machine,". A delightful find if you are interested in ancient civilizations.The Getty Villa in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, is one of two locations of the J. Paul Getty Museum. We had visited the Getty Museum on an earlier trip, but had never heard of the Villa. The Villa was built as a museum not as a home. The gardens are a restful place to walk and contemplate another place and time. There are various tours available with knowledgeable docents who are excited to share their love of art and architecture. We took a highlights tour and the architecture tour and loved them both. Visit the web site before you go. Hours vary, tour times are given, and be sure to check driving directions! The turn into the drive can be a problem if you are not aware. Plan to spend a morning or afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaseyandD

50,Ancient Beauty to Behold,"Like stepping back into Antiquity. Set on a beautiful hilltop overlooking the ocean stands a museum built as a replica of an Ancient Roman Villa. The art exhibited, dating back thousands of years, is varied from sculpture, jewelry, pottery, floors... from several ancient cultures. .All unique & breathtaking. The tour of the gardens and architecture are very educational & worth taking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/400barbaraa
50,Beautiful setting,We needed to book a reservation online to enter the free museum. Car parking is $15 per car. This setting is more tranquil than the Getty centre. The collections are Greek and Roman artefacts. The gardens are well presented. The experience here compliments the Getty centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andynaija
40,Beautiful and worth the visit but less there than I thought,"Not sure what I expected and I wasn't disappointed...it was a beautiful place, you could smell the herbs from the garden and the art was amazing, I think I didn't realize it was all art and grounds,,,,thought that there would be something about Getty and his life and home,,,but I enjoyed it a lot. You just need an hour or two. My favorite was the herb garden and the collection of ancient glassware. Both exquisite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizaY
50,Beautiful Museum in Malibu,"The Getty Villa is located on a hillside overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu. It is a beautiful location and you can easily spend 3-4 hours going through every exhibition in the museum. They also offer workshops on select days which cover subjects such as culinary arts, architecture and horticulture in Roman times. The Getty Villa does not charge admission but parking is $15. Tickets (with timed entries) must be obtained online prior to your visit. They also have a wonderful gift shop. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SgtBuffy
40,"Stunning setting, interesting collection","A great place to spend 2-3 hours viewing ancient Greek and Roman artifacts, enjoying spectacular architecture, and relaxing in lovely gardens. You must register in advance--on line--for free entry tickets and then pay $15 for parking. Be prepared for lots of stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Viajera51
50,Villa and Gardens a delight to visit.,"We learnt about the Getty Villa after visiting the Getty Centre on Wednesday August 19.The Getty Villa is situated in Malibu and is well sign posted.Admission is free however it is mandatory to register and obtain tickets in line. You have to stipulate how many people will be in your party as well as time to visit. The reception staff at Hotel Carmel ( Santa Monica) were very helpful with printing tickets.The villa has been recreated from Ancient Rome with splendid architecture and interior design. The flow of the villa creates a real haven. It's easy to forget that you are in the middle of LA.The collection of art ranges from bronze works of art, marble statues, vessels and priceless paintings.The gardens surrounding the villa were developed to reflect life as it would have been during the period.Staff were very helpful and knowledgable.If you are planning a visit allow at least 2-3 hours and pre arrange meeting place and time with those who you travelled with as the place is large.It is a well worth place to visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/656wendyt
50,Very interesting and inexpensive,This is a great Southern California Attraction. It is $15 to park and the Villa is free. We spent a couple hours there and only saw about a quarter of the Villa. Everything is interesting and beautiful. I plan to spend at least 3 more days exploring this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Putzcat
50,Must visit in California!,"Firsly, get your tickets ONLINE! (You have to, plus they are free) and you only pay for parking when you get there. This place is so beautiful! From the entrance right until the end of the Villa. We went in the morning when it was perfect weather outside and not too hot and there was not alot of people to begin with. Gorgeous gardens and amazing villa to walk around in. Deffinitly a must see and bring your camera because you can take all the pictures you want. You could easily spend a couple hours here, however we spent a little over an hour since we had other things to do on our trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandah62
40,Beautiful morning visit,We watched the brief film that detailed the construction of the villa. Interesting in that Getty wanted visitors to feel as if they were in an ancient Roman villa as they strolled the building and grounds. It was easy to imagine that we were.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/873kristing
50,"So close, yet a world away!","I love coming to the Getty Villa in Malibu because it's so close to L.A., yet always feels a world away. Recently I brought a group of teenagers and they all really liked it. The Greek/Roman architecture and art are very interesting and really take you away to another place and time. You'll need to schedule your visit in advance through the Getty's website but tickets are free. The only thing you'll need to pay for is parking at $15. The fact that this is so close to Pacific Coast Highway is great because not only will you have great weather for your visit, but you can easily visit the beach afterwards which is what we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,worth an afternoon trip,"There is a parking fee; no cost to get in. And you need to make timed reservations to enter, but the effort is worth it. Nice grounds, beautiful views, and a museum filled with ancient art. Might be tough for smaller children, but a must for everyone else. We spent about 3 hours there, but could have stayed longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayo112
50,Amazing afternoon,PCH was incredibly crowded so keep this in mind if you reserve a ticket online. I forgot to do it but it didn't trouble them that I didn't have the ticket as long as I paid the $15.00 parking free. The museum and grounds are free!!!!There is no internet and basic cell service until you get to the building and can then hop on their free service.The grounds were amazing. Remember the large pool/fountain and one or two others were not working due to the drought. The grounds were amazing anyway! The east garden and herb garden fountains were operational. Phenomenal place. Assistant in almost all areas. Prepare for a full day.Expect a wait when leaving the parking deck near closing. I was on the 2nd or 3rd floor and probably waited 30 minutes to leave. Others want to leave at the same time and with the PCH being full along with crossing a side street it's rather slow leaving the property. Park on lower levels.I will be back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R9860ZCwilliamp
50,Love it!,Great place to spend a day with family. The Villa tours are free and very interesting. The guides are very knowledgeable and open to answer your questions. So much history in this place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarinaG91
50,Stunning building - stunning views.,"We first visited the Getty Villa over 20 years ago. This is our first return visit since the multi-year renovation. The wait was well worth it. We thought it a stunning building before, but now the incredibly tasteful changes have made it even more appealing. Of course, it is Malibu, so the deep blue sky and warm, dry, Mediterranean-like weather forms a perfect backdrop for this replica of a Pompeii villa. We were ecstatic that several of the garden fountains were working despite the CA drought. I must add a word of caution, though, this is really not the best place for families with lively kids, IMHO. There is a specific family exhibit, but this did not appear to be enough to hold the attention of boisterous tweens and pre-tweens for long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kost1947
50,Sign up for a free tour,"The Getty Villa is beautiful, but we wouldn't have appreciated it as much if we had not signed up for the free tours. The tour guides are so knowledgeable - we loved the vignettes they shared as we walked through the collections and gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sidder
50,"Essential place to view classical art in LA, beautiful environment","On a family holiday to California from the UK, we went here and to the Getty Center. The Villa has a great atmosphere and some wonderful art, with beautiful gardens. Nice to wander around and enjoy, good cafe as well. The current delight has - understandably though disappointingly- meant some of the water features are not running. Only gripe is the parking process seems inefficient: queue to show ticket to one checkpoint and then again at another, where paying for parking takes time. Why not have online parking payment in advance, to match the online booking (free tickets ) for the Villa itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reviewer64Uk
40,The original Getty museum still wty it's charms and outdoor lounging space.,This is the original Getty Museum and most all of the important art pieces have ben moved to Getty Center. The grounds are charming and perfect for a beach front picnic at J.P. Getty's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jpresskin
50,The Home of Classical Art and Architecture In Southern California,"Housed in a compound inspired by a 1st century Roman villa, the Getty Trust has brought together a magnificent collection of over 44,000 pieces of Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities. Far from the stodgy and sterile setting of other museums, the Getty Villa immerses you in a setting of harmony with its art. The gardens, architecture, and views of the Pacific Ocean bring on a sense of culture and human appreciation to be found no where else. Entrance to the Getty Villa is free, but requires an advance ticket with a parking charge. Information and ticket reservations can be arranged on their website. The museum also has a fantastic cafe, very generous elevator access spread through the facility, and convenient restrooms facilities. Very friendly docents are everywhere to answer questions as well. Organized tours are also available at no charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BozBronco
50,Visiting the Getty Villa in dry California,"A lovely place to visit and enjoy. Just be prepared for the drought conditions. Lots of the water features have no water. it is sad, but understandable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolynz845
50,Wonderful place - just be sure to check THEIR web site before visiting!,"The Getty Villa is one of our favourite places, for its tranquil, relaxing atmosphere. We have been twice and we’ll go again.So many reviews, the vast majority deservedly way above average – unsure what I can usefully add.Much of the credit for the unrushed feel of the place is due to careful management of visitor numbers by an ADVANCE booking system. It works very well, in avoiding over-crowding. So, please, do not just turn up at the entrance and expect to walk in off the street. You will not be admitted in those circumstances, as some disappointed reviewers have discovered.The system simply requires that you make an advance reservation and it’s easy.You are reading this, so you obviously have Internet Access - just make an on-line reservation. Also, please don’t rely on learning all you need to know here - you won’t! Seriously, make the small effort to visit the Getty Villa Web Site and check out all the details THERE. If you can’t find particular info, then phone them – easy. A constructive comment about the Parking/Entry Fee:Admission to the Villa is definitely free, but parking costs $15 per car.The Villa is strongly geared towards visitors arriving by car. But, it IS perfectly possible to access by pretty much all other modes of transport. However, to do so, you absolutely MUST read and comply with the requirements at http://www.getty.edu/visit/villa/plan/parking.htmlAll the necessary details are posted there. The info is comprehensive and I’m not going to reproduce it here. Be sure to scroll down and see details regarding Public Transport, Taxis, Bicycles and even Drop-offs! All are possible - just, please, check their web site before you visit and you won’t have any problems on the day. It is well worth that small advance effort for a few very pleasant hours of interesting relaxation in a beautiful setting.I also strongly recommend taking advantage of the completely free, docent guided tours – those people really know their stuff, some of them are very entertaining and you’ll get a HECK of a lot more from your visit!ENJOY!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/John-Tropi

There is no charge for admission (hard to believe!) but $15 parking fee.The grounds and gardens are magnificent and well maintained. The Roman and Greek artifacts are stunning and well organized by subject (athletes, women, etc.).This is a must see when you visit the city of angels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halnkaren
50,A peaceful and informative Sunday Visit,"My wife and I decided to visit the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades. We ordered our tickets in the morning via internet with no problem. The tickets are free, but parking is $15. We live North of Pacific Palisades so we traveled down PCH. We needed to travel a mile pass the Villa and then make a U-turn and come back. There is no access from PCH going South; traveling from the North side of PCH only. Parking was easy and we made our way to the museum. The Greek and Roman artwork is quite impressive. The silver and gold artifacts are amazing. We had lunch at the cafe and the food was very good. We also walked through the herb garden. Because of the drought the water features at the Villa are not working. Unfortunate, but understandable. Great day for family, friends and out of town guests.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bobbyoyo
50,Beautiful,Hard to describe the beauty. The grounds gardens a must see. The Greek and Roman antiquities are what you'd see in Italy. $15 per car no entry fee. So worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/retirednene
50,Getty Villa revisited,"It's been over 30 yrs since the last visit to the Getty Villa, and the re-model of the museum's facilities and grounds are stunning. If possible, try to get here before 11 am in order to enjoy the tranquility of the villa's gardens and rooms. The 40-min architectural and garden tours run a few times during the day and the 40- min highlights tour of the Getty collection are offered only a couple of times during the day. Thanks to J.Paul Getty admission to the museum is free. Parking, unfortunately, is $15 dollars. One tip for visitors is that the $15 dollar parking fee can be applied to both Getty Center and Getty Villa provided you visit both locations on the same day,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GS2go
40,Very beautiful place. Lots to see.,"Very beautiful place. Lots of exhibitions. Should get a free video guide at the information (after the entrance of the museum, not the information between the south parking lot and the museum). Easy to use and give lots of detail explanation on each exhibit. Plan at least 2 hours for all rooms. Path to the museum from the parking lot is a little confusing. Should have more clear direction. Going up and down from several elevation until getting to the entrance of the museum.The admission is free but have to pay $15 per car for parking which is okay since the parking is an indoor structure. To go into the Villa (the museum), have to reserve a free tickets online. We got there later than the reserved time but they still let us in as it is not a peak time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Minami_SD
50,Make the Reservation to Visit!,"First, don't be put off by the fact that you must make an online reservation to visit this spectacular museum. There is no street parking so reservations ensure your place in the garage and help to keep your visit from becoming overcrowded. Unlike the ""big"" Getty Center, there are no popularly recognized names to draw people (e.g. Van Gogh). Yet the sculptures and pottery literally have stories that draw you in: the birth of Venus, Leda and the Swan, Hercules. We took the highlights tour and our guide was a true storyteller who helped us all see the art in different and unique ways. The provided artwork descriptions are detailed and great if you want to just walk and view the art. Tours, however, are free as are the iTouch audio guides. (Make sure to line up at least 15 minutes before the tours, however, as they have a limit of 25.) We enjoyed a break at the café, a little expensive but splitting an excellent mushroom pancetta was perfect for two. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/523MichelleB
50,A lot has changed in the last 20 years!,"Very nice, very high-level and well-run museum in an Italian villa setting. Much more infrastructure since our last visit. We took our time, taking about 4-5 hours to see the entire complex. The only hiccup was that it took about 10 minutes to drive up the entrance due to heavy traffic, and at least twice that to exit. Reel Inn Restaurant is a great seafood place just a mile north. Be aware that you need to order your free tickets in advance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kurteg
50,"Spectacular site, gardens, architecture, exhibits","This recreation of a wealthy ancient Roman country villa complete with atriums, reflecting pools, huge herb fruit tree and olive garden in a canyon overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The the exhibits of Roman statues, painting, pottery were amazing. Currently there is a silver exhibit of finely worked silver artifacts exceptionally well displayed.Down sides were that the California drout means the pools are empty. Also there was only one tour guide the day we went, so that two tours and 50 people were crammed into a single tour. The audio system works well but too many people in the tour makes it less appealing.Sign up online for free tickets and bring $15 for parking.The cafeteria was excellent but quite expensive. We should have split the $15 portabello mushroom sandwich that was big enough for both of us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sealbeachtraveler
40,Antiquities Take You Back--Waaaay Back--to Another Place & Time,"J. Paul Getty bought 64 acres of prime real estate in another century and directed his minions to build an elegant venue fit for those who like to time travel, imagining the lives, jewelry, utensils and coffins used by those who came long before us. The expanse of the buildings, the display of literally thousands of antiquities within, amidst sculptures and gardens that grace the property leave you feeling like a beneficiary of a man who left a legacy of history through art, which will ultimately define him as being so much more than his enormous wealth. While wandering the grounds and the hallways, you are made to feel as if you are in a state of grace. The highway makes it hell getting in and out but once you've reserved your tickets online and in advance, the Getty Villa gives you a taste of heaven, as envisioned by a man whose generosity has been extended to the general public to enjoy for a very long time. The only disappointment was seeing the ponds and fountains empty--clearly, a result of CA's drought. Diamonds dancing on the water in the pond that is situated perpendicular to the Pacific in the distance, would have made for an over-the-top experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PkbB_13
50,Great Escape from the Madness of LA,"We called for reservations ahead of time (necessary). The gates open close to business hours, so plan your arrival time. Admission is free, but parking is $15. We planned to visit the Villa and then drive over to the Getty Center (parking fee is included), but there was so much to do and see at the villa that we spent all of our time there. The collection is very impressive and the grounds, elegant. There are many Greek and Roman artifacts and sculptures. Throughout the day, free tours are offered almost every hour. For example an architectural tour, a garden tour, an exhibit tour. I think we took them all. The guides were very knowledgeable and made the visit more insightful. We found the entire experience to be totally relaxing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globetraveler30
40,Antiqueties of Rome and Geece,Entry is free but must book in advance.Give yourself a full day here to do this properly.Classic roman sculptures and the display of roman gold and silver from Normandy was exscuisite.Walking around in the gardens one could feel actually how the hi brow roman lived.Children friendly with lifts for disabled persons .Enjoyed the grandeur of this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354phillipr
50,Very beautiful place with a great collection of greek/roman antiques.,"I really enjoyed this place after driving through the horrible Sunday traffic of Malibu. The villa is really beautiful. I was a little bit disappointed but totally supportive of the Villa's effort to decrease its water use due to the drought in California. Because of this, the ponds were empty but still the place very beautiful.I really enjoyed the collection of antique jewelry and the amazing statues, specially the ones with the muses and Hercules.We also had lunch there and the chicken wrap and Mediterranean platter were delicious but a bit pricey.You need a reservation to visit, although I made it like 8 hours before going and it was fine. You need to print the tickets and although there's no fee for visiting the Villa itself you need to pay 15 dlls for parking and you cannot walk up there, so you need to pay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianarK4171VC
40,Worthwhile ancient sculpture display,"This beachfront legacy of the Getty Foundation is less spectacular than its hilltop cousin, but the collection is still very impressive and the grounds, elegant. Admission is free and parking, $15. Many Greek, Roman and Etruscan artifacts and sculptures.Print tickets online (they are free) for the time you want to visit. Apparently one can pay for parking here or at the Getty Center and use the same pass at both facilities on a single day, which is a real deal we hadn't known about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/selmer
50,Beautiful Grounds and Architecture,"If you are in the Malibu / Santa Monica area, plan a trip to the Getty Villa. Admission is free. You just need to pay for parking and get a timed ticket in advance. We took one of the architecture tours which was very interesting. It is a quiet, peaceful place and the buildings and gardens are beautiful. While you are there, take time to see the movie about the history of the Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianew166
40,Not what I expected...but lovely!,"My understanding was the museum was designed like a Roman villa, with that I thought it would be a redesign of a residence, but it is set up like a regular museum. That being said it is a great experience, the sculpture and other works of art are well worth the drive. Highly recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/363karnal
30,Yes and no,"Admission is free but you need to reserve in advance. The building is a tacky attempt to create a faux old Italian villa from a similar one found by archeologists in Herculaneum. For us this detracted from the excellent private collection housed here. Also we came to see,the Etruscan Art only to discover they have a very small collection and it is scattered throughout the Museum and so difficult to find u less you were prepared to read every single caption. The best part was an exhibition of ancient silver that was a temporary exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deena63
40,Spectacular works of Art,Great place to visit although not easy to get to. The art works and gardens are fabulous. Didn't like how the museum charges so much money for the food and souvenirs in their shop. Overly priced. Free admission but fee for parking.....the only convenient way to reach the Villa is by car..there is one bus that will travel PCH and stop below the Villa...but honestly how many tourist rent cars in Los Angeles. Maybe more than I suspect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/curiousreddog
50,Hot Day in Faux Pompeii,"The Getty Villa is NOT the Grand house you see from PCH. No it's tucked out of sight in the canyon.At first glance, you may think you're in the wrong place. But, persevere and you'll find beautiful grounds, wonderful art, and you will be transported back to an ancient Italian villa and get a glimpse of what life may have been like.I'm a 60 something native and this was my first visit. I highly recommend it and I will be back. Allow 3+ hours to really see it.Better yet, go in the morning tour- then eat lunch there and finish in the early afternoon. Th Villa closes promptly at 5:00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bellauno
50,Excellent visit!,First time visit to the Getty Villa. Had no idea it had such an immense and outstanding antiquity collection. We took three docent led tours; each tour was unique and the docents were very knowledgeable. This is a real gem in Southern California; a must to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventure2go
40,Great gardens even without water,"The landscaping plan of this villa is awesome, even without water in the pools. L.A. is in drought conditions so the responsible thing for the Getty villa management to do was to cut the water to the pools. The pools are painted the color of the water so it doesn't detract from the beauty of the place too much. The thing that does detract is the unattractive new wing which bears no resemblance whatsoever to the original buildings. It seems just stuck there with no forethought to the aesthetics. It does house a nice bookstore and auditorium, but surely more compatibility could have been achieved. The villa is a nice place to visit and wander about. The stairways are everywhere and steep so if you are not into climbing, take notice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chumbud
50,Ancient Villa Rises from Vesuvius' Eruption...,"The Villa is easily visited when in LA - just call ahead to reserve a time slot for parking - no ""walk-ins"" are permitted. I've probably toured it 25-30+ times over the years. Plan an 11:00 AM time slot so that you can have lunch in the restaurant on the terrace, or at the adjacent sandwich vendor kiosk - all while admiring this Roman treasure. (You pay a parking fee but admission to the Villa is Free.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,A touch of Europe right outside of LA,Not what I expected to see when hanging out in Southern California. The Greek and Roman Collections are impressive and the building is beautifully done. Great value in that you only pay for parking and there is lots to see.This is essentially a privately run museum focusing on The Romans and Greeks. Would strongly recommend visiting if you want to see Roman artifacts but it doesn't jump out at me as a thing to do while visiting California from afar.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrantH121

40,Greek and ancient Roman art in L.A.,"If you'd like a relaxing Sunday afternon strolling in an ancient Roman architectural/garden space (replica of course) then this is the place to visit. Very nice pave to get away from the LA stress. Although, I have to mention that the place doesn't look as good without the reflective pools (due to L.A. drought), and I found lately is over crowded with tourists. So if you can, pick a weekday to go (and you'll need to book your tickets online in advance or you won't be able to enter the parking lot), which is all free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beaxplorer

The renovation work (completed in 2007) has resulted in an expanded and fresh-looking venue. The museum is amazing and the current collection of ancient silver is worth the trip alone (note: no pictures are allowed in that gallery). Parking is $15. Be prepared to do a lot of walking if you want to see everything, but there are plenty of places to sit also. There are elevators and food is available.

50,Ancient Treasures in a Beautiful Environment,"Admission is free, but must be reserved online in advance. Parking is $15.00 per vehicle, and covered.We visited over two days to have time to see as much as we wanted without having to hurry. Recognizing that not all have this luxury, I suggest you reserve entry for as early as possible if you will only visit one day.There are a variety of tours and docent walk/talks offered. Be sure you get a copy of the day's schedule before heading to the museum area. The garden tour is especially enjoyable. Outside tours make umbrellas available as well.If you need a hat to be in the sun, be sure to bring one.We had the opportunity to see a presentation of ancient silver discovered in France that is here only through mid-August, 2015. If you can see this, you should.Food offerings are very good casual fare, well made and presented, and a bit pricey. However, they are not extravagant as long as you come prepared. There is a place to check things if you need such a service.If you are looking for Antiquities, this is a great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmgreen777
50,Worthy Stop off the PCH!,"Please make free reservations before your visit. And there is a fee for parking but not for entering the museum.

50,Amazing Architecture & Art,"This was an amazing place to behold with the vision that J. Paul Getty had when he began building this place to house his collection. The art was beautiful as was the architecture. If we had not traveled for ten hours from the east coast just a couple of hours earlier then I would have loved to stay longer. Admission is free yet you pay $15 for parking ($10 after 5pm). We did not reserve free tickets as they recommend, but the man admitting cars was kind enough to hand us ones to use. If you are in the area, I would highly recommend this museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieinTN
50,Beautiful grounds and lots to see,"We finally went even though we live 10 miles away. You need to make sure you book your free tickets on line prior to going because you are a time entrance. It takes you through ancient grounds of Roman times and garden. The landscapes are beautiful. Due to drought in California, they turned off the big fountains.All the statues are originals or replicas.The museum cafe's food was great. It's hot food you order and they cook it. Prices are decent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janet0728
50,Great collection in a beautiful villa,"The Getty Villa is a replica of a 1st century Roman villa, that displays exquisite Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities.Admission requires advanced online booking and is ""free"", but parking costs $15, and there are no drop-offs or walk-ins allowed. Still, this is a great value offer and the museum is absolutely gorgeous and interesting. There are two (free) guided tours offered: The Garden and The Architecture tours.

50,Unique journey to visit an ancient time..,"The Getty Villa was a truly unique experience. I came away from the tour (w/free ipad, audio) of the gorgeous grounds with a sense of having walked back through an ancient time and space. The layout was easy to navigate and filled with the ornaments and pieces of importance to ancient populations. A crowning, unique touch at the end of our day was found in the little outdoor theatre. It is a replicate of a Greek ampitheatre and is located on the grounds. On the stage, there are secret and singular places where one could stand and naturally amplify one's voice - a fun ""must"" for aspiring actors, professional actors, or just plain old ""hams."" We couldn't resist orating our favorite speeches there, and neither should you. A really special day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dancinggirl2014
50,Great collection in a friendly environment,"This museum is fantastic! The collection, including the structures and gardens, is amazing. They offer brief workshops, most of which seem to be free. I did one on herbs. There are also guided tours. The cafe is nice. And everyone there seems happy and friendly. It is a peaceful place to pass the time. However, it does get very crowded. The best time to go seems to be first thing (10 am tickets) on a weekday morning. Tickets are free, but you need a reservation, and parking is $15 per car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CYLau

Café on site or pack a picnic lunch and eat at one of the picnic tables. Now for the Getty itself. First make sure you stop and get a free IPOD to do the audio tour.

50,Ancient Art in a Setting that is a Work of Art,"The Getty Villa is more than a museum. THe setting is an integral part that sculpts the entire experience. You see art in a work of art. This multiplier effect makes each visit extraordinary.Ancient statues, pottery, mosaics and everyday objects are displayed and curated superbly. The grounds are beautiful, the parking easy and the scope of the experience should make this a ""must see"" for any visitor to Los Angeles. And, of course, it is all overlooking the sea.

Collections of ancient Greek and Roman art are really remarkable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruthg290
40,Architecture and art overlooking the Pacific Ocean,"My wife and I took a couple of hours to tour this great little museum. The biggest attraction for me was the main exhibit - the building itself. The building is modeled after the affluent villas of Italy. You can take in the decadent decoration and elaborate details of the home and garden. In each space of the house you can experience a host of arwork and artifacts from the Mediterranean.The museum itself is free, and they offer a handful of free tours and lectures. You have to preorder a ticket online prior to showing up at the museum. Parking is 15$ per car, and you cannot park off-site. You should definitely consider bringing your own food though. The cafe, while delicious, is not cheap. This is definitely a worthwhile way to spend a couple of hours, especially if you are interested in sculpture and Italian architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyD342
50,The Getty Villa,"This place was amazing! Beautiful gardens, wonderful architecture and lots of history. Be ready to spend at least 2-3 hours to enjoy every single detail.

50,Free Villa Getaway in Malibu,First off you need to get tickets online in order to visit the Getty Villa. The Villa has amazing architecture and gardens and a completely different vibe then the Museum. Even if you are not into greek statues and art this place should not be me missed and was one of the places we were still talking about a few days later. BONUS: if you visit both the Getty Villa and the Getty Museum on the same day you only need to pay for parking once ($15) - they will validate your ticket for the other museum just ask at the front desk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciaj327
50,Wonderful Getty VIlla,Absolutely beautiful! The art is amazing and the grounds are spectacular. We went on a Saturday late morning and paid our $15 for parking and nothing else. There were plenty of people there but we never felt crowded. We then went to The Getty and parked from free with our $15 validated ticket from the Villa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missybgolfer
50,Lovely gem,"This is actually big enough to cover in a day and is really lovely. Do check the exhibit schedule if you've gone recently, as it doesn't actually change all that frequently. They also have special activities for kids, so check before you go. And wear GOOD WALKING SHOES. That is a really hard floor, and you will thank yourself later.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuMomma
50,Wonderful garden tour!,"The setting and attention to detail are impressive from a historical architecture perspective and the art collection is as well. But I mainly came to enjoy the gardens and was not disappointed. I visited on a Monday morning and the parking was easy. I took the garden tour which highlighted the use and symbolism of the plants in Roman times. The views are awesome too. I ate lunch outside, a bit pricey but good. Bring a hat and wear sunscreen. Too bad Getty never saw this himself. Don't let that happen to you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanmF9763WG
40,Next best thing to a time machine,"Just a turn off the PCH and you're walking through a magnificent first century Italian villa. The classical art collection is impressive but you don't have to be into Greek and Roman sculptures to enjoy the visit. I'd come again simply to walk the beautiful and peaceful grounds. And you don't have to spend hours, an hour or two will go a long way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBC54
50,Getty Villa in Malibu,"My wife and I visited the original Getty Villa in 1983 but had not been back since the tremendous remodel that was completed in 2006. They have done an amazing job with the property and have created a very easy process for anyone to enjoy the facility and all it has to offer. Go on-line and select your arrival time and print your free tickets. Drive out PCH and arrive at the Getty Villa. Pay $15 for parking and stroll up to the auditorium where you will find a schedule of various tours. Sign up for a tour which is led by a docent with tremendous knowledge and insight not only of the facility, but many of the unique pieces. Don't miss the Harp Player or the silversmith's gravestone. Truly a beautiful experience just a few minutes from Santa Monica.After your visit to the Getty Villa, drive north on PCH a mile or so and duck into the Reel Inn for lunch of fresh fish at a communal picnic table.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RCTIII

50,Get Lost in the Past,The Villa is a must see. I miss the old Villa but understand the need to renovate. The location and the light is spectacular as are the incredible herb gardens. Inside and out a great half day adventure and place to get lost in the past. Book your drive on parking pass in advance and plan your visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smackie66
50,Wonderful Surprise,"This museum, located on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, far exceeded my expectations. The actual building is modeled after a Roman Villa in Herculaneum, Italy that was destroyed by Vesuvius in A.D. 79. The antiquities were collected by J. Paul Getty and include items from the Greeks, Romans and Etruscans. The drive there, the grounds and the views are also amazing. Definitely worth a visit. There is no admission fee but it costs $15 to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Myan60

40,Extensive historical artifacts and art exhibits,"If you're into art from the ancient periods, this is the perfect place. The Villa had a wide collection of artifacts from the ancient Greek and Roman periods. The Villa itself is a replica of old mansions and villas of ancient Greece or Rome.There is no entrance fee for this attraction but there is a parking fee of $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/517kathryng
30,"Overrated; ""free"" admission but mandatory $15 parking","The Getty Villa is modeled after a 1st century Roman villa, although it looks more like the Disneyland version (painted instead of actual columns, etc.).The Villa offers ""free"" admission with a timed advance ticket but charges $15 for parking and, to make sure no one escapes it, pedestrians are not admitted.The gardens are beautiful and well kept, although all water features have been turned off because of the California drought.The collections and exhibits are of limited artistic and historic value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cqfp123
50,Fantastic way to Spend a Morning,"I was the least excited from our group to visit the Getty Villa, but had the most fun! The staff/volunteers were very helpful, and the iPods with sound bytes for each exhibit were a nice extra touch. We really enjoyed the rare coin rooms and the outdoor gardens. Had lunch on the patio and was pleasantly surprised by the food - it was very good! Would definitely recommend the Getty to anyone traveling in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsnare
40,Good but Pools are emptied,The Getty Villa is really interesting and a must do for LA tourists.The Villa is beautiful as the gardens and everything is.Because of the drought in the state of California they emptied all pools and water facilities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrismue89
50,Could have spent an entire weekend,"The collection, temporary exhibits, gardens, architecture, and cafe are all outstanding. The staff is very approachable and helpful. The garden tour was very worthwhile. And it's a beautiful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N1590CQdavidf
50,Tranquil visit,"Key information is that it is free to enter however you must register online and book your visit. Note that access to only via the Northbound lane of the Highway and that you have to pay for parking.Other than that it is a very pleasant way to pass a few hours. I'd recommend 2-3 hours. The gardens are just lovely and well maintained, currently water features are not on and the place would look even better if they were working but they have to be seen to doing their bit. There is a brief film available that introduces the Villa and artifacts in the gallery are well displayed and explained.Decent cafe and a good place for a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruffwood1
50,Picturesque Villa with Amazing Art - and Divine Garlic Fries!,"The Getty Villa was my favorite between it and the Getty Center! You have to have advanced tickets through their online website to get in. However, it is still FREE. Just parking is $15.The entire villa was very picturesque so it made for nice photos, even though most of the pools weren't filled due to Stage 2 drought regulations. We went here in the morning and went to the information desk for a coupon for free parking for later in the day at the Getty Center. Make sure you get a receipt from the people at the gate where you pay the initial $15! I didn't notice that they didn't give me one but the young man at the information desk believed us that we did pay and gave us the coupon anyway.I really enjoyed the art here, there are a lot more sculptures and jewelry and coins here than at the Getty Center which had a lot more paintings and prints.The family fun center/room was one of the highlights of the Villa. It's designed for kids but even as young adults we had fun doing each of the three activities in this room - there was a stage for shadow play with foam medieval equipment to put on, a station to design your own vase through pencil rubbings, and another station to decorate some pottery with dry erase markers. The employee there was nice and encouraging and explained all the activities when we entered the room.We spent around 3 hours here including lunch, which we had at the cafe and surprisingly... they have the BEST GARLIC FRIES I've ever had!I ordered the Greek Chicken Wrap; it doesn't say anywhere on the menu that it would come with garlic fries so the fries were a delightful surprise. The portions are HUGE. The chicken wrap came split in two, and together they looked longer than a typical Subway sandwich. You could technically share this sandwich with someone else but I'm sure you'd want the full portion of the garlic fries to yourself.The fries were fried perfectly, and they were all nice, clean, and yellow, with a good amount of garlic, cilantro, and parsley, from what I could make out. It was simply divine. I feel the fries themselves are worth the total $12.95 price! The chicken wrap tasted fresh, but it didn't stand out flavor-wise.All in all, I'd recommend you come here at opening first thing in the morning, get the coupon for free same day parking at the Getty Center, eat here for lunch, then drive the 25min to the Getty Center to end the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dh375
50,Combine the Getty Villa with the Getty Centre.,"Paying for parking at the Getty villa, entitles you to free parking at the Getty Centre on the same day.A couple of hours at the Getty Villa, the museum building is a wonderful example of what a Roman villa might have looked like, and the art work excellent.Combining the Getty Centre where the buildings and overall complex as a whole are stunning, the artwork amazing, finish the day off with sunset and the lights of Los Angeles turning on.A great day out..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fvm54
50,A perfect day in Malibu,"You know that saying, if you live somewhere you never take the time see the sights? After almost 16 years in Los Angeles, I finally made it to the Getty Villa, thanks to the excuse of my parents being in town. We had visited the Hearst Castle a few years back, and I figured that meant the Villa would be a better option than the Center (which I still haven't visited). Roman and Greek art are among my favorites, and even my parents, who aren't big on museums, loved all the rooms and the layout.Best part, of course, were the gardens. Due to the drought, the water features weren't active and the infinity pool was drained, but none of us can complain about that. We're all doing what we can. It was beautiful nonetheless, with healthy green gardens and an area where they grow their own fruits and veggies, so we even learned about different species of plants.It was a fun few hours of family bonding. We made a day of it by driving down Topanga Canyon to get there (the scenic route) and grabbing lunch at Duke's, a Malibu staple.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Firecracker29
50,Rome in LA.,We enjoyed the Getty as it is so different from the hectic vibe in Los Angeles.It is a semi-peaceful oasis well worth your time.Even the drive up was an experience for we flat landers.It is a enjoyable stroll through the gardens and would highly recommend it as an educational stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bitburgboy
50,Step back in time to Ancient Rome,We visited here after the Getty Centre.I thoroughly enjoyed it. It reminded me so much of my Latin Classes at school.Like the Getty Centre there are Priceless Artifacts on display but the atmosphere is relaxed and friendly.The gardens were stunning. Unfortunately the main water features were drained due to the drought but still beautiful.So sad that Mr Getty did not live to see his dream realised.I really liked how the 2 Getty museums had separate themes.Note to management: It would be a great idea if there was a shuttle (for a fee) between the 2 places as we paid a fortune in taxis and waited forever for a taxi at the Getty Villa.Definitely a must see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosebuds63
50,A companion to Getty Center,"Another great Art Collection given to the world by J. P. Getty. If you visit the center first, and pay the $15 fee for parking you can get free parking at the Villa in Malibu. The Villa houses 1600 pieces of art from the Greek, Etruscan, and Roman periods. There are interactive session that are free, such as decorating Greek Urns, or art and drawing sessions. The Villa provides all the subjects and tools that are needed. A great way to spend a day, between the Getty Center and the Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JVK084
50,"Great thing to do solo, friends, family.","This is a beautiful villa filled with incredible action artifacts. If you are at all interested in Roman and or Greek history you will love it! It also it's just a beautiful place to wander around and look at the Gardens and relax. Unfortunately, due to the water restrictions most of the fountains are not flowing. But other than that the place is absolutely gorgeous. Admission is free and it is $15 per car to park before 5 PM. The reservation is required. You can make it online anytime on each half hour. The reservation is basically to have parking. You must print out your ticket and take it with you. And when you pay they only except cash and checks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robib_13

We were able to have an enjoyable time visiting the Getty Villa as it had Easy access parking with a last minute reservation calling in while on our way there .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SIDEROFF
50,Interesting tours and beautiful grounds!,"The Getty Villa is meticulously maintained and was endowed over 600 million dollars by J.Paul Getty to keep it that way! There are several guided tours to choose (architectural,garden etc) throughout the day from very knowledgeable guides. The museum and formal gardens contain Greek and Roman statues and artifacts. Had to pay for parking but admission was free and it was a lovely way to spend part of a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dharma2015

Restaurant is notable -- better than most museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClayLadyCowtown
50,Amazing,"What a jewel to discover driving by! We were supposed to have reservations but we didn't know that. Fantastic displays on pottery, sculpture, jewelry, paintings, and the grounds are so beautiful!! We only had 2 hours to spend there- not nearly enough. It was very crowded (on a Sunday afternoon), and my Mother got tired of walking. But the flowers drew her outside to photograph. :) I look forward to going back to see more of the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meCnewplaces
50,Charming and beautiful!,this recreated ancient Roman Villa is wonderfully full of artifacts.

The staff was helpful and it was clear they really enjoyed helping people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamdes2015
50,it really is quite lovely!,"We have visited here a few times as we are L.A locals. Each time, we catch ourselves discovering something new that we hadn't noticed on our previous visit.Watching the short movie at the beginning of your visit is well worth it as it introduces you to the history & gives you a little insight & a huge appreciation of what you are about to see. It's only short!!The Villa has splendid Pacific Ocean views that brings with it a welcoming breeze too. It really is quite lovely here! Meandering inside the building and strolling around the beautiful garden. It's beautiful!The cafe is very reasonable, offering coffees, sodas, salads, paninis etc.The Getty Villa itself is free, but you must BOOK online (& pay) to reserve your car. You can't just turn up - although you can walk in.If you are visiting L.A it's a wonderful complement to its sister, The Getty Museum, which is just off the 405 freeway on Sepulveda Blvd a short drive away (30 mins?). Both are well worth a visit and appeal to both young and old!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneK740

50,Beautiful,"As with the Getty Center, come here early in the day to avoid long lines for parking. It also has free admission (log onto their website and print out your free admission timed tickets ahead of time). Parking is $15 per car.The architecture is fantastic. The art is lovely. The gardens and grounds are beautiful. The views out to the ocean add to the feeling of being somewhere opulent and enchanting.They have eating options available onsite (café and kiosk), but we didn't have time to eat here during our 2 hour visit, before we had to leave for our next activity for the day.I would plan on at least 2-3 hours here, as we didn't see everything there was to see.Tips:An overview/orientation tour is helpful.Take note of where you parked your car (as there are several parking structures located on the property.)Most of the water features are turned off due to the drought water restrictions.Wear good walking shoes, wear sunscreen, bring sunglasses for outdoor portions, bring your camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLPlovesPE42

Thank you Mr Getty.If you live art, you will not be disappointed.Free entry. But need to book during busy periods.Well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seosamh_Pulvirenti
50,Absolutely breathtaking views and wonderful exhibits,"First and foremost, get here EARLY!!! If this is your first time, plan to arrive by 10:30 am and take The Highlights tour... It is only offered once a day, at 11 am. The docent will point out the highlights and then you are free to see the villa at your own pace. Do not miss this. A great place for lunch is at the cafe on the second floor.Learned a lot but the villa is about to undergo changes-- the villa will be organized chronologically as opposed to thematically. Nonetheless, this is a MUST SEE",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dermgoddess

50,One of the Best,"If you like smaller museum spaces - The Frick in NYC, the old Gardiner in Boston - then you will love the Getty at Malibu. This is a terrific collection in an amazing setting. Some could go through this in two hours, but I'd say take your time and enjoy a lunch - then wander around a second time and you'll find more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GayCouple-CA
50,Great Museum to while away the afternoon,"Great views, interesting place to visit. We stayed until closing. Great lunch spot too — they have a more upscale and a more simple kiosk. You can pretty much see what you want to see in a day's visit. Interesting museum store as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freeperson01
50,Viva the Villa,"A day after visiting the Getty, I thought it would be fun to check out the original museum, down in Malibu. Like the Getty, the grounds alone were worth the visit. I learned from the welcome movie that they were designed after a specific home destroyed in the Mount Vesuvius eruption in 79 A.D.Unlike my trip to the Getty, I spent a good amount of time looking at the exhibits. I really appreciated how they were organized, by theme areas, and found that rather than just looking at urn, I got to appreciate the themes celebrated on them, along with other art work along the same vein. So parties, athletes, animals were the subjects I got to learn more about. In addition, how the Greek, Roman, and Etruscan cultures blended together was also eye opening.Finally, we had a nice lunch in the café. I had portobello mushroom, with focaccia bread, and my friends had other Italian and Greek specialties, and we were all happy. Looking forward to a future visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbilmer
50,"One of LA's must-see ""attractions""","Calling the Getty an ""attraction"" is like calling the Lourve a gallery. This is an extraordinarily beautiful setting in the hills of Malibu, and one of the finest ""restored"" villas anywhere. Not only are the exhibits always beautifully curated and displayed, the buildings, grounds and gardens are worth a visit. This is a serene and peaceful place, and always a joy to visit and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/208kirkf

40,Nice visit,This is a lovely museum visit. You can't beat the cost for this cultural visit. So many wonderful artifacts. The grounds are lovely and the cafe is first class. The only downside for me was the traffic getting to The Getty from downtown LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/585lorir
50,Million dollar entertainment with Million Dollar Views.,"The Getty Museums are the best Museums in LA. They are smart yet approachable and best of all they are free. If you can either get one of the free parking spots or take the bus.The Getty Museum is a copy of actual Roman Villa that was said to belong to Julius Caesars father, that the founder John Paul Getty loved.The Restaurant is equally as amazing.Their lasagna is one of the best dishes I have had in any restaurant anywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmesaaz
50,Amazing museum,"I loved everything about this place. So full of beauty. Wonderful art, beautiful grounds, delicious food. If I lived near here I'd visit often. Every detail of the architecture was thought of from the ceilings, walls, floors to the bathroom faucets. I can't say enough good about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauramY7928OJ
50,fabulous villa museum and restaurant.,"beautiful Italian villa filled with Ancient Greek, romanantiquities, statues,art, gardens, and jewelry.excellent casual restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zippy808
50,BEAUTIFUL,"I went with a couple of my friends and its very relaxing. The environment is laid back and it has so much to look at! As a young adult I went there expecting to be bored, but its history and art keep you interested the whole time. Make sure to make a reservation beforehand you can't just walk in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/36carriem
50,fun tour guide,"loved the tour guidegreat gardenswe thought we were smart, parking on the street …..turns out you are NOT allowed to walk to the villawe had to walk back to our car and drive uphow about a walk way???",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/APChemistry
50,Wonderful visit,"We had reservations for opening at 10 AM. However, we arrived at 9 AM and were allowed to park and walk about the gardens. The cafe was also open. I recommend this, as it is very quiet then. Admissions are timed, but it gets busier as new groups arrive and the earlier groups are still there.There is no admission charge, except you pay $15 for parking. They accept credit card. You also sign up for tours you might like, e.g. We did one that did a few pieces as a highlight tour. We also did the architecture tour. There is a garden one as well. They are very well done and no fee.There is a brief introductory film that is worth seeing.The Villa was closed from 1997 to 2006 while it was rebuilt and enlarged. Now it is a gorgeous complex based on the idea of an archaeological dig. There are two different levels with walkways to the outer buildings. There are elevators and ramps, so wheelchairs can be used throughout.Photographs are allowed of the art objects, without flash. There are many funerary vases, silver pieces, minute cameos, and a huge assortment of objects going back as far as 2,000 to 3,000 years with many from the Greek and Roman periods as well. The paintings that were in the Villa prior to 1997 are now in the Getty Center. The Getty home is still on the premises, but it is office space and not part of the tour.Expect to spend at least 3 hours to get even a cursory walk through of everything!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Torte_Sue
50,Thoroughly Exquisite,"Some extraordinarily rich people spend their money on meaningless self indulgent extravagances (see my review of The Biltmore Estate). John Paul Getty gave knowledge to the public by exposing people to history and art that they might never get the opportunity to see. He left a legacy of educational gifts that is exemplary! The museum, which began in his modest ranch style house, and later moved to its current location, is dedicated to the study of the arts and cultures of Ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria.The Villa was designed after the footprints of the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum and houses a collection of art and artifacts that is extraordinary! This is a must see for anyone interested in art, architecture and history .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Idalucia
50,"A good place for ""Otium"" Philosophy... ;)","A nice where you can enjoy eating, playing, resting, contemplation...And that's what Otium is !Thanks to the charming guided tour, I enjoyed my visit of the Getty Villa !My tip : book the first spot to visit the villa (10 am), and if you arrive a little earlier (9.30 am), you will have all the villa just for you ! :)I wish I could see one of the play at the amphitheater : seems incredible...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/016010
40,Do the 40 min. architecture tour!,"As a former Latin and Art History student, this place really rang my bell after we took the 40 minute architecture tour. Before the tour, it was another beautiful, interesting place that J. Paul Getty sank some of his massive wealth into. The tour really gives context to how and why the buildings were built they way they were.We had no idea reservations were needed and our hearts sank when we were asked for tickets at the entrance. The good gentleman took pity on us when we told him we were from Wisconsin and he happened to have some tickets available so hooray and thank you!!There are so many nooks and crannies to explore here. And then there's the Roman artifacts and treasures. Getty was truly one of the best philanthropists to have ever lived. Take your time, enjoy lunch at the cafe (food is really good), and have a wonderful day!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seaLoves
50,Great place to visit and learn somethng,"We were there for about 5 hours and saw everything. The museum is just the right size and does not wear you out with all different collections from different eras. Getty concentrated on Greeks and Romans and his collection is fantastic. It is only two floors and easy to do. We did take 4 tours and are free and got a great overview of the collection. The only cost is the $15 dollars for parking, otherwise it is free. I have lived here for 60 years and never thought to go. It was my wife's idea and it was brilliant. I had no problem getting around and I am really old. LOL",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/923BobG
40,Lovely to visit but not exactly free,We enjoyed our visit - the security staff were actually very good entering into discussions about Roman Gods etc with our school age kids. We did not know you had to prebook the $25 parking charge - we thought we could rock on up and pay - it was a bit tense while we resolved the issue but we were let in. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kiwisam3
50,beautiful!,"Getty Villa is beautiful, its architecture and gardens are impresive. The collection of art is very good too, but the place itself its what makes Getty Villa worth to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriac892
40,The Getty's do things so well!,"A lovely place to wander and explore, inside and out. Amazing Greek and Roman antiquities in the museum and beautiful gardens. Everything pristine & perfectly kept. Our children loved spending time in the dedicated children's room where they could play, draw on urns and create some works or art to take home. Definitely worth a visit, particularly if you are in the Malibu area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelbug070
40,Really a beautiful spot - where's the water?,"After spending 4 hours at the Getty Center, we took the 20 minute drive down Sunset Blvd to the Getty Villa. The site is as advertised with spectacular antiquities on display - many more than 2000 years old! The grounds were well maintained although the location was quite quaint. We spent approximately 2 hours touring the museum and completed our visit with a walk into the massive garden.Huge disappointment was that all water features had been turned off due to the CA drought orders. I get it, but is dramatically detracts from the beauty of this site. I would hope that an area that traditionally only receives 10"" of rain per year would develop an alternate plan to recycle their water in their water features.Although I loved the antiquities and the setting, I'll likely not return until the water features are once again filled and functioning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkP165
50,Better than the center?,"We loved the Villa. We talked to a very knowledgeable guard about the villa and how Getty came to build it. The building is beautiful and the vases, sculpture and everything there are first class, some of them are so perfect you wonder how they can be so old. The cafe has good and pricey food for lunch. Definitely worth a visit, we went on to The Getty Center pay once visit both. We were late for our appointment time at the Villa and we still got in. Thanks so much! The traffic is so bad allow way more time than google says!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingartist_8
50,what a surprise,"We've never been to the villa before, always go to the Getty Center. Honestly, what a surprise - we enjoyed this place. Lovely museum. Liked the gardens. Driving to this place was traffic central but nonetheless this place was a fun experience. It's nice that parking is taken care of (if you went to one Getty location and want to go to the 2nd Getty location on the same day, you don't have to pay twice).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ready2Travl2
40,Great Value- Do you love history and museums?,"I will start by saying I'm not a huge museum lover! But that's just me. Everything was beautiful inside and out. I loved the gardens the most. That being said, my husband who is a huge history buff loved it all! It's very educational and a great study in Roman, Greek and Etruscan antiquities. Great value and worth a stop as you only have to pay for parking. Must have a reservation to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BabsUW
50,Not to be missed,"This is an awesome place to visit. A must see in your lifetime. Nothing else is quite like it. The villa atmosphere and gardens are wonderful, the antiquities fabulous, and the cafe is nice too. And it's free. Just get a reservation online, pay $15 for parking, and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nannerdoodle
50,Fascinating!,"The day we decided to visit, I called from the car, and was lucky enough to be given a confirmation number that got us into the Villa. We were so glad we went. We could easily have stayed more than the 3 hours we allowed. The grounds and Villa are stunning and the collection of artifacts are remarkable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeannefromNorCal
50,The Getty.,A must if you like museums. The guided tour and I Pod audio tours make for a fantastic experience. The settings of the exhibitions and the way that it is presented is most informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660nevilles
50,Perfect day to visit the Getty Villa (day 2),"We enjoyed the Getty Villa too! (yesterday was the Getty Center visit)Very pretty and loved the history /timeline room where you learn about all the invasions. Press the buttons that connect to the video. Kids who love history will love it and you get a mini-history lesson. The wall maps out the timing and it’s interesting to see all the history mapped out for you.Hint: You can skip the 12 minute video if you watch it online from home.The gardens were pretty with the grape vine cover, and the walkways. Very beautiful.The café’ was great! We were confused and saw the specials on the paper posted by the grill, and thought that that the 3 meals were all they offered, but then saw delicious plates that other people had. Turns out the menu is out front and we had just passed it. Lines can be long. We shared a delicious and healthy salad!Tickets: We got our tickets online, and it was quick and easy. Then a friend wanted to join us but couldn't get his tickets online (not sure what happened to that). We forgot to print out the tickets before we left home, but did print out the email confirmation #, and that worked out ok.Parking: $15 – wished we had been able to pay less, since we paid for yesterday at the other Getty, but we enjoyed it so much. Difficult to find our way back, since we were lucky to park in the beautiful and vast great hall, under the Getty, and not the parking structure.Note: Our tickets were for Easter Sunday, but the Internet posts the Getty as closed. There was nobody there that day. Hardly any lines, and very slow in the morning. Our tickets were for 11:30 am. Perfect day to visit the Getty Villa!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalkingInLA
50,Beautiful & Free Museum,Worth a visit. Parking is $15 and you MUST reserve your tickets online but they are free. You can only enter from the Northbound side of the PCH. Lots of Roman and Greek artifacts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J8063LRsteves
50,Excellent Tours,"A beautiful museum of Ancient Greek, Roman, and Egypt antiquities. There is no entrance fee but parking is $15.00. Plan to spend a few hours. We took the architecture tour and there is also a garden tour. We then wandered around the galleries with a self guided audio tour. A great cafe and a snack bar. Everyone who works there was very friendly and told us there favorite gallery. A not to miss attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susanretired2013
40,"Take a Trip to 2,000 Years Ago","The Getty Villa in Malibu is a design based on a huge Roman villa discovered in the ruins of Herculaneum, buried in the ash of the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 C.E. It houses all of the ancient Greek, Roman and Etruscan portions of the Getty collection.Access is limited, so you have to get a ticket for admission at a specific time. We went at 11:00 am on a Saturday. Tickets for admission are free, available on the Getty Villa portion of the Getty Museum website.Getting there is generally the biggest part of the challenge. The Villa is accessible only from the northbound lane of the Pacific Coast Highway, which can be, and on weekends always is, a traffic nightmare. But it is worth the hassle to get there. A parking tip: go to the top floor of the South Parking Garage–it is the easiest access to the Museum. Note that you'll have to pay $15 to park.Once you are there, take advantage of the docent-led guided tours. There is a free audio guide available, but the guided tours [FREE] are preferable because each docent brings his or her own perspective to the commentary about the villa, its gardens, and the collections.The Cafe at the Villa offers a nice array of lunch offerings, though the prices, as you'd expect, are not cheap. Expect a lunch for two to cost $40+.All in all, a very nice venue. We spent just over four hours touring the villa and grounds, though you could probably do a shorter visit if you weren't stopping for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sloucher
40,Very Interesting Exhibits,"We took a group of high school kids here. Great visit! Nice mix of indoor exhibits and outdoor gardens, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/46jeffa
50,One of the truly great museum experiences,"I can't say enough about how great this museum is. I had not been here for 30 years, and it is much improved and expanded. This museum is strictly antiquities, so if that's not your taste, it will be lost on you. Wonderful collection in a beautiful setting. Food in the museum restaurant is excellent but expensive. Plan to spend the day. They make a pint of saying that one pay one parking fee and go to both Getty museums on the same day, but I don't see any way to do that. Reserve parking in advance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HardGrader
50,Going Back To Rome . . .,"Me and my wife came to visit the Getty Villa on a very warm day recently and I really enjoyed my time there. Nice drive off the 405 through Sunset Blvd and the Palisades that takes you to Pacific Coast Highway [PCH] where the Villa is located directly across from the water. Admission is free but you just have to make reservations online where you'll be given a time to show up. Parking fee is $15... Drive up the cobblestone road and into the parking structure to the left. Take the elevators or in our case, the stairs, and you will see the amphitheater that sits in front of the Getty Villa entrance. If you go straight ahead you will see the concessions, restaurant, coffee/food cart and the pathway to the upper structure. The Getty Villa itself is a beautiful structure. I haven't visited it since before the renovation. It's architecture, many seating areas, courtyards, gardens and inner/outer peristyles are beautiful and so well maintained. Despite the peristyles not being filled with water due to the drought they are still something to behold, especially the outer peristyle. It's massive and you cant help but imagine how so many Roman villas during their time housed such reflecting ponds and such. It's construction is true art. I loved the ceilings, the long marble hallways and benches. Even the way the walls are painted are beautiful. I really respect Roman architecture and the villas is a great snapshot of that. The paintings, sculptures and artifacts are all very interesting. There are too many to name. You just have to visit and experience it yourselves. The several sarcophagus they have on display are intricately detailed and I cant help but be a little freaked out every time I see one. The statue of Zeus is amazing. I had to snap a pic of that. Of course there's way more on exhibit... There's a lot to see so I would say 3.5 - 5 hours would be enough time to spend here. The concessions were not so great but still something that can be enjoy. We had the peasant bread with the apple butter dipping sauce and grape slush. We didn't realize there was more food options outside as we went inside what we thought was the only restaurant. The food/coffee cart outside seemed to have other more hearty options. I would recommend to anyone to come up here at a nice day. Such a wonderful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/izzy_sparks321
50,Blown away!,"We were expecting that the museum was the house on the hillside that you can see from Pacific Coast Highway--it's not. Boy were we surprised that this $200 million project houses one of the most remarkable collections of ancient art and relics available to the public in United States. Before you do anything, start with the 12 minute video presentation on the history of the site and Mr. Getty. The Experience is incredibly curated and I highly recommend taking the garden tour and also getting the audio headset inside so you understand the narrative of the ancient items on display. It does very much feel like a step back in time twi thousand years to how the Romans lived at the time. It's a definite full afternoon adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidMarino
50,Very educational,"This place is amazing, the workmanship that has gone into replicating the villa was unbelievable. The artefacts were very cool especially the mummy first time i have ever seen one, well worth the trip out to Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kiwichic77
30,Nice gardens...relaxing,"We have read many good reviews about the Getty Villa and went there to experience it for ourselves. We were there for an hour or so, and we did enjoy walking in the gardens. Yes, the gardens were nice, beautiful and we did have a relaxing time there, but we did not feel that there was much to see other than that. There was an out-door theatre but nothing was going on when we were there. We felt that the Getty Center, located about a 35 minutes-drive away, is way better than the Villa in terms of what they have to offer for the enjoyment of the visitors.Admission to the Villa is free, but you have to get a timed ticket on line in advance to get in. One thing, if you are planning to see the Getty Center as well as the Getty Villa, plan to visit them on the same day, as you can pay for the parking ($15) at one and get a free parking coupon for the other one, provided if you use the coupon on the same day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffreySir
30,Strangely Unsatisfying.,"You would think that having some prime real estate right above PCH would allow some grand views but you'd be wrong. The ocean is just hinted at through the trees and the walkways that always seem to be at the wrong angle to enjoy the waves/beach etc, such a shame.Unless you are REALLY into Etruscan/Greek/Roman artifacts then spend about ten minutes looking through a gallery or two and then head to the gardens. The gardens are quite pretty, in a regimented way, the herb garden is the most 'human' if you catch my drift. Any more than ten minutes and you'll have a distinct feeling of deja vu as each gallery seems to hold identical/similar items ..over and over and over.We had already been pre-warned about the $$$ cafe so we ate before we arrived and after a few hours we left for the 3PM happy hour at Dukes where you can see the ocean without any problem.Clearly no expense has been spared in the location and construction but somehow it was slightly unsettling and unsatisfying, another reviewer mentioned that its more like a movie set and I'd say thats as close a description as you'll find. Once you've visited the Malibu Getty you probably won't have the desire to see it again which is sad as the people who work there seem to really care for the place, I just wish they had more to offer/show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewg239
40,Wonderful Place,"Firstly, you NEED to order tickets before arriving, and you need to arrive in a car, they won't allow you to just walk in. I guess they really need that $15 parking fee...The museum itself is quite beautiful, the grounds had a beautiful garden and fountain, I say had because the fountain was full last March 2014 when I visited but not today when I visited. The architecture itself isn't ""impressive"" but I like how it's easy to guide yourself through the Villa.They provide a free audio guide which I found very interesting, The grounds are still beautiful despite the drought, and the statues are pretty awesome, as somebody who finds this culture amazing, the museum was a must-see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heylookitsHerbie
40,Scenic museum which makes for a nice afternoon stroll,"While there is no fee for the museum they do charge $15 for parking. I would recommend you do both the Getty Villa and Center in the same day so you only have to pay for parking once although you need to have your parking validated at both places which is a bit of a hassle. The Villa is beautiful and from parts you can see the ocean. It's hard to see the line between rich recreation and actual artifact and at times you feel a bit like you are on a Hollywood set with painted architecture. The experience is worth it, but if you can only see one, I would spend the afternoon at the Getty center, unless you have a huge passion for roman antiquities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TryppAdams
50,Step back in time to a Roman Villa!,"This most remarkable part of this museum is that the building was created from archaeological records of a Roman villa that was destroyed by volcanic eruption. Walking through the house and gardens, once can get a feel for what life must have been like for wealthy people in Romanic times, even though you are thousands of miles (and years) away. You enter at the top and gradually work your way down to where the house is to give you the feel that you have entered an excavated site. The museum houses an excellent collection of ancient art. A highlight for us in the museum was to find a couple slow dancing in the room with the oldest artifacts--fertility goddesses from several thousand years B.C.. The herbal garden that would have been used by as their ""pharmacy"" was very nice. The only disappointment was that the long fountain could not be filled because of the drought. We chose the garden tour (which also included part of the villa). Each person gets a little receiver and ear phones which is awesome because you can sort of look at what you want while the guide is talking in your ear (but you can also ask questions which is better than audio guide alone). There was a cafe on site with a selection of drinks and snacks in the afternoon where we refreshed. There was also an interesting gift shop with replicas of a number of items from that period as well as plants.You need to get your timed ticket on-line ahead of time and show this receipt to the guard when you enter the property. There is plenty of parking in the parking garage there and it is a short walk from the garage to the place where they check tickets. If you go the normal route there are lots of stairs and up and down but there are also routes for people with mobility limitations. I would budget ~2 hrs at the property although you could probably see the highlights in less time. The guided tours were very informative so you would want to leave time for that. You can browse the museum without the guide, which is what we did since we took the garden tour. There are also excellent views out to the ocean from the villa gardens.It also can take a far amount of time to get from the Getty Center to the Getty villa. The highway goes along the ocean which feels very Californian, but the notorious LA traffic means that just going by google maps estimate alone is an vast underestimate especially if you end up in rush hour. We made it to both museums in the same day on a Friday in June without too much trouble. If we had to choose one, we would have chosen the villa because it is unique (due to the villa building itself). Just be sure to book ahead on-line!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaturePark_ArchSites
50,The Villa's Just Wonderful,"It's just a beautiful place, full of great stuff. The exhibit placards were very informative, and the arrangement of the art by topic was very cool. Also the food at the cafe was great and there was a fantastic selection of real books in the shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mongo2015
30,Interesting informative educational and pack your own lunch.,"The villa is beautiful well organized but sits by itself with substandard services to offer the public.The many numbers who have come to visit come hungry and prepared to spend dollars for an enjoyable lunch to complete the experience.The soup and salad we had for lunch still causes me to gag. Our salad was rotten. The soup, too.Beer and wine are offered if you choose ro drink your lunch.Visiting many real museums, such as the Louve and the Met and many smaller and always serving unfailingly good lunches one is not prepared for this ghetto act.McDonalds would be a five star in comparison to this gouging trick that one has not seen enacted since the sixties.Beautiful setting, here at the ocean. We opted to change plans and skip the other Getty ghetto. The horrible services make it Worth booking a trip to New York to revisit the Met, exhibits are better as is the food and services.Some folks visiting today brown bagged it. They were happy with their lunch. They didnt gag on lunch and saved fifty bucks.The better way to go if one visits here. Bring your own coffee, too as they deserve an award for the worlds worst.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Journeyman644
50,Like a trip to Italy!,"A delightful place courtesy of the Getty estate, you will love this secluded Roman Villa exact replica of the Villa Di Papiri near Vesuvius once buried in the ash of the epic eruption. The extraordinary docent tour guides provide a delightful insight to the Getty story and reveal treasures from his storied collection of antiquities.But wait... Before you go, get a ticket online as this is a timed admission and though it is free to the public you must book ahead. Parking will cost you fifteen dollars, a small price to pay fora trip to Italy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tpblyth
50,Beautiful and relaxing,"My husband and I chose to visit the Getty Villa because the pictures looked beautiful and the art appealed to us. We were thrilled with the grounds, the villa and the antiquities displayed. Top notch quality at every turn. The displays were tasteful and the galleries were not jammed. The building itself is a work of art. We spent many hours at the villa and only left because we still wanted to visit the Getty Center the same day. We also had a late lunch at the cafe and the food was unique and delicious. We will definitely go back the next time we're in LA. One tip: if you plan to visit the Getty Center the same day, make sure to get your parking stamped at the reception desk at the Villa so you don't have to pay to park at the Center. We didn't know to do this and the guy at the Center gave me a hard time about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZeGirl
40,WORTH THE VISIT!!,The Getty Villa is AWESOME!!The art collection is definitely worth seeing - what a variety!!A beautiful location and affordable attraction. Free admission with a $15 fee for parking - so worth it!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karen93550
50,Relaxing place.,This is free but you need to book a ticket online. We caught a public bus from Santa Monica but there is parking if you have a car. The Villa itself is a very nice building with lots of great art pieces. Not too many to feel overwhelmed and you can see most things in half a day. There's also a cafe and a coffee cart for food on a lovely patio.Worth the visit if you have the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ll1234567
50,Splendid,A real bargain at $15 for parking otherwise free the grounds are gorgeous and easily accessed off the pacific coast highway in Malibu. Sadly all the water features are turned off due to the ongoing drought. The collection of artifacts is outstanding and the building is breathtaking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Latta
50,Top Notch in every respect,"Thanks to all the TA reviews, we made the ""right moves"": book the tour well in advance, arrive first thing, take the architectural tour, leave plenty of time for the visit, etc. At first I was skeptical of a ""replica villa"" but the intent and the results of the Getty vision really makes sense. And the antiquities collection is world class. As were the special exhibitions. We traveled there and actually made a full day of it: breakfast in Santa Monica at Dogtown Coffee see the TA reviews), stroll on the Santa Monica pier, Getty Villa, Getty Museum (including our picnic lunch picked up a Subway), and even a sunset drive on Mulholland Drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pcyork
50,Striking Architecture and Gardens,"When you reserve your ""date and time"" at the Villa, consider going on the earliest time slot of the day. We were able to visit the gardens before the ""official"" opening and wander around the property with very few people around. The coffee stand is also open early, so what a treat to have a latte and look over the ocean and gardens. The museum is interesting, gardens are well maintained, and tours (free) are worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5nn
50,Beautiful experience,"We visited the Getty Villa on a clear day and it was fabulous. It's free entrance (but you have to reserve tickets in advance) and $15 for parking. We went on an architectural tour of the Villa and our guide was amazing. So knowledgable and informative. I would highly recommend a visit however the longer you can stay the better. We went in the afternoon and would have loved to have explored more but ran out of time. Also as California is currently in a drought most of the pools are empty, including the main one. We will definitely return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aus-vick
50,Beautiful and interesting!,"We arrived about half an hour before the museum offically opened and were welcome to enjoy the beautiful grounds. The quality of the artifacts is astounding, and the galleries are arranged in a very visitor-friendly style. We decided to take a docent-led tour of the museum highlights, and that proved to be an excellent way to enjoy the collection. Our docent did a beautiful job bringing the story of Helen of Troy (and the Iliad) to life with the museum's pieces, and she left us energized and eager to learn more about what we had just seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBFranks
50,Lovely way to spend the afternoon!,"Tucked between Malibu and Pacific Palisades, this magnificent property is both an imposing villa and finely curated museum. Lovely gardens and magnificent views add to the quiet grandeur of this destination. Have lunch in the restaurant as part of your experience. Several times a year, evening productions featuring rarely performed plays of antiquity are presented in the central outdoor amphitheater. There is a children's room as well, where they can draw a vase or attire themselves in an ancient soldier's costume complete with sword, shield and helmet.

50,Simply Breathtaking,"First don't go alone!!! If you carpool the parking is free! You can not park on the residential streets. The views of the Pacific Ocean are to die for, all the lush greenery...wow. The artifacts are also breathtaking, there are eating areas, a gift shop and lots of photo/selfie ops available. Everyone know how difficult it can be to entertain a teenager without electronics nowadays, my 14 year old was so intrigued, it really warmed my heart!! You can take your young children but it is very cumbersome and there are areas of the museum that you have to be quiet. But you will not regret your visit at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/402desereew
50,The Most Amazing Monument to the Ancient Civilisation in the US!!,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I am a considerable lover of antiquity, so any museum that specialises in ancient art will grab my attention, but the Getty Villa is truly an amazing place, experience, and collection, regardless of your level of expertise and interest.The Getty Villa has something for everyone. It's a wonderful place to go for a relaxing stroll throughout the gardened areas, for a small bite to eat at the amazing eating facilities, or to acquaint yourself with some of the ancient world's most accomplished objects.I have traveled to many museums to view their collection of antiquities and the Getty Villa's collection does not disappoint. They have some of the most amazing examples, across the board, in the US. The rooms are beautifully curated around central themes, which are easily consumable.The museum is the perfect size due to the careful curating, but make sure to leave room to gawk at the spectacular vista!If you are in the area be sure to make time for a visit; treat yourself! Tickets are timed and have to be reserved in advance, but are free, the only thing you have to pay for is parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiferinLondon
50,Do not miss!!!,"This a a reason to make a special trip to Southern California.. The place is magic.This is a gift to humanity from J.P Getty. The location, architecture,gardens...oh ! Not to forget the collections.The most sublime museum....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RAD10977
50,Wonderful place to go,Very nice and free of charge (need to book prior through internet) small museum. European art collection at a beautiful property.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRaupp
50,Italy in our own backyard,"It's been a good 5 years since I've been to the Villa and it won't be near as long before I go back again. I'd forgotten just how beautiful the Getty Villa is from the stone drive reminiscent of the Appian Way, to the beautifully manicured gardens, to the architecture addressing every last detail imaginable. Of course there are the actual exhibits themselves which left me wanting to return to Greece and Italy again. The villa is a wonderful escape from the hustle and bustle of the urban life set against an incredible backdrop of blue skies and the Pacific Ocean. No visit to LA is complete without visiting the Getty Villa in Malibu",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanneM882
50,The Right Scale,Almost intimate in scale. Full of historical perspective. Spend half a day in a full scale Roman country villa decorated with the vibrant colors of the ancient times. An immersion experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kiddydoc1
50,Beautiful!!!,The view from the top is breathtaking. Wish this villa was my own.Easy to get to and located in beautiful Malibu. You must visit here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FirstClass001
50,Fabulous way to spend a day!!!,"The Getty Villa has beautiful exhibits, artifacts, and gardens. The art and artifacts have elaborate details and are hundreds or thousands of years old. The pieces in this museum are very opulent and breathtaking. The museum is outside and inside, so you aren't in or out at all times. Pictures are allowed to be taken throughout except for a couple sections. There is a cafe on site, as well as restrooms. You can take guided tours or an iPod with ear phones that explains the museum parts to you. There is NO admission fee to enter but parking does cost $15, totally worth it. I would recommend this to everyone interested in art and history. It may not be the best place for families with young children, as they may get tired and bored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/girlcriedcomet
50,A gift to those who visit,Feels like a mini Louvre but with much better weather and smaller crowds. A great stop after or before a trip to the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalgaryFoodLover9
50,Beyond Our Expectations!,"We had an amazing docent . She was charming , knowledgeable and full of rich stories on Mr.Getty himself. The physical structure is just stunning as were the grounds. He clearly was a perfectionist and it shows. The area itself Malubu is truly beautiful! We dined the food was fabulous! We shared a bottle of prose I. I love the gift shop. I usually buy a keepsake everywhere I go. I left with a beautiful authentic cameo ring which I now cherish. I think this is certainly a must do for history buffs or even people just intersted in architecture!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonr636
40,Great architechture with many photo ops,"Beautiful coastal views and lots of photo opportunities in this facility featuring great architecture and art. We wish the water features were on, but understand their reasoning (drought) for keeping them off. The $15 parking fee was worth it and allowed us to access the Getty Center as well. Make sure you check out the orientation video at the entrance as it puts the whole facility into perspective.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JetSetFiend
40,Visit an Ancient Roman Villa Plus Learn about Antiquities,"Like the Getty Center, the Villa entrance is free, but you pay $15 for parking. The Villa plan is based on an ancient one located on the Bay of Naples. It is a delightful environment to showcase the Roman, Etruscan and Greek antiquities.. Also, like the Getty Center, art conservation is an important part of the activities of the Getty Trust. Good news for some - the collection is very big. I started to overdose on all the detail, however, so that's when we took an outdoor break in either the atrium or the lovely gardens! We took the garden tour they offered and it was entertaining and educational. There was a nice list of tours everyday. The cafe was good place for lunch. If you are in the area -- visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Betsy99
50,"Beautiful, interesting place","This place is the definition of amazing. I absolutely love how the museum is set in a house, making it feel more welcoming somehow. The architecture is beautiful, with a lot of water fountains, pools, flowers, garden statues, pillars, and balconies. It is peaceful, so you can just sit on one of the chairs and look into the beautiful garden while thinking about life (this is what I did, actually).The number of displays in the villa is fewer than the Getty Center, but it is still very interesting to look at. I like the ancient coin collections very much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Athenalim
50,Travel to Pompeii on the 101,"Beautiful Italian villa with precious works of art. The gardens are special. Take as many of the free tours as possible. Lots of great pottery and mosiacs here. Spend about 2-3 hours and then head to the Getty Center for the rest of the day. If you get your parking validated, the fee covers both attractions. I love it here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTWtraveler213
50,"Beautiful building, setting and special antiquities.","Arriving at the Getty Villa on a beautiful day is magical with the lovely mjseum and gardens. There is covered parking $15.00, but no charge for the museum. The antiquities, sculptures, painted jars and bowls are displayed very nicely. Currently there is a Special Exhibition of antique glassware that is from a special collection Mr. Getty purchased and is totally amazing. It is quite impossible to describe the wonderful gardens, outdoor porticos and grace of the buildings. They also have great educational opportunities for kids and employees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynnSeattle
50,Ancient Rome in Malibu - Who Knew?,"Irony is not dead. The best preserved Greek temples in the world are not in Greece, but rather in Italy at Paestum, and in Sicily. Also, the most authentic and complete recreation of a mega-rich Roman's country house and garden is nowhere to be found in Italy. Rather, it was built by a mega-rich American in Malibu.J. Paul Getty was preoccupied, if not obsessed, with Classical Greece and Rome, and in 1974 opened the Getty Villa, a museum dedicated to classical Greek and Roman art, which is set in a wonderfully recreated Roman country house based on a villa near Pompeii. This villa is still mostly underground, but Getty mapped it out and recreated it just off the Pacific Coast Highway on the way north out of Santa Monica. It is unique. It is wonderful.The art collection, though not overwhelming in size, is wonderful. The four gardens demonstrate thoroughly how much the Romans valued and how they used their outdoor space. Stone pines, better known as ""umbrella"" pines, were imported from Italy and planted around the rim of the canyon in which the villa is set. The food, Mediterranean in character, is alone worth the trip. The gift store is full of high-quality merchandise inspired by the museum.This is a place to spend a day. You'll pay $15 to park your car, but nothing else to get into the museum or grounds. After the first half-hour, you'll forget you're anywhere near Los Angeles. I live in Los Angeles, so for me, that is a good thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joel_Sandra
50,Amazing Roman Villa,"Everything about this location is amazing. Let's start with one minor detail entrance and entry fee. Walk-ins, unless you are a Malibu resident are a no-no. While there is no fee to enter the Villa there is a $15 parking fee, so load up the car. The Villa is a to scale recreation of a Roman Villa. There are countless, well at least it seemed that way, pieces of art ranging from paintings to statues to frescos on the walls. The restaurant was delicious. You order from a counter, but then find a table (inside or outside) and your food is delivered to you. Our table ordered a few items, but the most liked was the peasant bread (ours had a pear and pomegranate compote on the side). The view around the entire property was amazing. There was the ocean and the rolling hills behind. There are a few free guided tours, we went on the docent tour at 2pm. This tour was for the docents to practice different ideas. Our guide was working on animals and walked us around showing different animals and how they interacted with the people. The herb garden was outstanding. Many of the trees were beginning to sprout leaves after the cool winter. The fountain garden on the opposite side was quiet and tranquil. There was a lot to see at the Villa, I'd suggest spending at least a solid four hours or more there to be able to see most of the art and attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emmanuel954
50,A lovely way to spend the afternoon,"The Getty Villa is truly a gem. It's located near the water, on the road leading to Malibu. It was easy to find by car. I believe you need to make a timed reservation in advance so check the website carefully. Other than paying for parking, visiting the villa is free the enter. The architecture and gardens are really lovely and you'll want to spend some time outside so make sure to go on a sunny day (which usually isn't a problem in LA/Malibu). The collections focus primarily on antiquities (ancient Greek and Roman, etc.) and they do get some lovely temporary exhibitions. What I like is that the collection isn't overwhelming. It is very possible to visit the whole collection in a couple of hours, with some breaks in between to roam the gardens. There is also a lovely amphitheater outside, and I think they put on theatrical productions there -- I would love to see that. Oh, and the views from the villa toward the water and surrounding scenery is really lovely! Lots of opportunities for Kodak moments. Overall I really enjoyed the day I spend there and if you like doing something educational that allows you to walk outside in nice weather then you will enjoy this as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/314jp
50,One of the best museum trips in LA.,If you love antiquities like I do then you will love this place. You will love this place regardless. Walk around the museum then stop and have lunch or wine. Beautiful spot and serene.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Keleigh
50,A Must See in the Malibu Area,"We visit this area of the country once or twice and year, and after quite a few years, finally made time to visit the Getty Villa. It was worth the wait. The architecture was amazing - just beautiful. What is also amazing is how one man collected this vast amount of art and antiquities. This is not just a regular art museum; it is so much more. No one would likely get bored here since the different collections are so utterly unique. We loved seeing it all. Also, we had a nice lunch at the cafe. You need to make a reservation for the time frame you wish to visit. Although the museum is free, technically the cost is $15.00,which is for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiBowers
50,Awesome - GO!!,"It took me several years to get there, but it was worth the wait. I lived in California for six years and during most of that time, the Getty Villa was being renovated. During my final year it re-opened, but getting a ticket to the Academy Awards was easier than getting into the Getty Vila.I visited California several times in the ensuing years, but the Villa was either closed on the days I was there or I didn't have enough time to go. For this trip back, I planned everything else around getting to the Villa. There was going to be a family reunion and most of the folks said they didn't ""do"" museums. I told them that was fine, I was going with or without them. As it turned out, two car loads decided they'd ""do"" the Villa with me.OMG! OMG! OMG! Can you say out of this world?? If all you did was wander the grounds and never saw a single thing inside, you'd still say it was awesome.I LOVE museums and on my own, I would have spent the day there. As it was I got a few hours, for which I am grateful. However, I can't wait to get back and enjoy it more.The most amazing thing to me was the sculpture. Art and history are two of my strongest areas of interest. I grew up seeing carved portraits of Greeks and Romans in books. The statues and busts at the Getty are the portraits I'd been studying since grade school. It was a mind-blowing experience.What was almost as amazing was that theses ""kids"" and their ""kids"" that didn't ""do"" museums also enjoyed the Villa. The smallest visitors loved running in the gardens. One adult niece could barely be pulled away from a balcony with an ocean view. Hubby was blown away by the architecture. A teen-aged nephew was enthralled with an activity room where he was doing rubbings of faux pottery shards to create his own pictures.Obviously, this is a great family experience. One word of caution. When you first arrive there is a video to watch. When we got there, no one was in line and the volunteer suggested we look at the adjacent galleries. DO NOT take the docents suggestion. Moments later a bus load of oriental tourists showed up and there was suddenly a line. We had to wait through a second showing to get in. Not cool. The only blip in an otherwise perfect visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneSDallas
50,An Amazing step back in time 2500 years!,"What an amazing place to spend the afternoon! It's a museum that lets you get within a hair's breath of the art. The art is mostly Marble and Bronze sculptures and many guilded items... The reproduction of a Villa that was buried by Mt. Vesuvious, you can't help but feel as though you were transported back in time when you stroll the halls and garden!Best part... IT'S FREE!!! They do charge $15 for parking but that is nothing!You can see the ocean from the villa but the way it is situated, you cannot see other traces of civilization or the road out front.This was well worth the trip!Again, tickets are free but you must get them online to reserve a time. This is their way of crowd control.They also have an iPod guide that they check out to you free of charge with videos and music and special app that you type in numbers on art pieces that you can listen to deeper explanations on what you are studying!I can't wait to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricStarcher1974

50,A mujst see in L.A.,"The Getty Villa is amazing. A recreation of an Italian Villa filled with artifacts. A wonderful museum and history lesson. Lunch at the cafe is also quite good. Parking is $15, admission is free but you need to get a ticket on line to be assured of getting in. This is a cultural must when visiting LA (or for all who live here).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimH168
50,"Lush & secluded, it's a world-class museum","As a child, I watched the Getty Villa being built, and it's vastly improved over the decades. The stunning setting feels like Italy, and the collections, lectures, theatre & music are always open to the public. J.P himself never saw his beloved treasures ensconced in his chosen spot, but they belong to the world now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuRoo
50,Free! Only pay for parking,"Went here on my birthday, it was very beautiful and lots of interesting exhibits to see and enjoy. And not crowded so you can enjoy your time there.

50,Stunning re-creation off Roman Villa,"The Getty Villa houses the Greek and Roman antiquities that form a part of J. Paul Getty's collection. The collection itself is stunning---and thoughtfully arranged by subject matter--but the real star is the villa itself, complete with a number of gardens, that allows a visitor to imagine upper-class Roman country life. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NOLAfamily

50,Incredible Re-creation of the Old World,"Having spent time last summer at Mount Vesuvius and exploring the ancient city of Pompeii we were extremely impressed with the re-creation of what J. Paul Getty and his love of history, art and architecture produced at the Getty Villa, replicating a similar setting as in Herculaneum.They offer two free guided tours of about 45 minutes each which provide great information on the architectural side as well as the art and garden. The location is friendly for people of all ages. There are plenty of places for sitting and resting for older visitors. They have a cafe' that offers a nice variety of lunch choices, all freshly prepared right there in the kitchen, as well as a beverage concession with some packaged snacks.The only cost is parking. It's recommended that you sign up online to plug yourself into tour groups based on the time you'll arrive. Obviously, weekdays are very calm and enjoyable. We had a couple of different school groups there, but they were well-organized and working in small groups so there was no problem at all. We thought our time spent there was just excellent. Old World Europe comes to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SignorPicky
40,Lovely attraction - a must if in Malibu,"This building and its surroundings are gorgeous, the architecture, sculptures, gardens and museum areas are just incredible. There is a small kids area too where my daughter got to decorate a pot and dress up as a Roman and act things out behind a screen, she had a ball! We got some beautiful photographs from this visit as well. It wasn't too crowded and staff were very helpful when we asked questions or directions. The only negative point was we missed out on the beautiful water features as we visited during a drought so the villa was not allowed to run these. As a result, the outdoor pools were also drained. Of course, this is no way the fault of the villa, but for us it was a disappointment as this is a once in a lifetime trip for us and it would have been beautiful to see it in all its glory and splendour. However, even without water, the grounds are still beautiful :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTravels2785
50,Loved it,"As a non-driver, I didn't quite have the confidence for getting the bus so I took a taxi from Santa Monica, which was expensive but still think overall, it was well worth it for a fabulous day at the villa. At first, I was overwhelmed by the heat but quickly found there was many places to sit in the shade.There is a lot of fine art and sculptures but my favourite memories are of just sitting on the benches and taking in the atmosphere of the villa.Food was good, I had a wrap, garlic fries and a slushy drink that, for a moment, was so cold I thought I was having a stroke.The one niggle I had was when I was leaving and trying to find where I would wait for the taxi. I walked down to an attendant who sent me back up towards the villa. I sat obediently on a bench to be told by another attendant that I should not be sat on the bench, it was out of bounds. Apart from that, it was a fabulous way to spend the day and now I can tick it off my bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susiem538
50,Unexpected great attraction!!,"Yes, we never thought The Getty Villa was this great. The exhibition was very good, but the Villa itself... out of this world!!! Great construction, architecture... and the gardens... awesome!! Totally worth paying a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jose_a_rojas
50,Must see museum!,"This collection of Greek and Roman artifacts is a must see. The Villa itself is a work of art. Constructed by Getty to house his collection, it is truly amazing. Admission is free, but you do need a timed ticket. It was sold out on the Saturday we wanted to visit, but we went to the Getty Center earlier in the day, and the information desk there was able to give us tickets for the Villa. If you save your receipt from parking at the Getty Center, $15, you can use it to park free at the Villa. We used the Getty Guide which were iPods preloaded with info on the exhibits. Again, free. A great way to spend the afternoon in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmbeekay
50,History at its best,What a beautiful place to visit. Go early in the morning due to traffic in the area. We have traveled all over the world and the items brought into this museum brought back memories of Italy. We spent about 2 to 3 hours at the museum and the garden area. You ll like this villa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryybarra68
30,"Overrated unless you love Art, Scultures, European History and Mr. J. P Getty","Beyond the doubt, the Getty Center is better! So here is why I disagreed with the other reviewers and my logic. All the Art, Artifacts, Sculptures, Jewelry, Coins, Pottery and etc. are from Europe or emphasized Italian, Greek and other Old History of Europe. I realize this is a personal collection of Mr. Getty that the Getty Trust Foundation decided to share with the public however I just could get excited about seeing more and more of European Art that is everywhere. Now on to the little facts, unless you park in the community and walk down the hill then up the hill, you will pay $15.00 to park. You are supposed to have a reservation when entering but usually the gate guard will have extra/standby tickets. The house that can be seen directly from PCH is not open to the public maybe at a later time - I didn't' ask. The water fountains, reflecting pools and other statues that have water are not operational due to the California Drought. There are a few organized tours; however, we did not participate in the organize tours. There are no views from here because trees and other objects obstruct viewing. You can see partial views of the ocean ;however, the views from the Getty Center are 1000% better. If you are a true fan of European Art and History then you must go. If you are lukewarm, want to see views, want to see water and other Art then I would move this to the middle of your bucket list. There is a nice 12 minute film that explains how and why the Getty Villa was created. It was modeled after a residence in Italy that was destroyed by a Volcano. The Greek God section is very interesting. The Garden is also nice as well as the area where the reflecting pool would be. Please allow time to Park as well as time to exit the grounds. Do your research and manage your expectations and you will enjoy yourself. If you have kids, I recommend the Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdreynoldsjr
40,Villa in Malibu - Getty Museum,"What is not to like. The drive to the museum, the 64 acres of property, the amphitheatre, the gardens, frescoes, the 40,000 piece collection of antiquities, the buildings and the ceilings, etc. etc. Gift shop very nice and a good cafe. Truly takes you back into time, Greek, BC and until the Roman Empire Fell. Just figuring out how they found the items, shipped them to the USA and then fixed them or cleaned them or idenified them and then set in this Getty Museum is quite the task.Beautiful. Lovely volunteer team and architecture was quite extensive!!!!! Mr. Getty did good!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73helenew
50,perfect day at the Villa 81F and sunny,"Must reserve tickets ""online"" no charge and parking is $15. make sure you review the tours prior to arrival, currently the water fountains are turned off due to the California drought (even with the little rain we had). I also recommend lunch at the café. The museum has excellent souvenirs too.current highlight - Naples vases - collection from Berlin Germany (reserve a place for the tour). highly recommended MeuterMedia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeuterMedia
50,A gem of a museum!,"Everything about our visit to this fabulous museum was a first rate experience! The museum itself is a work of art, and then there are the antiquities and gardens. Wow! I especially enjoyed the Greek Pottery and the Roman statuary. The museum is two floors, and it is packed with beautiful objects to ponder. The galleries are well laid out and easy to maneuver and everything was so beautifully displayed, and the plaques were informative. After touring the two floors, we were saturated with information, so did not spend much time in the gardens, other than a quick peak in. The gardens are beautiful and peaceful feeling. The cafeteria was excellent and had a variety of options. The wrap and cheese plate we got was plentiful and the food was fresh. Parking was a breeze. Tip: If you visit the Getty Museum you can get tickets for the Getty Villa, which can be used anytime in the calendar year and you are not restricted to a specific timeframe. Otherwise, you must reserve ""free"" tickets online and arrive at a specified time for entry. Parking is $15. No drive-ins or walk-ins allowed. While some may find this a hassle, you will appreciate it once you are in the museum as it never got so crowded that you could not enjoy the art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/838CindyR
50,Must-see attraction,"We really enjoyed this!! We don't consider ourselves art museum type people, but we both like history. Traffic from Anaheim was quick and easy on a Sunday at 8am so we had already arrived around 9:15am. Although we hadn't yet made a parking reservation, we thought we'd start up the driveway and just check out where we'd be going when they opened at 10am. We were greeted by a super friendly parking attendant man who offered to 'take care' of the parking reservation for us and quickly produced tickets that would allow us to enter. He said we were welcome to proceed with parking and could then walk around and enjoy the courtyard, garden, and get a bite to eat from their deli until the museum opened. The next parking attendant (a women in the booth) was a little short with my husband but all of the other staff were friendly and helpful.We loved the opportunity to walk around and check out the gardens and courtyard areas before it opened. We got some pretty photos of the property and the ocean views before many people arrived. We basked in the sun on the amphitheatre seats and still had a few minutes to relax before the museum opened.There were so many interesting objects to see in the museum. We had a great time exploring and were glad that we took time to visit. It's a fascinating and pretty place to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Finalsan
10,Free entry if you park there for $15- otherwise no admission,"We were turned away because the policy of the museum is to not accept pedestrians. the guard pointed to a sign. he said. that,s the policy. Getty Oil...Getty Thinking...typical robber baron mentality. they probably get tons of government subsidies and they say the museum is free. You need a reservation or park on the premises...or with a tour...otherwise no admittance. i just waned to warn people so they don't drive all the way to Malibu or take the bus , only to be turned away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/montrealandre
50,Beautiful place showcasing wonderful antiquities...,"Who would expect to see a beautiful replica of a Roman villa once located in Herculaneum, Italy in Malibu, CA? J.Paul Getty's collections of antiquities are shown at this wonderful facility especially built to house his collection. Historians think the villa is a copy of Julius Caesar's father-in-law's house and was built as authentic as possible. Getty did not live to see the opening of The Villa in the late 1960's. Located on over 60 acres purchased in 1945 the site has wonderful gardens, as would have been planted at the original villa in Italy, down to the herb garden filled with herbs that would have been used in Caesars' time. The site does not charge an entrance fee, but you must get preservation tickets that are timed because parking is limited due to the terrain. You will be charged $8.00 for the parking. The collection includes one of the largest collection of Roman gold coins I've ever seen plus some very beautiful jewelry, pottery, figurines, statues, etc. There is something about seeing an artifact that says it came into existence around 700 BC when our life time is so short. How lucky we are to have these items to enjoy today. There is a lot to see...take the villa tour to get the information about how it would have been lived in in Roman times too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/byebye2u
40,Nice visit,"We stayed about an hour. No need to stay longer. We enjoyed the displays outside and the view more than the indoor exhibits. Although the herb garden wasn't that impressive. It was fun to walk around the back and look at the views. There are many free tours which seemed great but we didn't have time. It is easy to get to. There was quite a line of cars to go in to park. Overall it was nice for a one time visit, but not too sure if we would go back. Maybe we are used to the bigger museums and exhibits so we weren't too impressed with this. But it was nice for a first time visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/643annaa
30,Very pretty place,"It's inviting and peaceful, although smaller than I expected. The gardens were nice, and the exhibitions are nice, although I didn't feel that there was that much to see. If you're going to pay the $15 parking fee to see the Getty Center than I think it's definitely worth it to stop in at the Villa (you only pay for parking once), but I don't know if I would make a separate trip for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShevaLew
50,Spectacular collection and facility!,"The Getty Villa is an amazing experience with an even better location! While we were greatly disappointed that all the water displays (fountains) were all shut off, it's understandable due to the drought. Hopefully, on our next return, it'll be turned back on. That said, the Villa's experience was delivered in highly contrasting ways...Great: As noted, the location is amazing - right on Malibu overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The grounds are immaculately cared for and the space is very open to allow you to take your time exploring the Villa. Very relaxing for this family with a 2 and 5 year old.Not so great: The ""Family Forum"" - while it provided a nice distraction for the kids, it was somewhat underwhelming. It was tucked into a small room in the back of the VillaGreat: Parking - SUPER convenient and spacious. Even the parking lot was very clean. Very close to the main entranceNot so great: Cafe - While the entrees were reasonably priced, the options were pretty limited. The chicken strips and fries on the kids menu was not as described by the staff - it was actually just dry, grilled chicken breast cut into strips. The kids didn't touch it and my one bite confirmed why. The Peasant Bread was also quite a disappointment. It was nothing more than toasted white bread and some marginally flavorful jam. Certainly not worth the $3.95 for itGreat: The entree we got was quite good. Penne pasta with wild mushrooms and chopped bacon with a white sauce.Not so great: Bathroom facilities - while very clean. They can be hard to find. With a 2 1/2 year old fresh off diapers, it was always a mad dash to find a bathroom!Great: The art collection is outstanding. The artifacts from centuries (even thousands) of years old is simply incredible. My kids were on their good behavior (thankfully) so walking through the exhibitions wasn't as nerve-wracking as I had anticipated. That said, to make sure my 2 1/2 wasn't running around, I got him on my shoulders. This puts a lot less pressure on my back than carrying him, but security said I couldn't have kids above the shoulders. I thought that was a weird rule - am I the only one or what is the reason for such a rule?Despite some of the ""not so great"" comments, which can easily be addressed on a return visit, the Getty Villa is truly a great experience. No hesitation for a return visit and recommendation to others. Their website is thankfully very explicit on directions to the Villa, so I suggest getting those details there - it will be very helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tpn1997
40,"Architecturally, intellectually top notch, but where's the spark?","Getty Villa, Malibu, CAWhile visiting the Getty Center, we received our tickets and parking receipt to use at the Getty Villa in Malibu. Parking at the Villa is free if you go on the same day as your visit to the Center. The Villa attempts to reproduce an important archeological find in Herculaneum, near Pompeii, Italy, where an important ancient library was found in the cinders Vesuvius left in its eruption. You’ll find no better introduction to the architecture of the wealthy ancient Roman world than this.The museum contains a wide collection of ancient artifacts and offers unique special exhibits. Our visit included special collections of silver from ancient France and Greek funerary ceramics. Written explanations are included at the point of view. The standard collection has numbered pieces which correspond to numbers on the free audio guide, which is capably done.There’s just one big problem: how do you interest moderns in the remains of ancient life? The museum could do much more to enliven the visit. Imagine stepping into an area where you’re the ancient buyer of jewelry. The shop owner and artisans are there. You see how they did their handiwork. You learn what an ancient boutique might have been like.Imagine actors living out a meal with discussion such as might have taken place in an ancient Roman villa. The objects of the museum are duplicated for their use, and you’re directed to their sites after “the show.” Or imagine actors accompanying you through the villa to explain its layout, with perhaps a fictional story thrown in dealing with slaves, children, tutors, amour, etc. unfolding along the way.In short, by borrowing the best of museums from around the world, the ancient can be revivified and made modern to a visitor, who could be engaged to learn more about the ancient world.The views from the Getty Villa, the architecture, and some of the exhibits make it a worthwhile trip, but the possibilities for an exciting visit were unfulfilled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Proqual
50,A Visual Day-cation,"The Villa museum is based on an actual villa from Pompeii. They have an outdoor herb garden and outdoor theatre. In the summer, there are play performances. Each year alternates from comedy to tragedy. The art here is ancient Greek, Roman and Etruscan. Group tours are available as well as personal audio tours. I often come here just to relax and enjoy the atmosphere. You pay for parking but entry is free. While I love the art here, I would recommend bringing children here when they have a family day so there is more for little ones to do. Also, M-F there are school group tours, so wait for the afternoon if you would like to avoid the crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ntitled1
50,Classic History,"The variety of historical artifact items and paintings was very impressive. You arrive by appointment and park, then stroll at your leisure around the museum. The access was easy on the weekend and you should allow at least three hours to adequately see the complete museum. What a great place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amazinn2
40,"Mediterranean Villa, worthy of the Getty","Like The Getty, The Getty Villa is free admission, and $15 to park. However, you need to reserve a time slot ahead of time online, on their website; bring a print out of your time-slot ticket.As such, since visitors are allotted into time-slots, it never really gets overly crowded. There is only one entrance for visitors, and that is of PCH/Pacific Coast Highway. So be wary if Google maps or WAZE phone app tells you otherwise on how to get here. I've made the mistake of entering via their back entrance for employees, following a navigation app's misguided directions.You can cover the Villa museum area within an hour or two, unless you're spending vast amounts of time taking pictures. As I write this, the water fountains are dry, since the State of California is in a drought. Pity, since the front courtyard area looks so beautiful, otherwise.The museum area covers a lot of Roman and Greek art and sculpture, with the grounds luxurious columns to match.The food court has decent food offerings; not the most delicious, but satisfying enough. You will pay for it though... expect to pay around $10 a person, depending on what you order should you decide to dine here.Every Southern California resident should visit this place at least once. If you're from out of town, consider it worth your time if you really love Greek and Roman artifacts and architecture. It is a bit of a time commitment to drive out to the Getty Villa, as well as drive back. Especially during rush hour traffic, the traffic jams can be horrendous. Though, Malibu Pier and some truly authentic Italian gelato from Grom is not too far once you leave the premises, if you're looking for ways to fill the time once you finish here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/874chucks
50,Breathtaking - an amazing gift to visitors,"Do not turn up at this Museum without a ticket. There is no charge for admittance, so order a set visit time on their website and no stress. Parking $15. A little difficult to find off the PCH, but turn around at Sunset Blvd made it easier. Easy access to Museum from parking garage or drop off point - both by steps and elevators. This exhibit of Greek and Roman artifacts is just exquisite. Beautiful museum which is easy to navigate and walk around at your own pace. The gardens and outside is stunning. Saw many gardeners out taking care of the smallest plants. Respecting the drought so no fountains in use which is disappointing, but understandable. Nice cafe. Several timed tours within the museum available such as the the gardens or the architecture, so check them out on line and book your tour time accordingly. They have a cloak room so leave larger bags so you don't do any damage to precious exhibits. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventureExploreFun
40,Must See for Fans of Ancient Greece and Rome,"Excellent displays of artifacts from the ancient Greek and Roman Empires. All housed in a recreated Italian Villa. The Villa is impressive but the main attraction is the statutes, busts, vases, coins, mosaics, etc of ancient Greece and Rome. The artifacts were nicely displayed in themed rooms (e.g., sports, theatre). I enjoyed the Getty Villa but my two adult daughters and wife breezed through it in an hour and then waited for me to finish our visit. This place is ""free"" but the parking is $15 and timed entry tickets are required. Because of the drought in California, none of the fountains had water...kind of lame...how much water does that really save and it detracted from the attractive Villa setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msipple919
50,World Class Museum in Malibu,"This place is hard to find the first time you go. When going east on PCH, look for the sign and then get in the right hand lane. Exit before you get to the stop light. There is no entrance going east. When you park, take the elevator to the “Path to the Museum” Once your there, you are in for a treat. Take one or two tours to get an orientation then go off on your own with an audio guide. Plan on spending most of the day to see everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K2075BPmichaelr
50,Return often!,This venue is where one must return many times! Beautiful and meditative.Soothes the heart and soul.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saraleemacdonald
40,Well Worth the Visit!,"We reserved timed tickets online well beforehand (you cannot just turn up). Parking was easy - the $15 charge is good for both the Villa and the Getty Centre in the same day but too much to see in one day, in my opinion. The Villa, the exhibition and the grounds are all beautiful and very well presented. There are some guided tours but it was very confusing as to where to meet and at what times, hence we missed the one we would like to have done. Overall, highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruth44421
50,Wonderfull,"This is a must see if you are in LA! The place was one of the several properties of the Getty family and is a n enormous land in front of the Malibu beach, on the infamous Pacific Coast Highway 1. They started exibiting their private collection of ancient Greek and Roman art and later built a replica of a Roman Villa, with several statues and pieces exposes in several rooms.The pace is simply beautiful and you can spend the day there. The entrance is free but the tickets must be reserved on line and printed. The parking lot is $15, but if you are visiting both Getty Villa and Getty Center on the same day, ask for instructions how to pay the parking fee only once.The restaurant is also very good, but a little expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcels72
40,If you're interested in antiquities ...,"There was something about this beautiful villa filled with statues, mosaics, bowls, amphora, jewelry, and other items from Greece, the Etruscans, Rome, Roman Egypt, and other such places and civilizations that just rubbed me wrong. I wanted to love it and it would definitely recommend a stop if the subject interests you (particularly if you've never been to Greece or Italy). The galleries are manageable and thoughtfully presented, the grounds are beautifully maintained, and even the bathrooms are lovely. But there's something about the attitude of some of the staff and the whole energy of the place that just felt off.If you do go, four tips: get reservations on line on advance (admission is free but you need reservations and must pay $15 to park), go as early as possible because even with controlled numbers it gets busy, particularly on weekends, get the really great audio guide headset, and skip the line for the movie as you can watch it on that audio guide headset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kleic
40,Roman Villa in Los Angeles,"Tickets to the villa are free but you must book online, you cannot just turn up to visit. Car parking is $15 & this is paid on entry.

50,Wonderful smaller museum with beautiful grounds,"Situated on Pacific Coast Highway, the Getty Villa in Malibu has a commanding view of the ocean from its gardens and some of the open galleries. Built in the style of an ancient roman villa, the indoor and outdoor are integrated in such a way that cool breezes provide a pleasant cool environment even on the hottest summer day.The exhibits vary from time to time so look at their website for what is scheduled next. The objects on display include Roman and Greek antiquties and statuary that give you a glimpse of daily life in households of the distant past. The gardens include herbs and fruit trees as would have been found in such a villa in Roman times.It is a great place for families to visit, with ample room for kids to expend some energy without getting in trouble. There is an open air cafeteria that serves reasonably good food for moderate prices. Parking is convenient, but remember to make a parking reservation ahead of time. There are no nearby parking areas outside the museum's parking structure.All in all it is one of my favorite places to spend an afternoon with friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GloriaD121

50,Like it better than the newer Getty,"At the top of a hill overlooking Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, this is a great place to spend a few hours. Parking must be reserved in advance so call ahead. Formerly the home of this famous oil magnate and philanthropist, it is packed with art from ancient times through end of Roman empire. It was designed as an ancient Roman country house. Enjoy the Greek and Roman sections. There is a small café where one can have a snack or lunch at slightly elevated prices. Guided tours are available at no charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelfourless

50,Architectural oasis good for all ages!,"When we pulled up on at 10:30 am on a Saturday morning, we were informed that we needed to have reserved our (free) timed entry tickets in advance via the website. How could I have missed that?! My heart almost sank to the floor. However, the parking attendant took pity on us, said he had some extra tickets, and let us in. Parking is $15 but if you have a few people in your group, and spend at least a couple of hours, that's a small price to pay.Our 4-year-old wasn't keen on looking at the artifacts, so we mostly stayed outdoors, enjoying the open space and beautiful architecture. We took some wonderful photos throughout the grounds because it was so quiet. More people started to arrive closer to noon. We easily passed 2 hours just meandering around.The gift shop had some cute things but was not very extensive. Restrooms were clean.As we drove on the Pacific Coast Highway back to Santa Monica around 1:00, we saw VERY slow traffic headed north. Get there early to maximize your experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UCBGirl98

50,Wonderful sculpture collection and villa,"When we first read about the villa we thought it was a Getty Home turned into an art museum. This is not the case . The building was constructed, as an art museum, to represent a Roman Villa in approximately 80 a.d. They did an amazing job on the villa. We fully enjoyed watching the short movie about the history of the Villa. We loved how it is set up to flow from one room to the next. Very easy to wander and see the whole collection. The collection is mostly sculptures and is really amazing. We went first thing in the morning. It opened at 10.

50,You need more than 1 trip here,"This is a special place. So much to take in you need to go several times to take it all in.This was our first visit here. We had been to the Getty museum last month and it was equally amazing..Parking is easy and costs $15.00 which is cheap considering you don't pay an entrance fee to the Villa museum.Stairs and elevators make it easy to get around the grounds which are so nicely laid out.Staff is helpful and there to assist you and answer any questions.I would recommend getting the audio device to enhance your tour of the area. It really helps fill in with some great information on the superb collection at the Getty.Came here with my lovely bride and we had a wonderful time. We only where able to spend 5 hours here but we will return when we can stay longer and enjoy the beauty of the grounds as well as take in more of the collection.Art/artifacts from 2500BC.-300AD. is so nicely laid out. The different rooms filled with Greek and Roman items are well displayed and labeled to give you a feeling you are right there in the old world!Pottery, glass work and statues are plentiful and some of the most beautiful you can imagine. The grounds add so much to the art that it is hard to describe. You must go and experience it for yourselves.The landscape, gardens, fountains and Marble work is truly jaw drooping in its quality,workmanship and scope.Come and bring the family,probably 8 and up? They have family rooms to experience, with hands on things for the kids to do. Bring a pick-nick and sit in one of the gardens and relive living in Roman times.

I have always enjoyed the impressive permanent collection and visiting exhibitions related to the ancient world. The gardens and open spaces are just as they would have been in an upscale Roman villa, so be sure to allow time to enjoy them. Both the inner and outer peristyles are not to be missed. If you happen to be in town during one of the performances of classical Greek drama, do try to buy tickets. I've found the productions to be of very high quality.

I love that both Getty locations, Pacific Palisades near Malibu and right off the 405 near Westwood, are free to the public with paid parking. This allows for everyone to have the opportunity to experience the sheer vastness, opulence and artistic/architectural genius that comprise these two museum properties. With free educational tours on architetcure, gardens, art and more as well as events and lecture series, you could return time after time and always learn something new and fascinating. Opening to the public in 1974 and closing from 1997 until 2006 for renovation, the hilltop Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades now focuses on ancient Greek and Roman art, architecture and culture. You will be enraptured by the history behind every single small detail (ask about the significance of eggs and darts or the acanthus plant). Not to mention the sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean. A definite must see and do while visiting or living in the Los Angeles area. You could easily spend a couple of hours or all day here.

50,Greek and Roman Superfeast,"What a fascinating replica of a first-century AD Roman villa! We had a sunny, warm day to enjoy the delightful gardens and cool (in all senses of the word) roomfuls of marvelous ancient Greek and Roman artifacts to explore. Unfortunately, due to the ongoing drought, the water was turned off in the reflecting pools in the inner and outer peristyles, but a couple of the fountains in the side gardens were working. Nothing is more relaxing than the sound of a fountain on a warm day. The very interesting herb garden was stocked with plants Romans would have used in their cooking. The artifacts were all absolutely beautiful. I was fascinated by the high level of craftsmanship and especially taken by the amazingly thin but perfectly formed terracotta bowls the ancient Greeks were able to make. One of the Roman glasses was astonishingly like contemporary glasses I've seen at a friend's house, same color, same design. The artifacts are accompanied by brief, basic historic information. The galleries span two floors. There's an elevator. Entrance to the museum is free, but you must pay for parking @ $15 per car (note: per car, NOT per person) with all-day access. For the wealth of artifacts and information offered, I think this is a very reasonable cost. The museum has a cafe and a fairly large shop. The Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, where the museum is located, can be congested, so allow time to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/128MaggieL
50,Party!,"I've been to the Malibu Getty on any number of occasions, usually as a daytime museum goer. I definitely prefer .JPG's taste in antiquities to his taste in paintings or French furniture. This place however is an incredible setting for a party/gala. If you ever get the opportunity, go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
50,Well worth the visit,"We very much enjoyed the visit. The system of getting there, parking is well done. The garage is large and you must pay for parking. The Villa is most interesting to see how life was in the Roman times. The open air areas, pools, and the herb garden. The artifacts on display was well presented and amazing. It is worth the time to visit. Also the café has a great meal at good value",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/686peteb
40,Interesting place to visit,I am not big on sculptures but I found just viewing such old pieces of roman art pretty cool. The villa is great to walk around. Parking is too expensive for no longer than your there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soINInTraveler
40,Brilliant Experience,"After finding out the Getty Centre was closed on Monday's I went to the Getty Villa as my second choice. This attraction is outstanding, having been to Pompeii the resemblance to villas in this ancient city are remarkable. The collection of antiquities is fascinating and I can highly recommend this attraction. It is free to enter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonNewport
20,Unrecognizable,"Okay, I hate listening to folks harp about the good-old-days BUT... The makeover they did to the Getty Villa nearly ruins it for me. Remembering a beautiful villa nestled in a vale above the Pacific, I went back in October of 2014 after years of reconstruction. Oh my what a mistake! First as you begin the drive up the rough hewn paving stones you make a left and face a 3 story concrete parking garage. Yikes! Follow the signs for the museum and you are conducted along another concrete sluice-like structure, with all the comfort of cattle led to slaughter, to the side of the villa that is now abutted against a modern, very steep amphitheater that has no stage area, but leads to a walkway. So... you climb down the amphitheater? Or do you walk through the food-court to find stairs, or an elevator to the gift shop? All a very confusing jumble. The villa, has been lovingly preserved and the antiquities remain astoundingly beautiful, except for the googlie-eyed bronzes, I never did understand those, but the intrinsic beauty of the villa, at least for me has been destroyed. I give it a 2 only because once inside you can forget about that massive dump of cement you just escaped. Pity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carters12
50,A must stop during an adult visit to LA !,"Since most people visiting LA will take a drive along PCH toward Malibu . An unexpected pleasure await if you forgo the beaches for an hour or more and make a brief stop at the Getty Villa .You can't. Beat the cost , only 15.00 per carload for parking and the museum is FREE !You will find yourself as close. To a visit to the Italian coast as you can while still stateside . The Gardens are fabulous, the collection of Art and artifacts , splendid , in a setting that is amazing !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cocobay
50,"Wonderful, must see museum of antiquites","I have gone to the Getty Museum many times and it is a fabulous place. But the collection always seemed a bit odd. Wonderful paintings with a breath taking room of Impressionists. Each painting in the room takes your breath away until you reach the peak of Van Gogh's White Iris.But aside from the paintings I always thought the collection was eclectic with a bit of this and that without a cohesive thought. Went to the Getty Villa and now it makes sense.J Paul started collecting antiquities when he was in college. This is his passion. He decided to build the Getty Villa based on the plans of a home destroyed when Mt. Vesuvius erupted to display his antiquities in a setting similar to how they would have been originally displayed. When they built the Getty Center, the decision was made to keep the antiquities in the Getty Villa and move everything else.This museum is wonderful with it's small galleries in painted with color and with many decorative touches on the walls and floors based on what would have been in a home at this time.The admission is free with a small parking charge. You must reserve a date and time on line but we had no problem getting a reservation the day before to go on a busy Sunday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happy_Traveler4457
50,Love it -- feels like being in Italy,"Interesting collections centered around Roman and Greek life of the 1st century. The buildings and grounds are beautiful. On this, our second visit, I watched the 12 minute film on the making of the Getty villa, which was enlightening to see how it all began. The cafe food is a little on the pricier side, but delicious. We tried the Villa salad and the Portobello mushroom caprese sandwich on house-made foccacia; both were excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanineMB
40,Beautiful Area,"The Getty Villa is a ways up Pacific Coast Highway. It is the site of the original Getty Museum, before the on off Sepulveda was built. A lot of the classic pieces of the collection are still displayed there. The gardens are lovely and the view is amazing. Just a warning There are not large areas for young children to run around and the restaurant is a bit expensive. Still, it is a great way to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/warsblade
40,"A majestic, tranquil joy...","First off let me say, go early and have the place as much to yourself as possible.The Getty Villa is a meticulous recreation of a Roman villa and by being there with as few people as possible you can better imagine what it must have been like to have this as your home.Peaceful, beautiful, serene, majestic, tranquil, the adjectives keep flowing.Personally the building and gardens did a lot more for me than the antiquities collection but I know those who are interested would be enthralled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LDN_2009
50,A must see!,"An absolute highlight of our weekend vacation in Los Angeles.We spent hours there, relaxing on any bench, enjoying the view in the many areas and sections of this spacious inner museum and various gardens.As with the Getty Museum (at an enitrely different location), this is a must see, when in LA!(there is no fee, but you hgave to pay for parking)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dave-in-BOS
50,"Refreshing, serene, gorgeous: The perfect antidote to a day at Disneyland.","This beautiful site is a re-creation of the Villa dei Papiri on the slopes of Vesuvius in Herculaneum. We visited on a sunny day in October. The temp and breezes were exhilarating, the freshness of flowers and herb gardens relaxing, and the antiquities dazzling. Free to the public but parking is $15. Well worth it to grab a little slice of peaceful time in an otherwise fast-paced, jam-packed vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanhC4266IH
40,A museum dedicated to ancient Greek and Roman arts,"There is no doubt you will have a great time here, but I would recommend knowing the nature of the villa and what to expect. The villa used to be the only site for Getty's collections until the Getty Center was built. Now the villa is dedicated to ancient Greek and Roman art crafts - that's the only theme you will see at the villa. Meanwhile, the architecture of the villa, both the original Roman building and the contemporary add-ons, is something worth spending time to enjoy.Due to its remote location, very few people get there by public transportation. I would like to share my experience and recommendations. You can take metro bus 534 to get here from Expo Line's Culver City station or Downtown Santa Monica. It's a 30-min and 20-min ride respectively. There is a bus stop in front of the entrance. However, the villa doesn't permit pedestrians. You need to call a villa shuttle at the entrance. A shuttle arrived 5 minutes after I called.Also, be sure you bring your own food or e prepared to purchase food at the villa cafe. There is no restaurant nearby. You can get a good meal for 10 bucks or so there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeromecyang
50,Sense of living in a roman villa,"There will be many, particularly non-americans not used to the kind of philanthropy involved, who will have doubts about this place. But for most of us it is just a superb facility. It does give you a sense of what living in a villa might have been like with a fascinating building and lovely gardens as well as having an excellent collection of roman and greek artifacts. You'll need at least four hours to do it justice. Do try and get on a tour or two. We went on the architecture tour and then a specialist tour taken by one of the academics on staff. Both were excellent. The one disappointment was the decision to leave the majority of water features dry because of the drought. Very public spirited no doubt but it certainly lessened the experience. But leaving this to one side, if you like history, beautiful objects, architecture and story-telling then the Villa Getty is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllanJGJ
40,Fantastic architecture,"Overwhelming architecture, fabulous grounds but somewhat disappointing could not see the actual villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmartin6234
50,Another must in LA,"Second perhaps to the Getty itself, but nevertheless well worth several hours to explore the Greco-Roman world. Many fine statues (a knockout or three) and again the same careful descriptions & explanations, along with great views from its elevated setting, with the beach just a short distance away. Off the Pac. Coast highway and the best part of Sunset intersects right near the Villa so drool over the gated communities off it in your rental. There are kids, just move to another room; they won't stay long. Garden is tranquil. I needed to print a (free) ticket to see, although it was not really crowded you get the sense it might be at times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
50,This Museum Villa is my Love,"Even if it is a little bit complicated to reach the museum through the access way and the parking building, in reality, that is perfectly well organised. That requires a reservation before to go. The internet site is clear and easy to use. The access check points are like in a Swiss Bank. Anyone feel secure! A lady, the guide for the free of charge The Collection Highlight Tour, transmitted her passion to the whole group including the japanese children with us. The garden is incredibly out of time, we are in Herculanum, roman times. We had our lunch on the terrace of the Museum. It was delicious and very reasonably priced. The glass of white wine has to be mentionned. Excellent. The expresso at the coffee stand makes someone to feel in Italy. It is human dimension space and visit. Cross oceans and continents to visit this place. It is Unique.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Delanuit11
50,Wonderfully Relaxing!,"Even if you are not drawn to antiquities, spending some time at the Villa in Malibu is worth your time. The Villa was built to resemble a Roman villa from the same time period as most of the antiquities. The setting is perfect for Getty's collection. Be sure to start with the 12 minutes video so you know the history of Getty and his vision. We had lunch at the cafe and they had many great Mediterranean inspired selections that were delicious. A glass of sparkling wine really hit the spot. Views from the gardens of the Pacific Ocean are so beautiful and relaxing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nsnac
50,Looking for peace and serenity in LA...The Getty Villa is the go to spot.,"Love the Villa, its beautiful and peaceful, serene and interesting all at the same time. Great way to spend a morning or afternoon. I go during the week, as the weekends are more busy and more kiddos abound. Everything about this place is wonderful, the antiques, the landscape, the views and even the food is delicious. Bring your camera as there are so many photo ops at the Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimmiser
50,Don't miss this!,"Enjoyed this more than Hearst Castle. Could be a little difficult to find.Admission is free, but, there is a $l5 fee for parking ... keep your parking ticket and you can also use it for the Getty Museum.Gardens are beautiful. Make sure you get a tour. Reservations are a must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel200905SL
50,Not to be missed! You will never forget it!,"They require you make advance reservations, though I suspect that during the week there is no problem just showing up. The only cost is $15 for parking in the multilevel garage, and then an easy walk to the entrance. Getty was fascinated with the ancient world and so this is a collection of etruscan, greek and roman objects, all housed in a reproduction of a specific Roman villa.We took the garden tour and the architectural tour led by docents, both of which were very interesting and the 45 minutes went by very quickly. The gardens are beautiful and would have been more spectacular, but for the drought which had them turn off the fountains. the various rooms hold many treasure of many kinds, all worth a little time. They have iPods and simple headphones which work very well...just punch in the number by the piece of art and you get a short well done description of what you are looking at.There is an outdoor kiosk for light eating and lots of tables around it. There is also an indoor cafeteria where you place your order from a menu and they bring it to your indoor or outdoor table. It is nice and the menu has a limited but good variety. It would be nice if they had a restaurant as elegant as the Getty Museum, to go with such an elegant setting.I suspect that like some other places one has to visit it a few times to take it all in...this was our first visit and by the end felt just a little sensory overload, but in a good way. We shall return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saintjack
50,"Enjoy the Villa, as use to be in antique Roman period","Great antique art and nice collection. It takes abou 2:30 hours to see all. If you have te, go first to the Getty center and keep with you the parking receipt, than go to ""the Villa"", your receipt will allow you to have free entrance here.Its a nice vollection and a really beautiful place to take pictures.Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcos_mmdo
40,Worth a visit,We spent an enjoyable 3 hours on a Sunday touring the villa and seeing the art work. We took two tours given by the well-informed and friendly docens. Mr. Getty's passion for ancient antiquities coupled with his enormous wealth means that more people can enjoy the works that have been collected. Some of the works are quite controversial including the Getty Kouros that many if not most art historians believe is a very expensive fake as well as other works that may have to be returned to the country of origin. THe Villa itself is a masterwork of reproduction. You must make a prearranged reservation to visit because the access and parking are so limited. Admission is free but you pay for parking. You can visit both Getty museums in one day for one parking fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ptcvineyard
40,Nice,Very nice place for Greek and Roman antiquity lovers who prefer to combine their visits with interesting exhibitions and beautiful gardens as well as participate in special events .Free entrance just parking fee which is reduced late afternoon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dorit10_13
50,Gorgeous musuem and grounds,Absolutely beautiful! Everything easily accessable for the disabled. Maybe even slightly more beautiful if the fountains were full but glad that they are saving water during the drought. All the staff were friendly and helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BikeKaren
50,"See the fabulous Aeschylus play ""Persians"" in perfect setting","This spectacular performance by SITI Company NY is a 90 minute one act play in the ideal setting at the Fleischman Theater at the Getty Villa. While the seats have cushions it is a bit tough on the back to sit for the 90 minutes production but well worth it. It continues Thurs, Fri, and Sat until Sept 27. The special ""food"" available on Thurs is good food but not served in an adequate location - tiny plates and almost no place to sit (NO chairs) makes it not only difficult but impossible for people 70 and over who were not forewarned that this is the case. The food and drink were ample and delectable BUT having NO place to sit is unacceptable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westchicago
30,It is a spectacle,"This museum feels slightly weird, being a copy of a Pompeian Villa, yet absolutely pristine in every way.The exhibitions are spectacular and I have never seen so much Roman and Egyptian glass or Greek vases together in one place! Of course nothing American here so if you have travelled to Europe, give this a miss, it all seems quite pretentious.Spend the time at the Getty Centre instead where you will see at least some American art.Plus, even though it is free you still need to pre book online. If you can try to get in at 10.00 and arrive early to explore the gardens before opening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Muddy_8
40,"Fine museum, little atmosphere","This museum is strictly for admirers of ancient art. The exhibits are very good, no doubt. Personally, I cannot get so excited about these items (a friend took me there), and what I liked best was the collection of ancient glassware. Everything is housed in a single large building, a replica of a Roman villa. It is very new and therefore has a synthetic feeling to it. The ancient atmosphere is lacking, and the ancient items are (obviously) taken out of their appropriate context. The replica is just no substitute for the original; it is pompous, very Californian, and really not very beautiful. There are some nice gardens, but most of the water features were disabled, due to the drought. The cafeteria is very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brunor814
50,A slice of the good old life!,Not to be missed while in So Cal! A beautiful replica of an ancient Pompeian villa with magnificent art from the ancient world. I wish I could move right in!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Renaelee
50,"Beautiful, romantic, educational -exceptional!","My husband surprised me by taking me to the Getty villa. I e never been before so this was a treat. I love the Getty center but this is better. It's got a romantic and detailed feel to it with beautiful architecture and pretty gardens. Not only is the place nicely designed, it is also educational with a hands on experience. There is a room where you can draw on the Greek vases and pretend and dress up like you're a roman soldier. There is also a video room where you can watch a video of the Getty villa. The fountains and gardens are just beautiful and nicely done! There are lots to see and learn about. It's perfect for a romantic day or a family trip topped with an educational experience. There is no charge for the tickets but you need to order them online in advance. This is a must see place if you're in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alvinak2014
50,Exquisite + Delightful,Spent two glorious hours at the Getty Villa over the past weekend and my boyfriend and I loved it. The reconstructed villa is astounding and we took a free 40-minute walking tour highlighting some of its architectural features. (This was just one of several free tours being offered the day we were there.) The tour taught us about some of the basic features of the home and also added insight into what home meant for ancient Greco-Romans--and we agreed that we got way more out of the villa via the tour than we would have otherwise. A great site for a serene getaway. Make sure to book your free reservation in advance!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megalina14
50,Amazing and historical,"We were given complimentary tickets to go to the Getty villa, it's a place where you go back in time and is very historical, there are lots of old roman statues and nostalgia as well as a museum and wonderful gardens. Our only downside was the fountains were out of use to conserve the water.If you like archeology and a trip down the past roman era then this is a must visit for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonip1966
50,The original museum collection - just sad that Mr Getty never got to see it finished,"One man's collection of antiquities, one man's vision (and chequebook) for how it could be displayed. One of the nicest museums anywhere in the world. You have to book a slot in advance, drive up the Pacific Coast Highway heading north but once there it is a fantastic experience. Much smaller than the vast hilltop empire built later - but a nicely judged facsimile of a villa near Herculaneum with sea views, sea breezes and a real sense of period.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peaspatula
50,Get enchanted at Getty Villa,"Good value and a great selection of food. Yes, there is a children’s menu and it is licensedThe venues (also Getty Place)are worth at least 3 hours each. Google for a short video of the buildings and the stories associated in preparation for the visit so that you get the most out of it. The Getty collections are better than you can imagine. It is necessary to book an entry ticket on line for an appointed time so that there is controlled entry. The free guided tours are excellent and what is there not to like once you arrive, beats me. It was my favorite place in LA. Stella",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/908stellaw
50,"Art, architecture and gardens","Ancient Greek and Roman sculpture and artifacts. Lovely gardens, sweeping vistas. Right near the ocean so cool even on hot days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flyingchanges33
50,"Location, Location, Location and Great Antiquities","If you enjoy viewing ancient (mostly Roman and Greek) artifacts in a picturesque setting, the Getty Villa is the place for you. Right off the Pacific Coast Highway, the Villa, is just that. Built as a reproduction of a Roman Villa, the grounds are as beautiful as one can immagine. The views of both the Pacific Ocean and the surrounding hills are breathtaking. The ancient artifacts available for viewing are probably similiar to what you may have seen in other museums but it is the setting that you are seeing them in that makes the difference. If you visit this attraction, take the Pacific Coast Highway, if applicable, and be ready to take a lot of photos. Probably about three hours is enough time to walk the grounds and view all the artifacts. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roberte35
50,Fantastic collection in an amazing setting,"The villa is very beautiful, built to resemble a Roman Villa. The gardens and fountains, the reflecting pool need to be visited. The collection of Roman and Greek artifacts were fascinating. I love the ancient glass collection as well as the gold laurel leaf crown and the helmets. I took a lot of photos! Fascinating! Also while the entrance to the museum is free, the parking is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pomerols
40,"Fabulous architecture, beautiful art","We loved the architecture, the gardens, and the overall low-key atmosphere. the art was impressive, but we took the time to see only a portion -- too much for one afternoon, but that was enough time for a good taste. I think my favorite art was the blown glass. Many impressive statues as well, especially considering their ancient age.Pay close attention to the road signs when approaching -- do not miss the turn! We missed it and ended up in a nearby neighborhood of high-priced homes, with a twisty narrow street that was fun to drive but difficult to navigate.Visits have to be booked online for a specific time. this is an excellent way to control the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidBenz
50,One of my favorite places,"I wouldn't necessarily go for the art but the moreso for the grounds. The herb garden and fountains are absolutely astounding and my husband and I come here every time we're in LA. It's so gorgeous on a beautiful day and we have a great time walking around and just taking it all in. We saw lots of school-children there the last time and it looked like they have a pretty cool kid's area.It's sort of strange though you have to reserve tickets in advance (free) then pay $15 to park, but after you park it's free! No worries if you don't reserve ahead, unless it's a busy weekend.The only downside to the trip this time was that they decided to drain the fountains because of the draught. The fountains are so amazing when full and on!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kugali
40,Worth the Trip,"I visited the Getty Villa on the same day I planned to visit the Getty Museum. They are not one and the same. Admission is ""free"" but parking is $15. You can get a coupon from one museum for free parking at the other. Just see a docent or the front desk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbyjack73
40,An excellent collection of ancient artifacts and art.,They had the Byzantium exhibit as well when we were there.I'm typing now to fulfill the stupid 50 character rule. But we REALLY did like the Getty Villa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidwZ8047WC
50,Gem Attraction,"The Getty Villa is a must see attraction in Malibu California. The Villa was constructed based on a real villa from the Herculaneum area near Pompeii, that was uncovered after the volcanic eruption.It has been recently refreshed and is in pristine condition (ie: no peeling paint etc.).Honestly, it feels like you are in Italy: the villa is situated on a hillside, overlooking the ocean, with beautiful, historically accurate gardens ( both pleasure gardens and utilitarian gardens for foodstuffs).It also houses the Getty collection of ancient art ( mostly Roman and Greek).Architecture tours and gardens tours are offered almost on the hour, every hour. They utilize a wonderful amplification system - the tour leader wears a headset microphone, attendees wear an ear piece connected to a small rectangular receiver that can be clipped on a belt , waistband that enables you to be waaay in the back of the group yet still hear every word spoken- no need for pushing to get close to the tour director. The quality of the presentation by the docent ( we took the garden tour) was excellent.There is a beautiful outdoor eating area for the cafeteria/restaurant ( good menu offerings) but if the line is long, there is also a small ""snack"" kiosk in the back of the patio, where you can get drinks and also pre- made sandwiches etc. without a wait.Beautiful gift shop on the premises.And , did I mention that this attraction is FREE? Parking is $15 and limited. We did not do our homework - you NEED reservations ( online or by phone). We arrived around 10 am and were asked for our res. number ! ugh - we didn't have one, but the kind volunteer has 2 extra tickets and let us in, but I would not count of that being the case, esp. on the weekend or later in the day, so plan ahead and get those res. Take at least one of the tours, have something to eat on the outdoor patio and enjoy the beautiful art, house , gardens and location.Depending on your interest in art, budget at least 2-3 hours at the villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buckeyette

50,A Wonderful Collection,"This is an exceptional place to view an exceptional private collection. There are several tours, including a self-guided tour for children. The grounds are immaculate, and the gardens contain a variety of plants, including some that are not indigenous to Southern California. It is a lovely way to spend an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leslier832
50,A Beautiful Day at The Getty Villa,"We had just got back from an amazing trip to Italy. I had read somewhere that going to the Getty Villa was the closest thing to being in Italy in LA! So I made a reservation at 10am on a Sunday during the Labor Day holiday weekend. So we arrived at 9:30am. At the parking entrance, we paid $15 for parking (and they accept credit card), and gave the parking our attendant our reservations tickets. You need one ticket per adult. We parked at the first parking structure (South Parking lot). We continued to drive up to Level P1, which is the same level to enter the Museum. At that time, the Cafe was open.Right at 10am, the museum opened, and we immediately went to the right into the Museum Theatre where we watched a 12 minute film about the collection started by J. Paul Getty, the architecture that inspired the design of the Getty Villa, and the Getty's ongoing work to preserve antiquities. It was great to learn this background.Since it was a warm summer day, we decided to take the 10:30am Garden Tour, which was led by Jean. All the tours are free and you can find out the tour schedule for the day on the Getty Villa website or at the Tour Meeting Place. There's a maximum of 30 people per tour, but we had a small number about 15 in our tour. We were each given an audio radio so we can hear our tour guide. This was a 40 minute tour of the Getty Villa's four Roman gardens - the East Garden, Inner Peristyle, Outer Peristyle, and the Herb Garden. The museum also has umbrellas if you'd like to use them for shade, free of charge.After the tour, we decided to go back to the Outer Peristyle formal garden, where we walked around, then sat on a bench to take a good view of the garden. It was such a nice environment to sit and relax, and enjoy the art.My husband had a backpack, but no one made him check his bag in. As long as you don't have food or drink out in the museum, you were fine. We did bring our lunch and snacks, so we went to the Picnic Area to eat our lunch, which was nice and quiet, and in the shade.We looked around some of the galleries, and decided to check out the Cafe on the 2nd floor. There was a long line. We decided to go to the Coffee Kiosk, which had a short line, and ordered an Iced Chai Tea Latte for $3.75, which was delicious.Then, we decided to take the 2pm Educator's Perspective Tour. Our tour guide's name was Laura. This was about an hour tour that looks in-depth at special topics in the ancient Green and Roman world. Laura's topics were ceramic and marble and we looked at art made of ceramic and marble and went into deep discussion about them. We enjoyed this because she didn't want you to read the labels on the art. She wanted us to look and make our own observations. After the tour, we continue to look around on the 2nd floor.By 3:30pm, we had been at the museum for six hours, and decided to end the day. I definitely recommend visiting the Getty Villa and would return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennShio

40,Still one of the finest collection of Greek Antiquities.,"6.9.2014 Brought visiting relatives from the east coast to see the antiquities. The villa was thronged with many elementary school children on field trips so it was rather noisy. But it was good to feel their enthusiasm.The permanent collections were still every bit as captivating as I first saw them a year ago. This time around I got more and better close-ups to share with and inspire others. I'm very much awed by the exquisite ancient Greek and Egyptian gold jewelery circa 220-100B.C. The Terracotta Greek vessels, cups, urns are the finest specimens we've seen anywhere else -- dare we say Rome, Florence, Paris, Warsaw, Turon... I can't get enough. Check out my photos.Note: The grounds were looking a little dry in their effort to conserve water.The reflecting pools were drained because of the drought. What a pity!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells
50,Magnificent gift,The Getty Villa is gorgeous architecturally as well as in its gift of art to all people. What a legacy! Enjoy! Give yourself 4 or more hours to truly enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NEVenturer
50,A Journey back in Time,"Being minutes away from Santa Monica, Getty Villa offers a great experience for everybody. The admission is free and you only need to pay for their parking, which is $15 for each car. The parking is cheaper at $10 if you go after 5 pm. But you still need a ticket to get in, which you can reserve and print out from their website. The villa is a replica of villa dei Papiri of the Roman times. Going deeper in detail describing the experience my wife and I had would simply spoil your fun in your journey back in time when you visit Getty Villa. As mentioned by many other reviewers, attending the garden and architecture tours they have every hour would definitely enhence your experience in the Villa as if you have went back in time. The tours are very informative and nicely organized for everyone and located in front of the souvenir store. We planned to spend 2 to 3 hours in the Getty Villa before heading to the beach, but we ended up spending 4 to 5 hours there without finishing the second floor of the museum. It is a great place to get away for a nice morning or afternoon and entrench yourself in a Villa filled with Paul Getty's collection where you will have a pleasent time.ps. I've learnt from the tour guide that if you paid parking in Getty Villa, you can basically visit Getty Center for free because you won't need to pay for parking again and admission to Getty Center is also free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CKC206
50,loved it,highlight of my trip - fantastic place especially if you love antiquities - such a great collection & the gardens are beautiful. Café was good too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EildonLass
50,Tours are a must!,"You really must do the architecture and garden tours to give yourself a sense of history and perspective - and a list of what to go back for a better look at.In true Getty style no expense was spared in the re-creation of the villa. The tiles, marble, fixtures ... in fact every detail is superb. I'm not a historian or scholar of ancient Roman architecture but I feel fairly confident the research was extremely thorough.The Getty Villa is certainly an LA icon not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaisyQ3
50,Beautiful,"Beautiful museum full of Greek and Roman vessels, statutes and jewelry. It's modeled after a villa in Pompeii. The water was not in the reflecting pools when I went, but the concrete is dyed blue so it still looks good in photos. It is free aside from parking, which I think was $10, and you have to make reservations beforehand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404emilyc
50,Great oasis!,We spent a wonderful 1/2 day as we were migrating down the coast. The villa was really fantastic and both the architecture and artwork is really outstanding.Tip: reserve early as parking is limited and they might turn you away if not booked in advance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JSD_West
50,Don't miss this!,"The Villa was one of the best places we visited on our LA vacation. It was truly a beautiful place with outstanding grounds and art. You can read the rest of the reviews for details; it's obvious that everyone loves this place. I will note that it is easy to find, close to other tourist spots that you can combine into one trip (Santa Monica pier, Malibu, etc.). I was surprised to find a very nice parking garage at the site, and the number of vistors is controlled so neither parking nor crowds are an issue. The Villa is large enough to be worth the trip, but not so large as to bore tweens and teenagers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justusor
50,California or Italy?,"One could hardly wish for a more unique and beautiful museum experience. Strolling through this replica of an Italian villa I felt transported from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. There's lots to learn if you're up for a history lesson; if not, soak up the beauty of the art, artifacts, and gorgeous grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizzieHeff
50,"Two things to see, the art and the villa itself","I'm not a big fan of Roman or Grecian antiquities, so when I lead a group here, I spent more time walking the grounds (does take that long) and sitting and enjoying the view of the villa itself.The villa is filled with room after room of ancient art. One exhibit I did enjoy was on glass.You have to make a reservation (which is free) and the parking is $15. If you park also at the Getty Center (a half an hour away) you only have to pay once, but get a voucher.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tennisbump
50,Amazing!,"This is the most beautiful museum! Just the Villa alone with the grounds would be worth going to, even if it weren't filled with the most amazing Roman and Greek art. Vases, busts, statues, coins, jewelry, it is all there and so much of it! We were suprized at how big the exhibits were. There was also a great kids room where they can decorate vases and make shadow images with costumes as if on a grecian urn. So fun! I brought a 13 yr. old and a 9 yr. old and they loved all the items that had Hercules! It is such a high class experience we have seen nowhere besides Europe itself. So worth it! You get online for tickets, for free. And then you pay for parking. Would soooo love to go next time in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LS876
40,Uni,"We visited the Getty Villa which is in wonderful coast side location in Malibu. The admission to the Villa is free, but you do need to pay for parking. Wandering through the villa, which is a recreation of an ancient Roman country home, is an experience. We liked the beautiful reflecting pool and the gardens on the property.Couple this with amazing Greek and Roman art and sculptures made us feel like we were Roman royalty.It was an enjoyable day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
40,What an awesome museum,"I took my 3 teenage grandchildren to the Villa so they could learn to appreciate some of the ancient cultures and civilizations of our world history. The artifacts and sculptures on display are simply amazing and beautiful. This is an awesome museum and one I would visit again. In making our visit I got each of us a walking audio tour IPOD device which allowed you to enter the exhibits ""number"" and hear an interesting informational outline of the area or object you were entering or looking at, which was just excellent. There is an on site cafe/restaurant which features a somewhat upscale italian menu, which was also a little pricey if your feeding a family of 4, but was pretty good overall. We had early entrance tickets, 10:30am, and drove down from San Luis Obispo on the 101 freeway. Our travel was fine until we got off the freeway at Las Virgeness road and headed through the canyon toward the ocean and Malibu. Traffic was terrible, congested and bumper to bumper for about 10 miles with frequent stop and starts due to some road maintenance work going on. The next time I visit I will take hwy 1 (PCH) out of oxnard and approach the villa from the north. I went North on PCH after leaving the villa and had a great drive along the coast up to the 101 in oxnard with little traffic at 4:pm on a weekday. Best move I could've made by far. But back to the villa, upon our arrival we encountered a ""Check"" station as we traveled up the uniquely cobbled road toward the villa after exiting HWY 1. At the check station our entrance tickets were checked by the guard for our entrance time. They only give you a 15 minute window to enter the villa so they can control the number of people visiting the museum at any one time. Because our entrance time was early we were able to park in covered parking near the entrance gate and did not have to hike from one of the overflow parking areas. Upon our arrival at the gate we were given the option of taking the stairs up to a third level or the elevator. I would recommend the elevator to those of us over 50, because it is a hike up 96 steps to the entrance area of the first museum section and you may have to stop to catch your breath a couple times before you reach the top. In the first section I visited I found an Exquisite marble statue of Zeus that was over 2,000 years old. There are marble statues throughout the museum, all of which are excellent and very old. The history of all the pieces in this museum are simply breath taking and mind boggling given the craftsmanship and tools available to these ancient artisians. The museum is so large and filled with so many beautiful exhibits that seeing it all in one trip was not possible for me. So, I plan on returning soon to finish seeing this truely excellent museum. I should mention that while entrance to the museum itself is free, parking is $15.00 per vehicle, containing no more then 4 people each.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bencurry1
50,The best of ancient and super modern,"I am sure everyone will sing the praises of the beautiful setting and the pleasure of escaping the rat race in the tranquility of a careful reproduction of Roman opulence. I would like to sing the praises of the great docents and their free tours that really add to the experience. The Villa has kept up with modern innovation too, there are earpieces that make sure everyone can hear what is being said on the tours and also available portable ipod devices that you can take through the museum to provide more detail about the exhibits. If this were the only attraction in the county, and even if the ocean weren't nearby; it would still be well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/300daryls
50,Amazing in every sense of the word,"It is absolutely beautiful to hang around here and look at the beautiful Greek and Roman art sculptures housed within and all through the gardens! The Getty Villa is a reproduction of a large Villa they unearthed in Pompei, Italy.Most art is now housed at the Getty Center in Bel Air. This Villa offers you the opportunity to stroll along Malibu, walk around it's beautiful rooms and gardens and just soak in the sun and maybe catch a good bite to eat up there upscale café.Take a friend and make a reservation. The parking fee is $15 per car regardless of how many people you take inside the Villa. Admission is always free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler4k
50,If you are a history or antiquties buff - not to be missed!,"This villa is modeled after a first-century Roman country house, the Villa dei Papiri in Herculaneum, Italy. All artifacts are displayed in beautiful settings. We spent several hours at the Villa and had lunch at the café. The villa is a great place to visit whether you are solo, a couple, or have a family with you. Our family group included two little girls - ages 5 and 3 - who had a fun day. There is no entry fee, but a $15 parking levy per vehicle. Timed tickets are available online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoadWarriorFromPA
50,Easy to miss but you shouldn't!,We were doing the 101 drive LAX to SFO. Hadn't gotten very far when we saw a little sign off to the right pointing to the villa. We pulled in on a whim. Villa entrance is free but it's $15 to park. Tours are free and I recommend any you have time for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marylynnduncan
50,An Amazing Site in LA that has nothing to do with the film industry,"This museum of classical antiquity is unique in the world. In an outstanding location nestled in a scenic rocky valley, quite near the beach in Malibu, CA, is the exceptional recreation of a luxurious 1st century Roman seaside villa, modeled after an excavated ruin near Pompeii. The benefactor of this lavish scholarly extravaganza, the billionaire Texas oilman, J Paul Getty, was deeply impressed by Roman culture. Deeply enough that, over a period of years in the 1970s, he spent hundreds of millions to build this expansive and tasteful institution, and stock it full of thousands of priceless artifacts, and an army of specialists to curate them. Its spare-no-expense display and collections, no joke, are second to none--the only rivals I have personal knowledge of are the British Museum in London and the Vatican in Rome. There are extensive historically accurate gardens, theatres, pavilions, a gorgeous restaurant with excellent menu, the latest audio visual assets, libraries for scholars, and not least, the daily, sunny breezy orange-scented LA climate. Give yourself an entire day to visit this unusual museum,.. especially, if you have existing interest in Greco-Roman art and history. We went on a weekday, to avoid crowds. But the entrance is routinely closed once a certain number of people enter. Make an entry reservation.Very highly recommended.Note, this is not a place to take small children - they will be bored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scott890
40,Must see for your Museum Day,"Wonderful Museum built as replica of Pompei Villa to house Greek, Roman and Etruscan artifacts in their proper setting. Gardens and rooms reflecting period correct setting is quite marvelous and very enjoyable. A national treasure considering both the antiquities and how thoughtfully they are displayed. Very nice restaurant also, we enjoyed the mediterranean specialities at reasonable prices, so no need to rush your visit to dash off for lunch. This is great for the historian or those simply interested in a leisurely stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/motorhead01
50,You don't want to miss this...,"FREE ADMISSION, $15 per vehicleMake reservations online for your entry time and away you go!Beautiful, serene grounds featuring Greek and Roman art and statues.Amazing architecture, perfectly groomed gardens.I liked it better than the larger Getty Center plus it's close to the beach and Malibu!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Willow_roots
50,Great photo-ops,"Perfectly manicured and well designed. Very vibrant colors, especially in a region in the midst of a drought. The pools were drained due to lack of water, but the staining from the chlorine made it appear as if they were still full of water, which didn't affect photos at all. Great opportunity for pictures and enjoying a little peace from the hustle of Los Angeles. Free admission (must print tickets online in advance) but must pay $15 for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phuc2014
50,Antiquity Remix,"I like to read the negative comments before writing a review and yes the Getty Villa is not Italy. You don't go there to see Trajan's Column; you don't go there to see the ruins of Pompeii; you don't go there to have a genuine Italian experience. This is a different sort of visit. You go there to see what a Roman Villa might have looked like before 2 millennium of decay; you go there to admire - or distain - what extreme wealth can build and buy; you go there to relax in the tranquil gardens tucked into a cleft of the Malibu coast; you go there to discover artifacts of antiquity, now revealed because they are not overshadowed by an icon of civilization.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/floh1203
50,A little slice of ancient Rome!,"First of all it is FREE ADMISSION. You need to make reservations however, getty.edu. I felt like I had gone back to ancient Rome. It's atop a hill on Pacific Coast Hwy in Palisades, Ca. Do not get it confused with the Getty Museum in L.A.It is accessible via public transit, and don't panic you do not have to scale the hill if you get there by bus. There is a van that will drive down to the guard area at the foot of the hill and pick you up. If you drive, parking is 15.00.Lovely grounds and statues and artifacts. Great cafe and you will again love the gardens. Get a Getty Guide and an iPod Touch from the museum and tour the museum. My son and I mapped out what we wanted to look at since we were on a time schedule trying be on time to catch the public transit back to L.A. and then back to Lancaster, Ca where we were staying.You really need two days to see everything. They have a hands on room where you can do a shadow play and where you can touch things. My son was 12 at the time and wander on his own for a while while I sat in the outside garden, we enjoyed our day and ended it with a quick bite from the cafe where we sat outside in the California sun.The Getty Villa is directly across from the beach and we watched the sunset as we waited for our bus as we left. It was a lovely day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJones1589
50,Gorgeous Place,"Not only is the setting and the architecture and gardens stunning, but the art is fascinating too. I went with my teenage son and parked him on a bench near the gardens (he hates art) and enjoyed being in such a magnificent setting. I would go early as the place was starting to get a bit crowded by the time we left (around 11:30) even with the times entries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kay64
50,Time well spent,"A wonderful oasis of gardens, art work and buildings make this a worthwhile place to visit. Close to the beaches and restaurants of Malibu, so easy to visit the villa and then head over to Malibu for eats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzzie_m
50,A beautiful place,parking is $15 but free admission (I can't believe it!). This is such a wonderful place. We spent 2 1/2 hours here and really enjoyed this trip. Sign up online and get your ticket first. You need to show the ticket at the entrance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/690vickyh
50,Free?,"What attraction is free in LA? Not too many but the Getty Villa is. The parking is not free but it's no big deal because it put you into a great place. We took the tours and were blown away at this Getty guy. What a MAN! to save a preserve all this history in Los Angeles? this man had such vision. we went to the Getty Center two years ago and were also amazed. This is a man, with all his riches, gave back to the community.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cappie808

50,Ancient art in a beautiful location,"Smaller than The Getty Center, the Villa houses beautiful sculpture and ancient art.

50,like you needed another reason to drive down PCH,"You will love the Getty Villa if not for the history and art then for the setting alone. The Villa is built into a canyon on the coast near Malibu. The views are completely stunning. The grounds are beautiful with many trees and well kept gardens. If you ever been to museums and wondered what happened to all the sculptures heads, they are all here in the Villa. They also have an impressive collection of burial markers that would have lined the roadside. Admission is free, parking is not. However, you need to make a reservation in advance of your visit. To top it all off they have nice food and serve beer and wine. Bacchus Fools! They Getty Villa is a great gift to the world by an old school family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackS181
40,A nice little museum,"As other reviewers have said, it is free (advance registration required) but you have to pay a completely reasonable $15 for parking. The bulk of the collection was moved years ago to the new Getty center, and what is left is their ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan collection. If you are in to that kind of thing it is really good. The site is also interesting, thematically based on a roman villa. We went on the architectural tour which was worth the time. Lunch at the cafe was good too. Unlike some other reviewers, we found all the staff to be courteous and helpful. The tour guide was great in accommodating my companion who was in a wheel chair. My only complaint is that the villa doesn't feel as cozy and welcoming as it did before it was rebuilt, maybe 10 years ago...but I understand that they had to restructure to properly display the collection and accommodate the number of visitors.Getting there: be forewarned that the Pacific Coast High often has traffic jams. The entrance to the villa comes up *very* fast and if you miss your turn it can take a while to recover (we didn't do this but I know others who have).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulhU5674BE
50,"If you like history, this spot is a MUST !","Imagine that in this day and age you can experience what it was like to live in a functioning Roman palace over 2000 years ago? You can do just that at the Getty Villa. Remember, this is not to be confused with the Getty CENTER which is near UCLA in West Los Angeles. The Getty VILLA is in the Malibu area. A ticket is required, which we easily got off their website, and although there is a $15 cost for parking, there is no cost for a ticket. We had a wonderful day walking and enjoying the free guided tours. If you like history, this spot is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fatbird1
50,Free! But I would have paid,I couldn't believe admission was free but it is $15 to park - that's for everyone in the car so this is a great travel bargain. Go on the Getty villa website and reserve your free tickets for a specific time. I believe this keeps the villa from getting over crowded. The architecture and art are beautiful and they have different exhibits. I would allow 2-3 hours to really enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lasvegas_NVDoglover
50,"Wonderful collections, amazing locale, gracious staff","Our visit to the Getty Villa was a much anticipated one and we were not disappointed. The collections, especially the art of the Byzantine Era, were inspiring, the setting was beautifully maintained and the staff, whether we were getting our headsets for the guided tour or eating in the little cafe, could not have been more accommodating. This precious little gem is worth the time and effort for a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rgm30
50,Roman style architecture in Malibu,This roman style villa with it's rich collection of east Roman and Byzantine antiquities is a must see oasis in the hills of Malibu. We had a wonderful day in this museum. A peaceful place. They look for reservation. Easy access from PCH.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Earibal
30,"Romantic, scenic, but not much to do","It's very nice for a mid afternoon walk, but the ""free"" entry doesn't include a $15 parking charge, and the extent of the activities/collections is quite narrow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/batmaz
50,Trip back in time,"We love to visit the Getty Villa. It is a smaller museum, it is easy to see most of the exhibits in one day. The museum is a work of art in itself. J.P. Getty designed the buildings and gardens to replicate a villa in Italy. There is a wonderful cafe, ocean views, herb gardens, large pool surrounded by gardens and sculptures. There are also many activities for children. While in Malibu, I would suggest stopping at the Adamson House down the highway. You can tour the former home of the owners of the Adohr Dairy. They were the first residents of Mailbu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsEllie2014
50,Viewing The Villa,"My husband and I visited this on Saturday, June 28. When we pulled into the entrance, we did not realize you had to get tickets for this ahead of time. We were about to turn around and exit when the guard handed us two tickets to enter. We were so thrilled because we live several states away and could not likely get back to this area for a long time. In regards to entry: The website says ""Admission is Free. An advance timed-entry ticket is required."" Be aware that although admission is free, there is a $15 parking fee.Once we parked we entered a courtyard welcoming center and then climbed the stairs up to the villa/museum area. Don't rush, stop along the way and take in the beautiful ocean view.As you enter the villa there is an outdoor amphitheater - quite impressive. Although there weren't any shows going on there at that moment, I imagine it would be a lovely place to see an event. There is also a gorgeous water garden and gift shop in this general area.Once inside the villa we got the audio guide so we could hear about the grounds and exhibits. Then we took in the short movie about the making of the villa - interesting and worthwhile. We looked at the gardens first (beautiful except the water features are all turned off due to CA drought so that was a little disappointing). Then we went through all the exhibits inside the Villa. The artifacts are very impressive and it is wise to allow at least 3 hours or so just to view the artwork. You can go through faster and skip over the audio if you do not have enough time allotted for a long visit.There is a snack bar or restaurant on site, but we did not go in or get anything to eat or drink while we were there. I also noticed there were specific talks and guided tours available with check-in directly across from the gift shop.My husband and I throughly enjoyed visiting The Getty Villa and were so glad the guard was kind enough to let us in. I would highly recommend visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iDobyksoldo
40,If you like Roman ancient history you will love this...,"If you are a ""fan"" of the history of the Roman Empire, like me, you will appreciate the experience of entering a completely restored roman villa. This is a replica of the villa that Julius Caesar's father in law had built close to the town of Pompeii in Italy which was destroyed by the Vesivius eruption. Youo need to print your tickets ahead of time. Guided tours are free. The tours (gardens vs. architecture) are pretty similar, we were told. We took the gardens and we found out a lot about how the ancient romans lived, all in the environment perfectly restored (it's not like when you are actually in Pompeii you wee the ruins). So you can dream about how these people lived. When we visited they also had a re-enactment of a funeral ceremony in Roman times we thought that was interesting though it was long. If you don't want to buy food at the overpriced (but good) cafeteria you can bring a picnic and eat outside in a seating area. The visit will take you the best part of one morning if you want to see all the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vasile123
40,Beautiful Place,Make sure you stop in while you are in Malibu! Such a beautiful property! The artifacts are displayed well and they even have a MUMMY!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danealoo79
30,Wonderful Museum,"The Getty Villa is located in Malibu and is quite an extensive museum with several gardens and pools to enjoy as well as dozens of rooms with thousands of exhibits. The villa is a re-creation of a Roman country house that was destroyed by Vesuviouss, and J. Paul Getty built a reproduction on his property to house his collection of classical artifacts. Most of the exhibits are antiquities from ancient Greece and Rome: statues, coins, jewelry, busts, vases, pots, more. It is amazing how well kept they are, considering their age.The collection is very high quality but most interesting is the villa itself, and how it is designed and sited. There have been renovations adding to the facility - theatre, changing the second floor to be more accommodating to visitors, other modern changes. Getty's own ranch home can be seen above the villa and is now used for administrative and educational purposes.Be sure to allow yourself ample time to pore over everything, see the film, take a tour or two, and take some time to eat. Caution: the food at their cafe is not cheap; split the costs with your companions. It's well worth the trip, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljc5055
40,If you love roman and Greek architecture a must see!,"Paul Getty had a great foresight to make this landscape fit roman and Greek art. Make sure you print your free tickets for admission in advance. A nice cafe and shop are on the premises. Visitors can't walk up the driveway. A shuttle will take you up or your driver. Guided tours are given is that's for you, or you can wander about yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shamrock6373
50,Spectacular Gardens,We visited the Getty Center first so parking here was free and there is no admission charge - so great value. Nice drive between the 2 places. You will need to collect the entry tickets from the information desk and the free parking ticket from the office before you leave. The villa and gardens are spectacular and worth a visit alone (if you are not interested in the Greek and Roman antiquities) Well worth a visit - takes the best part of a day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/towella69
50,Awesome Museum!,I love the antiquities of this museum and the gardens are just beautiful. Took my 5th grade class here not too long ago and they had a blast. Was really nice to see all the beautiful artwork and sculptures. They also have some amazing food there and perfect for a day date with a special someone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonn479
50,Serene and peaceful visit,Great exhibits and great atmosphere.What is there not to like!Guides are not always well informed and touring groups too large.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/19022013
50,Must for Greek and Roman Antiquities Fans,"Book your free tickets in advance online; entrance attendant will collect them. Parking is $15 but easy to find in the adjacent covered garage. Be sure to watch the short film before touring the Villa; it provides info on how the Villa came into existence which enhances your experience. Plan to spend at least 3-4 hours there; so much to see. Guards are quite vigilant about their jobs, particulatly as regards child visitors, so be sure to keep a close eye on your kids while there. Food in the cafeteria style resturant was very good, Mediterranean-influenced in keeping with the theme of the Villa; food was a bit pricey but it is Malibu. Be sure to visit the gardens as welll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BooKat
50,"Water, no water Getty Villa extraordinary!",The drought in California is for real! It is even impacting the major attractions like the Getty Villa. But do not let that stop you from dropping by. The grounds are impeccable and the art extraordinary. Short of a trip to Europe you will not see a collection equaling the ones at the Gettys. The Villa is more quaint and the views more incredible. The Villa sets across the road from the Pacific Ocean and the verandas offer amazing places to just sit and enjoy California even without water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Onebrand
50,When in Rome...........,"High on the side of the hill in Pacific Palisades, with an absolutely gorgeous view of the ocean, sits the Getty Villa.it is one of two locations of the J. Paul Getty Museum. The Villa is an education center and museum dedicated to the study of arts and cultures of ancient Greece, Rome and Etruria. The villa designed was inspired by the Villa dei Papyri at Herculaneum and incorporated additional details from other ancient sites. It opened in 1974 but Getty never visited it. He died in 1976.When you enter the Villa, you do so on a lower level than the building itself. After climbing the steps, or using the elevator if you prefer, you step out to see an open air theater.The entire villa houses some of the most incredible artifacts and statuary that I have ever seen. There is a little something for everyone. While we were there we had the pleasure of seeing an exhibition of Byzantine art that was most enjoyable. (I couldn't take pictures there but could everywhere else on the grounds and in the building.Lunch was at an open air plaza on the grounds and was very good.We managed a visit to the gift shop where the selection was most interesting. There were several things that caught my eye but I purchased a book about the destruction of Pompeii. It was a very well written novel and I enjoyed it very much.This villa (and I understand the other Getty museum) is a great way to spend an afternoon, with the cooling breezes of the ocean gently wafting over the outdoor pool, and walking around imagining what it might have been like it you truly had transported yourself back to the time of the great quake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hannibaldiva
50,art for Art's sake,Our daughter took us to this beautiful facility which is almost a fairytale. Mr Getty's trust has provided the beauty and history of the world of Antiquity for all to enjoy. The docents (guides) are enthusiastic and knowledgeable when describing the architecture and gardens which are authenticly planted as Roman gardens would have been. Plantings had their uses and you will learn about them. The exhibit on Byzantium was extensive. We had lunch at the cafe and the food was creative and delicious. It was reasonably priced with outdoor and indoor dining and excellent service. Highly recommend for self enrichment purposes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulC328
50,Beautiful villa on a cliff,"It took a little longer than expected to drive to the Getty Villa as you have to get past all the traffic going to the beaches, but once you get to the Villa, it's as though you stepped back in time, to ancient luxurious Greece but in a modern setting.You need to book a reservation (free) online before you go there, but the Villa is very well organized, with plenty of parking. The setting is wonderful, with an outdoor amphitheater that's almost an exact replica of ones I've seen in Greece, and indoor/outdoor courtyards that are reminiscent of the replicas I've seen at the Museum of Modern Art in NY and the ruins in Greece. The gardens are absolutely beautiful as well, especially the ""spice"" garden, where there are many spice plants, and even fruit trees, such as apples, and grape vines hanging off the arches.The artifacts and art that are displayed in the Villa/museum are also quite extensive. It was a wonderful experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYPanda888
50,Amazing place,The Getty villa is very beautiful. It is a gorgeous place. I loved it. The columns and the wall painting is beautiful piece of work. The fountains and the garden is nice. If you paid for parking at the Getty center then it is valid for The Getty Villa for the same day. It is very rich and worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherryS78
50,An amazing experience.,"You need to book a ticket on line, but they are free. This villa is an amazing museum conceived by Getty himself, yet he never saw it completed. It is filled with amazing historical artifacts, and you just have to go to appreciate its beauty. The grounds are spectacular. You can even bring a picnic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaraFromToronto
50,Stunning place. And the best part: for free!,This museum is an impressive place. The architecture is one of a kind and the exhibitions are spectacularly well put together. Visit must be booked in advance and it's free of charge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabioc359
50,"Beautiful, must see!",Beautiful museum with beautiful views. Free just $15 parking. Need to call for ticket reservations. Worth the time to stop and see the beautiful antiques & buildings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjohnson131
50,"Largest Dedicated Roman, Greek, Etruscan Museum on West Coast","This is one of my favorite museums. Not only is there a rich variety of museum pieces but the architecture of the building itself is an exhibit. The architecture of the Getty Villa is models after the Villa of the Papyri (which was thought to be owned by Julius Caesar father-in-law, Lucius Calpurnius Piso). They have made some alterations but regardless the attention to detail is amazing.This museum sits overlooking Malibu and the ocean. What could be better? Picturesque to say the least. Make sure your phone/camera is charged and has plenty of space for lots of pictures. I love the pools and garden.Tips:1) Make reservations. This museum is free but reservations online are needed. http://www.getty.edu/visit/villa/plan/2) Parking is $15. Completely worth it. Covered parking, direct access.3) It is easiest to enter going northbound on Highway 1 (PCH - Pacific Coast Highway)4) Photographs are allowed for all permanent exhibits. Do NOT take pictures of their rotating exhibit (usually in one section on the second floor).5) Look on their website for special plays, exhibits, classes and events. They have different options for everyone!6) Leave plenty of time for this museum. It can easily be an all day affair.7) Bring a smartphone - they have a Getty App with audio built in!8) Be sure to take at least one of the guided tours! You will not be disappointed.One note: California has severe water shortage. At the time of this post, they currently do not have most of their pools filled with water. Give them a break - they are trying to be water conscious, the museum is still stunning, and you got in for free after all! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheMadScalpel
30,Definitely not the real thing,"While impressive to see, it does not come close the real Italy. The gardens upkeep seemed to be skimped on. With the water shortage in California, all of the pools were drained. The art was extensive for a private collector, but will disappoint if you ever traveled to Europe and saw the art there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neilsellers
50,Diamond in the rough,"J Paul Getty acquired so many pieces of rare artwork. He displays many sculptures and pottery on a beautiful piece of property that's located right across from the Pacific Ocean. Built in the 1970s the architecture and grounds are absolutely gorgeous. Definitely worth the trip, admission is free parking is $15. You can't beat it on your next visit to Southern California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnV214
50,All Of The Ancient World & All For Free!!,"Well, you do have to make a reservation and pay $15 for parking. But everything else is free! The Getty Villa is perfectly situated just off the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California. It is an oasis of beauty, serenity, and history. You can wander the exhaustive collection of Greco-Roman artifacts and the well kept grounds or you can also opt for a myriad of professional tours. For an afternoon, you can almost imagine living in the splendor of Ancient Rome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kena2013
50,Roman Art in a Roman Villa,"The Villa is a reproduction of a Roman emporor's uncles house in Pompeii. J.Paul Getty's vision was to rebuld it exactly how it would have been in antiquity and then fill it with sculpture and art and place it in the settings in which they would have been back then.Firstly, you should get online and print out the free tickets in advance of your visit. The tickets are time sensitive so too many visitors at once are not allowed in at one time. The museum is located on a cliff side in Malibu and is just stunning. The area is a maze-like at first from the parking structure where you take a series of elevators and passage ways to the Villa itself.Once inside I recommend viewing the ten minute video so you can orient yourself as to what you are seeing. I liked all of the art and sculpture inside, but the really amazing part is when you go from the inside the Villa to outside to view the water features and gardens with the trees and blue sky and water of the ocean as a back drop.It's truly beautiful and worth a trip to see it. I was a little surprised that many people sort of dressed up to visit this museum. I was in shorts and a button down shirt and felt comfortable, but I saw plenty of guys in work place casual attire and women in dresses.After the museum we ate at a sea side restaurant and later laid on the beach. All in all a really good day in Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cante87
50,"Beautiful place, worth a visit","We visited the Getty villa after the Getty centre and liked this visit even more. It has some very rare and beautfiul art collection, and the house itself is very attractive. You need to book the tickets in advance though they are free. This can be done on their website, and a printout can be taken which is checked at the entrance.Be warned that there are virtually no refreshment possibilities. We found coffee and some cookies on their terrace restaurant, but nothing substantial.We were staying in the downtown LA area and so took a cab to the Getty Centre and took another one to the villa from there. The cab (for the villa) was easily available at the Getty centre car park area. Since we were four people, the steep transport cost of hiring a cab both ways seemed absolutely worthwhile as both the places are worth a visit, especially for art lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeenaR173
50,A Journey Into the Ancient Past,"We took a week to tour the art museums of Los Angeles. Of all the museums we visited, I enjoyed the Getty Villa the most. As opposed to a typical art museum with paintings not he wall, the Getty Villa succeeds in creating spaces that made me feel as if I were in the palatial surroundings of a Roman patrician. This is a singular experience not to be missed by anyone with an interest in the period of the Roman Empire.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffLookinatFish
50,A Gem,The Getty Villa is a lovely spot to visit. Their exhibits are always worth a look. The setting and the house itself are exquisite. Reserve first.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyNYLA
50,Beautiful house,"You get the tickets for free in the Getty Center. The house is really beautiful and well worth a visit. Beautiful landscaping, great architecture with great level to detail. Great please to rest and calm down from the bustling city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vinzentk2018
50,One of a kind visit to the Getty Villa,"My spouse and I had our first visit to LA in many years and all of the reviews we read on the Getty Villa EXCEEDED all expectations. Reopened in 2006 and a must with a unique wonderful indoor and outdoor experience on 64 acres with antiquities dating 2000+ and wonderful gardens replicated of a 2000 year old Italian Villa....great knowledgeable guides....All free of charge. We also had a delightful lunch with higher quality food included the Villa salad with wonderful lemon yogurt dressing and a Great burger....more than we expected. Of course, the scenic drive on PCH to Malibu was an added treat. No fees...except covered parking charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaintsFanDallas
40,"Byzantine ""Rules"": Great collection","There are several rules which are quite specific and restrictive:1) You must make a reservation: 1 car - up to 4 adults, but you must get a reservation for each adult and print separately.2) You must have your ID with you at all times if you want to get anything done.3) There is no photography allowed no matter what!So, with these restrictions in mind, you can have a great time. We went to see the Byzantium exhibition -- which is not part of the Getty museum collection -- and so they were the ones who were militant about photography, where you stood in relation to the art/exhibits, and how long you stayed. I like to look at art: front, back, side, close, far, bottom, top -- you get the idea. Well, this caused quite a frackus as I tried to enjoy the various displays. The lights that shine on the mosaic and paints are so bright they wash out the image. Therefore, you have to go to several different angles if you are going to enjoy the piece. While standing at a distance admiring one of the mosaics, a ""Guard"" approached me and told me to stand forward so I didn't block the path for others! Mind you, there was nobody coming -- but just in case! This is absurd. I was there on a Friday, not a weekend day, and I should be allowed to stand wherever I want to in the room to admire the art. Once I was out of the Byzantium display, it was a totally different experience. I was allowed to walk around the art, go on the floor and look up, go on all sides of the exhibit, and even take photographs. It was quite cold in the rooms, so I would recommend a sweater or jacket -- otherwise, you will be like my wife who spent more time in the garden warming up than actually seeing the exhibits. This is not something you can see in an afternoon. It is a huge complex and so I would recommend several visits over time, targeting a specific room, exhibit, or area each time. The iPod based self-guided tour is wonderful, with lots of great information -- allowing you to go at your own pace. But, you have to present ID to get it -- so make sure you have some with you! I am a very conservative traveler, and so tend to take nothing with me so I can't have anything stolen. I had to make a trip back to get my ID -- but then it was great. We enjoyed our stroll out via the herb garden, that allows you to pluck a few leaves here and there to smell and enjoy. The coy pond was well stocked and was relaxing to watch as the fish swam around the pool",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lestertheinvestor
30,Good artifacts from european culture.,A good place on the pacific coast highway in Malibu a day to watch the museum relax with family and friends. They have a very good collection of European artifacts. One thing to remember is do not forget to get the tickets early before visiting the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kinu2013
40,When in Rome...,"An impressive recreation of an early Roman county villa with beautiful gardens, pools and marble staircases leading to rooms of fine collections including early glasswares. The view is wonderful, too, even with the typical California haze. Also a nice outdoor eatery and coffee bar. I will bet that no one who reviewed this excellent villa has made note of the good acoustics in the parking garage. If you are traveling with your polyphonic singing friends you must try a few rounds of ""Dona Nobis Pacem"" and listen for the overtones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcia2424
50,As Awesome for views as for art,"One caveat - register online for your free tickets - you must have them to get in the parking lot. (Tickets free but you pay for parking & it fills up.) Siri will guide you to a back gate, so look for the big sign on pch once you get close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beechmom28
50,Getty Villa,"We got there at 9:30 AM for a 10 AM reservation entry. They let us park and walk around. We took three tours. All were excellent. There was an architecture tour, a garden tour and an arts tour. The guides were about the best we have ever had anywhere. We spent 5 1/2 hours there. Love it. We had lunch there on the our door patio.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MPMellum
50,Great to spend a day !,"It is a wonderful place to spend a day, specially with family and friends. They also have various free tours by knowledgeable docents. One has to book tickets online beforehand and get a timed ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/671ipsitam
10,Don't arrive by public transportation,"We arrived on the bus to the Getty Villa. We had arrived in LA on the train and took the bus for our transportation. At the Villa they will not let you walk up to the Villa; you have to wait for a shuttle. 12 people got off the bus and were waiting for a shuttle. After maybe 20 minutes a van pulled up, but the middle seat had been taken out, so they could only take 4 people. We waited another 20 minutes and got to go up on the 2nd trip. Four more people had to wait for the 3rd trip to go up to the villa. It just wasn't worth it.They said that they have another shuttle, but they were using it for directing school buses. When we complained to a man, wearing a vest that said security and who the shuttle driver said was the supervisor, he did not apologize and said that we should come back next time in a car. I filled out a comment card when I was there, but have not heard back from anyone from the villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NMtraveler47042
50,An amazing collection of antiquities,"During our trip to Southern California, we made the trip to Malibu to the Getty Villa. Having been in countless museums around the world, I have to say that this one does one of the best jobs of presenting an array of antiquities in an informative fashion that doesn't overwhelm the visitor.We took a picnic lunch and ate it in the cafe area that overlooks the museum and the theater before going inside. Once inside, we watched the 12 minute video that explained the history of the museum -- this is well worth the 12 minutes and helps orient you to the rest of your time on the grounds. We then proceeded to walk through the museum at a leisurely pace and were able to take it all in without reaching a point of mental saturation.Yes, it is free -- but you do have to pay $15 a car for parking. It's well worth it considering what you will see in an amazingly beautiful setting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCTravelingFamily
50,Worth the time,"A gem at the top of a hill overlooking the ocean. The villa is gorgeous -- as are the views. The attention to detail is exceptional and the interior spaces make you feel like you were an ancient Roman country house. The exhibit we went to see was ""Cultures of the Ancient Mediterranean World"" -- we wandered from room to room and through the gardens, oohing and aahing over the pieces displayed, from statues and busts to paintings to jewelry to pottery, and much more. The Getty has done an excellent job of describing each piece (I believe a recorded guide is also available), and the history I learned here just whet my appetite to learn more about them now that I'm home.What was really amazing is that there is no entrance fee -- just a $15 parking fee -- though reservations are a must.If you are in the Los Angeles area and love beautiful ancient things, the Getty Villa should be on your bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanE715
50,"Stunning location, fascinating art, fascinating tours.","This Villa was truly gorgeous. Stunning views and attention to detail in architecture, landscape and art display make it truly a feast for the mind.The Villa is free, get your reservations at the website. THEY DO ASK for it at the front gate. Parking is $15 cash or credit, with a small amount of hassle they will get you a free pass to park same day at the Getty in Los Angeles (which we did).We did the movie inside, we also took walking tours of the architecture and landscape.Two complaints, Foremost is te Mayer of LA County is demanding the water off. All the amazing fountains are dry currently. Its a disgrace. ( dry fountains and pools cause damage to boot)Secondly is you have been to Europe and been to Bath UK, or anywhere where the buildings are thousands of years old, this Villa feels very fake, like a modern attempt at antiquity but misses its mark. Like being in Disneyland. Dont get me wrong, it is a beautiful structure and right on Malibu is breathtaking, but if you have seen ancient villas and ancient acritecture this may leave you feeling less than impressed.I LOVED getting the background history on Mr Getty and how it all came to be. Overall a GORGEOUS and extremely positive trip. I WILL go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michelle_Haley
50,A Must See in Malibu,"Within just a 30-minute drive from Los Angeles, this beautiful villa is a true gem of elegance and tranquility in Malibu. Commissioned by Paul Getty in 1968 as a replica of a Herculaneum palace to house his extensive collection of Greek and Roman sculptures and artifacts, it is now an open-air museum which is an absolute must-see. There is an excellent documentary about the history of the place that runs every few minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laviajera67

50,Beautiful place to visit!,"I had always heard about the Getty Museum, but not the Villa, and this place is not to be missed! Lovley to visit both inside and outside!Free but you pay for your parking. You also need to go on-line in advance to schedule your admission time and print out the ""admission tickets""We signed up for the architectural tour which was fascinating and you could tell the volunteer docent had a lot of passion for the subject matter.I really enjoyed the ancient art and enjoyed that the collection was limited to those three time periods.On the day we visited it was very hot but they have umbrellas you can use. Unfortunately the water fountains were all turned off and the culinary/herb garden was looking a bit parched...but it was great, and not to be missed--first time seeing a pomegranate tree!We did not eat in their cafe but the food looked good and reasonably priced. I would consider coming back and doing the special tea with tour of the herb garden.A wonderful couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluesmama11
50,Made me want to read the Illiad,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to The Getty Villa. Finding the entrance to the site can be a challenge, and we overshot the entrance but made it back. It was well worth it. The buildings are wonderful, with a really good insight to what ancient Romans' villas might have looked like. I didn't think I would be as interested in this facility as I was The Getty Center, but I went away a convert. There is a terra cotta coffin displayed, with a quote from the Illiad on the information panel. I was so interested that I stopped by their great gift shop to look into it. I wound up buying another book on art that was on sale and an incredible buy. We also had a meal in their cafe, and it was quite nice. It was worth all the hassle of advanced booking and a slight confusion to place. I highly recommend this site to my friends and family and will be returning for another visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/losita
40,Most go for the antiquities but I like the gardens,"Been to the Villa twice. Both times it was extremely well kept, athough with the current drought in California they have turned off the water to the fountains which slightly reduces enjoyment of the garden area. The gardens and trees and vegetation are all in good shape. Especially enjoyed the twisted trunk Plum and Pomegranate trees which have been lovingly shaped and tended over the years. And of course the view of the ocean is spectacular on a bright sunny day. Participated in the ""highlights"" tour which focused on a particular sculpture. Tour guide was very good at engaging everyone and it was hard to believe we'd spent 30 minutes considering just one piece of art. Love the philosophy of the Getty which is to preserve antiquities but leave them as they are, so expect to see a lot of ""broken noses"" on statues. Also ate at the café and enjoyed the meal, but too much garlic on the garlic fries!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwoByTwo
50,The Ultimate Los Angeles Date Spot,"The other reviews will cover how amazing the art is and how a little preparation is necessary (book parking in advance). But I want to say that just being in this beautiful environment can be inspirational. Add to that the relaxing and simple restaurant and you have a great date.We plan our visits to arrive at lunch time. This allows us to order from the thoughtfully conceived menu (inspired by the cuisines of antiquity!) and a bottle of wine. Dining al fresco with the villa and Pacific ocean as a backdrop, you'll want to take your time and savor....just being there. Afterwards, you can roam the galleries and gardens - don't miss the fragrant herb garden! This gives you ample time to get to know someone and sober up for the drive home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraveleRoger
50,Amazing!,The Getty Villa is so beautiful and worth the trip. They offer more ancient art than the modern art you see at The Getty and the gardens are just as nice!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710reneel
50,Architecture inspired by the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum in the year A.D. 79.,The Getty Villa is gorgeous and definitely worth checking out. I highly suggest taking the tour to better understand the architecture inspired by the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum in the year A.D. 79.The Villa contains beautiful gardens and amazing artworks. The ocean view from the balcony on a clear day is unbeatable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stevenjkay
50,Time on display,"Every detail of the Villa is well managed, therefore gracious, beautiful, informative, and delightful. Parking is generous, walkways wide and shady, landscaping evocative, and the exhibits themselves displayed and explained to perfection. Oh what money and good taste has given the public. The gardens with fountains and ancient statuary, to my way of thinking, bestow quiet order to body, heart, mind, and soul. This is a venue to return to again and again. We particularly love to sit in the amphitheater on a summer night to take in a Greek play. And during the wintertime, we attend plays in the theater. Even the gift shop invites browsing. And I so love the serene pool with waterlilies on the ground level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/301charlottew
50,A work of art!,"The Getty Villa is located in the Pacific Palisades area, west of downtown L.A., on Pacific Coast Hwy. The Villa houses exceptional exhibits of Greco-Roman antiquities that alone mandate a visit. Coupled with the magnificent recreations of Roman gardens and of a Roman villa (that was swallowed by Mt. Vesuvius eruption), this destination is definitely a world-class treasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helinas
50,"Not a history buff, but.....",I just may become one after visiting this amazing tribute to the beginnings of the world as we know it today! What a beautiful setting to learn about ancient man and his means. The gardens are incredible. The presentation of artifacts is so elegantly done. I lingered in front of many of the exhibits and studied as if I was back in school. Be sure not to miss the mummy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bikerbarbie56

50,"Amazing structure and Gardens, Classical Art","The Getty Villa is free but you must pay $15.00 for parking which you book in advance on a timed arrival basis. The Building/Buildings are spectacular designed to resemble an ancient Roman villa in Herculaneum before Vesuvius erupted and buried it all. Great classical art collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan artifacts, free tours, fine cafes with great views and very good reasonably priced food",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuffleScruffle
40,Worth it in the end,"While I can appreciate the need to regulate visitors to such a popular attraction, is it necessary to make it so inaccessible to foreign tourists? We had one day in LA and no car. We found out that reservations were essential and managed to make one over the internet but proof of ticket and transportation were also required. Had to be hardcopy - difficult without printing facilities. Expensive phone call (roving mobile) sorted some of this out. Finally got there by public transport and had to wait ages for a shuttle as there is no pedestrian access. Initial impression was why did we bother. All pastiche. Some good architecture in the facilities. It wasn't until we got to the displays on the upper level that we could finally see what is a great collection presented in a first class way. Much of the garden needed attention with clipping long overdue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/John_MtEden
50,Exquisite classical architecture to enjoy in Malibu,"This is the birthplace of Getty's original collection in his hillside home. He then built an entire Roman villa further down the slope, pools, statuary, classical touches all over, great for history lovers and architects to savor. Best to study their website in advance to time your visit for any special events, guided tours or exhibits. The property sprawled on a hillside, is a little confusing. It has a restaurant with hot and cold dishes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisandroVoyager
40,Very nice,I went to the Getty Villa with my daughter on a field trip. Naturally some of the kids laughed at the statues. Overall I think it was a very beautiful place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newdiet
50,"magnificent setting, superb antiquities","First, it's important to note that while the Getty Villa is free, you need a reservation that has a timed entry. In addition, you will need to pay for parking ($15), but this fee entitles you to free parking the same day at the Getty Center. Visiting both will give you an unforgettable day.The Villa is J. Paul Getty's dream for all the antiquities he acquired over the decades, and his dream provides all of us with a setting fit for these antiquities. Plan on 2-3 hours to leisurely enjoy the statues, artifacts, painting, architecture and gardens.There is simply no museum anywhere in the world, and I have visited almost all of them, that display antiquities so beautifully with full descriptions of every single piece.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anthony-Susan
50,Having a chance to feel like a Roman empress!,"Although this is the first time I have reviewed the Getty Villa for Trip Advisor, this is my fourth visit to this wonderful museum. Not only are the antiquities on display exquisite and span 7000 years from the Stone Age to the fall of the Roman Empire, but the museum itself is a reproduction of 1st century Roman architecture found around the Bay of Naples, primarily the Villa de Papyri excavated in Herculaneum.In addition to the museum's own marvelous collection of Greek and Roman artifacts, the Getty frequently hosts world-class traveling exhibits and that was what brought me to the Getty on this occasion. I had come to see ""Heaven and Earth: Art of Byzantium"" with most pieces courtesy of a number of Greek museums including the Archaeological Museum of Athens, the Byzantium Museum in Kastoria, the Museum of Byzantine Culture of Thessaloniki, the Byzantine and Christian Museum of Athens and the Palace of the Grand Master in Rhodes. The exhibit ranged from glittering mosaics to golden-hued icons to intricately crafted gold jewelry that could have been worn by contemporaries or descendants of the Empress Theodora.One of my favorite pieces was a mosaic portrait of the rather notorious Greek aristocrat and sometime rascal, Alcibiades. Although he lived long before Christianity was born, the inhabitants of Byzantium still took pride in their early cultural inheritance.The Getty offers visitors a free app for their smartphone in the App Store or Google Play, depending on which type of smartphone you have, that serves as a guide to the Byzantine exhibit. The beautiful images and informative narration make a lovely keepsake to remind you of your visit. (Search for Byzantium at the Getty)There is no charge for admission either although if you arrive by car you will need to pay $15 for parking. You must also be sure to reserve a timed entrance ticket in advance before going to the museum. Although parking is first come, first served, if you have an entrance ticket you are pretty much assured of having a space.Also, if you are driving down from the north, you will need to drive down to the second stop light past the Villa entrance and make a U-turn then drive back north to the Villa's entrance gate.The Getty allows photography of their permanent collection but like many large museums, they do not allow photography of traveling exhibits so I put my cameras away temporarily and just savored the beauty of the art before me. After I finished touring the Byzantine art, I was able to walk around the other galleries on the second floor and take all of the pictures I wanted.The last time I had visited the Getty Villa was four years ago so I was anxious to see if any new pieces had been placed on display. I also had a much newer camera on this trip so I rephotographed many of my old favorites as well. While I was on the second floor, a security guard opened a large set of doors to let us go out onto the balcony and look down upon the marvelous grand peristyle garden below. I was able to take a panorama of the scene with people strolling about the garden enjoying the beauty and the warm California sunshine.By the time I finished the second floor galleries, it was lunch time so I went downstairs and walked over to the cafe above the gift shop. The cafe had a number of Greek-inspired lunch items on the menu in honor of the special exhibit that included things like goat cheese as well as pasta dishes, pizza and salads with grilled chicken or shrimp, but I opted for a Villa burger cooked medium rare and topped with crispy onions, a port wine reduction, Stilton blue cheese and wild mushroom Aioli. It was very tasty but so filling I didn't really have room for the huge pile of fries that were served with it. I must caution new visitors, though, that some of the items are a bit steep for lunch. My Villa Burger was $13.95 and I noticed that the salad with grilled shrimp was $18. But the food is freshly prepared and quite good.After lunch I walked back over to the ground floor galleries. I wanted to use my new ultra-wide angle lens to get an inclusive shot of the Orpheus group of sculptures. In Greco-Roman mythology, Orpheus was a young man who could play the lyre so beautifully he could charm wild animals. The Orpheus group at the Villa is a sculpture of a musician, possibly Orpheus flanked by two sirens, creatures that are part woman and part bird. The sculptures look like women but if you look closely at their feet you will see they have the feet of birds. These terracotta figures were sculpted about 350-300 BCE in South Italy, a Greek colony before being conquered by the Romans. I was so glad they were still on display as they are one of my favorite groupings.Another favorite collection of sculptures are displayed in a room designed like a Roman basillica. Delicate statues of the muses stand besides masculine sculptures of Herakles (Hercules) and an enthroned Zeus. Although the muses are carved from marble the stone is almost translucent giving their faces an ethereal air. There are traces of gold gilding in their hair and I can just imagine how spectacular they must have been in antiquity.Also, don't miss the Getty's marvelous collection of Parthian rhytons (drinking cups) crafted of silver and gold with the heads of lynxes, a lion and a stag and be sure to leave some time to stroll around the gardens and imagine what it must have been like to be a Roman aristocrat at the height of the Empire!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mharrsch
40,Brilliant place,"This is a really interesting place to visit in Malibu - not to be missed. There are some fantastic exhibits and the copy of a Roman villa is beautifully done. Ensure you watch the introductory film before entering the museum. The gardens are well done, informative and cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karencA6283NY
50,Wonderful place to get lost for the day,Be sure to make a reservation in advance. Make sure you take all the time you need to see everything...this is the pre Getty museum. I was told 1-2 hours and easily spent 3 hours. Take advantage of the guided tours...you will get to hear about all the history of this beautiful landmark......then take a moment to see the beautiful ocean view while walking back to parking garage.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mary07020
50,Amazing,Anyone who visits this area should go and see the Getty Villa. You do need to book online ahead as it does get quite busy. The Getty Villa replicates a Roman Villa and the attention to detail is breathtaking. It is beautifully maintained. A great way to spend a few hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cazzie6
50,Enjoyed the Setting as Well as the Art,"The setting of the Getty villa and the replicated Roman architecture really add to the art experience. We took three tours and all were good, but we especially enjoyed the garden tour. We bought lunch at the outdoor stand and ate on the patio overlooking the entrance/theater, which was a lovely setting. I suggest getting there early if you go on the weekend (we had our tickets reserved ahead of time) because they have only one small entrance and they take your tickets as you drive in, and I imagine it would be quite a long wait if you came later in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poem19girl
50,Gorgeous Getaway!,"NOTE: You don't have to print your ticket to the Getty Villa. You can bring the ticketing confirmation number, which is much easier than printing the ticket.Since you are reading these reviews, you probably already know that Getty Villa is a replica of a real Roman villa. My wife surprised me during our visit to LA by bringing me to the Getty Villa without telling me anything about it. Upon arriving at the Villa, we lined up right away to take the excellent Architecture Tour. I was dumbfounded to learn, while sitting in front of the Villa, the true nature of the estate; as the tour continued, it was like walking back into time, or a wonderland. Maybe you can surprise your spouse or kids the same way.Everything about the Getty Villa was superlative. The grounds are spectacularly beautiful, the villa, impressive. The Architecture tour was really fun, informative, and approachable. The garden tour was still good, but do the architecture tour first. For the tour, Getty provides a wireless earpiece linked to the guide's microphone. The guide speaks in a normal voice into the microphone, and you don't have to be within earshot. It's the best system ever, and also excellent for the hearing-impaired. Make sure you snag a free sun umbrella before the tour.The cafe also was pricey, but the food was amazing. Treat yourself.All in all, Getty Villa is a breath of fresh air, lifted far above the din of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccag629
50,Don't miss!!,"This is a beautiful setting and well worth the drive to Malibu and it is a beautiful drive!! You must order tickets ahead of time on line or you will not get in. They run out pretty quick especially in high seasons so pick the day you want to go and reserve your tix. The antiquities at this place are unbelievable and the different tours are well worth it. Go. You will not be disappointed, especially if you like historical things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525karenj
40,The Getty Villa by the Sea,"What a lovely afternoon spent at the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades. The Villa is free but reservations are required. I made the reservations two days before going and there were tickets available. Parking is $15.00. Once inside the museum, we took one of the free tours. There is a garden, architecture and collection tour. There are additional tours available based on the current exhibition. A little disappointed in the collection tour. The tour lasted approximately 50 minutes and the docent only showed us about 5 different objects. I would recommend spending a little less time explaining each piece and including more items in the tour. Otherwise, the Villa is beautiful and the garden with the pool is magnificent. We also ate at the museum. The food is a little expensive and next time I will bring a picnic lunch. The Getty has many places to sit and a picnic area. For $15.00 per car, you can have a nice outing. I too am grateful for the legacy that has been left behind by Mr. Getty. I also, believe for same $15.00 and if you have time you can go to the main Getty Museum on the same day and use the same parking pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanT930
50,Beautiful landscaping and architecture,"The Getty Villa is located in a stunning site on a hill above Malibu. Modelled on a Roman country house in Herculaneum, which was buried by the eruption of Mt Vesuvius in A.D.79, the villa contains a museum of art and sculpture treasures. The museum is home to one of America's finest collections of Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities. Beautiful landscaped gardens and pool form an outdoor courtyard. It is worth joining the tour of the gardens (it's free)as the guide has an amazing knowledge of the species of trees and plants in the various gardens. Children can try painting designs on the life-size vases and vessels in the family room.Entrance to the villa and gardens us absolutely free! Amazing! You could easily spend a day there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoisG702
50,John Paul Take a Bow !,"OK , it might have been a tax haven back then , but the gifting of this place to future generations to enjoy is still pretty special either way. The wife absolutely loved it and I'm glad I found it trolling through TA a couple days out of LA. It's free to visit with only a $15 parking fee if driving but worth every penny ! The Villa is faithfully based on the plans of a 100 AD Roman Villa and is evidence of what money can do !! The treasures within complement the building & grounds, all magnificent and worth several visits to fully capture & enjoy ! A fantastic display of Grecian, Roman & Etruscan artifacts !! A must see in LA !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skeney57
50,beautiful & relaxing,"I've spent a few afternoons by myself at the Getty Villa recently, having lunch, and roaming around the gardens. It's the perfect place to clear my head, and juice up my creativity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mskatia1
50,Beautiful Place,"It really was easy to find and parking was easy also. The grounds are just spectacular and the museums were so very interesting. We happened to be there for a performance of a Byzanntine Chant, which was really nice. Really a great experience, and so glad we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/723PattyCakes
50,Wonderful and educational experience,I enjoyed the whole experience. The Villa and grounds were beautiful and well maintained. I took the architecture and garden tours which were informative and entertaining. I had a very tasty lunch at the café. After lunch I toured the exhibits and found them very interesting. It is was a wonderful experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssl56
50,A breath of freshness,"Very well presented exhibits, but the Villa is an intriguing showpiece in itself. The intro video was very interesting, giving the concept of what you walk through. Very accessible for wheelchairs. Helpful staff throughout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/408jackl
50,Palatial Elegance in Malibu,"The Getty Roman Villa in Pacific Palisades was our favorite attraction in the Los Angeles area. The pools, gardens, fountains, colonnades, sculpture, and amphitheater are magnificent. The setting in the attractive wooded canyon is fitting for a patrician's palatial home. The museum antiquities--the sarcophaguses, murals, and jewels--are well worth seeing. The food at the café restaurant is also good. And the only thing you pay for at this museum is the parking! If you see nothing else in Los Angeles, go here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielK751
50,The excellent fake villa,"This place reproduces an italian villa from antiquity and although it's a fake, it's still very good. There's a good collection of greek art, some temporary exhibitions and the architecture is amazing, with a greek open air theater and beautiful gardens. There's also a very nice cafe, with tasty options (and not super expensive) and all the facilities are great, with free self guides and guided tours every hour.It's free to entry (just make sure you print your entrance before), but you have to pay to park. You can go by cab, it's around US$ 25 from santa monica area. It's also possible to use public transportation (metrobus stops just in front of its gates and they have a shuttle to go to the museum), but be aware it may take a while waiting for the bus.It's a lovely place to spend a morning or afternoon, I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alalas
50,First class,We visited the Getty Centre two weeks ago and decided to visit the Villa. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The buildings and exhibits are first class. The gardens are really lovely. Both locations are worth visiting as they each have something different to offer. Well worth a visit if you get the chance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Corran9
40,"Get free advance tickets online, but parking is $15","This museum full of Roman and Greek artifacts is designed to resemble an ancient Roman country villa and includes a gorgeous courtyard and an open air theatre. Kids will enjoy the Family Forum room where kids can draw on vases and perform shadow art. There are also great ocean views from the museum. Admission is free with an online timed entry reservation; however, parking is $15. Consider going to the Getty Centre on the same day as parking receipt can be used at the Getty Centre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinter17
50,"Veni, y'all","Beautiful reproduction of a Roman Villa, complete with columns, buildings, gardens and statutes. On top of all that, a lovely two-story museum loaded with antiques of Greece and Rome and wonderful exhibits that change regularly. Oh, and a charming café and smooth elevators leading you to the museum and an outdoor ampitheater.Worth a visit, indeed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zogmeister
50,Fascinating and well done,"First, the tough part...getting to the property. One MUST approach from the south on the Pacific Coast Highway to enter the well-disguised driveway. (I know I was not the only driver trying to get in from the north side, but we all learned the hard way to actually read the fine print of the ticket info that described the only way.) Not to mention, one MUST order (free) tickets in advance (the Villa has a time-phased entry system); the tickets are free, and are required for entry, but are mailed, if you order four weeks in advance as I did. No walk-ups/drive-ups allowed. On-site parking does cost $15, but the tickets for entry are free, as noted previously. NOW, the best part... fascinating exhibits, artifacts and architecture. We enjoyed both the architecture tour and the garden tour; they are free and lend a substantial amount to your appreciation of the layout. Docents describe items of interest over a radio headset system; each tour guest has his or her own individual headset and can set volume with rotation of a volume control. In the inside display areas, the artifacts have adequate accompanying explanatory material posted for the casual visitor. We also got to see an interesting special exhibition of Byzantine icons which was on display. Not to forget the on-site cafe. The café has a reasonable selection of dishes for lunch on the premises; my wife and I are not heavy eaters, so we split a very nice Greek chicken wrap. Overall, we spent an exceptionally pleasant four hours or so on site. Almost forgot -- right now, and for the foreseeable future, the Pacific Coast Highway (or PCH) in this area is under construction. Expect really long traffic delays if you are approaching from the north; it took us 2 1/2 hours to do what should have been (according to Google maps) a 1 + 40 drive coming down from Santa Barbara. The last four or five miles took 1/2 hour all by itself. Well worth the effort, though, well worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WYbirdwatcher
50,Hidden Gem,"My wife and I visited the Villa after a short visit to Santa Monica Pier. It was a short drive. The villa is beautiful. The gardens and sculptures are fantastic. The setting is just breath taking. We enjoyed walking around and seeing the many Greek and Roman artifacts. We don't frequent this type of museum, but we really enjoyed this one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chiefbill16
50,Superb Collections - a great place to spend a few hours,"We grabbed a bus from the LAX area and then transferred to a local to get to the Getty Villa from Santa Monica. It all went very well. This was my first trip to the Getty but the second for my wife. We thoroughly enjoyed the displays, the grounds and a quick lunch at the cafe on the grounds. It you happen to be in the LAX area hanging around for a flight - and have a few hours - this is a great place to visit. The next time we are in town - I will certainly think about another trip. Collections are well organised, displayed in an informative manner and the grounds are kept in pristine condition. Thank you to the Getty Villa and its staff for a superb afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tevorolevu
50,Antiquities in Malibu,"The Getty Villa, in Malibu, is a recreation of an ancient Roman Villa, the Villa de Papiri. This is the only museum in the United States that is devoted wholly to classical antiquities. Be sure to spend time in the magnificent gardens. The cafe has good food, I recommend either the Roman burger or the Villa Salad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CricketInMalibu
50,Felt like we were in Italy instead of Malibu,"The new auditorium, villa and restaurant were beautiful. The villa is opulent and filled with jaw dropping antiquities. A very fun afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trixiefig
50,Great place to spend couple hours,"I have been coming to The Villa for many years. It is a very beautiful place to just hang out, drink some wine, and have a nice lunch. It just a beautiful to stroll through and enjoy the beautiful art and grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felixb651
50,Exceptional museum with a view of the ocean,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed visiting the Getty Villa. With only a $15 parking fee you can't beat the history and art housed in this museum. The Greek and Roman artifacts and art were inspiring, never thought we'd see such an extensive collection in the US. To think JP Getty donated this to the public for our benefit is awesome. The buildings and grounds were tastefully done, including a view of the ocean. I recommend getting there early before the crowds and bus loads of kids. The gardens were beautiful this time of the year. We had blue skies to boot, can't ask for anything more for an enjoyable day. Our kids are grown and now it's time for my wife and I to enjoy the cultural experience in LA vs Disney Land and Universal Studios. We also visited the Getty Museum the next day, another must see on your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Evanston_WYBikeboy
50,"Beautiful, Clean and Organized","Spent the day here, today, Sunday with a family of all ages, 9-75 years. The facility is beautiful, clean, organized and has plenty of staff around to answer questions. Free tickets with online reservation, parking $15. Arrive prior to opening for a walk around the grounds and gardens without any crowd. Excellent representation of Roman architecture. Photos without flash permitted throughout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFabrega
50,Not to be missed!,"We attended with our four children aged 5 to 15. This was a delightful attraction, both entertaining and educational. They have done a fantastic job with the main attraction, a reproduction of the Romanesque Villa. There are interesting museum pieces in various rooms throughout for the history aficionado. The children can play as you walk throughout the grounds visiting the beautiful gardens. The scenes are so beautiful, you might even consider bringing dress clothes and cameras for photographs. There is a lovely Italian restaurant on site, for a relaxing time enjoying good food and even beer or wine. The landscaping makes for a very relaxing afternoon. This site is good for a single person, romantic couples, families with children, or anyone interested in history. If you haven't seen the Getty Museum as well, that is highly recommended along with this site. This is one of the two best attractions in the LA metropolitan area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boondoc
50,Stepping back in time,"Here's your opportunity to be an Roman emperor for a day (or just fantasize a bit). The Getty Villa's grounds are stunning. Attention to detail makes for a breath-taking view over the Pacific (just as Tiberias must have seen from his retirement villa off the Isle of Capri) from the porticos of J. Paul Getty's gift to posterity. The exhibits inside are wonderful, family-friendly, and well-presented. There is a cafe, a well-curated museum shop, and for those who are challenged by moving from one level to another (strollers, wheelchairs, etc.) there are elevators. The best part is that the admission is free; parking is only $15/car. Go early and avoid the crowds to soak up the atmosphere. The grounds and the exhibits are pristine. Friendly staff as well. Ask at the museum entrance for the map/list of restaurants in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tenighir
50,Wow,"We had previously been to the Getty Museum so decided to check The Villa out. You need a few visits to really see it all, but we spent a couple of happy hours there and will return again when we can. Although there is no entrance fee, there is a parking fee of $15, a small price to pay for so many treasures. You also need to pre book your attendance by web as I think they must be controlling visitor numbers, but that prevents over crowding. Mostly the treasures are artefacts rather than paintings etc, but also the building itself and the gardens are beautiful and should not be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TJDJM
50,Impressive Italian villa in malibu,"If staying in SM tour this wonderful museum. There are no painting [at least when we toured] but the grounds, gardens, collection, docents, locations, price [free] is worth a couple hours. Catch the 10 minute movie during your walk, its worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunless_n_seattle
50,"Relaxing, interesting, mostly ... just beautiful.","What a wonderful afternoon we had. 5:00 came too soon! We enjoyed the gardens so much and got so absorbed in the whole experience, we didn't have enough time to see all the exhibits upstairs. Luckily my brother-in-law is a frequent visitor and showed us some of the high points and filled us in on the back-stories. We should have arrived earlier, enjoyed a bite at the cafe which he says is always great, and leisurely explored everything. We had 3 (mature... 50+) adults, 4 20-somethings, and a teen -- and we all enjoyed the Villa and each other. It might be a more difficult visit with young children. There are things of interest to well-rounded children, but for the average (video game/you tube/etc.) generation... they may not be as interested.When back in the L.A. area I'll definitely go back and finish the visit and try the cafe. I love that you need a parking ($15) reservation because the crowds are held to a reasonable level that way!Enjoyed a stroll on the beach after the visit too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1DerryTreeHugger
50,What a Treat,"Get tickets on line for a wonderful experience. The grounds are worth the visit alone and the museum makes it even better. No admission charge, but a $15 parking fee per car (not bad). Don't miss the entry gate, just before the intersection or you will have to wrap around and come back up PCH north. The signal lights on PCH are like waiting forever for a green light. The Villa is quiet and just a great place to visit for an educational and quiet experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rsth
40,Beautiful Villa,"The buildings and grounds of the Getty Villa are fabulous. You need to make a free reservation and parking is $15. The café was good, but the artifacts were not our favorite (compared to Getty Center). If you enjoy sculpture and vases & urns rather than paintings this is the place for you.If you have several days in LA to play tourist I highly recommend but if you have to xhoose only one museum choose the Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zztraveler
50,Excellent - Reserve,"First - Be sure to reserve via Getty Villa web site.We went on Saturday and cars without a reservation were being turned away. Parking is limited.We loved everything about the Getty Villa.We started with a lunch at the cafe. Nice with outdoor seating.The grounds, the structures, the art, the film the covers the building of the Villa were all awesome.We spent about 2.5 hours touring. The outside is outstanding so I would visit on a nice day. But in Malibu that should be almost everyday.Bring a camera and wear comfortable shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PH-Travel-Lovers
40,"Friends, Romans and Others","We had hoped to get to the Getty Center, but as it was closed our only day in town, we checked out the Getty Villa. The setting is beautiful on the hillside above Malibu. It basically covers Getty's collection of antiquities from Roman and Greek periods. But the grounds and garden are nice. The little café offers the perfect place to rest the feet and enjoy the vista.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judio

50,Beautiful,What a beautiful museum with great views of the ocean! A must for locals and visitors. The architecture and history of the museum is flawless!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/519edwinar
50,Beautiful re-creation of a Roman villa,"The Getty villa may not be authentic, although it follows plans drawn by the original archaeologist in the18th century, but it brings these plans to life in the full colour of which we only get glimpses in the original ancient remains at Herculaneum and Pompeii. (Colour courtesy of Sherwin Williams I was told) the gardens are also laid out with the pool and the statuary largely as they would have been seen in ancient times. We took the Tea by the Sea, which was a nice experience if a little expensive, and this included a guided tour which was very informative. The audio system was excellent and meant we could follow the guide without having always to keep close to him, a useful thing when you have a baby in a stroller. There are also galleries with ancient artefacts and all the staff went out of their way to answer any additional questions. Altogether a wonderful concept and a very enjoyable day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoffGuiseley
50,Beautiful and interesting,"A free ticket is required before you show up, and parking is $15 but it is well worth it. This is one of the most beautiful and interesting places that I've ever been to. I just checked everything out at my own pace, the inner and outer peristyle are gorgeous and have absolutely magnificent landscape architecture. If I were you I would go here early and then go to the Getty center after, where there is no ticket required to enter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heylookitsHerbie
50,Could have spent the entire day!,"Gorgeous views and amazing gounds - we only planned to be here about an hour or so but spent about three, and could have stayed the day! So much to see, it's amazing to me that these artifacts are so accessable, and the actual villa is incredible. Make sure you reserve your tickets online before going, and parking is $15, but admission is free. They do have a little museum shop as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaywave319
50,Beautiful!,Just a beautiful setting! The villa is just breathtaking and the modern structures around it that make up the visitors center are so cool in contrast. We learned so much on the guided tour. Well worth the trip. I would go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janetlynn13
50,Getty Museum and Villa - Ddefinitely worth a visit,"The museum, Villa and grounds are amazing and you could spend a day and still not see all of it.Its free but you need to reserve and print tickets before arriving at the museum. Parking cost 15 dollars..There is a train from the park to the top of the hill and the views from the train are amazing. You can get a free iphone audio tour guide but need to leave a picture I.D. when collecting the iphone.From the reception area you have access to the gardens, the different wings of museum and the gardens and its terraces. The gardens are beautiful and you get panoramic views of the city.The collection of antiquities are beautifully presented and the audio guide gives detailed explanation on each piece.Ddefinitely worth a visit and a day well spent, although we were only there for a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abdul7829
50,Another amazing day at the Villa,"The Getty museum is overwhelming, but the Villa transports you back into antiquity. The Villa helps one appreciate the civilizations that were Greece and Rome and how the dark ages were just that, a truly lost 500 years. This is a unique experience that goes beyond being a museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vernona719
50,Well worth the Time,Spectacular collection of antiquities in a unique setting in Pacific Palisades. Free entry - we ordered tickets online a few hours before heading there. Fantastic architecture and gardens - the roman style villa really complements the displays inside. Parking is only $15. There is a cafe with inside and outside seating. Great way to spend a few hours and immerse in some culture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CDNtraveller66
40,Beautiful,"We only took the Garden Guided Tour. Very informative about the history of the Villa and more on the gardens and types of trees and plants and flowers. Even if you're not into gardening you'll enjoy this tour. There is a architecture tour we did not take. It is free, but need reservations. And how to get there off the Pacific Coast Highway is tricky. When you print out your ticket it will tell you the details.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PABNewRichland_MN
40,"Worth visiting, 2 hours or so","Was going to the main Getty museum when guard on road said it was closed on Mondays but they had free tickets to the Getty Villa -- about 25 minutes away -- parking $15 -- very nice grounds, lots of artifacts to see and read about -- cool place -- clean --",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stormyray
40,FANTASTIC GARDENS FOR A WINTER DAY,"First let me say that you need to make a timed reservation to visit. You also need to arrive by car, taxi, or if on bus, bus ticket must be stamped by bus driver. NO walk-ins are allowed.Don't rely on your GPS to get you there. When you put in the full address it takes you somewhere else entirely.There is no entry fee but there is a parking fee of $15. If you decide to go to The Getty Center on the same day you can use the same parking ticket and park free at The Getty Center.We arrived about 10am and so glad we did. Close to the time we were done it seemed to get a little more crowded.I would recommend this tour to anyone that is wanting to spend some time strolling some gardens, taking in the ""painted"" beauty of the walls, and looking at artifacts. If you have actually been to Europe, and have seen some of these things in person, you will probably not be impressed.I would not recommend this to anyone with really active small children or people in wheelchairs.We decided to wander around on our own. We enjoyed this more I think as we were there to take some photos and see the sites. We might interact more with the staff on another trip but didn't during this one.We loved the gardens. They are not the biggest but they were so green and the flowers so lovely on a sunny winter day.Some of the artifacts on display were interesting and we made our way through most of the buildings.Overall we enjoyed our day of slow strolling and just enjoyed the sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2travelersasof2001
50,Fascinating museum,"This was our second visit, as our first was terminated, halfway through, by forest fires. I could have spent days in here, just admiring the beautiful exhibits. There was a special exhibition of ancient glass, which was amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mayso
50,So beautiful and tiberius exhibit was interesting,"Didn't realize how huge the location was. Loved the exhibits,especially the olympic athletes. Fascinating workshops and beautiful artifacts, plus super recreation. Thanks mr. Getty for sharing your love of art with the world after you. Want to go back to Italy now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMF568

Make advance preparations if you are going as a group which we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinklady007
50,So much Greece&Rome in US,"The Getty Villa is a very well organized, perfectly set up center dedicated to Greek and Roman antiquities and replicas surrounded by wonderful trees and plants. It was a very good experience of a museum. Set up, light and information about every little section of the museum was very professionally arranged considering the basic necessities of visitors of all ages and physical conditions. Gardens were beautiful and peacefully takes you away from the visitors crowd when you need a time out. Enough, accessible and very clean restrooms. Very satisfying gift shop especially considering the books available. Recommended to all age groups having an interest in antiquities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BasakSteryo
50,Stunning,"I learned of this museum through Tripadvisor and the reviews were not wrong. Recreating ancient Roman villas sounds like something that might be done in Las Vegas but this was extremely tasteful. The ancient Roman and Greek art was beautiful but the real attractions are the stunning gardens and buildings. We arrived on an overcast and cloudy day and were still impressed with the villa. When the sun finally came out it, we just sat and admired our surroundings.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We drove to the Villa only to find that we were meant to pre-book online for a particular timeslot. However, we were still let in by the friendly guard (I suspect it must have been a quiet day). Parking at $15 is not cheap but it is probably an admission fee in disguise. I was later told by an LA tour guide that the parking fee even has to be paid if someone drops you off at the villa without parking and the only way around is either to walk or to take a bus.The 12 minute film detailing the history of the villa is also worth watching. While waiting in the queue, we spoke to one of the staff who was very friendly and gave us tips for things to do all over LA as well.If I were to come back to LA, I would definitely revisit the Getty Villa and perhaps give it 3 hours rather than the rushed 90 minutes we had this time around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DWD26
50,An Excellent Afternoon,The Getty Villa is a wonderful place to spend an afternoon. The museum offers some amazing Greek and Roman artifacts in a very attractive setting. The grounds of the Villa are magnificent and it is really pleasant to spend time in the gardens as well-which happen to face the Pacific Ocean. The museum offers a free self guided tour on an I-Touch (which they provide) and it allows you to either choose a tour or move at your own pace wherever you wish. There are also free guided tours at set timesIt is easy and free to get tickets online at their website and there is ample parking in the garage ($15 and can also be used at the nearby Getty Center). There's also a cafe if you are hungry-although we eat at a local Malibu beach restaurant after visiting the villa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffn146
50,Delightful Reminder of Classical Rome and Greece,"For us the highlights of the Getty Villa are the building and grounds. We enjoy the exhibits, but the architecture and gardens are pure delight. Our favorite exhibit is the remarkable glass. Look for it because it's a small exhibit and easy to walk by.Be sure to make a reservation. And plan time to linger in the gardens. They're actually rather contained, but they are well kept and lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CLC48
50,Ancient Greece and Rome come to Malibu,My visit to the Getty Villa exceeded my expectations. The setting is breath taking and the amount of antiquities is amazing. I could not believe the only cost was parking to see this attraction. If the weather is good this is a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenwM8672IM
50,A Real Treat--Don't Miss It!,"If you think you've seen all that LA has to offer, check out the Getty Villa. We had an excellent 45 minute guided architecture tour and lots of extra time to stroll the grounds. The antiquities inside are something to see too--don't miss the racy drinking vessels on the second floor. Wonderful museum shop with well-priced souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ght0314
50,Antiquities in Malibu,Great day trip from the Los Angeles area. We spent a sunny Saturday tripping through the Roman and Greek empire in sunny Malibu. An impressive collection of exhibits of antiquities and history. There are even some interactive rooms for kids.The early glass blowing exhibit was especially nice.We also got a little snack outside at the cafe which we got to eat and drink walking the groundsYou need to order your tickets in advance through the internet because they really limit the numbers inside the museum. Security is very tight and you will not make it in without the tickets.The limited public admitted really make this a comfortable experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adventureseeker4242
50,Lovely Free Museum,"Very important to reserve your ticket online first. Even though it is free, you have to get the tickets (choose date and time). But expect to pay parking of 15$. Also it is NOT pet-friendly unless it is an service animal. I had my service dog in a stroller and everything was fine. The place is very nice, clean and serene. A lot of beautiful scenery and interesting art history. It was great. It took us 2 to 3 hours to visit the museum. There are clean restrooms and a nice café with terrasse. You can take photography in the museum but make sure to ask because some rooms don't allow it. There are security guards everywhere. There was road construction to get to the Villa so we had a lot of traffic getting there... maybe you have to add 15-20 mins for the extra traffic. Don't confuse the Getty CENTER and the Getty VILLA. They're 2 different museums and at very different location. Getty Center is SUPER GREAT too so if you have time, pay it a visit. It is bigger too and will take more time. We had a great peaceful time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mononoki
50,Unbelievable juxtaposition of the ancient world and the glitz of Hollywood,"Entry is free, but you must book on the Internet, then pay $15 parking.J P Getty has provided America with a truly amazing collection of ancient Roman and Greek artefacts. The renovated building, with magical gardens and water features makes this a stunning place to visit.Make sure you watch the introductory movie when you arrive.The exhibits are logically laid out, the descriptions are clear and concise.We thoroughly enjoyed the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevea617
20,Some excellent exhibits but ...,"The temporary exhibition of ancient glass was fascinating. However, two things let the place down. Although most of the staff were very pleasant and helpful, one of the greeters had a serious attitude problem. He seemed to think that the guests were there for his benefit, rather than the other way round. Either the Getty hiring policy is faulty or the training programme does not work. The replica villa, which might work in isolation, is flanked by shuttered concrete buildings which also might work in isolation. The two side-by-side do not work at all. One building is shuttered concrete with 'Roman' columns on top. Disaster! Unless you have a real interest in ancient Greek, Etruscan or Roman antiquities, go to the Getty Center instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RLP50
50,Always nice to get back,"That the Villa has a touch of kitsch is evident, as well as it is evident that it is beautiful and a marvelous gift to the American people and the worldI have been here several times in the course of 40 years and always loved itThe new theater in front of the main entrance to the museum is frankly uglyNevertheless being Italian seeing the massacre of Pompeii due to the criminal disdain of the Italian governments towards art cultur heritage of my country I wish we would have entrusted Pompeii ercolanum etc to organizations like the GettyShame on my country",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diporzio
50,Getty Villa,"The Getty Villa is easy drive from Santa Monica. You have to call ahead for a appt. I did not have my computer, so the person I spoke to gave me a ticket number, that I presented at the gate. The Museum is free, parking is $15.00. If you have your receipt stamped as you are leaving, you can can get in free at the Getty Museum, around 20 minutes away. The Getty Villa is a must to see, the villa alone, and the gardens is a experience. It is a replica of a Roman Villa. The museum is filled with .7,000 years of ancient art, from the end of the Stone Age to the fall of the Roman Empire. I am more of a visual art lover, but found the collection very fascinating. If you are in Southern California, definitely worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422richards422
50,Idyllic,"When you visit the Los Angeles, CA area, you will really want to visit the Getty Villa. It is a museum (a re-creation of a villa destroyed by Mt. Vesuvius in 79AD) … you know, Pompeii, etc. It is a place to go and stay the day. There are two excellent tours, Architecture and Garden, and a great system whereby you wear a receiver so that you can hear the docent from a nearby bench. So, don't worry about becoming too tired standing, etc. It is beautiful. You need reservations, get them online. Try to plan to spend a good part of the day. Cafeteria style food was delicious w/many different choices. Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudiFran
50,Fabulous - Run do not walk to this place,"The art is great ( Roman, Etruscan and Greek ). High quality, some truly novel pieces and interesting presentation by theme ( comedy, theater, etc.). What truly makes this museum exceptional is the setting - the architecture and design of the buildings and spaces. A feast for the eyes. Even the cafe had good food and was not totally outrageous in price. I liked the museum shop, as well. Unfortunately, we had way too little time here. If I go back and I will, actually, I would spend at least 5-6 hours to have a relaxing experience. Considering it is free, except for the $15 parking fee, it is one of the best deals around. In fact, if you go and see the Getty Center ( which is also great ) on the same day, you only have to pay 1 parking fee and that makes a great deal even better. The only negative is that you will have to make each visit shorter than it deserves. If you go to the LA area and you don't see these museums, unless you hate art, you are cheating yourself. Go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJJC_Family
40,Refreshing break,"Unless somebody tells you about it, you can pass the Getty Villa completely unnoticeably. You can access it only driving from the South and you have to know preciseley which turn to take. Even though the visit is free you have to pay for the parking, and very important,you need a reservation.But it is well worth the effort, the Villa is such a special place, a return in time that makes you feel like you are an actor in a movie set. Fantastic, manicured gardens and clear pools! Antiquity at its best! Wonderful architecture and interior design, if you own a big house, you may come here to get some inspiration for your next remodelling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveller_12
50,Great Docent lead tours,"We went on 3 of the docent lead tours and they were all great. It gave me a better appreciation and understanding of the art that we saw. We went on the tours about the architecture, the highlights and the special exhibit on Tiberius. The docents were all very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend the tours.Make sure you make reservations on-line since they will not let you park unless you have a print out of the reservation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_Buff29
50,Visit to the Getty Villa,I am still thinking about my visit to Getty Villa. I live in NY and have visited many museums but this was not only a museum but scenery from the top of the villa took my breath away. This is a must see if you are in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cvkerr19
50,Beautiful reconstruction of Villa de Papiri in Herculaneum,"It was wonderful to see how a country villa of a wealthy family would have looked, and it seemed to be faithfully reconstructed from the ruins uncovered in Herculaneum. While Pompeii is extensive and fascinating, it is mostly gray ruins. The Getty Villa appears in excellent condition,newly renovated. The inner and outer peristyles were even designed in typical plantings of those times. The statuary in the outer peristyle was placed according to where it was excavated in Herculaneum. While a few of the statues were missing noses and arms, it was refreshing to see pottery and glass work that appeared complete rather than shards. The decorated wine drinking vessels were amazing in their depictions of life then. The mansion is set in well tended grounds with an amphitheater and indoor/outdoor cafe, however there is relatively little walking other than just around the mansion. With so much to see in the mansion and lunch, we spent 4 1/2 or 5 hours there. There is no entry fee but the parking fee is $15, and reservations (can be done online) are required.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanneJ739
50,Making Sense,"The Getty Villa and gardens are a ""recreation"" of what might have been the mansion of a rich family in Italy before Etna exploded and covered Pompeii and Herculaneum. The displays and exhibits connect Greek, Roman and Etruscan cultures together in a way that really makes sense of how those cultures influenced and interacted with each other. The details involved in creating this place are painstaking and amazing. I especially enjoyed standing on a balcony and overlooking a small amphitheater complete with stone (marble?) seating. Getty came after Hearst and Huntington, and you can see their influences in what he tried to accomplish here. He succeeded. If you can't get to the Med yourself (or even if you can), go to the Getty Villa. It's all there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChubbyElf
50,Great and wonderful,Extremely enjoyed visiting this place. It's fabulous and the art is great too. Visit if you are in Malibu. Great gardens and also great food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mabrincat
40,Veni Vidi Villa!,"This place is almost more like a masquerade to me than a museum - the scenery could be Mediterranean, the villa recreates the days of the Empire, and the sculptures and pottery harken back to the heights of Greco/Roman culture. Seriously, it's fantastic that this place is free, but if they just staged some bed sheets nearby and charged $10 for a makeshift toga to wear on the premises, I bet it'd be a big hit. The only anachronisms are that there's tomato sauce on the pizzas and you likely burned a decent amount of dinosaur remains to get here.Speaking of which, if you drove here, and you want to make a day of art, you'd be good to attempt to visit Getty Center immediately afterwards, since your $15 parking fee covers both places for one day (though you'll need to see Customer Service for validation). You can then see firsthand how displays of art have changed over the past 2,000 years. Just be sure to ditch the toga.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SquareBohemian
50,Excellent day out,"Very well designed with all the facilities you could want to enjoy a full day here. The orientation film is excellent. The permanent collections are well displayed with good explanations. The special exhibitions are small but well thought out. The restaurant is good. The family room is a great place to take children. They can decorate impressive Greek vases (two of the best Greek vases in the museum are in this room to provide them with inspiration) and they can participate in Greek theatre.Timed tickets ensure that it never gets too crowded but we were glad we went early before lots of people showed up.Although the collection is not as big as those in Europe's major museums it succeeds brilliantly in conveying the feeling of being in the villa of a rich, successful, ancient Roman.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annerly777
50,Idilic views and ethereal art,The setting of the Getty Villa overlooking the Pacific Ocean is breathtaking and the collection of antiquities is impressive. When planning your visit reserve an entrance time as early in the day as possible because the collections and the villa are best enjoyed at a leisurely pace. Several tours are available free of charge that highlight the culinary gardens or the architecture of the villa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLE2013
40,Much More Than One Visit,"One important point to start: As soon as you know you will be visiting, get your scheduled time online. Our visit ended the day, and we would have enjoyed it much more if we'd had more time and earlier in the day. The antiquities presented are but part of the story as the museum structure and property are magnificent. Again, more time and we'd have appreciated this much more. Seeing the statues of people living that long ago, in such generally good condition was breathtaking. By no means well versed in this era, I went away amazed.It was crowded that day, though, a holiday week, so if possible choose your time wisely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmpoz
50,Wonderful Roman villa museum based on Herculaneum,"We called in and managed to snag a parking spot on our way back from LAX just in time to enjoy lunch on a lovely outdoor table. Stand in line, get a number and be sure and order a cheese plate and a glass of champagne. Salads are fresh and flavorful, and their bruschetta is inspired. We come here often. For the price of parking you get great food, architecture, views, garden and Greek/Roman art with changing exhibits-this month is a giant bronze Tiberius. Architecture is based on aspects of Herculaneum and Pompeiian villas. A wonderful place to have lunch and spend the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dkayrenick
50,Overall enjoyed more that Getty Centre,This was my first visit as in the past seemed a bit difficult to organize as you have to book online for a particular time. It turned out that wasnt such a big issue as the booking is just to control the crowds that want to come so everyone has a good experience..It is a beautiful building recreating faithfully a roman villa using materials from the original sources in Europe. The collection of antiquities was the best I have seen and the gardens and views across to the ocean were stunning.I went by bus and you have to get the bus driver to give you a card to prove you came by bus or they wont let you in even if you have a ticket. The same if you arrive by taxi. This is apparently a restriction imposed by the local authorities to prevent walk up admissions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/highst25
50,a delightful surprise,"I had a great experience visiting this place. It happened to be a spontaneous visit, too, which would have been a mistake had the entrance guard/escort at the gate not GIVEN us tickets after finding out we didn't have any reservations.The villa, on top of being an incredibly beautiful mansion with an immaculate fountain courtyard and a view of the sea, contained a collection of museum-worthy artifacts and sculptures. Interactive displays and a small library were very informative and educational. Just like many other museums, the attraction has a gift shop and restaurant, although the restaurant had closed before we had a chance to try it out.I wish I could have stayed longer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajenshus
40,good but no substitute for Pompei,We toured the Getty Villa in November. It houses many of the collections of J. Paul Getty in a setting where they would have been displayed in the era of Pompei in Italy. It is a recreation of an ancient Italian vila. It is nice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Continent8
50,Great place to wander the day away,Wonderful building and grounds. Be sure to make a reservation on line: entry is free but parking costs $15.We had a 2pm reservation which allowed for one tour and a speed trip thru the antiquity section. I would allow 4-5 hrs in the future with a snack break in between.The gardens are lovely even though winter was taking its toll. The exhibits are not only great to look at but also informative.I plan to be back at a different season.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Balticrambler
50,Getty Villa,"Can get crowded in new exhibit areas, but they try to time the new arrivals by requiring an online reservation to get in, so it could be worse.Many docent tours available throughout the day, make use of them, they are great.The Villa houses the antiquities collection: statuary, objects, etc. For paintings go to the OTHER Getty Museum off of the 405 freeway.Museum is free but parking is $15. Make reservations online prior to arrival as they may refuse entry without reservations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bassnfly2
50,Impressive,"We booked the Getty Villa in the morning and just thought it would be a 2-hours maximum but it ended up we spent 4 hours there. There were various guided tours, which we took the garden tour and special exhibition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P_and_C2013
50,Beautiful museum with lovely grounds and gorgeous artifacts.,"This is a lovely way to spend an afternoon. The museum is not huge, so you can take your time and see the entire collection in a couple of hours. The grounds and gardens are beautiful. The building itself has an amazing variety of marble on the floors, stairways and walls. The collection of ancient glass is gorgeous, the Roman and Greek antiquities are spectacular. The minute details in some of the vessels are incredible. Read the names of the donors in the room with the gold coins. You will be surprised that many of them were donated by a well known comedian.Make advance reservations for parking. There is no admission fee, but the parking is $15.After wandering through all of the exhibits, we sat on the patio and had lunch at the cafe. They have a variety of plates that are perfect for sharing as well as sandwiches, salads and seasonal specials. We had the artisan cheese plate and the mediterranean platter with a selection of desserts. It was a very fun, relaxing way to spend the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bstorm
50,Incredible place to visit,"We went here before about 30 years ago and remember it as great, we went again and now it is simply stunning. The new exhibitions are just marvellous, seeing artefacts and ceramic pots from 500+ years BC just blows your mind and so well displayed. The villa was just a great place to visit.One word of help, if you go to the Getty Centre first,as we did, you get to park your car free the same day at the Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/479AndrewG
50,An afternoon in a first century Roman Villa,"This is worth the trip. A little dodgy getting into the estate especially if you are driving south. You'll wonder why you are making a u-turn in a subdivision but follow your navigator.The paving into the property is reminicesent of a Roman road so appreciate the bumps. Getty bought the 64 acre site in 1945 to house his collection of Roman, Greek and Etruria antiquities and what a beautiful collection it is. We loved the glassware. I think it was invented 2500 BC but might be wrong. And what about those cameos? And the delightful pull toy with the chariot driver going up and down. And the little beggar girl piggy bank!The house/ palace is a re-creation of the Villa dei Papiri which was destroyed by Vesuvius in 79 AD.Great children's hands on area too plus additional services such as sign-language tours, braille, wheelchairs and strollers. Lovely restaurant. We spent three hours and could have gone longer but too pooped. Call and check on the special exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciab992
50,Always beautiful,"I have been here a few times, and it never disappoints. Each time I find something amazing that I didn't see before. Being able to be so close too such valuable works of art and archeological value is mind blowing. The grounds are absolutely beautiful, and depending on the time of year you go the garden takes on many looks. This beautiful home, so close to the Pacific Coast Hwy in Los Angeles, is a hidden gem, and when you consider that you only pay for the cost of parking and entire car load of people can view these treasures for less than the price of a cup of coffee.Go, explore, be awed and amazed, you won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mily4
50,The original Getty and still a Gem.,"An excellent afternoon activity with Family, Friends or on your own. Must make parking reservations in advance or you can bus up from Santa Monica. One of the great places to visit while in Los Angeles and worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
50,This place blew my mind!,"All I saw was beautiful gardens, amazing statues, incredible architecture and sweet people. I took my family, and we enjoyed everything. I had never seen statues in my life until I came to The Getty Villa. One thing that amazed me was ""the pool,"" not sure what it's called but it was so beautiful. Definitely coming back AGAIN.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GraiceC
50,Spectacular,"We arrived at the Getty Villa a few minutes before ten a.m. Admission is free, but you must make an online reservation. Parking is $15. There is a large parking garage with an elevator with excellent signage.There are so many beautiful, interesting and informative things to see here. I suggest doing the garden tour first thing before it gets too hot. The architecture tour is amazing too. You go to the meeting place and get in line for your audio ear piece - an excellent way to hear the docent.The last tour we did was the highlights of the collection. Apparently each docent has their favorites to describe and show you. Both our tour docents were articulate and very knowledgable about the subject matter.We also saw on our own the Cyrus Cylinder which was breathtaking in its history and importance.There is a cafe and a coffee kiosk if you spent more than a few hours at the Getty. It is not inexpensive and the menu is limited although what we had was good. The gift shop has some high quality items.It's a vacation from your vacation!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travchef
50,Beautiful roman architecture in LA,"You can book a free admission online at the website, there is no fee, but there is a $15 parking fee which you can also use at the Getty. If you want to see both, I would see the Getty in morning which has a modern architecture and houses modern art and the Getty Villa in the afternoon which houses Greek and Roman art. The Villa is a replica of a Roman villa. I would save the details for the volunteer docents who can tell you more about the villa during the tours. Both Getty and Getty Villa not only have interesting art, but also have amazing grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadarien
50,Where time disappears,"Splendid art, gardens, and antiquities! Plus a lovely restaurant to boot. Just being there feels like one has been transported in time. A perfect way to spend a day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheOneandMore
50,Dreamy Seaside Roman Villa filled with artifacts,"The Getty Villa is worth visiting just to experience the architecture and dream about living there. The ocean views are breathtaking and the cafe is delicious. Whenever we have out of town guests, I take them to the Getty Villa and I always notice some fascinating detail each time. The cafe is delicious and admission is free. Parking is $15 and I guarantee there is no place to park other than the parking lot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeneferOSEA
50,Beautiful villa with art,"This seaside roman villa is a must to see at least once before you die. Recreated by J.Paul Getty from a famous roman villa destroyed by mount Vesuvius, it houses gardens and architecture and art you will not believe. The free tours are outstanding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinkQ7630MZ
50,A place to be educated and inspired! Worth the trip!,"The Getty Villa is less well known that the Getty Museum. It is a much smaller structure but it is no less beautiful than the museum, just different. The Getty Museum is for paintings, while the Getty Villa houses ancient artifacts. Currently, on display is the Cyrus Cylinder ~ an artifact in cuneiform that documents the achievements of king Cyrus and gives a view into what kind of king he was. All these artifacts, such as statues and vessels give us a glimpse into the past, how they lived and went about their lives. The property was once the house of J.P. Getty. It is beautifully detailed. Just look at the staircase leading to the 2nd floor. It is all mable and even the handrail is carved from the wall. There is so much to notice. If you happen to be standing in line to view something, during the weekend perhaps, take the time to notice the detailed ceilings, the mable mosaics floor, the shadow and glare free glass that houses the items exhibited. Take the time to wander in the garden and from there look at the gorgeous view of the Pacific Ocean. It is breathtaking!The tickets are free to be ordered online or over the phone. They are date and time specific to regulate the number of people in the villa at one time. However, the time is quite flexible with a window of 2 hours. So if you sign up for 2 pm, you can arrive anywhere from 1-3 pm. There is a parking fee of $15 per vehicle.This venue is good for anytime of year, rain or shine. Try to come during the week when the traffic of visitors is far less than in the weekend. There is also a restaurant where refreshments or meals can be bought.Nice place to take guests too. It is easy to forget that one is L.A. ~ it feels more like you're in Europe. Just lovely and worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CamelliaS_12
50,Beautiful Roman Villa,"The Getty Villa is totally different to the Getty Centre. The Villa in Malibu is built to look exactly like a Roman Villa, with spectacular courtyards, atriums, statues, gardens, pools and fountains, whilst the Getty Centre is a very modern complex of buildings, very striking . If you get the chance try to visit both. Admission is free but parking is $15 but if you get the ticket validated you can use it to visit both of them on the same day but it would be a shame to rush both visits by doing this.For the villa you need to book a time slot in advance, either on line or by telephone. Best to arrive early as it will not then be so crowded. Once you are in, you can stay as long as you wish. There are free tours led by volunteers so check what is happening when you arrive and put your name down for what interests you. The guides are excellent, friendly and informative.The whole complex is beautifully maintained - do allow 3-4 hrs to really enjoy all there is to see.There is also a very good café with outside seating - much better than the one at the Getty centre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frequentraveller_12
50,Beautiful!,It's a beautiful museum! Wonderful location and surroundings. We preferred the villa to the Getty Center actually.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anouschkar
50,Magnificent location for a great museum,The Getty Villa was constructed to house J Paul Getty's collection of ancient artefacts. It is modelled on a villa in Herculaneum and features spectacular courtyards and atrium which connect the outside space to the internal galleries. The site is beautifully maintained and free of charge ($15 charge for car parking). Booking ahead of time is essential for a timed ticket. As a result the location doesn't seem crowded. There is an excellent cafe and free-of-charge iPod-based audio guides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Romond
50,Beautiful!,We stopped in on the way to Malibu. This place is stunning. You could easily spend a couple of hours on the exhibits. The museum is on beautiful grounds with a beautiful view. Staff is helpful and friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maggs123
50,Great day in CA,"The ticket is free, but parking has a fee. Came by bus right to the entrance. My ticket was for 3pm but had no problem to come in around 11am. Another guy came in around that time and they gave him a free ticket with no problem. Wonder if it's more for parking regulations.The museum has a nice tour after tour schedule so you'll be able to spend the day in a beautiful villa environment. Plus they had a live performance of the day of my visit, which was very nice.Saw a pomegranate tree for the first time in my life:) take your camera, the views are fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel-77-Kate
50,Beautiful and well worth the visit.,"Believe it or not this beautiful place was free of charge! There was a nominal fee for parking, but other than that FREE.There are beautiful gardens, museums, and a lovely view of the Pacific Ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SwissyFaye
50,Amazing setting filled with Greek and Roman antiquities,"When planning our southern California trip our oldest son’s first wish was to take his Dad to The Getty Villa. This from a child who has never requested a museum stop in his lifetime! Years earlier we’d spent hours in the Getty before a summer camp. Between author Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson and the Olympian series and that Getty visit, he’s had an interest in Greek and Roman gods ever since.For teens and children who enjoy Greek and Roman gods, goddesses and heroes they’ll have a blast viewing numerous images grouped around specific characters in The Villa’s the human-scale galleries. No matter what age of children you have along, don’t skip the interactive art area. Although designed for some of the youngest visitors, the teens on the trip enjoyed creating shadow poses worthy of a Grecian Urn as well as creating other “works” of art.This is a museum that a family can tackle in a single morning or afternoon, unlike mega-museums where you carefully plan which time periods you want to see and know that it will take a lifetime to appreciate the entire permanent collection.The floor plan of The Getty Villa is based on a Pompeii villa, the setting is on a hill above Malibu. Do take time to explore the grounds. The gardens and use of water features add to the overall beauty of this amazing setting.Museum admission is free, although there’s a charge for parking. Even though the admission is free, do not forget to book your visit in advance as this is how The Villa controls the number of visitors who view the collection each day. Although I enjoy the settings of The Getty Villa and the Getty Center equally, I prefer the quality of the collection at The Villa. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hbsboston
50,A little bit of paradise,Don't forget to pre-book - easy to do online but you need to do it. Easy to find. Fantastic collection and something of a marvel in terms of location and setting. The villa is a wonderful way to see what a real villa would have been like and the collection is first class. Worth a couple of hours at least.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidJ758
50,What a terrific place!,"The building itself is a gem. Take the architectural tour of the Villa. Free. Did I mention the entire place is free and has a number of other free tours as well? The Roman Villa is exquisite, gardens, and pool, and all. Parking is $15, but I did the Getty Center the same day, and so got a two-fer. The Cyrus Cylinder was in a special exhibit here, and came with a number of other Persian-related exhibits and movies. Very informative and inspiring (the free iPod audio guide adds to the experience). Well worth the four hours I spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skinnspirit
50,A fabulous day out,"The villa is modelled on one at Oplontis, near Herculaneum and Pompeii, which was covered in the ash of Vesuvius. It houses the antiquities collection of John Paul Getty. The artworks are impressive, but if anything are eclipsed even by the villa itself, and the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arncliffegirl
50,Impressive,"The setting is a recreation of an ancient Roman country house and gardens. Scattered throughout the villa and gardens were 1200 Roman and Greek antiquities. I found it a great venue to better understand ancient history. I would see the movie when you first arrive. There is a tranquility about the place and some great views of the ocean. There is a $15 parking fee, but handicapped parking is free in a garage that is closer to the entrance and elevators. There is a cafe for food purchases that tend to be expensive, but the food is excellent and goes beyond the standard fare of hot dogs and hamburgers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drichabel
50,Excellent stop off before driving up HY 101,"There is so much to the Getty Villa that even a couple of hours doesn't do it justice. But that just means it is perfect for a return visit. We were lucky we arrived just when it opened for the day and were able to get in without a prior reservation and without any charge, other than for parking. It's a lovely area and inside are quite a few treasures with plenty of security personnel watching over them, but being very friendly and helpful as well. I was especially pleasantly surprised when I was able to take pictures of the artworks. That's not allowed these days in so many places. The shop has a variety of items to buy, including some fascinating books and lovely tasteful souvenirs and art pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vlherring
50,Lovely,"Free admission, but you have to reserve your ticket in advance.Beautiful gardens, beautiful views (you have the ocean in front of you), and amazing pieces of art. The exhibits focus on Greek and Roman art, but I am an art history geek, so it was perfect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/begutierrez
30,Not my favorite,"I rather prefer The Getty Museum!!. I know, both places are way different, but this one was just fine compares with the museum. The ocean view from the balcony is amazing but all the art is too much of the same things! Sorry, I didn't love It!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xivi09
50,Cyrus cylinder,"The Getty is always a favourite destination when in LA. This time we were incredibly lucky that our visit coincided with the Cyrus cylinder exhibition, a chronicle from ancient Persia detailing the exploits and humane policies of Cyrus after he took over the Babylon Empire and his emancipation of the Jews. Well done Getty for keeping it fresh for 40 years!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yubitzume
50,Closest thing to a European vacation in So Cal! Loved it!,"This place is recreates a villa in Italy, and features informative tours of the gardens and antiquities. I have been all over the Mediterranean, and felt transported back there. Guides are informative(and free) Also, the cafe offers delicious , healthy options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NTLALA
40,"Beware: you must reserve and you need a car... then, excellent collection and setting","You must reserve well in advance and go there either with your car or with a cab. Indeed, we nearly missed the Villa, because: 1- we tried to reserve two tickets via web, on the day before our visit; but every entrance time slot had already been sold out and 2-we decided to try anyway and we went there, but without our car: discovering that pedestrians are not allowed!! (a taxi is OK as well, but only if it drives you IN the villa). This is very American... Note that in the previous days we had visited the Getty center and asked for info, but they did not tell us of these 2 requirements.Plus, on the following night we had to catch a plane, so we could not postpone the visit.We were very angry, but we explained the situation to the security guy and he understood: we had to go and retrieve our car, but then he allowed us to get in anyway.The visit was definitely worth the effort; even for us Italians, who are used to museums with Etruscan, Roman and Greek pieces of art. The Greek vases, the small and large statues etc.are interesting and well presented; but in addition, the overall setting of the villa, with the amphitheater, large pool and peristilium etc. is an experience in itself. The villa is a display of grandness without bad taste, because it matches the treasures it contains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sergiob703
50,Unique place by the ocean,"Amazing place, beautiful gardens and excellent collection, mostly from Greek and Roman Empire. Make a reservation online, we didn't know and were able to get in because we got there early (10:00 am) no line, totally smooth but by the time we left there was a long line to get into the parking area, it took us about 3 hours to see everything and headed to a nice Rest. by the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosU763
50,A must see ... but call for reservations.,"The Getty Villa must be seen to believe. Free admission, but parking is $15, and worth every penny. You will see art works, dating back to 2500 BC. The grounds are picture perfect, so bring your camera. Cafe menu is sufficient, and tasty. Make your reservations (a must) early, so you have time to see The Getty Center, about twelve miles away. Don't forget to pick up a parking coupon, so you will be able to park free, when you arrive at the Center. Hope this is helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FLworldwanderer
50,Wow!,My husband and I stopped here during a camping trip in Malibu. What a great experience! So many artifacts and information. Highly recommended for anyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F4865AOandreab
50,Everyone should see this!,"If you can't get to Rome and Athens this year, this is the next best thing. The ancient artwork here is unique, splendid and plentiful. The setting is beyond beautiful and maintained to the highest standards. Everything you see is presented perfectly. Yes, perfectly, and you likely will spend your entire visit without once wishing they had done something better, or even differently. My best try at saying something helpful is -- do their tours. Like the villa itself, they're free. I didn't ask, but I do not think the tour leaders were just knowledgeable volunteers. My guess is that they were all professional staff, because they had that kind of knowledge. I loved the Collection Highlights Tour which included the Victorious Youth, a rare bronze of an ancient Olympic victor, retrieved from a Roman shipwreck. Our guide told us how it was made, and showed us what the now-beautiful statue looked like when he was pulled from the bottom of the sea. The Garden Tour and Architecture Tours are also terrific. I've been to the Villa before, about six years ago, and hope to go again some day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silkyapril
40,The Getty,"The Getty Malibu has wonderful artifacts, a beautiful garden, and great views of the ocean. No entrance fee but you need reservations for parking. The day we were there, there was live music in the courtyard. It is a wonderful way to see art and have a great day near the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loisp2013
50,Worth the time to visit,"My wife and and drove down from Calabasas to visit and it was worth it. The collection of Roman, etc. artifacts was as good as any I have ever seen. The grounds were beautiful, even just to relax and take a walk. By making people secure a reservation for a specific entry time, it never was too crowded. Unless you are a scholar, you can cover everything in 2 to 3 hrs. There is a $15 fee for parking, but no entry fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EaarO
50,Amazing!,Great place to visit - worth the money and time! This Malibu location is beautiful and a great getaway to see this amazing place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingDuo6
50,Amazing,"The grounds are amazing, the museum itself is designed to replicate an ancient villa in Italy, that was buried after the eruption of Vesuvius...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manyw
50,Out of this world!,If don't have time to visit any other galleries or museums then visit this one plus the center if you can. It was set out thematically which helps you understand the connections between periods and places eg themes like wine or worship. The gardens and the house are a tasteful reconstruction of a Roman villa. There were many precious stones like onyx and porphyria used in this construction. A place not to be missed. The visit is free but you pay for parking which is $15 but this includes a visit to the Getty Center. It pays to book and you can make a reservation online about two months in advance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedAuckland1
40,A world nestled away in the PCH mountains,"this is literally its own world, you forget your in Los Angeles. The views of the ocean are great. Overall very informative experience in history too. The surroundings especially the architecture is beautiful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BFStravel
50,Absolutely Stunning,"We had a day in LA before flying out in the evening and, having been to the Getty Museum last time, we decided to go to the Villa.I am did classics at University and was astounded at the design of the museum and the collection. It was stunning. Thematically laid out it was a wonderful artistic, cultural and educational experience. While we were there, there was a special exhibition of the Persian Cyrus Cylinder which was truly wonderful. While I would debate whether the scroll was an antiquities version of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as claimed (Cyrus was a brutal militaristic autocrat and the cylinder is not more than a long-winded paean of self praise) but overall the xhibition was superb. I would like a couple of days at the Villa to really absorb everything that is there. I am sorry that I shall miss the Tiberius exhibition scheduled for later in October.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djhdcj
50,Best go in Los Angeles,"We made online reservation, it is free to enter the villa, but you must pay $15.00 for parking. The Villa is well maintained, very nice. The garden is so beautiful, and in the Villa, there are a lot of Italian and greece collections. Very good",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiger1127
50,America's best classical art museum in a beautiful villa and garden,"This is the grandest house-museum (modeled on Herculaneum villa covered by Mt Vesuvius's lava in 79 AD) combined with the finest collection of Greek-Roman art in the US. We have visited the wonderfully restored site of Herculaneum and the classical museums at Delphi and the new Acropolis museum in Athens; this villa in Malibu is smaller but right up there in quality with the others. Beautiful gardens, fountains, elaborate marbled plazas and courtyards adorn the exquisite architecture of the villa. The rich collection, 1900 pieces, are arranged thematically, not chronologically to be accessible to the casual visitor of the classics--gods and goddesses, Dionysus and the theatre, athletes, women and children, stories of the Trojan War, a basilica, a massive sculpture of Heracles. The best handout-guide I have ever seen in my life, with floorplan, and visitor amenities; but also a list of the gods and goddesses, a silhouette guide to the shapes and names of vases and urns (that is the surviving record of painting) and maps of the ancient world. The eruditon and care that went into that guide, however, was lacking in the labels that accompanied the art. They were juvenile at best: ""Africa is a continent."" ""This man is just like someone you'd see on [name of LA intersection]."" The other jolt was a huge mechanized wheel used for some performance in the outdoor classical theatre and right at the front entrance. Maybe other visitors can attest to a wonderful performance and justify its huge presence. But these two blips are minor in this magnificent museum. You do need to reserve ahead of time--it's free but you must have a reservation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ann2009CT
40,Good museum,"The villa is a replica of a Herculaneum house. The reconstruction in 2006 added walls around the villa, simulating an archaeological dig. In good weather (when isn't it a good weather in Malibu?) it's good place to visit. The museum exposition - ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt - is not large, but very good. You may see everything there is to see in the villa in two hours. If you know even a little about Greek/Roman culture, don't waste your time on guided tours - minimal amount of information. Same for 12-minutes-long video, you may watch it on the museum website. I suggest reading a bit before you go, and then enjoying a walk through the villa and the garden, and seeing the exhibit.Admission is free, but you must reserve tickets online or by calling the museum. Parking fee - $15. There is a full service cafe, and, of course, museum store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneS810
50,breathtaking,an italian villa in the middle of Malibu. Took a tour which was informative and entertaining. Reccomend to get there early and get the joint admission to the Museum and Villa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WonderTrekk
50,Exquisite Exhibits!,"Built in the grounds of one of Paul Getty' s homes, this museum was opened in 1974 while he was residing in London. Unfortunately, he died before he was able to see it himself. The architecture, the gardens and the exhibits are superb. Although entrance is free, parking costs $15 per car. Tickets must usually be ordered online and printed beforehand. However, you could phone and receive an order number from the call center if you encounter problems with the website, which is what I did. If you visit the Getty Center and the Getty Villa on the same day, you only need to pay the $15 parking fee once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IgelEye
50,Take the Curator Tour,Such a beautiful museum with an important collection of antiquities. Highly recommend the free Curator Tour - an hour with a small group on whatever topic the curator finds fascinating. A terrific way to see though a brand new lens!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelMom269
50,A definite must see and do!,"The artwork and architecture are of course fabulous. Great place for a date, a learning experience for the children or a long visit with a dear friend Getty Villa covers it all. The gardens are fantastic and the weather is nearly always beautiful. What more can I say?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calgirl71
50,Great architecture and art.,"The parking is free if you go to both the Getty Center and the Villa on the same day. I'm glad that the Villa was closed the day we went to the Center or we would have tried to do both and there is too much to see at both places. You also have to make a reservation but if you go to the Getty Center first, they will give you tickets. It's not as wide open as the Getty Center but it's just as interesting. I'd say the Center was cleaner (bathrooms) but there were probably at least 4 school groups at the Villa at the same time. It's worth it to take a drive up the coast before or after making this visit. There is no fee but you do pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAnn9
50,Beautiful grounds and impressive collection of antiquities make this a must see site,"I was in California for my first visit. The typical tacky tourist spots of LA were not on my 'to do' list, however the Getty Museums were. My intentions were to visit both sites, but my love for Ancient Roman and Greek history and art made the Getty Villa sound far more appealing; we only visited this location. For this museum, you must purchase advanced timed tickets, which we did online. We opted for the opening time, 10am on a Sunday morning. Parking at both museums is $15, but you can pay at one and go to the information desk prior to leaving to get a free parking pass for the other Getty Museum. Interesting architecture, perfectly manicured grounds with several gardens and a reflecting pool set the stage for prime photography opportunities. From the highest floor of the villa you could look out towards the sea. Inside the museum, covering two expansive floors of exhibitions was an impressive collection of Roman, Greek and Etruscan antiquities. I was pleased to find that this museum allowed photography with certain restrictions; most often photography is not permitted. My husband was not too thrilled with my decision to drag him to this attraction, but after visiting a few of the gallery rooms, he was pleasantly surprised at how much he enjoyed it. The Getty Villa was one of my favorite experiences while in LA and I would highly recommend it to anyone with a love for Greek and Roman art and history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kribbean
50,Great Start To A Great Drive,"Around half an hour's drive from LA in Malibu is a gem to enjoy and get a drive from LA to San Francisco off to a memorable start.The Getty Villa exhibits of antiquities is free although to enter and access secure, undercover parking is $15. To enter the estate a pre-booked free ticket is necessary (from the net).Set among beautiful, authentic ancient Mediterranean gardens is an inspiring complex of Roman villas. Inside are displays of many artefacts and art pieces.Good visitor amenities are provided.The standout feature of the Getty Villa is the almost tangible feeling a visitor gets of what it must have been like. This is much more than a virtual experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJW52
40,Beautiful Views and Gardens worth stop alone,"We spent the day at the Getty Center and the staff encouraged us to make the short drive on to the villa in Malibu since the $15 parking pass is good at both locations. The staff at the Getty Center even gave us the tickets needed for entry into the museum, which seems odd since it is free. Highlight for the children was definitely the mummy. Only down side is the $275 million renovations give it more of a Caesar's Palace feel than a real Italian villa. As at the Getty Center, the family room (called the Family Forum at the Villa) has great activities for the children. Our kids especially enjoyed the ancient vase puzzles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rutha2s
50,Highlight of my trip,Never thought I'd say this but it's even better than the Getty Center. Still can't get over that it's free except for parking ( $15 ). The artifacts and antiquities are amazing and you can actually walk around the statues and breathe them in. They did an excellent job of recreating the roman villa and the gardens are a breath of fresh air. The security guards are unobtrusive except to tell you the villa closes in 5 minutes....... where did the time go. I could spend the whole day here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drennan2
50,Lovely place to spend your afternoon,"Fabulous architecture, excellent maintenance, extremely organized (in order to visit the place you must make reservation on the internet at least a day in advance, so it's never jammed), Fair price ($15,00 for parking. In case you want to watch some performances, there is a fee). Must visit place in Malibu, for those who appreciate ancient art and architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BiaMenes
40,"Great, but not quite Italy","Ok, I'm spoiled. I LOVE Italy and have seen too many museums, villas, etc there. Getty Villa is great, don't get me wrong. But I thought the building/villa itself would have more charm, more appeal. They did reproduce the grounds and structure of the villa like in Italy, but the inside still looked like a museum. Now for the collections...great! Wonderful Greek, Italian and Egyptian collections to see here at home. Definitely worth going, just don't look for a REAL Italian villa with all its history and charm as I was expecting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaKarson
50,Great small art museum,"We enjoyed our afternoon at the Getty Villa. We didn't know reservations were required, but they gave us two tickets at the gate. Entrance is free, but the price to park per car is $15. The Villa is beautiful, the artwork revivals the best small museums anywhere. The art focuses on the ancient world and antiquities. I disagree with a reviewer below that stated that it isn't much compared to Europe. I have been to museums all over the world, including NYC, London, Paris, Canada, Middle East, Spain, Amsterdam, too many to list. This museum should be judged by its size, not against the Lourve. That's like comparing NYC to Kansas City, is that fair? Getty Villa is a finely finished grand house with high quality ancient art and displays. There are many beautiful areas to sit and admire the villa and take photos. Great views of the Pacific. We didn't eat at the cafe but is was a great airy looking space and many visitors bought food and coffee from it etc. I will definitely try it on a future trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SBFINCT
50,Great place,It is awesome place for both family and friends. There is no entrance fees or anything except $15 car parking fees. It also has the great view of Los Angeles. Great place and one of the MUST place to visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nandart
50,What a gem!!,"If you are from Europe or traveled extensively throughout Europe, then you might be jaded enough to think this place is ho-hum, a second rate imitation.But if you can look past the snobbery, this place really is a gem, with sufficient number of genuine artifacts set in beautifully replicated Roman villa. The gardens and the fountains are lovely and tranquil. It would a bookish romantic way to spend an afternoon.The cafe serves delicious lunch at a reasonable cost. Admission is FREE but you must print the free ticket in advance online for timed entry. The parking is $15. I'd love to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zanypoet
50,Wonderful experience of the past,The entire villa was top notch replicated. The fact that the villa took nine years to rebuild and equipped with earthquake proof protection devices shows the depth of seriousness to protect every pieces of history to share with everyone all over the world.It was a thrilling feeling to come upon the real mummies and the harp player which is the highlight in my opinion. The guided tours was very helpful and informative. It aids many to understand the the vision of Mr Getty passion for the art from the past.Please visit whenever possible as the feeling will be new each time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Contented77
40,LA treasure,Truly a local treasure. Beautiful grounds giving visitors a feel for an ancient roman villa. Extensive collection of ancient roman artifacts. Free but requires advance reservations online. Parking is $15.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaniseE
40,Beautiful location and collections,"The Getty Villa would be a draw even if it were empty. The Villa with its reflecting pools, koi ponds and expansive gardens are other worldly. Though it is near the Malibu coast, views can be limited especially when there is a heavy marine layer as often happens. The collections are so extensive--you could spend several hours there if the antiquities are your interest since they are the sole focus of the Villa. There is an informative film on J. Paul Getty and the origins of this Villa as well as the newer Getty Center in LA. In recent years, the Villa was closed for an extended period while significant infrastructure was added. As a result, the site now includes ample parking as well as a cafe and other amenities. The Villa still needs to limit access, though, so advance tickets are required. Tickets to see the Villa and its collections are free, but the cost for parking is $15. Same terms at the Getty Center, though if you do both in one day, you only pay the $15 once. Just check in with the info desk at the first site you visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrishG87
50,A beautiful view,This museum overlooks the Pacific Ocean in Malibu CA. Everything about this museumIs special. The admission is free after an initial $15 for parking. There are excellent docent guided tours of the artwork and the beautiful grounds.

40,Nice short excursion if you're in the area,"We were very impressed with the Getty Museum in LA and, as we were making a road trip to Santa Barbara and would be passing Malibu, we thought we'd check the Getty Villa out.It is a very beautiful and impressive recreation of a neapolitan villa. Having seen the ruins in Pompeii, it was very interesting to see this recreation. I was happy to see it being done so respectfully and not a cartoonish caricature. The gardens and water features are beautiful. Too bad the balconies were closed due to an evening performance :-(The exhibits were in great condition and very interesting as well. Worth the $15 parking fee and the timed (free) entrance :-p",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b_lizard76
50,Beautiful place,"Spent half a day here during a family trip to the LA area. Our visit to the Getty provided a much needed respite from our whirlwind tour of the area. Even the teenagers seemed to enjoy our visit. The structure iself is impressive, but the grounds are truly magnificent. We hope to visit the Getty Museum during our next trip to the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billp768
50,So beautiful!,We took both the garden and architecture tours which were very helpful in getting the most out of our visit. The line at the cafe was long but the food was worth the wait.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SonomaCo_Girl
50,Beautiful Surroundings,"What a great way to spend an afternoon. The buildings and gardens are beautiful, with an amazing view of the pacific. We took the docent lead architecture tour, and would highly recommend it, very interesting. Just be aware that, even though admission is free, you must book you visit in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveNScottsdale
50,Beautiful villa museum,"We were so happy to have visited the Getty Villa. The museum transports you back in time to ancient Italy. The grounds are perfectly manicured and the pool is crystal clear. What a gorgeous place to visit when in Malibu. It's located right off the Pacific Coast Highway, 15 min. from Santa Monica. We had an enjoyable experience and highly recommend it. Would love to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/molfetta91
50,A great museum to experience,"Didnt go to the Getty in LA proper, but instead this charming villa, which was a great experience, with outdoor gardens, fountains, and of course some great exhibits inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33kurtr
50,Beautiful garden and interesting historical displays,Our 1st time here.The place is easily reachable and hosts interesting historical artifacts.The gardens are beautiful and very well kept.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wisniak
50,A glimpse into the past,"Based on the plan of an actual Roman villa, the building and its surrounds are as much an attraction as the Greek and Roman antiquities themselves. With its gardens, statues and pools, the villa gives a striking impression of the life enjoyed by Roman aristocrats. It's location near the sea at Malibu seems very appropriate.The villa's regular collection is great in its own right. However, it is also supplemented by special exhibitions such as the recent ""Sicily: Art and Invention between Greece and Rome"". I was very impressed by this exhibition and by the display on ""Glass Making in Antiquity"". Time seemed to fly while I was at the villa, so I would allow more rather than less time to explore, especially if you want to take one of the guided tours on offer such as through the gardens.As a tourist without a car, I took a bus from Santa Monica as far I could but then faced quite a long walk to the villa. This was ok but it was a bit dicey due to a lack of a footpath in some parts or road works along the beach road. Parking is provided but can be difficult to obtain on some days if it is busy as it was on the day that I visited - a Sunday. So it may pay to arrive earlier rather than later on a weekend or on holidays.Note that you have to book in advance to visit the villa unlike the main Getty Centre in LA. I didn't really have a chance to taste the food on offer as by late afternoon the main café was shut and I had to make do with a coffee from a stand, although the outdoor seating was very pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melbourne3058
40,Lovely museum,Make sure to reserve your parking in advance. The grounds are lovely and the food delicious. The museum is across Malibu beach. It's a must visit if you live in LA. Last time I visited I felt as if I had been transported to Europe. Even our waiter had an European accent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TTITL
50,Contemporary and ancient beauty with great food!,"The villa is laid out as just that - a Roman villa with herb and flower gardens, fountains, columns, pools and sculpture. The grounds are beautiful and the Getty museum is indeed a treat if you want to see some of the best Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities anywhere. My wife and I have visited museums in Rome and the Getty collection rivals or surpasses what we saw there.We also had lunch at the villa and were pleasantly surprised to find gourmet vegan food on the menu (along with many other dishes), all freshly prepared by chefs at a reasonable price. The outdoor seating overlooking the villa was an added bonus.The entry fee is free, as long as you make reservations in advance, so the only cost necessary for a visit is the $15.00 parking fee. However, the parking is ample and conveniently located.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/577MichaelK
50,European history on the California coastline,"Our family (Mum, Dad & 2 teenage sons - 17 & 13) made the trip to the Getty Villa in Malibu in June 2013. It was the first full day of 5 weeks in the USA and Canada and was our first stop on a driving trip up the California coastline from LA to San Francisco.Over the years, we'd heard about the Getty Villa, but it is not until you make the visit that you appreciate the history that has been preserved and the effort the curators of the Getty Villa have taken in trying to make it look and feel as European as possible. Antiquities from various periods in Roman and Greek ancient history are presented in an easy to understand, almost ""anti-museum"" environment. Our eldest son, who is studying Ancient History for his Australian Higher School Certificate found lots of useful information that he could take away and use once we returned home.The replica Villa dei Papiri is a beautiful building in itself, and helps to capture the essence of what you are there to see. My tip would be to book for the earliest entry (we had the 10am opening), and then arrive early enough (say before 9.30am) to park your car. By the time you have spent a few hours looking through the Villa, you will be one of the first patrons for lunch. Then, a quick trip through the Gift Shop before you head on your way up the Pacific Coast Highway and the Getty Villa is a great, half day adventure.Finally, they don't charge an entry fee at all. They only charge for parking (which is undercover), for around $10. Personally, I'd be more than happy to pay an entry fee. For a family of 4, a fee of between $60 and $90 USD would be easily justified.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJR68
50,Great attraction,"This is a beautiful replica of an actual ancient Roman villa. The rooms were filled with pottery, sculptures, and other Roman artifacts. Is important to make an advance reservation for parking. Parking is $15.00. Villa is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarriedMay18
50,Transported to Italy,A spectacular museum with wonderful programs and audio tapes to gain a deeper understanding of the art work. The museum is a exact replica of an Pompeii Italian Villa.

40,finest ancient gold collection @ getty Villa,"Do not miss the superb collection of hand-crafted ancient gold jewellery @ hall 212. It is the most intricately design specimens I've seen. I'm comparing it to the gold in top museums in Rome, Florence and Paris.The Grecian ceramics are very fine too.The grounds are a delight. Many were gushing over the herb garden. But getting to the Villa is a hassle - having to apply for limited passes, parking is limited. We parked 2 miles away androde our bikes to the gates.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells
50,Can't beat free,"I am so glad that the Getty Villa was remodeled and reopened. There is plenty to see in this compact museum.The museum highlights Mr. Getty's interest in Greek and Roman antiquities, but the gardens and grounds are every bit as fascinating.What I really appreciate about the Getty Villa is that it is compact enough that you don't need a full day to experience it. Two to three hours is sufficient.The Villa is a great place to take out of town visitors.Don't forget to make reservations. The museum is free but you do pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveb413
20,Be sure to have reservation.,We couldn't go here on our trip because it was full and we had not made a reservation. We just happened upon it and it looked interesting. Just be sure to have a reservation on the weekend. We don't plan ahead that much. Maybe next time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChurchMouse2010
30,Disappointed,"When you have seen the Getty center, you are awaiting a beautiful italian villa with marble everwhere and very luxuous. But no. You find only concrete falsely painted, The statues seem fake, the garden is very small. The view is not even the best. Of course if you are interested in etruscan ir greek artefacts you will see plent of these. But that was not our interest. We were expecting a beautiful roman villa and we did not find one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nine52
30,not recommended if you are European IMHO,"Didn't do the homework on this one, we should have went to the Getty center in LA, Its a lovely place but if Italy and Greece is on your doorstep you don't need to visit here, $15 parking and you need to make a reservation on internet so arrivals are staggered, it was a lovely day so some nice pictures round the pools and gardens, how many statues and busts can you look at?, living a stones throw from Hadrians wall there was nothing of interest here for me, my fault for not checking up properly, nice drive out to Malibu",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bryan50
50,On a sunny day in California ...,"On a sunny day in California,this is a truly wonderful place to be. Because you need to book tickets (free via the website), it is never too crowded and you can really enjoy both the antiquities and the wonderful gardens, at your leisure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarlzL
50,A wonderous cultural experience in beautiful surroundings - for free!,"If you are looking for an inexpensive attraction and access to a computer/printer, you need to put the Getty Villa on your scheduled! Lush garden landscapes surround the Villa and grounds, which house priceless exhibits dating to antiquity. The views of the Pacific off of the upper terraces are gorgeous, and the location is ideal for novice photograpers.While the Getty Villa is free, you do have to RSVP by timed online-only reservations & print tickets; however, this is well worth your time. Parking is paid - about $15 per car. There is also a cafe onsite, as well as a gift shop. If you are a tourist, or a local playing tourist, this is a wonderful activity!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mystica33
50,A great day out,"The Getty Villa is a great way to spend a day - fantastic buildings, all modeled on ancient Roman villas, and filled with ancient artifacts some as old as 4000 years but most of them from the time of the Roman empire. Even if you have no interest in ancient history, this is a fascinating place to visit, with a great ethos - and the best bit has to be that it's free. Free to get in that is, you pay $15 to park the car, but that's peanuts compared to what is on offer. The restaurant is pretty good, and even if you just go and hang out there or in the gardens you'll probably enjoy yourself. Getting into it is easy if you're going from the Santa Monica direction, though make sure you don't miss the turn as you won't get a second chance without making a considerable detour. Coming from the Malibu direction is more complex as you can't make a left turn off the PCH at this point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Theologyprof
50,A Nice Mix of Museum and Gardens in a Lovely Setting,"Located on a hill above Santa Monica Bay, the Getty Villa specializes in the art and architecture of the Ancient Mediterranean. You feel like you are walking back in time visiting a Roman Villa. The displays are well done (not too congested) with good explanations and if you are lucky, join one of the docent-led tours about the architecture and gardens. The hours are 10-5 daily except Tuesday. Go to the Getty website to book your time slot and FREE ticket. Parking is $15 or you can take the bus, but there is definitely ""no parking"" in the surrounding neighborhood. Late morning tends to be quite busy. Take a lunch or tea break at the Cafe. We enjoyed an excellent light lunch for 3 people without alcohol for around $40. I would not recommend the Getty Villa for young children - too many obstacles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kanda84
50,Stunning,"What an amazing place to visit. This attraction is free. You just need to go on their website and reserve free tickets ahead of time.You just need to pay for parking inside the villa.Absolutely stunning villa with an amazing array of art.We spent there 2 hours and you could easily spend more time there.There is a coffee shop on premise which we didn't try.Funny thing is that we were in the area earlier than our ticket time, so we drove around Malibu looking for a coffee shop or a breakfast restaurant and couldn't find any.Very strange, where do all the stars that live in Malibu go out for breakfast?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vie_voyage
50,Beautiful place,"This is the perfect place to visit when looking for beautiful views and art. The gardens are breathtaking and peaceful. The exhibits are changed often and since visitors have to reserve a time to go, it is never too crowded which is perfect to admire all the beautiful art. My 7 year old daughter enjoys the activities at the children's room. It's a perfect place to visit with the family. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adriana2travel

50,Beautiful Greek and Roman Art in a Villa Garden Setting,I love this Museum and have been coming here for years. It is such a relaxing place. I love the gardens where you can see the Pacific Ocean. On exhibit are Greek and Roman Artifacts. Entrance is free but requires a reservation and parking is 15.00 per car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jan_Medina
50,A step back into antiquity,"It has a fantastic collection of amphoras, statues and other ancient artifacts that are well displayed. Outside, the gorgeous reflection pool is a great place to sit near and relax and the gardens are absolutely beautiful. Besides the regular collection, there are special timed exhibits. For children, there is a hands-on amphora decorating room which is a lot of fun. The indoor/outdoor cafe has a great selection of delicious, moderately priced food and beverages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/topgrandma
40,Fun place,"Medium sized, very well kept up. Mostly statues and other 3D art. Has an interesting garden. It is very unique in that in is mostly really an out side space but with rooms you enter from the outside arcade. Definitely worth a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_MTJ_99
50,Amazing collection of antiquities,It was very easy to access once you have booked the parking. We choose to explore by ourselves and found the map easy to follow. As with many museums there is a great deal to see and it would be great to be able to visit again and again and take some of the tours and concentrate on specific areas. Loved the gardens as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rajNapier
40,Nice day by the beach.,"Nice place to go and spend quality time. My husband and I got our tickets for 10 am and we are glad we did go in the morning. The place was relatively quiet on a Thursday morning and we got to take our time looking at the exhibits and artifacts. It did get very busy just as we were leaving in the early afternoon. Lots of places to sit and you can take pictures if you turn off your flash. Please note you get free tickets by going to their website before you go, you can not get tickets at the location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/882ArleneR
50,"Always, always our first stop","My kids (7, 8 and 9) love the Getty Villa. The iPod audio guides with pictures and videos are part of it, but they really get caught up in the Greek mythology behind many of the pieces. It's like a discovery walk to look at things, big and small, that are so old and all have a story. There is a lot more dimension to the art here than at a normal, art-hanging-on-the-wall museum. There is an audio book, D'aulaires Book of Greek Myths, that is read with great drama by Paul Newman and others that offers a great backdrop to all of the pieces that you see here. Just a thought for the car...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kate320
50,even better than the Getty Museum,"The Getty Villa is rather like a stage set--not completely authentic but beautiful. There are courtyards, gardens, fountains and a museum all in the classical style. There is a lovely herb garden and many paths on different levels to walk through. The museum houses a very nice collection of Greek vases, classical glassware and some sculpture. There is a very good cafeteria, reasonably priced. Be aware that you must have a reservation to get in through the guarded entrance--but you can call this in on the same day of your visit. There is a parking garage included in price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorothyB97
50,We spent 5+ hours at the Getty Villa!,"Having visited the Getty Museum years ago, this was our first visit to the Getty Villa. We stayed in nearby Santa Monica (15 minutes away by car) and planned our visit in advance, purchasing a timed ticket. It's well worth the visit!PROS:~You buy a 'Timed Ticket', so the villa never feels overcrowded.~Take the architecture and garden tours to give yourself a better appreciation for everything.~Tours offer an ear-piece so you can hear the tour guide well, without them having to shout.~Beautiful grounds, pools and gardens.~Enjoy lunch at the villa cafe which offers quality fresh food.~AAA 10% discount available at the cafe and store.~Fabulous place for taking photos if that's something you enjoy.~The villa underwent a 9-year renovation in recent years and is in almost perfect condition.~Lots of artifacts, statues and artwork to look at inside the villa.~Super interactive children's area where they can be creative and hands-on while learning about the artifacts.~If like us, you like to take advantage of the tours offered and like to read about a lot of the artifacts, eat lunch and take photos, it's easy to spend a good 5 hours there.CONS:~ Parking at the multistory structure costs $15 (Although entry to the museum is 'free').~You are only permitted to park at the museum, not anywhere nearby.~Lots to read -- you kind of get overwhelmed after a while!~We looked into the afternoon tea that they offer Thurs and Sat, but thought it was a bit steep at $36 per person, plus 18% gratuity and tax. We opted for a nice lunch and a glass of wine at the cafe instead. (Show your AAA card to save 10%!)~I wouldn't recommend this attraction for children under age 10.Note: Bring sun protection for exploring the gardens and for the tours, especially during the summer months.Be prepared for a short walk from the parking structure to the villa and to be on your feet most of the day. Wear comfortable shoes!If you thought this review was helpful, please click 'yes'.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwfr
50,Amazing art and architecture,"I could have spent my entire day just wandering through this gorgeous villa, taking in the sites and views. The Etruscan and Greco-Roman artwork was magnificent and well-displayed and the villa was fascinating! It wasn't crowded, although there were a lot of people there, parking was easy, there are lots of stairs (and elevators, too), and lots of bathrooms and a cafe. I didn't go to the cafe because the line was too long and the menu was limited. I'd recommend packing a few snacks or a small meal if you are there around the afternoon.A must-see if you're in (or not in) the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DimitraT
50,Fantastically beautiful!!!,"The grounds are amazing, it is Malibu, right? The museum itself is designed to replicate an ancient villa in Italy, that was buried after the eruption of Vesuvius. That in itself was interesting, add in the antiquities, perfect Southern California afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pamela0262
50,Wonderful Place to Spend a Morning,"The Getty Villa is one of the most attractive museums we have ever visited. The've basically done everything right: the setting is unique with a view to the ocean, the structure is beautiful; they have outstanding gardens; the art is exquisite; and everything complements and highlights the artwork.The Getty Villa focuses essentially on Greek and Roman art up to roughly 500 A.D. The art is quite beautiful and striking and extremely well displayed. They also have frequent and helpful tours, whether your interest is in the art itself, or the building itself. They also have some interesting historical displays to help you put it all into context. All of the pieces are well marked.Some tips:The museum admission is free, but there is a $15 parking charge. That's a bargain. Note that they have timed entry so you really need to book ahead AND bring the confirmation with you - unless they have extra tickets you may not be able to get in. They tell me that days earlier in the week are less crowded, although it wasn't especially crowded either day we have visited.Until late August they are having an exhibit on Sicilian art. See it if you can. The statue of a charioteer is one of the most striking I have ever seen, but there are many other great pieces. Unfortunately (for us), Sicily is asking for the artwork back early. It was scheduled to go to the Cleveland Museum of Art, but even that is presently in limbo and this may be the last chance to see it in the United States.Not that bad days are that common in Los Angeles, but you definitely want to go on a nice day. About half of the museum is outdoors or exposed to the outdoors, and it is simply stunning if the weather cooperates. They have a nice cafe with lots of outdoor tables and it's pleasant just to be there.It may seem silly, but look at the floors. The marble work is ornate and at times astonishing (see, for example, the round room with the statue of Hercules, but there are many others).The Getty Villa is not a huge museum, but it's well worth a visit on many levels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineAndGreg
50,Gourgeous place,"Is a gorgeous museum of art with a collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities. The museum is modeled as an ancient Roman home with beautiful gardens. The entrance is free, you pay only for the parking. The café is very good for capuccinos, snacks, but avoid lunch, not good at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Olavocma
50,Take a step back to antiquity,"Museums do not get any better than this anywhere in the world. This is truly a treasure--a gorgeous reproduction of a villa based on several old world villas. I have been here countless times since they reopened several years ago and am never disappointed with the latest show and with revisiting old favorites. The gardens are lush and elegant. If you are a photographer or an artist, bring your equipment; you won't be disappointed. Tickets are complimentary, but you have to order them online and enter the Villa at the appointed time. The only charge, which is required, is the $15 parking fee. You cannot walk in nor can you park on the streets due to ordinances regarding the residential neighborhoods adjacent the Villa. Exceptional tours, overview films of the Villa, ongoing art classes and concerts, the Getty Villa is a joy for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAPlatinum
50,"J. P. Getty's home, Getty Villa Museum Greek and Roman Collection","Greek, Roman and Etruscan collection, more than 1200 pieces, endless gardens and reflecting pools, mummy of 20 year old Herakleides, film on how it was made; ancient glass, bronze, solid gold headwear and so much great beauty. Rest on the 2nd floor balcony overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Be transported back in time in an open, airy setting. Getty's home, not open to public, is behind the museum. Reservations needed for parking. Beware Pacific Coast highway traffic as you try to turn up the museum road. It's only 2 lanes. Afterward, head down the road to the best little seafood beach house restaurant in Malibu - Malibu Seafood!! Super prices! BEST fish and chips this side of the pond! Other seafood restaurants go to Malibu Seafood to get fish for their own restaurants. Definitely worth the wait to get in and carry your own lunch to an umbrella-ed picnic table and watch the surfers across the road. No alcohol served. Convertible Bentleys drive around looking for parking spaces along with everyone else. It's worth standing in line with locals and tourists waiting to get in. From busts of Calpurnia and Caesar to Calamari and Caesar Salad, you'll have a memorable day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdlasser
50,You Want To Immediately Buy A Ticket to Sicily,"The Getty Villa currently has an magnificent exhibit of art from ancient Sicily. Run don't walk, it is one of the most intelligent exhibits I have seen in a long time. This economical and brilliant exhibit in a relatively few works ( about 6 rooms) opens this visitors eyes and mind to both exciting questions and artistic connections. Run don't walk, and then savor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newyorkscreen
50,A little bit of Ancient Rome,"What can I say? If you like cultural destinations, beautiful gardens, rare antiquities, then you will enjoy the Getty Villa. Even if you have been before, it is just a beautiful place to wander and enjoy the beauty. The nice thing is, you must have a reservation so they are never over booked. You will always have a place to park ($15). The cafe is nice. Both indoor and outdoor seating. Food is a little higher priced for what you get than I would ordinarily pay but the setting is priceless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FruPasadena
40,The building and gardens are more interesting than the art,"The view is incredible, yes. Overlooking the Pacific, one cannot feel a surge of romanticism and inspiration from nature. Yet, something is lacking...perhaps some interesting art? There's a beautiful garden and a pool but where is all the art? The black reproductions around some bushes are a bit lame. I've seen more ""bust's of women"" and broken off wangs to last a lifetime. I appreciate this place for what it is, but the louvre in Paris is the place to go of you want to see and experience true history...this place is very LA - shiny on the outside but oh, so full of empty promises on the inside. If you have your expectations straight, you won't be disappointed. But if you want to feel enlightened and cultured afterwards, a few broken pots, statues, and landscaping won't make you marvel at human nature and the human potential.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MitsoukoRussie
50,Hidden Gem in Malibu on the Pacific Ocean,"We have visited the Getty Villa twice in the past 3 years while vacationing in California.The museum houses artifacts study of the arts and cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria.For anyone visiting this area that would like to view very old wonderful artifacts from ancient Greece, Rome and Etruria this is a must see. There is a very nice ""affordable"" restaurant to sit and have a bite to eat. The Getty is not huge or overwhelming but worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlglazer
50,Great Place,"Excellent visit. The docents are incredible storytellers. First we took the Architectural Tour. The docent described the architecture, presented in the context of the history of the construction of the museum and the villa it is based on. So it was really more a presentation about the lifestyle of the ancient Romans. Then we took a specialized tour which described selected pieces. I particularly liked the headphones. It was a not a pre-recorded lecture - they just served to amplify the docent, so everyone could hear, even if you stepped away to look at something else or take a picture. Reservation times are not absolute. We got there late and there was not problem getting in. This just prevents crowds from ruining your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samantha_Marie
50,Outstanding,"This was much more than we thought it was going to be, it truly is vry interesting and the tour guide we had was wonderful ,she told us things I had never heard of Getty. It really was amazing how he did all the things he did for the educational aspect for the rest of mankind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaun0063
50,Architecturally Exquisite,"The collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan art is outstanding, of course, and it greatly expanded my knowledge and appreciation of the creative works of those cultures. However, I was even more excited by the Villa itself. The workmanship that went into the creation of the buildings is unlike anything I have ever seen. The patterns created in the marble floors, and the detail in the columns are a wonder to behold. The Gardens, too, contain many beautiful and unusual plants and flowers creating a most tranquil environment. It is a perfect place to spend many hours. While it is fine for any age, I truly believe adults will appreciate it more than children. My visit was with my grown daughter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Connecticutosprey
50,Absolutely brilliant,"This has to be a must go place for the organised tourist (you must make reservations before hand - no walk-ins are allowed). We enjoyed every moment of our five hours here - we took part in three lectures / walks saw numerous exhibits and to save money, we brought our own lunch (the food is a little expensive). They do their best to be child friendly with activities for younger people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulHarvey
50,Amazing Garden,"The garden looks fantastic. It's a short drive from LA so if you are around here, you should go there. We saw Lion Attacking a Horse from the Capitoline Museums, Rome which is pretty interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/opalka90
50,"Gorgeous Art, Breath Taking Grounds, Family Friendly, Free","The Getty Villa (NOT to be confused with the Getty Center) is one of my all time favorite places to visit in the US. Its open air courtyards with reflection pools are breath taking, the gardens are gorgeous, the art beautiful. My hat off to the Getty family for such a gift to the public. The Getty Villa is kid and family-friendly; AND is also friendly to art and culture aficionados who prefer to browse in an appreciative manner with hushed tones. There is no entrance fee, but reservations are needed. There is a $15 charge to park. The guards and entrance staff are exceptionally friendly and informative. It is a wonderful stop whether visiting LA or taking a driving tour of the Pacific Coast Highway. A few hours is all you really need to enjoy the Villa.The Getty Villa also has a wonderful cafe, perfect for a relaxing lunch in the balmy Malibu breeze, with a very nice wine selection.Of note, the Getty Center is magnificent beyond words, but is really not appropriate for young children and can be overwhelming with the number of security guards at every turn around what seems to be an infinite number of amazing pieces of art. It is also well worth a stop for a day of art and culture.I find the Getty Villa to be a celebration of art, philanthropy and beauty in a very relaxing atmosphere, perfect for anyone young or not-so-young.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillS567
40,Only if you love ancient rome,"Grounds are beautiful as described by everyone. I think you would definitely enjoy this place more if you're big on ancient roman history as that is pretty much all that is displayed. The architecture tour was ok, but most of the time was spent discussing how Mr. Getty tried to copy an ancient roman villa as closely as possible. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area, but not sure I'd drive too far to come here again unless I suddenly developed a new found interest in 1st AD Rome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s3jwang
50,"Gorgeous Gardens, Architecture and Art","If you have never been to the Getty Villa, you should plan a morning or afternoon there. Enjoyed it more than any other attraction in the LA area. Any!The museum is housed in a replica of the excavated remains of the Villa dei Papiri in Herculaneum, Italy--which was once covered in many meters of ash and rock by the Mt. Vesuvius eruption of 79 A.D. in Italy that also covered Pompeii. J. Paul Getty was fascinated with collecting antiquities and the villa was originally designed to house his private collection. The main Getty Center is about 14 miles away, this museum is located on the slope directly below the Getty residence. Well-done guided tours of the gardens and architecture are available and the self-guided tours come complete with free use of an ipod with a library of descriptions of most of the highlights in the museum. Cannot say enough about the beauty of this place. A wonderful gift from Mr. Getty to the rest of the world. Gorgeous location in Malibu, California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeautifulWorld08
50,Visitor's Beware,"That's a fair warning. You might get enchanted and never want to leave this place. Every where you look, everything you see, every story you hear would magically transformed you to the lands of Gods and Goddesses. Taking the Garden Tour and Architecture Tour is a must and if you planned ahead you can get Collection Highlights Tour. I love the fact that The Villa has staffs everywhere to make sure every visitor respect the place and behave appropriately. It's a big production and the Villa does it well. Ten thumbs up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zaitun101
50,Excellent semi self service,Good value with fair prices. You choose your entree inside and it is delivered to your table. Pleasant atmosphere and efficient service.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelgarcia
50,Wonderful grounds & exhibits,"Have been to the Getty Museum so decided to come here thinking it would be even better due to the setting, types of exhibits, architectural style, etc. & it was! My only minor gripe would be that some of the pottery seemed repetetive in style/patterns but I would kind of expect it from the time period the museum's collection is from. Highly recommend the audio tour to help understand the pieces/historical info better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerfmeister
50,Amazing collection of ancient artifacts and stunning grounds,"A beautifully recreated Roman Villa compound which houses several rooms showcasing artifacts from Etruscan, Roman and Greek period. The courtyard area is stunning reflection pool that looks like it was taken out of a true Roman Villa. Just touring the grounds is worth the trip but make time to learn about the history and artifacts... amazing collection. The cheese tray with fresh figs and wine was a pleasant surprise for lunch. And the views are awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paiger10
50,Perfect harmony of old and new,"We had visited this reconstructed Roman villa before the renovation. The modern courtyard is so well done. It creates the illusion of being in an archeological dig with its striated layers and sense of enclosure. We enjoyed a 45-minute architecture tour that took us through the first floor of the villa and gardens, allowing a glimpse into the Roman way of planning buildings. What beautiful stonework and trompe d'oeil paintings! Fantastic mosaics. Well-tended gardens with vistas to the blue Pacific. To enjoy the architecture and the space is enough reward, but the Getty offers more.Art exhibits, some kid-friendly, are on both levels. We learned much about Sicily's Greek-Roman connections in the current exhibit. I also enjoyed the ancient glasswork collection. If we had more time, we would have spent the entire day there.Reservations are needed to park, but they are easy to get online. Plan on a $15 parking fee and money for lunch, if you stay that long. We had a heavenly late breakfast on their veranda, sipping excellent coffee and munching baked-on-the-premises chocolate biscotti while taking in that view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WideEyedTraveler
50,Getty Villa,The Getty Villa is well worth your time and plan to spend several hours. We took the garden tour which was informative and helped to explain why certain plants were planted and used. The Villa was built to give ordinary people the feel of how ancient Greek and Romen wealthy had lived. We got our tickets on line which were free and parking was $15.00 which I didn't think was much at all. We took a picnic lunch and ate on the balcony of the restaurant. A fun day was had by all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mhood_VA
50,LOVED it!,"Until this last trip I had never heard of The Getty Villa, only the The Getty Center. We decided to go because I had heard that it was pretty; I had no idea that it was a museum of Roman and Greek mythology, etc. My family and I absolutely loved it and could have stayed there all day. It was very relaxing and we learned a lot too. My 7 year old son was reading almost everything in each room and was asking us mythology questions the rest of the weekend ;) The gardens were beautiful. We didn't actually take the guided tour but we did overhear a bit when we were in one of the gardens and it sounded like it was very informative. This attraction is a must-see when in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrslibrarian23
50,"Whether antiquities are your thing or not, it is worth the visit","The only admission fee is the $15 for parking, which is a bargain for your Los Angeles entertainment and tourism dollar. You do need to make a reservation for the time you wish to arrive.The opulence of the Villa makes for a spectacular visual experience, and you can appreciate what the Getty Foundation has contributed to the public with its one-of-kind museum experience modeled after an ancient Herculaneum Roman villa now buried under the lava flow from the 1st Century eruption of Mt. Vesuvius.We visited the Villa on a Wednesday and avoided much of the crowds one might expect on a summer weekend. However, we did not avoid stop-and-go traffic on I-10, and I would recommend surface streets in lieu of driving through Los Angeles if you have a reliable GPS navigation tool.The museum features exhibits on loan from international museums. The Sicilian antiquities, which complemented our viewing of the Getty collection, are featured through August, 2013.The Villa has a café, bookstore, and gardens that are worthy of your time. Bring your camera, but remember - no flash photography, and some displays prohibit photos. However, you will want people pictures around the fountains, pools, and view balconies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globalexplorer1
50,Getty Villa - great collections and great views,Beautiful villa and the collection housed there is fantastic and ever changing. Great views and very close to Gladstone's restaurant. A must for tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azminak
50,What a wonderful afternoon!,"I have wanted to come to the Getty Villa for a long time when visiting the area, but never had the opportunity until last week. We had no difficulty making a reservation the same day & the process was very smooth. The collection was fascinating; we spent 4 hours & only left at closing time; we could have stayed even longer. I loved the fact that so many exhibits were not contained in glass displays but were available for close inspection. Obviously, you cannot touch anything but it seems everyone respects that rule. The proximity of the objects completely enhances the experience. We were the only ones signed up for the herb garden tour at the time. Our guide Lucy was just delightful! I recommend the whole experience & imagine many return visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Templetons911
50,"Unique, historic, one of a kind masterpiece...","Admission, by reservation on line, is free, but parking is $15. It is a bit tough to get to driving east on 1, but worth the trouble. There are elevators -- several -- that will get you to the main museum. Because of the hillside they had no choice...perhaps an escalator would help here as the parking lot is down the hill from the facility. In any case, there is an 11-minute film on the history of the Getty Villa that you must see to get a true picture of what this place means today and to Getty when he built it. The detail is almost over the top, but Getty wanted it that way. Don't just look at the art and sculpture -- some dates back 6,000 BC -- look above, below and at the walls for an awesome experience. The Villa is an authentic reproduction in every way. There is nothing like this anywhere else in the US, including the Hearst Mansion. The cafe has great, healthy food that is a bit pricy, but expected. Grab a table on the patio overlooking the drive up from Malibu and the ocean for an added thrill. Also, don't miss the gardens of mostly herbs and the multi-photo op fountains and pools that are incorporated into this landscape. We have been here four times and will come back when we get to LA again. Can't get enough!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LarryR86
40,Beach front Museum,"Free admission, you pay to park, but can also park the same day for free at the Getty Center. Museum is beautiful, all Greek and Roman sculpture. Don't let 'villa' fool you, this is an art museum, not the place to come and see how the Getty's lived. Cafe has nice food and decent prices for where its located. Its cloudy and cool today, I think a clear sunny day would make a difference. Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/290DavidK
50,"Must visit more often, must visit more often",Let this be your mantra. Its a bit of a drive to this location but so worth it. I visited one hot summer night to see some wonderful Greek theatre. The words and actions of the actors felt right at home in this home of artifacts and edifices of the ancients.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/infaymous
40,Great Art and beautiful views.,The villa is a great place to visit. Its free :) and has wonderful art from ancient Greece and Rome. From the Villa you see the wonderful views of the Pacific Ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tolle186
40,"Lovely, but not for young children","This is always a wonderful place to visit. The Villa is in Malibu; another review mentioned LA. The Getty in LA is not the Villa. There is an emphasis on sculpture, but also many other wonderful works of art. The gardens are true works of art. There are many places to relax and reflect. And yes, the view is spectacular. My teenage daughter and her friends enjoy it, but as my title states, this is not a fun activity for most young children - it just isn't geared for children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CamReviewer123
50,Truly lovely!,Too much to see in one day. The view of the ocean is lovely. It is fun to imagine living in such a mansion high above the Pacific. Took the plant tour and really enjoyed it. The restaurant serves delicious food. Next time I'll visit the Getty Center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanB427
50,Breath taking views and art,I have been to the Getty Villa on several occasions and it never gets old. The museum based on a Roman villa at Herculaneum is stunning. The Greek and Roman art is well laid out. The visiting exhibits are usually very good and often based on works that have been restored there. I just saw the Sicily exhibit which was well worth the hour drive. Lunch was good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KAS57
50,It's what you can do if you have more money than god,"J. Paul Getty was once the richest person in the world and he used some of that wealth to assemble a remarkable collection of antiquity at the Getty Villa.The Getty Villa is nothing short of breath taking. It defies imagination that such a collection of antiquity could be assembled and presented in such an accessible manner. The gardens and architecture of the Villa are worth a visit on their own merits. By the way, while admission is free there is a $15 parking fee and a time stamped ticket must be obtained on line prior to your visit. You will need to arrive at or near the time you select.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davecm329
40,"Beautiful Grounds, Unimpressive Museum","For a free museum, this attraction is definitely worth more than the price of admission. I was definitely impressed with the grounds of the villa, the embellished architecture/decor, complete with herb garden, pool, etc. Less impressive are the actual artifacts within the tiny museum. The artifacts are dedicated to ancient Greek heroes/gods, which is interesting, but most are pots, sculptures, etc. However, as a casual outing, this place is hard to beat, especially if you can enjoy the impeccable Malibu weather. Remember to reserve tickets ahead of time. Also, take advantage of the pay once, park twice program where you pay $15 to park at the Villa and enjoy free parking at the Getty Museum if visiting both venues on the same day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2Legit2Trip
50,A World of Grace and Beauty in Los Angeles,We make yearly treks to LA just to see the exhibitions at the Getty Villa. This year it's Sicily - a couple of years ago it was The Art of Ancient Greek Theater. Thoughtful exhibits and wonderful books to take home. I have yet to see an outdoor theater performance (but I will) - but have seen some delightful and new pieces at the indoor space. The location and gardens are divine.Unsurpassed views inward and outward. Good food. Good tours. Can't miss.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJtheScrivener
50,There's more than just shopping,"I have been planning to visit the Villa for years. I have now done it. It's fantastic. As good as San Simeon. It's really easy to get to. The parking is easy. There's only a short walk to the villa from there (50 yards). Just make sure you go on line and secure a ticket otherwise you won't get in. You need to have the paper ticket with you - otherwise you won't get in. There's no trouble getting a ticket. I applied on a Friday for a Saturday visit. I arranged for my hotel to print out my ticket. 2 - 2.5 hours is about the time you need to see all and take plenty of photos. The exhibits are wonderful. The villa is tranquil and stunning; the gardens and pool, remarkable. There are two tours - the architectural tour and the garden tour. Both are worthwhile and run for about 40 minutes. I also recommend going to the little theatre to watch the history of how the villa was built.Surprisingly I didn't feel that there were many visitors when I was there (2:30 pm admission)Get yourself there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AL9999q
50,European Time Machine,"Well, I'm not sure this review will be too helpful because I see I'm not the only one that thinks this place was amazing. You already knew that. I don't know why we have never been here before. We travel to LA frequently to visit my sister. This was spectacular. It is a replica of The Villa Dei Papyri (the house of papyrus) in ancient Herculaneum. They have done an amazing job with the architecture and items within the house. There was a mummy they featured, you can view coins from ancient Carthage and all over the Mediterranean, you can even draw on vases to experience how they did it themselves. The statues are amazing - it really transports you to Italy. They have these mini tours throughout the day of the architecture and gardens. You get a neat earpiece so you can hear the guide at all times. You can walk around and admire the work while still hearing the guide speak. It is a great tool. Tickets to the Villa are free, but parking is $15. Well worth it. We were there for over 3 hours and it wasn't even close to enough time. You could easily spend 4-5 hours here. This is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brauchtj
50,Beautiful retreat for art and a trip back in time,"Unlike the Getty Center, Los Angeles, the Getty Villa has an older allure. It helps when there are costumed visitors in Regency Era garb and walk around like Elizabeth Bennet in Mr. Dary's estate. I even looked them up, they were there for tea!Anyway, it's a good, relaxing way to imagine olden times and see collections of things from long ago. Some are reproductions, some are originals (busts, tombstones, artifacts, etc.). Either way there are so many things to see you probably will have to come back. And with free admission ($15 parking), it makes it easier to come back.The views are beautiful. The amphitheater is a nice little hike up. The herb garden was a lovely little walk out. I was there for the Pompei exhibit and it was my first visit to the Villa. I don't know why I waited so long to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5feetsmall

40,Beautiful and Informative,"Beautiful ocean views, easy parking, and interesting exhibits. It is a perfect way to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454chriss
50,"Don't miss it!!! Beautiful view, and great art.","I strongly recommend the architectural visit. It goes over the layout of the building and how a Roman village of the 1st century functioned. A lot of historical facts about life in a wealthy Roman family. The collection includes Greek, Roman, Etruscan, and Cycladic art. The emphasis is in Roman art but the Cycladic ar collection, though small, is rather interesting. You need to get tickets ahead of time and sometimes they are available at the Getty museum near Santa Monica (just ask). There is no fee for the audio guide (recommended) but there is a 15 dollar fee for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuisGReyna
50,A great visit to Ancient Greece/Rome without leaving the US,"First, you must make reservations online before visiting. We found later in the day to be very empty. Each ticket includes a number of children with an adult, so you need to check for more specific info online. Parking is $15 for each car and if you already paid at the Getty Center, you won't need to pay again. The person at the parking gate took our tickets and didn't really look at the time. There is handicap parking available, but you need to ask. the Getty Villa has a cafe and tea room. We found the food to be tasty and not too pricey, but you can bring food in. They have picnic tables and tables available for the cafe food. Sandwiches and salads range about 12-16$. There is also a coffee cart with hot beverages and cookies.There are two tours offered hourly and you just walk up at the hour and get a headphone to listen to your guide. We found both guides very knowledgable and tours were about 40 minutes. The villa itself has two floors and a great room for smaller children to play with items and have some hands on time. There are elevators for those who cannot walk up the stairs. This is a villa, so the grounds are small as compared to the Getty Center. In the spring, there is much in bloom, but we are told in winter they make sure things are very green. The guide for the garden tour (the other tour is architecture) told us that we could touch all the herbs in the herb garden. The museum itself has small rooms set up chronologically with amazing antiquities. We did not see very many school age children,but the villa can be enjoyed by all ages. If your children enjoy Greek mythology, the rooms on gods and goddesses are amazing. Our son is 11 and he enjoyed the entire collection. We have been to Greece and this collection has a sampling of so many antiquities that we were sorry we did not visit it prior to our vacation to Greece. It is well done and well organized. There are iPads in some rooms for a closer look at coins or other items which can be enjoyed by children and adults. You can take photos of their collection, but not visiting collections which were found upstairs. I highly recommend a visit to the Getty Villa. It is well worth the time for driving from Orange County.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joantri
50,An attraction not to be missed.,"I don't know how we missed visiting this marvelous site on previous trips to LA, but I'm really glad our niece suggested it. We were specifically interested in the special exhibition featuring Sicilian artworks, but the museum emphasis is on J. Paul Getty's collection Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities. The venue is generally modeled after a Roman country house, the Villa dei Papiri, buried during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The pools and surrounding gardens are beautiful. We sat outdoors for lunch at the cafe, where the food has a Mediterranean emphasis, and is very good and reasonable. Admission is free, but reservations must be made for parking ($15.). The venue is handicap friendly and there was a wheelchair available for my wife's temporary need.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gilamon
50,So worth another visit.,"Greek and roman gods dominate the museum, and once you get past that there is beautiful are and skilled craftmanship from eons past in a wonderful setting replicating ancient pompey (sp). Great gardens duplicating Ceasars fathers' villa. Gift shop and cafe are places we intend to revisit, next time we will go early. Paid parking, free admission. Make a reservation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibizmentor

40,Baeutiful setting,"This is a lovely museum in a beautiful setting.Of the two I preferred the Getty centre, but that's because I prefer more modern art, but the Getty villa is definitely worth a visit, particularly if you are interested in Roman life. Make sure you take advantage of the free guided tours, they really add value and are very informative. You do need to book here, and you can't walk in for some reason, so if you go by bus make sure you tell the bus driver as he/she needs to give you a special ticket to say you came by bus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CityGirlAimee
50,Thought Provoking Lectures!,"Sir Isaac Newton began trying to explain what he called the ""phenomenon of colors"" in the late 1660s. So we began thinking of color as the crayons that we grew up with... What was color to the ancient Egyptians? We sat in on a wonderful thought provoking lecture at this beautiful complex!Thank you J. P. Getty Villa and Center for supplying us with the most talented scholars IN THE WORLD!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OmaReading2Me
50,Loved This Place,"We went to the villa on a beautifully sunny day. Got the free ipod audio tour and was amazed by all the antiquity. There were pieces that were over 5,000 years old! Beautiful jewelry, statues, urns, and glass. A must see.Had lunch on the patio and chose from the many selections. Good food and peaceful surroundings as we sat near a peaceful water art. Plan to spend most of the day here and enjoy the exhibits and gardens at a leisurely pace. Excellent attraction, and the drive in Malibu was pretty too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeleneL960

It was downright beautiful.Make sure to pre book your tickets online for timed entries.The grounds are so pretty and the building romantic and European looking.Took so many photos inside the sculptures are so interesting you can spend hours here.Plus the cafe has delicious food.Much prefer this over the Getty Center in LA.Only con is parking is 15$ but the museum is free so it balances out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Canadiatravelgoddess
50,An oasis in Los Angeles,You might think you are actually in Italy when you enter the premises of this magnificent copy of Villa dei Papiri from Herculaneum. J Paul Getty visited the Naples area many times and finally decided to built this villa next to his home in Malibu. Fantastic gardens and Roman architecture but most of all peace and quiet. Exquisite!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JarmoS622
50,Recreation of a Roman Villa with Ancient Artifacts,"This is quite a spectacular museum at the site of a J. Paul Getty residence he never occupied overlooking the Pacific in the hills of Malibu. The VIlla dei Papiri originally opened in 1974, but was redone in 2006. Admission is free. This is a must see in Malibu, even if you are not a fan of ancient Roman art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HAD232
50,In Addition to the Getty Center,"Another great California attraction. Not as spectacular as the Getty Center, but definitely worth the visit. I enjoyed the recreated Roman courtyards and fountains. Impressive period art too!It is important to plan your visit, since a ticket is required to get into the parking lot. Parking is $15, but the actual villa is free. (Parking is free if you have been to the Getty Ctr on the same day).The setting in Malibu is wonderful and it is a nice way to spend part of the day if it is sunny and not too hot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9DaveR
50,Beautiful Getty Villa,"I have lived in Los Angeles twice and had never gone to the Getty Villa until a vacation in April. It was easy to get reservations on-line. Parking was $15 and that was the only fee. We also got a voucher for free parking at the Getty Center on the same day. My first impression was how quiet and peaceful it was. The recreated Italian villa is absolutely beautiful. Outside, the walls are frescoed. There are fountains and pools with lovely plantings and statues. We took one of the two tours and saw the formal herb garden. The woman who gave the tour was very knowledgable and informative. The buildings are two story with Roman, Greco, and Etruscan art exhibits on each floor. There were only a few of the private exhibits that were not open to photography. While we were there, the Lion Attacking a Horse exhibit from Italy had been held over. It was quite breathtaking and must be viewed from all angles. There is a cafe, but we did not eat there. And of course a gift shop. For people who have difficulty with stairs as I do, there are convenient elevators. The walk from the parking garage to the villa is inclined, but was easily walked. I would recommend planning for a 3 hour visit to be able to appreciate all the gardens, architecture and exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manatee27
40,Good Place,We visited here in March. Not easy to get into if you are going down the highway the opposite way (towards LA) from the Villa but it is doable. The Museum and setting are very nice and it is really a nice place to spend some time. The collection is also good and there are special exhibits - some glass works when we were there - so that can be nice. It is free although you must fork over $15 for the parking but that is for a carload so not a bad deal. The main reason that we came again is because my son has been reading a lot of Percy Jackson (based on Greek Mythology) recently and we wanted to see the Greek pieces again. We had been here 3 years ago. But still a very nice place with a nice collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/419KenL
50,Getty Villa,"This is the first site of the Getty. It is smaller than the Los Angeles Getty, but newly up dated. It is well worth the trip. You must make reservations because the parking is limited, Because of its small size. it is easier here to linger at the wonderful art and gardens. The cost is a parking fee or can be free if you do the Getty first and then go to the Getty Villa on the same day. You need to get a voucher from the Getty in LA and present it at the Getty Villa parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandraW252
50,Mr Getty'd legacy,"This is a first class museum in excellent condition thanks to over a 1,000 volunteers. the parking is $15.00, but no admission fee. There is a steep walkway from the garage, but 99% of the people should be able to make it fine. A large amphitheater faces the museum entrance. Tours are available or you may select a self guided headset. A movie is shown at the entrance which helps to give the visitor some history of the museum.There are two floors of exhibits that are spaced apart for easy viewing. A large open garden area in within the walls of the museum with very beautiful plants and sculptured shrubs. Again, volunteers are in every position with one in every exhibit room. There is a small place for lunch and a gift shop, of course.This is a one of a kind experience and it takes 2-3 hours to go through the entire complex. It is a wonderful to invest a day. Take your camera as pictures are allowed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998JamesH998

50,"INCREDIBLE GREEK, ROMAN & ETRUSCAN ANTIQUITIES BY THE SEA","In a sense, I hang my head in shame because I have driven past VILLA GETTY MUSEUM Hundreds of times without stopping.I FINALLY made it to VILLA GETTY in Malibu mi-March!VILLA GETTY is a breath taking museum founded by J. Paul Getty. He created it so he could share his beloved collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan sculptures in marble and metal as well as incredible ceramics.There was a special exhibition of a Roman sculpture, LION ATTACKING a HORSE, in marble from the Capotoline Museum in Rome. It was painfully beautiful as you could see the anguish of the fallen horse who was being mauled by the lion. I had to look at it from all sides to appreciate the full impact. It is quite old and has been restored but, the beauty and power is awesome.I was fortunate to be on a tour with one of the extremely fine educators who took us on tour to special pieces. She was a very articulate and attractive woman named, Laura, who has been at Getty Villa for nearly a quarter of a century. Listening to Laura was captivating and educational while being very interesting. I will try to see her again.The grounds and gardens are quite special with beautiful metal sculptures. A loggia encloses theinner courtyard making for a pleasant respite. Walking out of the Villa is quite interesting as there is an herb garden of vintage and modern herbs beautifully arranged making for peacefullydeparture.I am very grateful to the GETTY FOUNDATION for making access to their beautiful museums without charge. At the new Getty in Brentwood, they installed a monorail to make the visit really pleasant. When you reach the top, the museum is a modern facility with beautiful views of the Los Angeles basis. Put that on your Visit-To Do list. I love that museums as the exhibitions areworld class and many are on loan.Going back to VILLA GETTY is a must for me.Next time I will enjoy lunch and possibly their special Tea event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QUEENIE_ELLE
50,Beautiful villa by the sea,"I wanted to show my college age kids another part of the history of LA. Instead of walking through a stuffy museum, they were gliding through this beautiful Roman villa filled with Roman, Greek, and Etruscan artifacts. The Pompeii exhibit was there as well. (No pictures can be taken there but can be taken of the gardens). The gardens were delightful overlooking the Malibu hills toward the Pacific Ocean.It does take some planning ahead. Free tickets are available online. Present this to security were you will be directed to the parking garage for $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vossowski

40,Wonderful site,"The whole place is very well maintained and has lots of interesting art of different types and eras. The actual building is great to just wonder round and is based on a classical roman villa lay out. The fact that it is free to visit also made the visit even better, although make sure that you go online to get the free tickets before you head over there. My only complaint is that they confiscated my tripod for my camera until I left as it was ""too professional"" and so I couldn't take any pictures with me in them as I had nothing to put the camera on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/88tpm
50,European Escape,"A different era. a different time, only minutes from the fast tempo of Los Angeles. There are antiquities, art, statues, fountains, gardens, tranquil settings that transform visitors within minutes. Worth at least a day. Just off Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) past Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillT360
50,Gorgeous Setting,"Plan ahead to get your free tickets...you'll need the confirmation number to get to the well-hidden parking garage. Parking will cost you $15. The Roman, Greek and Etruscan vases and statuary are housed in a beautiful Roman villa setting. There are several outdoor gardens and many places to just sit and rest, including an outdoor amphitheatre. Great care was taken so that the surroundings would fit the art. Out of all the art, we particularly enjoyed the vases, which were very well restored and beautiful. There is a huge collection of perfume jars as well. If you are into archaeology, or ancient history, this is a must stop for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VEC24
50,A Wonderful Afternoon,"My wife and I spent a great afternoon taking in this gorgeous place on a warm Spring afternoon. We arrived in time to take in the docent guided tour of the gardens. The many green spaces were beautiful, relaxing and laid out in the Roman symmetry style. There were several pools including a huge one with perfectly manicured garden paths and sitting areas. There was also a large garden of edible plants and herbs.Next we had reservations for Tea by the Sea. It is an English styleTea complete with traditional Scones, finger sandwiches, pastries and included a special blend of tea. It was held in a privite dining room and was elegant and enjoyable. The only thing missing perhaps was some soothing chamber music.After the tea, we took the architectural tour again led by a knowledgeable docent. We were taken to most of the rooms and she told us about the unique features of each one. Again each room was done in the pleasing-to-the-eye Roman symmetry. I liked the tours since everyone is given a receiver with an ear speaker so we could hear every bit of the dialogue by the tour docent.We also saw many pieces of ancient Greek and Roman art, but to us the highlight was the Villa itself and the beautiful grounds. It is truly a Los Angeles treasure and is worth seeing for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williequin
50,The Roman Villa in Malibu,"Driving into the villa grounds you are immediately transported back to Roman times. The villa/museum houses amazing works from Greek and Roman artists. The garden is the crown jewel of the property with a central pool spanning, for its seems, forever. This a must see especially because timed entry leads to less people and a better experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMachold
50,you have to see it to believe it,"I found out about the villa by chance while on the Getty website. You're supposed to reserve free tickets online for the date you choose. I didn't realize this, but staff at the front gate keeps some extra tickets, and allowed us to use those. Admission is free, but parking is $15.The grounds and building were designed by Mr. Getty to resemble a roman villa near Pompeii, and it's tough to decide if the villa or the artifacts are more impressive. Garden sculptures and marble are everywhere. I would have visited just to look at the architecture.Exhibits cover various aspects of life from Roman and Greek civilization, with some artifacts from even earlier cultures. A new exhibit was underway during our visit, and would be complete later this year.There is a restaurants and a cafe on grounds, so you can easily plan to stay all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AC301
50,Great place to visit,It is magnificent! Now it is easy to understand how some of the ancient romans lived. They made this place with such love for details. There are wall paintings all over and in the garden you will find typical herbs and plants in general. You should give it a try!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChicaBandita1
50,A hidden gem.,"A much less visited place than the Getty Museum. Not a problem for a last minute reservation even on a Sunday. There is no charge to visit, except for a parking fee of $15, very reasonable. It's located right across PCH from the beach. The place is full of Greek artifacts and displays. A wonderful place for high schoolers to learn about mythology. There are free guided tours all day it free self-guided iPod tours as well. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigFishDiveClub
30,It was just so-so.,"I think if you're in the area, then it's a good place to spend a couple of hours in since the admission is free (you have to pay $15 for parking though). Don't make a special trip to go there like I did unless you're really into sculptures. The big garden is nice with a big fountain, but the other gardens are just o.k. I somehow got the impression that I would be able to see some neat architecture, but it wasn't really impressive. Overall, it was just o.k., but I won't go there again...the traffic was bad on the 10 Fwy both ways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJAACCKK2004

50,Must see location in Los Angeles.,"If you are visiting LA for a few days, the Getty Villa is a must see addition to your list. It is like visiting a Summer get away villa in Roman times. The sculpture and art are world class and the entire facility is a work of art in stone. Prior to the opening of the larger Getty Museum, this was my favorite ""art"" location in Los Angeles. The museum is free but parking needs to be reserved in advance, or you can take the Coastal bus line. Worth spending a whole day if you have the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
40,Adequate variety of art and beautiful gardens for a 2 hour self tour,"My husband and I enjoyed our day trip out to Malibu and centered the day around a visit to the Getty villa. It was a nice drive by the ocean to get there, however lots of traffic due to the popularity of the area. You must make a reservation ahead of time to enter the grounds- we called the day before and were able to get in at our appointed time. They are closed one day a week either monday or tuesday. Parking is $15 but otherwise no entrance fee. You can borrow an audio headset for no fee which plays on a iPod! My favorite part were the gardens outside near the long pond. There is an adequate amount of art from the roman and Etruscan periods and a few breathtaking pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4_traveller12_4

50,"The Getty Villa & Museum, Malibu, Ca.","Driving from Seattle to San Diego along the coast, we stopped in Malibu to visit the Getty Villaand Museum.

Took many pictures so I couldremember my visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/islandgirlthree
50,Wow!! You need to spend the day here.,"Yeah it is that amazing to see. The grounds are so beautiful. The view is amazing. The artifacts are just beyond words. It is a collection of Greek and Roman artifacts that we are all fortunate to see without a 12 hour flight to Europe. There is lo much to absorb. Look at the ceilings the columns the floor, let alone the sculptures, pictures, sarcophagus, mosaics and fountains. So much history here. Very relaxing! And it is free, you need only get a timed ticket in advance. great gift store with lots of books and trinkets to bring home. Anytime we are out this way, we will visit again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cobaltshadow
50,Just fab!,"Book FREE reservation in advance. We did day prior and got in on a Sunday morn around 11 am Parking was $15/car (mar 2013). I'd recommend full day...start with overview movie. Get the free ipod touch audio guides to tour the facility and before you know it is three hours later and you still have the person guided tours, lunch and the gift shop to hit. Facillity's focus is antiquities. Wonderful geographic variety of objects (although many are restorations...but hey they know what they are doing). Even getting there is a fun drive up Pacific Coast hwy. just go and take your time (weather hopefully will cooperate as there are several out door things to see).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BTMNSP
50,Beautiful,"We went here on a beautiful July morning and were really impressed. The grounds and building are lovely and the collections are impressive. The parking was $15, but the entrance to the museum is free. Well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TripleDeckers
50,Brilliant !,"The last time I came here was 25 years ago. The renovations are spectacular. It is a brilliantly arranged museum - thematic as opposed to by era or civilisation. We took a tour that focussed on perhaps only 7 objects. The docent (Laura) brought these beautiful things to life with her amazing art history lesson. We went in the afternoon due to other commitments - when we go again I would definitely go in the morning so as to catch up to 3 tours, as they feature ones specifically to do with the gardens & architecture as well.It is not Italy, it is not Greece - but it is a spectacular collection and beautifully laid out - I think the (what seems to me) somewhat pared down 'new' villa exhibits a perfect slice of those life & times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YRR_11
50,Must See!,We had four days in Los Angeles and decided to visit The Getty Villa and what a great decision that was. It is FREE to visit you just pay $15.00 to park.We booked the day before we went and had a brilliant time exploring the villa itself and all of the antiquities on display.We had a meal in the resturant which was excellent quality and extremely good value for money.It is simply stunning and should not be missed.Probably the best Museam we have ever visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jagsUk
50,Best Trip Ever!!!,"This trip to the Getty Villa was the best trip ever, I loved it there... It's so pretty there... The parking is $15... But the entrance to the Getty Villa itself is free",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alicatal07
50,Unique Opportunity Outside of Europe,"What makes the Getty Villa ""excellent"" is not only the Greek and Roman antiquities. It is the setting in which they are presented. The villa itself is part of the exhibit. It is modeled on the partially excavated Villa dei Papiri on the Bay of Naples near Hurculaneum and Pompeii. Of course, the interiors are modern lighting and air conditioning to display the well arranged contents. The building and gardens in this great setting overlooking the Pacific though truly give you a feel of what the actual villa must have been like.Recommendations:- Take one of the free tours. They last about 40 minutes. I suggest the Architectural Tour.- Walk through the gardens and fountains and enjoy the views on your own.- Get the free audio guide. That's right. It is free. And you will enjoy viewing the collection so muich more when you just listen to the enhanced descriptions while you look at the artiquities instead of reading all those cards.- Eat at the Cafe. Sit outside. The food is good, reasonably priced and brought to your table on real plates. No plastic.- Plan on a minimum of three hours. If you spend less time, you aren't really interested in this.After visiting Italy and Greece last year (including Pompeii), I thought the Getty people did a great job. This is a unique opportunity outside of Europe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David-IrvineCA
50,I need to go back!,"So, I understand that several people just need 2 - 3 hours. If you're anything like me, you may need up to 5 hours. There is a lot to see. We also went on an architecture tour. I'm not sure if any of the hours are a must do but they are there if you are interested.Anyways, if you are the type of person that wants to enjoy the museum and read the description for the pieces that you like then you will need more time then 3 hours. This place is huge. There is also a cafe on site just in case you get hungry. If you're like me, do not bring family or friends here that aren't that interested.There is plenty of parking (at least when we went). There is a lot to see here. It's great. I wish I had more time. We arrived at around 3pm and two hours just wasn't enough. Maybe another two to three hours for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/832SarahN
50,Fabulous,The villa provides a unique opportunity to experience what a Roman villa actually looked like and felt like. No expense has been spared. The artefacts on display are remarkable for a private collection. Visitors are well looked after and there is a good restaurant on site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Massacio1423
40,Wonderful Field Trip to the Getty Villa,"I recently chaperoned 6th graders to the Getty Villa, my second time doing this...after the kids had studied ancient art with their teacher this school year, they enjoyed so much seeing the sculptures and various artworks depicting the cultures they'd studied. It really brought everything to life for them. The teacher made maps of the rooms and highlighted key topics, and provided worksheets for the kids to use to help them really think about what they were seeing. They loved the statues, the mummy of course, and the artwork on the urns and more...and then when it was time to go out into the gardens, they GASPED - so beautiful. Stunning. It's hard to find a more beautiful place than this.We took photos inside without flash, and got some gorgeous ones outside. There are many places to expore out in the gardens so you want to walk right and left at the end and see all of them. The gift shop, the waterfall outside the restrooms, even the driveway are just beautiful. If you haven't been, it is worth the trip. I believe you can only turn into the museum driveway when driving north, so check your map carefully so you don't have to go past it and turn around in order to approach it correctly...there's a nice parking structure. We brought sack lunches so I don't know about any other food there. We did walk up and down some sets of stairs and I didn't pay attention to the wheelchair access, so check on that if you need. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventurousMom63
50,An Italian Villa in California,Perfect symmetry in the architecture and gardens. Greek and Roman statues. Perfect setting. A very relaxed place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JKNDenver

50,Go there ALL THE TIME. It's like being in Italy. Have Lunch there!,It's free to go. Just pay for parking. I go all the time and sit in the gardens and pretend i'm back in time. Lunch is super. Great salads. Just go. And get tickets online easily. At 9am they release tickets for that day. So easy to get.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sashu2
50,!!!!!!,Best Greek and Roman museum outside Rome if you ask me! wonderful gardens amazing view from the Terrace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LxxMxxL
50,A trip to Italy,"Magic! A scholarly reconstruction of a Roman villa, full of real Greek, Roman and Etruscan art. The upscale cafe is worth the price, but the coffee cart will do if you are on a budget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliceT800
50,Interesting and educational for families,"The ""treasure hunt"" game for kids - get the kids really excited to look at the exhibits! I would not have gotten to kids to walk around the room otherwise. The villa is truly beautiful as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CandiceC935
50,Art and culture,This is a gorgeous place. Renovated and full of classic anntiquities. The grounds are so lovely and flawless. Great place to go for a day with friends or family. Not really for little kids. Make a reservation for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryD879
50,The Getty,The museum is close by and we didn't want to miss an opportunity to visit while we were staying at the Inn.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hartes62012
40,Great way to spend an afternoon,"We spent a wonderful afternoon at the Getty Villa. We explored the art in the museum, walked the gardens and enjoyed a late lunch on the Terrace while enjoying the views. Being in Malibu, the weather was perfect!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheilaO293
40,Nice way to spend some time away from the beach,"We loved that this was a free visit, the only cost was parking which was $15.oo but included 6 of us so great value for sure! The grounds are spotless, the exhibits very interesting and the views from the various levels were amazing. The cafes for a short coffee break were affordable and very good! Highly recommend as a great way to spend some leisure time away from the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fifidudedog
50,Phenomenal Museum,"My wife and I have been to The Getty Villa many times over the past few years, most recently for the specific purpose of seeing the sculpture known as “Lion Attacking a Horse” from the Capitoline Museums in Rome. Just seeing the “Lion Attacking a Horse” was worth the 150+ mile trip from San Diego; it was extraordinary. If there had been nothing else to see at The Getty Villa, the trip still would have been worth it. But The Getty Villa is jam-packed with other incredible exhibits.There is no fee at all to enter The Getty Villa, but tickets are necessary that require you to select a date and time for entry. It’s easy to obtain the required tickets at The Getty Center or on the Internet. There is only a $15 fee to park. Exhibits at The Getty Villa are often booked for limited, specific periods of time, always well-spaced, many have interactive panels, and they all have detailed explanations of the pieces. The museum offers tours and talks, lectures and conferences, performances and films, courses and demonstrations – many are free. Some require tickets or reservations; many limit the number of participants in the program. Detailed explanations about everything is available online.Free iPod Touches are available to visitors for self-guided tours of the phenomenal exhibits. Over the years, we have taken many of the tours; every single one that we’ve taken has been outstanding. Everything at The Getty Villa is always first-rate – the architecture, the gardens, the tours and talks, the exhibitions – everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paolo-Chris
50,Absolutely beautiful!,"The Getty Villa should be visited by everyone! The museum is free but parking is $15, and reservations are required through their website. We had a reservation for 3pm but were in the Santa Monica area around noon so we called and they were able to accept us at that time with no problem. There was a 10-15 minute introductory video that is definitely a must-see. The gardens are absolutely spectacular on a sunny day. There are many sculptures to learn about and the outdoor amphitheater is nice as well. Definitely recommend coming with friends or family at any time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatherineG126
40,Nice Visit,"On a day trip through our city, we ended on the coast and decided to stop and see if we could get to the museum since I knew we may have needed a reservation. Luckily, they have spare tickets for late comers. The grounds were beautiful! Everything looks pretty new due to the massive renovations that have taken place. We joined an architecture tour and learned so much about the design and functionality of the spaces and gardens that most people would overlook. A treasure worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/preyes63
50,"Beautiful Setting, Wonderful Collection","The museum is free (thanks JP Getty!), but the parking is $15 per car, by timed reservation only (through their website). You must arrive within the designated time block or you won't be admitted. The parking structure is new, and provides direct access to the museum.The setting, high above Malibu facing the Pacific, is stunning. Several of the outdoor gardens and patios are oriented toward the ocean, providing a welcome respite from ""museum fatigue"". I can't recall a museum that provides so many opportunities to get some fresh air while perusing the galleries.The collection of antiquities is excellent, and is presented in intimate galleries. That is why entry is controlled and timed. If it gets too crowded, those small rooms would be unbearable.Adults will appreciate how old the artifacts are, as well as the exquisite detailing. Kids will think it all looks just plain old. But, there is a very nice kids room with urns that they can write on, and a neat projection wall where they can don costumes and their shadows can play along to music/dialogue. That room, and the outdoor areas, will leave kids satisfied.Whether you are a tourist or local, the $15 parking fee is a real bargain for this gem of a museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelDrone
50,Pleasant visit,We were pleasantly surprised at how well done the Getty Villa and Museum is presented. Our guide Thomas was excellent and so knowledgeable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColleenB982
50,A Treasure,"While staying in Santa Monica for the Rose Parade events we passed the sign for Getty Villa while driving on highway one. Since we had a free day we looked into going to this museum and I'm so glad we took the time. The Villa is free but you have to reserve parking ahead of time. The parking is $15. Once inside the grounds of the museum you are transported back in time to a Roman villa. The Greek, Roman, and Etruscan artifacts are amazing but my favorite part of the museum was the gardens with the reflecting pools and the views down to the ocean. The grounds are amazingly large but everything is handicap accessible. My bad knees really appreciated the elevators! Although busy, the museum never felt crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherminwil
50,Magnificent!,"The views alone from the Getty make this a must see if you are in Los Angeles. The museum is magnificent, the Greek and Roman displays are beautiful and well done. We stayed for the afternoon, and sat outside just taking the scenery and the views. A must, if you are in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chantelita7
50,Wonderful Greek and Roman artifacts,"I have been here many times over the years. I love it each time I go! There is a fee for parking and you must have a reservation. The Villa has been transformed into a wonderful place for Greek and Roman antiquities. There are outdoor and indoor areas for viewing. Nice relaxing atmosphere to view wonderful historical artifacts. The Villa is just off PCH so the ride up there is fun too. Have dinner in Malibu or Santa Monica when you finish your day!I have also been there to see an evening performance in the theater. I did not try the cafe, but if you are hungry there is an opportunity to eat as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/triptravelCA
30,Getty...Interesting but not a must see!,"You have to schedule your visit...and I was disappointed that it wasn't a tour of JP's villa as much as it was just another collection of art. But, hey it was interesting and I'm glad I went. Return is questionable...rather to to the Getty Ctr if I'm going to see art!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlieU236
50,A trip to Ancient Rome minutes from LAX,"The villa de papyri inspired the design of J. P. Getty's villa in Malibu, CA. Although it is less than 1/4 the size of the ancient villa in Rome, you won't think it's small.On the daily tours, you can learn how the Romans lived, worked, and played in early AD.The garden tour highlights how plants were used in every aspect of life. The architecture tour gives insight on how the most technologically advanced people of that time were able to build these structures without modern equipment. Entrance is free with a required advance ticket. Parking is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoachTerri
20,Getty Villa,The people who work there are snobbish and not friendly at all. They are rude. I've been there a few times and every single time I noticed people who work there are not happy to be there. I would go to LACMA instead who have great art works and great staff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryamS922
50,"Not free, parking is $15 per car","** Make sure you call ahead or book parking online. You need the reservation number when you show up, they're pretty strict. Parking is $15 per car.**Parking aside, I love love love this Getty! The long pool facing the ocean, opening to central pool, the marbled floors, and the lovely garden are a great setting to view ancient Greek/Roman artifacts. The museum is really built around the artifacts and I felt like I had been immersed in another world.There are lots of free walking tours (they even have those cool headsets so you don't have to strain to hear the guide) and you can also get the GettyGuide (free iPod-based audio guide).Don't miss the Landsdown Heracles, which is almost hidden away in a little room by itself. The room, btw, is itself exquisite (the floor! the columns! the ceiling!) -- I can't say enough about how the architecture of the place complements the artifacts on display.I really wanted to have high tea there (it was like $45pp) but the DH nixed the idea in favor of going to the Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Former_grad_student
50,Love This Place,I have come here a number of times and always enjoy it. For me it is a full day experience. My wife and I will just hang out and enjoy the views or see what is new.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kraef
50,"Unique, stunning museum","This is a unique and stunning museum. Not for the casual tourist or family outing, there is no other place in North America which depicts Roman culture, art and architecture. A rare jewel that should not be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRBoston_MA
50,A true treasure in Malibu,"The original Getty Villa here in Malibu is -in my opinion,WAY cooler than the new Getty . I love the outer paristyle with the busts and statues throughout the hedges and reflecting pool.It's a fantastic place-a visually sensual treat.The museum is a treasure trove of Greek,Roman & Etruscan pieces that fascinate the lover of theatre,art,gods&goddesses.You really are transported to another place of beauty and rich history.The audio tour is a great way to experience the Getty villa .Good food in the cafe and snacks available as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeRTrippin
50,Beautiful!,"A beautiful place on the cliffs of Santa Monica. The art pieces are amazing, set in a gorgeous mansion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelay157
50,Roman Villa in Malibu,"The Getty Museum was closed, so the guard suggested the Getty Villa. Oil Tycoon J. Paul Getty has recreated a Roman Villa in Malibu, complete with statues, reflecting pool, herb garden, and other features based on historiacl records. I felt transported in time. I took numerous photos, enjoyed the tour of the villa and the library and museum on the second floor. Exhibits rotate, and in the summer they have theatrical performances in the atrium outside. Alight dining cafe is also on sight, so you can make the day-long visit and enjoy this unique architectural tribute to ancient times at leisure. Doesn't hurt that the view is of the pacific ocean. Delightful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lirocapoce
50,Beautiful Place,Worth the visit. Sad that Getty never lived here but built this to house his Greek and Roman art. It is extremely beautiful and what a house in Pompei may have looked like or Heraculeum if built by Getty! The collection is important and worth seeing. I just wish someone had lived here to add to the romance like the Guggenheim in Venice! The grounds are beautiful and well planned. Parking as you drive in off the pacific Coast Highway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCR_12
50,Superb,"This may well be the most spectacular combination of artifacts, building, and setting of any museum in the country. This wonderful collection of ancient art is housed in a replica of a Roman country house, nestled in a valley with stunning views out to the Pacific. None of the four of us has a particular interest in this era of art, but all still thoroughly enjoyed our nearly three hours here. No admission fee, but there is a $15. per car parking fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DOD56
40,Take the bus...it's easier and you wait on the beach,"The Gtty Villa is quite spectacular, although nor quite so impressive when you learn Getty copied (replicated exactly) a classical villa in Italy. But on a nice day, it ca't be beat. Absolutely fabulous views, with the ocean in front.If you take the 534 bus to Malibu, everything is much easier. It drops you at the foot of the Villa. You can park at the culver City Transit Center and catch the 534.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annet782
50,if you can't get to italy...,"this is a great California substitute and well worth the effort to get here. fantastic location on the Pacific, so enjoy the drive up the coast. everything the other reviewers have said is true about the setting, the collections, and the building. I especially enjoyed the gardens as it was a gorgeous day.my only complaint is about the 'continuously running 12 minute film'. they make you stand in a line until the film is over and the previous group files out. it is a very small room which doesn't hold many people, so we had to wait and wait to get in. quite annoying, but we wanted the overview before exploring the museum,other museums we have visited with 'continuously running films' are open; you go in, sit down, watch as long as you want, then get up and leave. if you come in mid-way, you just watch the beginning and leave when you get to the point where you came in. this makes for a nice, smooth flow without the tedious and quite irritating standing in line.the cafe was a lovely place to sit and enjoy the sunshine, although a bit pricey ( as expected,though). a cup of soda was over $3.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnelrog
50,Do not visit LA without seeing the Getty Villa,"This is a hidden gem just outside of LA. An outstanding collection of Roman, Greek, and Etruscan artifacts. The docent-led tours are terrific. It is a wonderful place to bring children. There are child-specific tours, exhibits, and scavenger hunts.Have lunch on the terrace and get a glass of wine. Sit back and enjoy the magnificent scenery overlooking the Pacific. This is my favorite place in all of SoCal.Remember to ""buy"" tickets ahead of time (they're free). The spots fill up quickly for weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda235
50,A Taste of the Ancient World,The wonderful museum is world famous for an extensive collection of ancient Roman/Greek artifacts in a beautful Villa. The museum is free but requires reservations and parking does cost.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulLori
30,Nice but not spectacular.,I have been to many museums and this one unfortunately ranks as average. A positive note however is that it never seems to be super crowded or overly busy whenever I visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyandlina
50,Gotta stop here,"This place is breathtaking, and also much larger than I had imagined from seeing it while driving by. I like the fact that you must have a ticket, so attendance is not only limited, but at a steady pace so that you can really see the exhibits up close..We were in Santa Monica for the Rose parade and game, and Getty was 10 minutes from us, so we decided to go. What a wonderful suprise to see the pompei exhibit with contemporary art (18 and 19 centuries) amid things like a real mummy from 150a.d.There is a reading room on the 2nd florr where you can pick one of the books and read away! Loved that....Beautiful views, great gardens (loved the mosaic fountain with imbedded shells), pools and frescos. Everything about the building is wonderfull (check the room with the muses) This is a great stop, and it's free:-)) Also of note, the entire place is wheelchair accessable...great place for families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ohm2
50,Beautiful!,A wonderful way to view a fantastic art collection in a personal way in a lovely area. This setting is so different from the large J Paul Getty Museum in the hills of Los Angeles which is also a unbeliveable place to visit & see some of the worlds most famous pieces of art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swancastle
50,A Different Kind of LA Experience,"The Getty Villa is a different kind of LA experience. I highly recommend taking any one or two of the free, docent-led tours. They provide great insight into J. Paul Getty and the Roman and Greek antiquities in the Villa. The listening devices used on the walking tours are wonderful. You can clearly hear the tour guide without feeling absolutely tethered to the group. The tours are short and kept my interest. The cafe at the Villa was also great -- good food with a non-touristy menu. Since someone else booked this for us, I don't know if there was a fee to enter but there was a parking fee which you can't avoid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BerylM414
40,was good,"Overall we had a good experience. Easy to find since it is right by the highway. We especially enjoyed the antique collections and the herb garden. We reserved the tickets online. Also liked the fact that there was a cafe inside the property, so we didnt have to go out for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalGirl84
50,Great collection to see if you can't get to Italy or Greece,"If you have travelled to Italy or Greece, you will probably feel like you are seeing a lot of the same things you saw over there. Nevertheless, the Villa has an amazing antiquities collection and beautiful gardens. If you do plan to go, you must get a free ticket online. No one is admitted without a reserved ticket. If you do try to get in without a ticket, you will be stopped as you enter in your car and directed to the exit. Plus, you're holding up the line for the people behind you that do have tickets. While this facility is crowded even with timed tickets, the crowds start to wane around 4 pm. That is a great time to stop by the more popular exhibits for a more intimate experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cemckeon
50,Outstanding!,"This is well worth a visit; super collection of Roman and Egyptian antiquities contained within a lovely villa; great architecture and excellent location. One of the best ""museum"" experiences we have ever had. Were there for four hours, including lunch, and there was still more to do and see. It was very busy, and this was on December 31st; can only imagine that it must be swamped in the summer, although the car park ticket allocation system is supposed to help control the flow of visitors. There is no entrance fee, but there is a charge of $15 for a car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidB75
50,A Wonderful Place for Out of Town Visitors,"The Getty is sweet because it's free. Despite the $15 fee to park, it's amazing to know this is a free attraction open to the public for the pure pleasure of reliving life in Herculaneum pre-volcanic eruption.The tour guides are very knowledgeable although the self guided tour via iPod headset that can be obtained at Guest Services is also pretty helpful while navigating the exhibits.We went for the Pompeii exhibition and it was really astounding. I would have liked to see a film or two of the actual excavation process. There is a fantastic mosaic fountain outside that is captivating.The restaurant serves very good food in a pretty outdoor setting. It's a very interesting place to visit and there are a great number of antiquities and historical artifacts that will satisfy the curious guest to the So Cal area....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/424JM424
40,Amazing Antiquities!,"Amazing antiquities form ancient Greece and Rome in a stellar setting. Nice place to be, particularly on a beautiful day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Knucklesmccarthy
50,A Real Treat!,"A beautiful setting on the hill, with great views - out over the ocean, but of course what's inside is the real treat! An easy wander around through a variety of rooms to see the collection(s). The Cafe offers a lovely setting for a light lunch. Highly recommended - especially if you've already been to the Getty Museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllenV377
50,Amazing Collection of Art,"On our visit to LA, we didn't plan on going here, but we were glad we did. There is an amazing collection of art, primarily statues and sculptures. The famous Lion Attacking a Horse was on loan from Rome and there was a Pompeii exhibit, also on loan, which I found VERY interesting. These exhibits complimented Getty's own unbelievable collection. It's amazing how beautiful this art is and most was created before or just after the birth of Christ. Lastly, the grounds and gardens are beautiful and peaceful. You HAVE to get tickets ahead of time, which are free, but you pay $15 to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CregS
30,Nice for American standards,"Ok, I don't consider it as a serious museum, because after visiting the biggest museums in Europe, this one is just a joke. But I think for being in America, it has pretty nice collection. I would recommend not to take any tours, they are pretty much talking about everything as if you were a baby, telling the stories that are not approved. Take it only if you don't have enough education in history and art. Otherwise, it's very nice place, definitely visit if in LA:",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LunaTravelsTheWorld
50,Spectacular!,"My husband and I visited The Getty Villa in Malibu, California in December 2012. It is the most unusual museum in the most unusual settings. You find yourself immerced in ancient history looking at the precious objects of art which go back 2000-3000 years. The gardens and the views of the ocean are magnificent! Make sure you book your tickets on line in advance, though the entrance is free, you still need tickets to get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marinaa873
40,The Garden,"Overwhelming assortment of classical pieces, mind-boggling treasures, almost to the point of overload. But the true pleasures are the gardens and the views. Suggest taking a break, from the museum tour and stepping out for some fresh air and re-focus. Gorgeous grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gskat
50,Unexpected find; an absolute must see!,"We were on our way out of L.A. And decided to give this place a try. SO glad we did. If you have any inclination toward history, art, the Greeks or the Romans, architecture or even gardening, you will love this place. The tours are first class, and there is so much to see; 4 hours is a minimum. They have a decent cafe, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GypsyTraveller94
40,Nice and free excursion for a sunny day,"Great villa, nice collection & free.. so whenever parking alongside the Malibu beaches gets scarce.. try this alternative, has nice view as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabriela_Ka
50,Free Attraction,"We went because they had a Pompei exhibition, which was interesting, but was based around a book rather than being a display of just items from Pompei.We had an audio tour, which was interesting and some of the exhibits were narrated by Mary Beard, which was good.The museum is built like a villa from Herculaneum, which is a novel twist, and contains some fantastic items.His way of collecting was a little strange, wanting to take items from other collectors, especially British aristocracy, but never the less he has left a lasting legacy, which is being looked after in a proper manner.You have to book on line, and be able to print tickets, but, it is well worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andym498
50,"beautiful at night, and not a Villa","I was surprised when I was told that this was never really a home (what one would call a ""Villa"") but the museum that Getty built (he had run out of room for his personal galleries) in the stile of a classical Roman Villa.I visited the Villa for one of the ""college nights at the Getty Villa"" and we got to see some of the conservation labs they have there. The work they do is really astonishing. The Villa itself is amazing at night, and a great place to photograph if you're into that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/f64CM
50,Amazing small museum,"Great ceramics, gorgeous location, very nice to come here and relax and get some culture! My daughter the art major really loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJinCA
50,Getty Villa,"I'm a fan of antiquities, particularly Greek and Roman. The Villa has an outstanding collection of statues and other artifacts in a very well done replica of a Roman Villa. I've been visiting since the 60's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidG574
40,Wonderful collection,"Some amazing pieces, prehistoric and later. All well presented. Orpheus and two sirens--walk around the sirens and each figure changes with different angles, the emotion expressed, the lines, they are three dimensional in a way that most sculpture is not. We went to the Getty Center first, which was spectacular and, contrary to what I would have thought, a better experience than the Villa, which feels a little dead, not ancient, though everything has been really well done, down to Italianate pines and plantings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aubri9
50,Pompeii exhibit,"Enjoyed this very well laid out and fascinating exhibit over a couple of hours. The gardens in particular are not to be missed. Unfortunately, it was very foggy on the day I was there so there were no views to speak of but the fog muffled the noise of other people and added a shroud of mystery to the outdoor areas which was fun. The parking is easy but as other point out, make sure to book your tickets ahead of time because you will be turned away without a ticket as parking is very limited. This exhibit is truly not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllaToronto
50,Fantastic Museum,This place is simply amazing. The exhibits are outstanding and well presented. The views from the Villa of the Pacific are also a wonderful experience. I felt so relaxed on the serene grounds of the Getty Villa. A must see when in this area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarge54
50,A great museum,"The Getty Villa exhibits ancient Roman and Greek art dating back to 6500 BC. There are many statues and sculptures throughout the villa which is modeled after an ancient Roman Villa. Admission is free, but you do need to get tickets in advance here: http://www.getty.edu/visit/ Parking is $15 per car. There are several walking which I recommend -- the Garden and Architecture tours occur multiple times throughout the day and are 40 minutes in length.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andy_the_diver
50,Museum in our own backyard,"I live I Pacific Palisades and had been to the Getty several times but never to the Villa on PCH. I was so surprised and impressed. The parking is easy, just remember to call ahead to book your spot, the displays are terrific, the setting phenomenal and the restaurant has plenty of good choices to eat. I love that you can see an outdoor performance of a Greek Tradgedy in the amphitheater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HilaryS931

50,The next best thing to being in Pompeii,"Pompeii is a magical place, and the Getty Villa certainly captures some of that magic! The Villa is filled with ancient treasures, with a different collection to see in each room. The inner courtyards, gardens and walkways are delightful. In fact, one of the ruins in Pompeii had a similar layout, and walking through the Getty Villa took me right back to Italy. The collections are very well displayed, and I learned a great deal in the 3 hours we were there. Currently there is an exhibition entitled ""The Last Days of Pompeii"" that is well done. I would highly recommend this unique museum to anyone fascinated by ancient civilizations! (The only downside is the $15.00 parking fee, and the somewhat confusing access from the main road, but it is money well spent.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Debru
50,Just Beautiful,The Getty villa is a beautiful open air museum and gardens with fabulous Greco/roman art. I could spend all day admiring the marble and the statues or the glass and gem collections. Nestled in the beautiful Santa Monica Mountains it is a perfect way to escape for the day. Parking is just 15 dollars and be sure you have prearranged your visit on line tickets are free but you have to print them online. I highly recommend a visit it's breathtaking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darin_and_Christi
50,Never knew.,"I had lived in L.A for several years and never visited the Getty. I currently live in San Diego and my sister invited me. She said that I missed out on a great museum. My sister was right, not only does the Getty Villa have a great view but has several interesting pieces. I would live to go multiple times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jazzitupp
50,An intimate visit to a LIVE museum and Gardens,"A visit to the Villa, is like taking a journey into the ancient and elegant time, when the Romans vacationed in Pompeii, that is, before the eruption of Vesuvius.This replica of and authentic Villa of Pompeii, which architectural plans were found in Herculaneum, houses amazing greek and Italian artifacts. Gorgeous gardens and sculpture can be enjoyed as well.The exhibits make you want to come back time and time again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GladysS716

50,Ancient Rome and Greece up close!,"A stunning museum overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Only fee is for parking, $15.00 per car.Tours are ongoing most of the day. The antiquities to be seen are high quality from severalperiods of history long ago. Each area is well documented so you learn as you go. Outdoor dining is the best way to have a bite to eat while in this museum. Go casual with good walking shoes to make this trek easy on your body. A very special place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/564barbaraw564

30,Kind of boring.,"Went with a friend of mine who had visited the other site in LA and really enjoyed it. Since Malibu is such a nice area we expected the Getty Villa to be even better, but was disapointed.I cant speak for the museum, it might be great - we however came for the gardens. And to be honest found it a bit boring. It was pretty, the herb garden was very nice (love the smell). But to be honest, it wasnt worth the 15dollar parking fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Majzet
50,Is it for real?,"J Paul Getty has got to be in heaven. The Villa is a replica of one circa pre Mt. Vesuvius eruption close to Pompeii. It's even located and positioned at the same distance from the Ocean as the ancient villa would have been. It's a museum with beautiful with a replica of roman gardens with incredible ocean views.The docent who gave the tour of the gardens was outstanding. Couldn't say as much of the architectural one; however, it didn't matter given the incredible job the garden's had done. The restaurant's food while not extensive in variety was outstanding, albeit a bit pricey; however, well worth it given how delicious it was.There was a special exhibit during our visit on the last days of Pompeii. Absolutely incredibly curated.I am absolutely in awe of this place. It's absolutely free. You just pay for the parking $15. That's it. You do need to make reservations.The villa is in impeccable condition. It's as if it had just opened. Everything is in immaculate condition. There's an area for children where they can decorate Egyptian pottery -- actually it's not only for children, adults can do it too.My mom, my two sisters and I spent the whole day there. Awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D5954LOgracec
50,"Lots of sculptures, gardens, and history here",The place is very clean and well-kept. The exhibits were spaced apart well and very interesting. It is confusing upon arrival as to where you are supposed to go. The cafe on the second floor does not connect directly with museum's second floor. Prepare to do lots of walking. There is no internet or cellphone network connections on the premises. Parking is ample. Steep incline onto the property...best accessed from northbound highway. Plan to spend 3 - 4 hours to see everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SpringBreak48038
50,The must see in Los Angelos,"Of all the things to do in LA, making a reservation to tour the Getty Villa is the best. Be sure to get a reservation on-line (it's free!), see if there are any other events scheduled for the day (we went to a fabulous play reading), and have a coffee, or a glass of wine and eat lunch on the terrace. (Great food. Loved the Mediterranean plate). Was I in Tuscany? Or Malubu?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouisaTheK
50,Mind blowingly wonderful,"If you are not into ancient art then don't bother, if however youlove real art and real craftsmanship of the highest order this isa must see for everyone in the world that can make here.The Getty Villa is like seeing ancient Greece as it might have been2000 years ago.The artifacts they have are fantastic in number and in quality.I don't think there is a better museum outside of London forthis kind of thing.We are so luck to have this in our backyard, I can only hope thatmore people will take advantage of the wonderful place.Take your time walking around and look into every corner youhave time for, it's all fantastic, and be sure to take note ofthe time periods that these things were made, it will simplyblow your mind.Best museum in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinF600
50,Beautiful and educational!,This is a very well run operation. The reservation system keeps it from getting overcrowded. The buildings and the setting are beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/122JohnD
50,A must see if you are in the area!,Our final stop on our way back to LAX for the flight back to Europe. Most enjoyable though a little OTT in places.Access from The Pacific Highway requires careful planning and LOW speed or you will miss it!Only a short drive to LAX when finished.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bristol411
50,Escape to Rome from the heart of LA,"This is a beautiful Roman style villa near Malibu beach housing gorgeous art collections and a beautiful garden.The location is fantastic and although you don't get many ocean views you can definitely feel that seaside 'vibe'. The centre is designed to imitate approaching an archaeological site and you don't see the villa unless you're right upon it, which is quite clever.The artwork on the lower level focuses on ancient Greek and Roman artefacts, which are going to be a lot more beautiful and fascinating than you'd think!, whilst the upper level houses some more modern pieces, including works by Rothko and Dali.I can spent the whole day there and stay wanting more.It's just a beautiful piece of architecture in a wonderful setting... and then you can leave when it closes at 5 and head to catch the sunset at Topanga beach! Heaven.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DestinationVictoria8
40,"Pick me, pick me!","The last time i was in Los Angeles, I went to the Getty Centre but this time, I went to the Getty Villa and enjoyed this a lot more as it was more focussed on the Roman civilisation. Beautiful gardens and so many interesting paintings and photos.The Fall of Pompeii exhibition was on and was very impressive. A great way to spand a few hours in Los Angeles.On-lin reservations are essential but was easy enough to get the day before. A beautiful drive there too!There's no entry fee but a $15 charge for parking",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RayC888
50,Breathtaking!,My husband & I visited the Villa after seeing the Getty Centre. A reservation is required as you visit only with scheduled appointment (the attendant at the Centre took care of the reservations for us). Was not crowded as it appears only so many people can visit at once. Unfortunately the sea fog moved in and we lost our views but the Villa is beautiful. Gorgeous gardens and architecture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/620irene87
50,Beauty Everywhere You Look,Fabulous collection and beautiful grounds. The staff went above and beyond and gave a terrific tour. Lovely way to spend the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6205QQlisam
40,Beautiful day to spend!,"We opted to visit the museum last minute, and we were able to get reservations quickly and easily. Once there, we were happy to find that museum was not crowded, and the weather was perfect for our day. We wanted to see one of the exhibits, but wandered through most of the other galleries as well, and spent a long time in the beautiful garden. The Villa is so perfectly situated along the hillside, and the renovation has given new life to this wonderful treasure. It is so relaxing just to wander through the halls, that it feels like someone's home, not a museum. It is a nice place to take friends, and out of town visitors, for a perfect day of leisure. They have a nice outdoor cafeteria with the usual food, but it sits above the museum a bit, so it gives you a nice perspective of the property. Reservations are required, and there is a parking fee of $15/car, but the museum is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winenutt
50,Beautiful Getty Villa,It's been a while since I've been there but it is in a beautiful setting and has a very impressive art collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibaol
50,Transported to Ancient Rome,"I was here 15 yrs ago. Few museums have the quality and quantity of antiquities of Getty Villa. Boston, British and Met in NY would be three who can compete. But for the experience of feeling transported to ancient Rome none compare. This is an exact replica of a country villa destroyed when Vesuvius erupted. If you've ever visited ancient sites and tried to recreate them in your mind's eye and wished you could have seen them in their splendor this is the place! Get your tickets online, they are timed. It's free but parking is $15. There is a casual lunch cafe, cafeteria style. Take time to explore the gardens. And they are closed on Tues. This is must see for L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dtothesecondpow
50,Truly Beautiful,"What a great place to spend the day. Gorgeous marble, the grounds are so scenic and pretty. Excellent opportunity for photo's:TIP~ get there early before the crowds and you won't have strangers in your pictures :} Really a site to see, so much more than a museum. Relaxing atmosphere, beautiful surroundings. Bring the person you love and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JannieBoo
50,What a Treasure!,"It seems incredible that such a wonderful treasure as this is located conveniently in Malibu, CA. My wife and I often vacation in the LA area and, prior to this most recent trip, looked to see what sights would be worthy a visit. We decided to give the Getty Villa a look. It was a smart decision. Though we were staying in Pasadena, it was a pleasant enough drive to Malibu. As the story goes, Mr. Getty built this villa and the property with instructions that no visitor should need to pay for admission. That is nice but they do charge $15 for parking. I won't split hairs for that nominal cost is certainly great value.Malibu is a wonderful place to have situated the Villa. There are views on the grounds of the ocean. Ocean breezes are frequently present. And you should stay long enough to take in the sunsets.I don't exactly remember the length of our visit but it had to be close to 3 hours. We spent a good deal of time in the Villa itself. The printed guide states that this Villa is inspired by another Villa in Herculaneum. The Villa is a work of art that houses many artifcats collected by Mr. Getty. The variety is such that something will appeal to everyone.Below the Villa is a formal garden with statues, greenery, and walkways. Directly across the entrance of the VIlla is an ampitheater where evening performances are held. Adjacent is a museum store and restaurant. There are other buildings on the property but they're not open to visitors.If you've a free afternoon while in the LA area, dedicate that time to a visit to the Villa. You will not regret it. We loved it and likely will return for another visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fallfan54
40,"Relax, Enjoy the Space and Art","Everything works together here for you to enjoy the art, the scenery, the buildings and the garden. Do take the time to sit in the cafe (very well shaded for the California sun), pretty good food, and take in the view.They have different tours through out the day. The Villa tour is interesting and gives you a overall view of the architectural design of the Villa. I am sorry I missed the garden tour. The tour is first come first serve so it can fill up quickly.The Villa is free but there is charge for parking. You have to print out admission tickets online before entering.After the Villa, then go and enjoy Malibu Beach which is right below it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CDEMOM

50,Fantastic and FREE!,"The Getty Villa is beautiful and full of learning opportunities. You can also enjoy many photo ops as well as the opulent and relaxing vibe. This place is gorgeous.

50,"art ,history and culture in charlie harper country","i was in town visiting my girlfriend Valery (a transplanted Canadian) and we had already seen the Getty museum on my last trip and decided ti visit the Villa which is the actual site of the first Getty museum and now houses the antiquities collection.As we drove up from the Malibu shore and into the parking area we were asked for our reservation ticket which would allow us entry at a specific time. Oops ,who knew? Anyways i was able to talk my way past the two sentry posts and entered the premises.The grounds are fabulous and the museum was built just below Mr Gettys home( he passed on in 1976) which is now used to house the museum offices .The museum is built in the fashion of a villa around a large rectangular pool and garden filled with statues.The exhibit was ""The last days of Pompeii"" and it did not disappoint with no shortage of paintings,sculpture , jewellery and statues. The plaster ""death corpses"" were amazing.There is even a herb garden that is full of enticing herbs like thyme and marjolaineValery and truly enjoyed the respite from the hectic traffic if the metropolisaround us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samsheraton

20,Beautiful but not geared for little children or handicapped,"We recently visited here and I thought it was beautiful but with two little children, it was difficult to manuever and not friendly for them or for my wheelchair-ridden mother. The maps were hard to understand and although the gift shop had items for little ones, they snarled at me for bringing in my two grandchildren to pick their toy. I will gladly take my little sweeties and my money elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GloriaF_11
50,World class museum,I am never sure if I am going to explore the exhibits or take in the ambiance. This is not a place for a quick visit. make sure you explore the gardens and enjoy a glass of wine in the cafe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,Awesome!,"We visited with 2 small children so could not really make the most of it but here are my thoughts:- very accessible (we had no problems getting around with a double stroller)- excellent iPod based Audi tour- amazing items on display- nice cafe- gorgeous herb garden, my daughter loved the fish pondRemember to book your times in advance, they are free, parking is I think $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tilf
50,Beautiful Step Back into Time!,"I spent several hours here simply browsing through the exhibits and displays and enjoying the outside gardens. This is truly a wonderful way to escape the noise of the city. The Pompeii exhibit was absolutely captivating! The process of admitting guests is a staggered one, so there are never too many guests trying to walk through the museum at the same time. You will need tickets/reservations which are at no cost. However, the parking is $15 per vehicle. But, three of us spent a lovely afternoon here for that one low cost. Not much in the city compares to this bargain!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blcwkh

40,"Beautiful spot, art not so great","The Getty Villa, along with the Getty Museum, is one of the best places to take out-of-town visitors.

Access is easy these days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweiserw

50,Getty Villa Views,"The view is one of the best things. The renovations include better parking and facilities, which are very nice. Make sure to have reservations. You will feel as if you are visiting the Mediterranean. The best part is the outdoor spaces with the view. There are a lot of displays and a lot to read. The collection is flawed because some of the best treasures were acquired under dubious circumstances and have been returned. What remains is worth a look, but my advice would be to spend more of your time in the garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madmadeleine
50,Fantastic collection of Roman art and artifacts,"Beautiful grounds with a replica Roman villa built by Paul Getty. The villa itself is not much to speak of but the gardens are beautiful. The collection of Roman art, particularly statues, but also glass work, ceramics etc is outstanding. Staff are all very friendly and informative and there is a good dining room for lunches. The most phenomenal part is that it is free, although there is a charge for parking. Only a short drive north of Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gco21

50,"Beautiful building, gardens, and views","The Getty Villa was very easy to find, off the PAC Highway. Reservations are required and have to be printed out on paper. This was annoying for me as I don't have easy access to a printer and other places let you use your email on your iphone. The Villa is free but requires a $15 fwee to park. Aside from that the villa is gorgeous. Compared to the visit to the Getty Center, this was much more relaxing as it is much smaller. I began with the video, then went on the architecture tour, which also gave background on J Paul and his vision, as well as info on Herculaneum (the site near Pompeii). I was most interested in the tour about Pompeii and selected my day accordingly. I showed up to the tour 20 min early, instead of the recommended 15 min and the tour was already filled. Since this was a special exhibit, and apparently popular, it seems they could run a morning and afternoon one. The audioguide was a good substitute though. I took the garden tour as well. The guide told many mythology tales, explaining statues there. The cafe had very good food with seating in or out. There is a small hands-on room for children. You can do see it in 2 hours or spend 4 with lunch and leisurely walk about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dragginfly2
50,What a joy!,"You MUST have a pre-ordered, timed ticket to get into the gallery. Go online and take care of that, preferably at least 48 hours in advance.It is worth the ""inconvenience"" (the ticket is free, after all!) to see this magnificent structure and the ancient art it contains. We were there for four hours and still felt as if there was more to see. Having timed tickets meant that it wasn't as crowded as some museums become on weekends - we rarely had to wait even ten seconds to get in front of a work that interested us. The curation is fabulous and easy to understand, and the grounds are absolutely impeccable. Next time I'll be sure to get tickets for a play in the ampitheatre as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcello

The collections had no marquis pieces, the walls were painted columns instead of actual columns, the place reminded me of bad Disneyland impression of Italy. I took my Mom who was in from out of town and two local friends and none of us were impressed. My Mom wanted to go because it was high on so many tourist lists but it was sad.

However, when we tried to pick one up at the Getty Villa the ignoramus on the desk would not accept our passports as ID and was dismissive and unhelpful.

50,Lovely!,"The museum location is lovely. The exhibits are interesting. I went on the garden tour and I thoroughly enjoyed it. They have food, however, my hot tip is to bring a picnic lunch.The picnic tables are very peaceful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LincolnInnVT
50,"Awesome artifacts, very classy place",The artifacts and art were stunning and in excellent condition. A very broad collection of artwork. Grounds are amazing - I love it and look forward to returning soon!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShariP467
40,Great free attraction in LA,"If you like art and architecture, you will enjoy a visit to The Getty Villa. Entry is free but there is a $15 parking fee and you have to book a spot online, otherwise I think you will be turned away at the gate. We arrived first thing in the morning so there weren't that many tourists yet, which is great if you want to take pictures without too many people in it. By the time we were finished roughly around before lunchtime, there was a steady stream of people coming in so quite happy that we beat the tourist rush. Good collection of antiques and the gardens are quite lovely. There are also interactive sections for kids so good fun for families as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3ntmonty
50,Ancient history in a scenic location,"My wife, 16 year old son and I toured the Getty Villa in Malibu. It was hot all over southern California, so I was glad to be near some sea breeze. The grounds are magnificent and the Roman and Greek artifacts are the very best. This rivals the Met in NYC.The statue of Lion Attacking Horse had just been installed and was excellent. I can't say enough about how nice this whole Villa is. Even the food on sale was tasty and not too pricy. The Getty Museum on the hilltop by UCLA has a prettier view and more striking architecture , but the Villa has, IMHO, the better collection. I guess that shows my preference for ancient over medieval.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tropicaldiver2001
50,saw a play there,love the setting for plays. it is beautifully arranged and the setting is so wonderful. you can hear everything perfectly and sitting outside on a warm evening enjoying one of the greek classics is as thrilling as it can get! i can't recommend more. the villa itself is also incredible with so many gorgeous pieces of art. go there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janrichgmr
50,HIDDEN GEM,"It's so beautiful out here, the garden and the property. I saw a Toltec exhibit that was pretty cool but the main attraction is the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dufflyn
50,beautiful museum,"hard to get to from the pch going south but well worth it, interesting roman and greek pieces and wonderful garden/pool area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/statement96
50,Do not miss the Getty Villa!,"Seriously this is not to be missed! Get your timed entry ticket in advance (free, but $ 15 parking) - easy to get to in Malibu, this treasure contains an amazing collection and is a joy to visit, from the gardens to the incredible collection. Do not miss this!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IfUSeeK
50,Stunning!!!!!!!,"The revamped villa is a must-see. I had last visited the Villa before the Center was built and was excited that now they had a place where they could concentrate on Greek-Roman and Etruscan Art. We were there from opening to closing and would have stayed longer if they would have let us.Be sure to do the tours, especially the architectural tour and one of the curator tours. They are relatively short, but worth all the time you spend on them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dagda2
50,Worth it just to see the building and gardens,"The Getty Villa is amazing! The building itself is worth the visit. Admission is free, but you will absolutely need to register for tickets for a specific entry time before you get there. You can do this online or by phone. The exhibits of ancient art and artifacts are arranged around themes, such as theatre, animals, sport, etc. so that it's interesting for children as well as adults. The architecture tour (free) was very informative, and there are other free tours and lectures. The gardens/fountains are very beautiful. Definitely worth at least half a day if not more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QBzzz
50,Art Museum,"This is the most extraordinary museum due to the fact that is built to resemble an authentic Italian villa from the days of Pompeii. I went to satisfy an art class requirement, relics from before Christ, large statues found on the sea bed, greek and italian art from the days of Carthage and Rome. Amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobinB365
50,Beautiful venue for ancient art,"$15 parking fee, reservations required for free tickets for visiting the Villa. Gorgeous recreation of an ancient Roman villa. Fabulous views, beautifully maintained and filled with fabulous examples of ancient art, including a genuine Greek bronze sculpture found among the remains of a shipwreck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M0ther_of_5
50,We spent 5 hours here! Beautifully done,"I would highly recommend the Getty Villa to anyone visiting in the area who enjoys beautiful architecture, gardens, a well done and documented museum, or Greek and Roman antiquities. Our family enjoys all of this, so it was a great place for us to visit.Our daughter, who is minoring in Anthropology, noted that the items on display were well documented and thoughtfully arranged. After experiencing the Villa, we were spoiled for other museums on our trip, as this became the quality standard for us.Some pre-planning is required to come and see the Getty Villa, but it is worth it! Before our trip, I went to the Getty website and made a reservation for our family to visit. This is tricky, because of the traffic in this region, and you have to reserve your arrival time. When you are unfamiliar with an area it can be difficult to judge how long it will actually take you to get somewhere. I called them when I realized we would be a bit late and discovered that you are allowed a one hour arrival window on either side of your reservation.Parking for the Villa is in a covered garage, which is up a very steep hill. Parking is $15 and admission is free. They have a cafe with indoor and outdoor seating. Many unusual choice on the menu.There was a noisy school group there during our visit; the children didn't seem very engaged in what was displayed around them, except for the fact that there are many nude statues and etchings on artifacts. Probably not a great place to bring elementary school or younger aged children unless they are truly interested in the history of the regions represented, I believe that most younger children would find the museum boring.We took dozens of photos; this is a photographer's paradise! We spent five hours at the Getty Villa and are so glad we discovered it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/disneygirl62
50,Extraordinary place -- but improve transportation for those lacking cars,"The Getty Villa is one of the most beguiling museums on this continent. The place is modeled after a Roman villa near Vesuvius. It looks completely new -- but Roman villas just constructed would have looked new at the time also! Most importantly, the place is beautifully built. The view out over the landscaped gardens and ponds to the Pacific is breathtaking, the smell of herbs in the garden intoxicating, and a walk around the exterior is a delight.And then there is the interior. The villa has been remodeled to focus on its Roman/Greek art collection, and everything is artfully displayed and labeled to give both the greatest pleasure and education. The visitor is directed to get absorbed in each item, and the collection in itself is fantastic, quite apart from its arrangement by a staff that must be amongst the best in the business.For those coming by car, there is a $15 parking fee and nothing more -- so this is great value.If you want to come by bus, admission is completely free. However, getting to this location by bus can be time-consuming and rather an ordeal unless you are staying in Santa Monica, from which there is direct bus service. At the end of your visit, a villa shuttle van takes a circuitous route, furthermore, actually passing the Sunset/PCH terminal of the No. 2 line but not allowing guests to exit there. This would be a much better place to pick up and drop off visitors, given the higher level of bus service than outside the villa itslef. In addition, a public walkway could be opened from this location to the villa, as the only current walking alternative from the No. 2 line is along PCH, which lacks a sidewalk -- making it necessary to transfer to the infrequent PCH bus for just a 2-minute ride.There are many visitors to LA who do not have cars, rental or otherwise, and my villa shuttle driver told me that on many days no more than five people arrived by bus, indicating that more needs to be done to make the villa accessible to those without cars.Still, this is an absolutely fantastic place so, car or not, everyone visiting LA should make the effort to enjoy it. Absolutely a highlight of Southern California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patisson
40,Great Collection,"I visited there in July of this year. The weather was great. However, you need to reserve for entry. Because of the LA traffic. We were 50 mins late. They give you an one hour grace period. Parking is $15. No other entrance fee. There are a lot of exhibitions about Greek and Roman. The garden was beautiful. Nice place to take picture. You can also see the ocean from the villa. There is a cafe there to have some food. Price is a little pricy. There are also tours for the exhibitions and the garden, but need to line up at the front of the entry. Overall it was a nice place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyglobaltraveler
50,Why go to Europe . . .,when you have the Getty Villa right here in Malibu. What a beautiful place with fabulous antiquities. Nice outdoor cafe where we had coffee. Good paid parking but no entrance fee!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanbeach11
50,Great excursion while visiting Malibu,When you need a break from all the beaches or it is an overcast morning I highly recommend this. Especially if you like antiquities. I am not particularly fond of them but I also was able to enjoy great architecture and gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieW229
30,Museum Morphed into Tourist Trap,"What a pity. In their arrogant, never-ceasing grope for fame (they already have the fortune), the management of The Getty Trust turned a quirky, charming, little museum full of funky treasures into a sideshow designed to suck maximum $$$ out of tourist pockets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RThyme
50,Wonderful!,"Amazing, if you have not seen this place it has to be the best attraction you can visit and its free, I would do this again, its a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigblack416
40,So pretty,A gorgeous setting for such lovely antiquities. Can imagine what this sort of place would have looked like all those years ago in europe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noosadoer
50,Absolutely great experience!,"This is an absolutely magnificent museum. The setting, the collections, excellent tour guides. Should be on the list of 'must see' for anyone visiting the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NLW2644
50,Afternoon @ The Getty Villa,"The Getty Villa is a beautiful property on the coast of Malibu in Southern California. It is fairly easy to get to from PCH, although you can only enter from the south side. The entrance is free to the Villa itself, but there is a $15 charge for parking. It still think it is a great bargain for what's inside. There are so many incredible Greek & Roman pieces of art. The majority of the art was focused on the Greek and Roman Gods. Considering the size of the museum, I only planned an afternoon trip which allowed for a couple of hours to tour. This was not nearly as much time as we needed. For someone who was not incredibly interested in hearing all of the details about the different pieces of art, a couple of hours would be fine. For me, it was not enough time. I will be back for more:) I suggest packing a snack, because the prices from the food cart were high. I guess for free admission to see wonderful artwork, I can't complain. Now I can't wait to see what is at the Getty Center museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angeegirl
40,Traditional museum in a great setting,"The Villa and the Getty Center are as different as chalk and cheese. This collection of Greek and Roman artifacts is housed in a copy of an actual Roman villa, and the free short movie describing how it was designed and built is worth watching. There's also a free tour of the courtyard and garden that gives a nice overview of Roman times in the original villa. Unless you're a real fan of traditional, glass case exhibits, or if you're short on time, I'd recommend only a quick look at the upper floor, which for us very quickly led to 'information overload fatigue'. The cafe and gift shop are pleasant, if pricey, and as with the Getty Center the parking charge (currently $15) is hefty, particularly for singles or couples. Note too that you have to book in advance, as number of visitors per day is limited here. The website makes this easy, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trudyscrumptious_12
40,art with a view,Off the coast of the pacific ocean is a gorgeous villa. If you don't like heights or art then this is not your place. However the statues and some of the history if you take a tour is awesome. Spend hours wondering around . restuarants on the grounds. I personally had a hard time since my cell phone didn't work at the villa. I had to find one spot to talk. OMG I hate when i have no contact with family... but worth the look around,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisek829
50,What a Gem....,"The commitment to the purpose of this museum is admirable in every way. The Collections, Architecture and Gardens are true to its essence of preserving a culture that has long gone but never to be forgotten. The cornerstone to the western civilisation will forever be preserved for as long as the Getty Villa is here to remind us of how great and beautiful the world can be without computers and machineries.The bus ride along the Pacific Highway was a very pleasant way to get to the Villa with a shuttle service at the base to take you to the Entrance to the Museum at the top of the Hill. The best way to enjoy the Villa is to allow enough time to explore the grounds and the gardens after the rooms of Antiquities. The tours are both informative and educational, the cafe serve good,wholesome meals that are reasonably priced. Oh,and what a setting!Oh,what a foresight,Mr.Getty....thank you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mkma
50,We love it here.,We love to take visitors here to enjoy this beautiful museum. Indoor and outdoor beauty everywhere. Great view of the ocean too. Wnjoy a casual seafood lunch nearby before or after!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LosAngelesEveL
40,Beautiful Museum,"Getty villa is a beautiful museum nestled in the hills of Malibu. The original site opened mid 20th century as a site to display John Paul Getty's vast art collection. It was expanded in the late 70's, with a remodel in 2006. Admission is free with advance reservations, parking is $15.The focus is ancient Greek and Roman art. We did the guided architecture tour which was a very informative overview of the villa which is based on an ancient Roman site buried by a volcanic eruption.Definitely worth a visit when traveling to LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scotalot
50,Nice day viewing art,"BEAUTIFUL. Nice art display, statues, herb garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcurly1der
50,Incredible Setting!,"The Villa and the Antiquities it contains are wonderful, there is enough to see for as long as your feet can take it. We ate one of the nicest lunches we had in Califonia at the Villa, the setting is great and so if the food. When you have seen enough antiquites, then the gardens are a wonderful place to stroll, just about wore out my camera taking pictures. It exceeded my expectations. Even the Museum shop is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mitchell57
40,Getty Villa,"a first class experience....plus, there's no charge except for the parking. This is an exceptional venue that overlooks the Pacific Ocean high above the beaches of Malibu. A short drive just north of Los Angeles, this Villa contains many rare antiquities, all framed by the stunning gardens, ponds, and the magnificient buildings. There are a number of guided tours (no charge of course) and one can spend many hours just wandering through the exhibits and gardens. The parking lots are indoors, well maintained, and offer easy access to the Villa itself. This is one destinations you should not miss when visiting southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronearle
50,A bit of Italy in California,"We learned things at the Getty Villa we weren't told in Rome or Greece. Worthwhile visit to see how the affluent Romans lived, and a great antiquities collection. We too both the architecture and garden tours and enjoyed both. There is also the museum to explore, and the exhitbits were very well done. Anticipating returning with a friend who was a classics major. Free, but there is a fee for parking. Well worth it. There is a cafe on site, and when we were there there was also a small sandwich stand with above average sandwiches [some of the same fare as the cafe, just more casual. There are a few tables with umbrellas on the patio]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sometime_Wanderer
50,Art and View Combined,"What a grand experience: history, art, architecture and view all collected in one place. A Roman villa filled with Greek and Roman antiquities. This elegant place is such fun to explore. You need to make reservations for your car. Plan to stay for lunch and stroll the gardens. We happened to be there on a beautiful clear day with ocean breezes flowing through the gardens. Bring your camera and walking shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lulu82143
50,Stunning Views,"For people who are interested in either Gardens, History, and/or Architecture, this is the place for you. The property is well manicured, with flowers and trees that not only take your breath away because of their beauty, but also serve purposes to the original owner due to their philosophical/medicinal properties. The Villa itself is an architectural marvel, using some incredible building materials, and displaying an incredible attention to detail in every nook and crevice. My friend and I participated in the Guided Garden Tour, and learned quite a lot from the guide. A wonderful feature at the Getty Villa is that, when you choose to particpate in a tour, you are given a set of headphones and a receiver. This receiver picks up the microphone unit that the tour guide is speaking into, so that you can be a distance away from the guide, but yet not miss a single word of what he/she is saying. This is wonderful, as it allows the listener to move towards flowers/statuary that catch your eye without feeling like you might miss out on some piece of intersting trivia. Also, there is an on-site cafe that has wonderfully healthy selections for salads, as well as some of the largest burgers I've ever seen. With admission to the Villa being only $15 per car, this is an inexpensive getaway that should not be missed by anyone in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rokclmr
50,Well Thought-Out Art Museum,"Very impressive museum! I've been to numerous museums and archeological sites in England, Greece, and Turkey, but the Getty Villa is by far, the most comprehensive and accessible of them all. I found the Greek statues, filagree jewelry, and blown glass displays especially interesting. We made our reservations the same day, and had no complaints about the parking or ""traffic"" in the GV. All the guards that we asked questions of were helpful and friendly. Beware that the cell phone service and Internet access is very very spotty here. Not sure what that's all about!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnaCasanaSeattle

50,Go!,"Went there to see the Aphrodite & Gods of Love special exhibit. Go before it closes in July. It is a wonderful exhibit. However, the 30 minute special tour for it wasn't worth it. Our tour guide, an archeologist, wasted too much time on her favorite two sculptures and then it was over. The museum is another great place to visit in the LA area along with the Getty Center whatever the special exhibits are. The permanant collections are excellent in their own right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HikerBiker2

50,Trip to Ancient Greece and Rome,"Having studied classical art and architecture, this museum stop was a must. The weekend drive through pch was slightly congested but well worth it. Seated way on top of a hill, you must make an online reservation and present your ticket at the gate, then pay 15 dollars for parking. After parking in a spacious garage, I walked up to the museum entrance and was blown away by the mini reproduction of an ancient Greek Theatre, where events and performances are held. Inside the museum, is a beautiful Roman garden, filled with fountains, a central pool, and Bronze statues. I went inside the museum, and saw ancient Greek potttery, busts of Roman men and women, information about funerary practices, and mosaic and wall paintings. The main exhibition was a stunning Roman marble statue of Aphrodite. Breathtaking. She is truly beautiful up close, and the intricate detail amazing. I was upset they didnt let me capture her essance on my cell phone, as no photos permitted. They should have signs posted about that, as some exhibits you can photograph and others you cant. They dont really make this clear until you are curtly informed about your camera. There are also hands on activities, such as paint your own Greek Vase, which kids and adults can enjoy. Also, they had a Roman fashion show, featuring Roman clothing styles. I missed this one but spoke with models who explain their outfit and role in society. There is a room inside and a Roman lady explaining ancient cosmetics, kids can dress up and have photos taken in Roman garb. What I liked about this museum is hands on activites and you experience a slice of ancient life witbout hoards of tourists at the Parthenon or Colosseum. On the way out, there is a lovely herb garden filled with lavender, lambs ears, and lilly pads. Carpe Diem and go. You will be impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angier287
50,Time travel back to Roman Times!,"Well not really, but you can use your imagination and explore a villa modeled after an actual house buried by Mount Vesuvius. For years this was closed, so my family finally paid a visit in May of 2011. My tweens are interested in Greek and Roman History so they enjoyed the villa as much as the adults. I would add this to my list of things in LA not to be missed. The gardens are beautiful and so are the views, so I would recommend visiting this on a sunny day. Luckily we have lots of sun in Southern California! You do not have to pay to enter the villa but you do need to pay to park. In order to go to the villa you follow this link to pick the date and time for your visit http://tickets.getty.edu/show_events_list.aspWe all enjoyed the Garden docent led tour, next time I would like to take another docent led tour. Unlike other docent led tours these are FREE. Also the tours do not disturb others since the docent speaks into a microphone which go directly to your personal headset which they issue just for the tours. I do remember we had to stand in line before our tour for about 10 minutes but that was fine. We did not eat during our visit but there we noticed people eating at a cafe and a theater area. Some people brought their own food and had a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Apamperedtraveler
50,One of the coolest places I've been,"How great would it have been to be so rich that you could build yourself an ancient Italian Villa on the hill in Malibu primarily to house a small fraction of your art collection? With only a little imagination you can will yourself back to the time of the Caesars by taking a stroll through the Getty Villa. Since it's been restored, the grounds are gorgeous with expansive views of the Pacific. If you have never been here, you are truly missing out on one of the great places to visit in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rsqdvr
50,A not-to-be-missed treasure!,"I first visited the Getty Museum on a rare rainy day, opting to save the Villa for a sunny one. What an excellent decision! The Getty Villa is a true gem and one of the most beautiful places I've visited. The gardens are magnificent, the roman villa is stunning, and the art collection is worthy of several days' reflection. Still, if you have only a few hours, this is worth the drive to Malibu. Be sure to join one of the 30-minute tours (architectural or garden) to get a feel for the place. Then, wander through the galleries at your leisure. There is a cafe for lunch with a hillside view of the Pacific.Parking is $15, but there is no entry fee for the Villa. Food is a bit pricey and the selections are less than what you'll find at the larger Getty Museum in the city, but the food is good. You must have tickets to enter the property; the Getty Villa website has a link to make reservations and print out your free passes. Be sure to print the tickets; they won't take the reservation from your smart phone even though they do send an email confirmation.All of the docents at each of the Getty's venues are gracious, knowledgeable hosts and the collections are stunning. That we should enjoy all this for free is a rare gift, indeed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scout1960
50,ANCIENT ROME LIVES,"On 6/20/2012 I visited the ""Getty Villa"" (I'd been there once before). The ""Getty Villa"" is a re-creation of the Villa dei Papiri, an ancient house in Herculaneum. It was buried by the same volcano, Mount Vesuvius, that covered Pompeii in A.D. 79. It is a perfect setting for the ancient art objects that Getty acquired. As you walk through the ""Getty Villa"" you can easily imagine that you are living back in time to the days of the Roman Empire. They have a 12 minute orientation film (well worth seeing) and the parking is $15.00 (reserve before going) but the entry is free. Guided tours are optional. The gardens are outstanding. Do not leave until you have viewed the Outer Peristyle Garden from the oceanside (this was the grand view from the old entrance). A wonderful place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DwainC
50,It's a retreat out of the big city,"This cozy sized villa beats all those noisy and crowded places around the town. It is just a short drive out of the city. The ancient Greek/Roman art collection is superb. After the $15 entry fee, everything is free: including the fantastic guided tours and the movie.The not-to-be-missed treat is at the cafe. It's like a designer dining at the balcony of the villa museum. The menu and food items are artfully created and gracefully presented with real silverware and white linen napkins.If you are beyond the cattle crows of Disney and Movie Studios, make a get away from it all at the Getty Villa. You can easily spend a whole day here relaxed yet feasted on the art collections here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chuck_1992
30,Disaster in Pompey,"Its a great educational experience but there just were not enough exhibits. The gardens needed more care, the tour guides did not seen interested in what they were doing and ruined the tours by telling everybody they could not take pictures until the tour was ended, well that kind of spoils it don't it? I really was not interested in knowing that the beautiful pool was only 18 inches deep. I guess the whole museum and the artifacts were great in their own way but...boring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Onefather

Beautiful gardens to stroll around as well. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRBrighton
50,Stunning place and free,"One does need to make a reservation and cannot park in the neighborhood, but the small fee to park is well worth it. (Or public transportation, somewhat of a quaint notion in LA). There is a tremendous collection of ancient art and the property is just over the top. If one had all the money in the world and could build anything, this could well be it. Views out to the pacific and the facility is world class. One of my favorite LA places. Seem to recall some quote that Getty could divide his fortune and everyone would get a dime or he could build this spectacular collection and facility. Happily pass my dime for this. Food service is excellent and books in gift shop are hard to pass up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelleCo
50,Best museum in America that's not the Met?,"The Getty Villa has an amazing collection of classical archeology. But so do many museums in America and the world. What makes it so spectacular is the creativity with which the art is displayed -- take a look at the photos here and you'll see what I mean. But you won't quite appreciate the grandeur of the museum (and how much the design enhances one's appreciation of the art) until you go.As far as practical considerations go, it's a bit far from downtown LA (inasmuch, you know, as there is one) and even West Hollywood is a hike with typical L.A. traffic. In addition, though the museum is free, parking is not and I can't imagine many people show up on foot. So make sure to consider that. But a small price to pay for a magnificent museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesK846
50,Travel back in time,"If you are in LA for just a couple of days and you enjoy history I would recommend a visit to the Getty Villa. The Roman villa is so beautiful with it's architecture, gardens and antiquities. The villa is located in a canyon near Malibu and provides a fine view if the ocean. Guided tours are available, but it is fun to just explore in your own. Tickets are necessary but are free. You only have to pay to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happywhalewatcher
50,Beautiful ancient villa and antiquities museum,"The Getty Villa in Malibu is a great place to spend a day. The villa itself is a wonderful object of art, and it is full of beautiful art works from the ancient Greek, Roman and Etruscan civilizations. Free tours are offered of the architecture, gardens, special works of art, etc. A cafe provides good lunch, coffee and snacks. I recommend spending the whole day there, and taking one or more tours to learn about what you are seeing.The villa is a replica of an opulent country villa in Herculaneum, near Pompeii, that was buried in the ash from the explosion of Vesuvius. It is thought that the villa belonged to Julius Caesar's father-in-law. Although the original villa in Herculaneum has been only partially excavated, the floor plan is known, and J. Paul Getty, richest man in the world for many years, used that floor plan to create this replica. The idea of the villa here is that one can get the feel of how it would have been there in the times in which people lived there.Tickets are free, but the parking costs $15 per car. Each visitor needs to have a TIMED ticket. You can go online and print out your tickets. It opens at 10 a.m., seven days a week. I recommend getting there early, so as to have the whole day to enjoy the villa and the beautiful gardens.The marble floors are amazingly beautiful. In one room there is a mosaic floor with more than 4.000 pieces of different-colored marbles from different locations around the world. Still, walking on marble all day long can be a strain on the feet. Wear comfortable walking shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTrails12345
50,Wow! This guy was rich and knew how to spend it,Exceptional reproduction of a Greek/roman villa with incredible artifacts from those days. All presented in a no matter what it costs way. A must see for so many reasons.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericbG4720PM

50,Just up the coast a bit to Heaven!,"If you go North up the coast towards Malibu, you can find the Getty Villa. This is a museum that looks like a traditional Greek or Roman villa from a history book. It has antiquities and gardens and is a wonderful place to spend a couple hours. Entrance is free but parking costs 15$. It is very much worth it. Every time I go here I have a wonderful time! It is even a great place for the entire family, they have a family room, a resturant and places for you to sit and enjoy the art/view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WassmannK
50,"Beautiful, peaceful!","This site is truly amazing. The Villa itself is wonderfully executed and its gardens are extensive and well-done. The docent leading the garden tour was very knowledge which added to our enjoyment. The galleries, while not huge, contain some outstanding pieces of art - with excellent signage.

50,Getty Malibu,"Free to visit, reservations required due to limited parking/location. Beautiful grounds, art and exhibits. Friendly staff. Enjoyed lunch overlooking the ocean and toured at our own pace. Note: If driving a manual transmission have a skilled driver as, even with reservations, the line to get in to the property is long as they check you in and the incline up onto the bluff is steep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irievic

50,A very unique place! Roman serenity.,"After the visit of Getty Center, move to Malibu on another day for a 4/5 hour visit to Getty Villa. Advanced reservation by internet is compulsory. Arrive early in the morning, around 9.30: the site is yours and your pictures will be superb. Limited art exhibits but outstanding quality. You nevertheless will miss the feeling of true Roman antique sites and villas of Pompei or Herculanum. And the site here is a canyon which is quite different from the original sites. But the massive renovation and creative environment is compensating this difference. Here again, try to avoid noisy school groups: go on Saturday or Sunday. Average cafetaria onsite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akhenaton2
30,Interesting to walk around and it's free except for parking,While staying in Malibu we went to check out the Getty Villa. We spent about an hour walking around the museums and gardens. There is a cafe to eat lunch or you can bring your own lunch and eat in picnic area. Get your tickets online before going-they/re free. $15 to park. I only wish the Getty home was part of the attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristaC303
50,Getty Villa,"Worth the trip, you need to make advanced reservations but it keeps crowds from forming. It costs to park but admission is free. It is not a very large museum but the quality of ancient items is excellent. Good interactive areas, beautiful scenery overlooking the pacific ocean, and flows very well. Can easily spend many hours there enjoying the whole experience. Will definitely return in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardrO6631OY
50,Awe inspiring!,"This place is magnificent. The art work, statuary and sculptures are absolutely stunning, and at a no-cost museum, you cannot go wrong. We went as part of a class trip, and we will definitely be going back to spend more time there. Not only is the setting incredibly beautiful, but it is so tranquil that you would never believe that you are that close to Malibu and Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/h2opolodad
50,Time travel without stepping into Europe,Before we entered the property of the Getty Villa there was a sign that said no entrance which meant we had to do a U-turn on 101 and find the proper parking entrance. Once paying the $15 parking fee (but mind you the museum is free) its a breathtaking sight right smack in Malibu.The entrance to the museum is quite modern but once you walk through the doors it's like walking back into time. Coming from me that's a compliment because I've traveled Europe and experienced the real deal.I love how the artifacts are in individual rooms so it's easier to keep track and not overwhelm the senses from trying to figure out what to see first.When you walk outside you're greeted to statues surrounding water and walking further you're looking at a beautifully landscaped oasis. Coming with your significant other would be the ideal since its a nice quiet stroll looking at the beauty and serenity you might miss if living in the busy city. If you're looking for a cheap day time date this is a place I recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/place-name-here
40,Perfect location,"The Getty Trust has done a wonderful job showcasing antiquities from ancient Greece, Egypt and Rome.

50,Visit ancient Rome without leaving the US,"The Getty Villa, on the site of J. Paul Getty's former home in Malibu, is a remarkable experience and it's free! Yes, it's $15 to park your car or a mere pittance to ride the bus over, but admission is free for this wonderful museum bequeathed to the public by Mr. Getty. He was an amazing collector of antiquities and use to open his ranch style home on the hill above three days a week for the public to enjoy his collections. For several years now, they have enjoyed their new setting in a re-created Rome villa so one truly does feel like you've taken a step back in time within feet of the Pacific Coast Highway and very convenient if you are in the LA area. From 6,000 year old goddess figures to lifesize marble statues, jewelry, coins, art and architecture and all arranged by themes. Treat yourself to an afternoon of ancient Roman, Greecian, and Etruscan antiquities. Be sure to go online and get tickets first. Although admission is free, you are required to have a timed ticket, which you can print off at home. Don't miss this priceless collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annhhowell

A 100 or so of great statues, mostly marble, but dozens of metal, as old as 500BC. If you like ancient art, and some ancient gold jewelry ladies, thrown in for fun, you have to go here. The Malibu state park is a few miles North for a nice afternoon on the beach too. Would I go here again? Maybe, if they had some really unique exhibit. Would I recommend it?

It's a nice place to wander around in for an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pjcrockett1

We had to get reservations in advance with certain time (you don't need to do this downtown). Admission was free but we paid $15 to park the car. Totally worth it. The cafe with outdoor seating was also great with fresh and healthy food on the menu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ksquarednyc
50,Authentic Herculaneum Villa in Malibu,"J.Paul Getty built this place to house his growing collection of treasures when the house his wife & son lived in (just behind the museum) was full to bursting. It's a replica of The Villa de Papiri in Herculaneum, which was the home of a wealthy Italian in the seaside resort town of Herculaneum before Mt. Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79. The architecture alone is worth the visit. The gardens are beautiful although the rear garden was closed. The treasures are breathtaking! It was fun to imagine what it's like to be SO RICH that you can buy whatever suits your fancy, whenever you want it. The cafe sells really yummy food, too. This is a good 1/2-day trip. Then take some time to drive PCH & take in the beautiful Pacific.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mauram525
50,Not-To-Be Missed Museum,"This museum is an architectural wonder containing priceless antiquities. The grounds, the building interior, the perfection of this museum and the exhibits inspired us to want to know more about Rome's early history. We took the architectural tour: Excellent tour guide, very knowledgeable, with a great sense of humor. It would be a shame to travel to the area and not experience this amazing place. Don't miss the mummy and the video on how the body is processed for mummification--very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SnmaGal
50,A Must See when in L.A.,"The Getty Villa is on an amazing site on a bluff in Malibu above the Pacific Ocean. The site represents an archeological dig, upon which is perched a replica of an ancient Italian villa. Inside are wonderful antiquities, including decorative arts, paintings and sculptures. Be sure to plan for lunch, as they have a nice menu and lovely outdoor seating. Make a reservation. Admission is free, but there is a charge for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clglenn

Like one other reviewer, my passion is art (Getty Center) more then antiquities, but the Villa has a wonderful collection of unique items, one example, is the jewlery room where you will find cases full of gold and amber along with other semi precious stones. Of course the weather in California (most of the time) is beautiful so enjoy a snack or lunch while here! Remember to get your free tickets online BEFORE you go (or you can't get in) also parking at the Villa is $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAGirl2
50,Impressive,"The Getty Villa was very impressive. We ordered our tickets online, that were free and used my cell phone instead of printing them off. So easy. Parking is $15. They allowed us to park in the garage, closer to the entrance, since we had a 3 yr old that had fallen asleep. Everything is at your fingertips here. They didn't have strollers to rent, they just let us borrow one. Umbrella's are ready and waiting for you. The views, of course, are outstanding of the ocean and the grounds are immaculate. That was all before we got inside. I felt like we were in a museum in Greece with all of the statues, artifacts and displays. The children's room was outstanding and one of the best that we've ever seen. We didn't eat there but the setting was amazing. The herb garden was a nice surprise. The museum staff is great (even gave me a bag to carry my water bottle in so I wouldn't stain the marble floor). The villa is well controlled and not overbooked so it wasn't crowded. A great day at The Getty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fwmag
40,Slow down and smell the centuries,"Friendly staff and a wonderful setting make this place a must for any visit to LALA land. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade ten minutes at the Getty Center for an hour at the Villa, but I am partial to art vs antiquities. If you can appreciate the idea of strolling in an environment where Ceasars strolled, pay for the parking and soak it in. Also a fine gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wdj1066

50,Beautiful & Educational!,"Visited on Sat. April 7, 2012 with daughter who is 1st year high school art teacher, son age 15, & my husband. We had the reserved parking passes & had no trouble finding the entrance. There are large signs close to it, so not easy to miss. Parking is in garages, max. 7' tall. Parking is $15.00 & entrance is free, but unless you come on the bus you need a timed parking reservation to get in. I picked the 10 am time & I am glad I did, it was cooler & fewer people walking around. There is a coffee cart outside the restaurant where you can get some pastries & coffee if you want to & we had both while taking a break. We signed up for the drawing class that lasts an hour where you draw one of the statues. This was a good experience, but my daughter said the instructor didn't give enough instructions & she observed most people not knowing how to use the charcoal & other pencils as they were inexperienced & lost. The instructor talked about the statue & how it was posed, etc. but just didn't focus near enough on using the drawing tools, shading, lighting, etc. After the drawing class we had lunch at the restaurant which has good food. They have a kids menu & we all had the kids spaghetti/meatballs because we didn't want to spend about $11 a person for lunch. The adult food that I saw others eating (like the wraps) looked very good & a trained chef oversees the restaurant. The facility itself was upgraded in 2006 and is wonderful. There is an herb garden you can walk through & there are water features throughout. It is set up to make you feel you are at an Italian villa instead of a museum. The artifacts are arranged by theme so for example one room is called the woman & children's exhibit. All of the ancient statues that had been at the Getty Center Museum were moved to the Villa where they could be displayed properly. They are Greek, Roman & Estruscan. There are also examples of pottery, an ancient glass exhibit that is really wonderful, and many smaller pieces like jewelry, a coin exhibit, etc. We stayed in Westlake Village (near Thousand Oaks on Route 101) at the Residence Inn which was very convenient & has a great free hot buffet breakfast with eggs & sausage. Then we went across the scenic route that leads over the Los Virgines Canyon toward Rte 1 (the coast hwy) & turned left onto Rte 1 & went south maybe 10 min. tops, then a left turn on Sunset (you can't make a U-turn), but turned around on Sunset a block away & then back heading North on Route 1 with the quick right turn into the Getty Villa entrance up the hill to the parking garage. Leaving we headed out South (left turn) & then got on the I-10 West heading out of the area. It was very convenient & staying in Westlake Village the night before was much more reasonable & stress free than staying south / East of the Getty Villa in the more urbanized area. Highly recommend this experience. I also recommend you see the Getty Center, but I would allow one day for each so you aren't too tired from walking & also just being alert to take in everything you are seeing. There is an elevator for wheelchairs & strollers. I do NOT recommend that children under 8 visit the Getty Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MOTHERLOAD

Be sure to take the free tours. It significantly improves the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BradleyBurr
50,Spectacular and opulent look into Patrician Roman life,"The Getty Villa is an outstanding example of a patrician Roman villa from the time of Julius Cesar. In fact, as we learned, it was built as an exact replica of his father-in-laws home near Naples, Italy. The gardens were gorgeous with cypress and olive trees and other plants representative of what would have actually been used at that time and place. The architecture was stunning making use of the colors, tiles, marble and stone which would have been used by the Romans at that time.We took the architectural tour, guided by a very charming and knowledgable docent. We were given headphones to amplify her voice, which was a thoughtful gesture for those harder of hearing, or prone to wander off. She offered details and anecdotes which really helped bring the place to life. It was easy to feel that we were no longer in Malibu, California, but in ancient Italy.The museum housed the amazing collection of J.Paul Getty. It was because of this amassed collection that the villa was built...there was simply too much to display in his ranch [on site, not accessible to public].There is also a lovely cafe with a large outdoor patio area, a picnic area for groups and the like, and ample enclosed parking.The admission is FREE, but you have to book tickets in advance.Try not to miss this attraction, very close to Santa Monica and right off Pacific Coast Highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Debodan
50,"Beautiful setting, beautiful collection housed in a beautiful villa!","You do have to get parking reservations ahead of time, but its well worth the experience. Watch the movie at the beginning, it's just a 10 minute overview of the villa and JP Getty, then rent the i pod tour guide and wander! The garden tour is also nice as well all the guided tours, but with the i pod you can guide yourself and at your own pace.

50,"Fascinating museum, great architecture and beautiful gardens","Many visitors in L.A. visit the majestic Getty Canter, but maybe not so many the Getty Villa, which was there before the Getty Canter was built. The Getty Villa is located along the Pacific Coast Highway, not far from Pacific Palisades, is smaller than the Getty Center but has collections that are just as interesting, such as Roman history, Aztec history and usually also some temporary exhibitions that certainly make it worth while to drive a bit to get to the Getty Villa. Last time there was an interesting Picasso exhibition. The museum has a magnificent patio (oriented towards the Pacific Ocean), which easily can serve as inspiration for garden projects at home. After a visit in the museum we had lunch at the restaurant, enjoying the scenery. For a visit to the Getty Villa, keep in mind that an online reservation for parking is required, and I would suggest doing that at least a day before the planned visit to get a time slot that fits the schedule. There is public transportation to the Getty Villa, but then it takes time to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mietzner
50,Fantastic Museum with Great Gardens,"We loved the Getty Villa. I think the reviewer who compares this unfavourably with 'real"" Roman buildings is missing the point. This was built to house a collection of ancient artefacts. It does that very well and far better than many museums in Greece and Rome. The Getty Villa is an interpretation of what such a grand villa would have looked like prior to the eruption of Vesuvius in the Bay of Naples.The collection here is small enough to keep your attention and the display of ancient glass (a special exhibition) was stunning. So this is where Missoni get their inspiration! It is incredible to think people were making such amazing glass well over 2000 years ago. In addition the cafe is great, the tours informative and friendly, parking was easy to find and the gardens are exquisite. Clearly the Malibu setting helps, but we thought the whole concept glorious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BindiB
50,Another must see in LA,"First, this offers a much different , though equally worthwhile, experience than does a visit to the Getty Center. The grounds, though well landscaped, are less extensive and done to fit the theme of the museum (i.e., Roman gardens). The mansion itself is not open to the general public. The main attraction is the reproduction of a large Roman country villa destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. This provides housing for an extensive collection of ancient art and artifacts. As part of the features, the museum has an area for children of all ages (I had my shadow picture taken in ""full armor"" while dueling with a 6 year old). While I would label this a must see, again, UNLIKE the Getty Center, I would not place it on my must return list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redneckersson5
50,Went for the architecture amazed by the artifacts,Easy to locate with plenty of signage. The architecture of the exterior of the building was amazing as was the marble walls and tiled floors. There were many art students sketching the many busts that were displayed which just added to the experience. The artifacts on exhibit were definately some of the oldest pieces I've ever seen with some dating back to 2000 BC. It was a great experience and the cost of $15 was well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathyC670
30,"Good collection, nice gardens, but too expensive.","Firstly I feel I have to say if you've been anywhere in Europe (especially Greece or Italy) then you may find this a bit of a waste of time. It has a good collection for a US museum but nothing particularly impressive if you've already seen sites in Europe.The gardens are nice, and the herb garden is relaxing to spend a while in, the scents are fantastic.Overall, its an ok way to spend a hour or so, tickets are free but you have to pay $15 to park. With only two of us going it made the ticket price $7.50 each which I felt was overpriced. (I actually find it very annoying they say tickets are free to then charge you to park, especially since walking in is prohibited so you cant park off-site and walk in for free.)Also you have to reserve tickets online before you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA-JH1

50,Absolutely Fabulous!,"This would be at the top of my list of art museums to see in Los Angeles. If you have to choose between the Ghetty Center on the hill in Brentwood or the Ghetty Malibu, choose Malibu. I am a frequent art museum visitor to museums all over the world and I found the Getty's Greek and Roman sculpture collection to be fabulous. The ""Victorious Youth"" has got to be one of the best Greek sculptures anywhere in the world. We spent 6 hours here to take in everything. I wouldn't plan anything less than 2 - 3 hours. The $5 for an iPad self tour is money well spent. We also took the architecture and garden tours which were worthwhile. Remember to visit the Ghetty's website in advance to get free timed museum tickets; you need to pay $15 for parking on arrival. We ate lunch at their restaurant and it was excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JordenN

50,Mini Hearst Castle,"If you like visiting the Hearst Castle, you have to see the Getty Villa. It is a beautiful property, usually very quiet as they limit ticket sales during the day.

If you're into museums and especially ancient greek and roman history, you'll fall in love. I had my first date with my boyfriend here. It was beautiful and allowed us to engage in some great conversation, which is why I think it's a great date spot. The antiquities themselves are amazing and kept so well here. The Getty IS the standard in my opinion when it comes to museums. They have activities for families and adults. The food is average, but about what you would expect from a museum cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelJunkie2579
40,Marvellous Italianate Villa and Antiquities,How John P Getty acquired all these antiquities is amazing and to have many of them on display so that we can gauge how the ancient Romans and Greeks lived provides us with a true insight.The peaceful surroundings and the myriad of fountains and waterfalls give the villa an air of beauty and wonder,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFL2004
50,A 'must see' destination,"J. Paul Getty actually recreated the Villa Papyri, a thriving Roman home of the wealthy father of Julius Caesar's wife, Calpurnia - until it was covered by the ashes of the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius.

40,"Do not try to walk in, or make sure you have a bus ticket with a stamp!","We visited this place in 1984, and again today. The focus of this place is now on antiquities, and there is none of the art I had previously seen. The Villa and the gardens are well maintained, admission is reasonable, and the educational opportunities are multiple. The setting is welcoming.I saw the Villa thru different glasses, today, as I have been to Venice and Pompeii since my last visit. Some artistic license has been taken in the construction of an exact replica of the original villa. Displays include some reproductions of statues.Most of the displays of pottery, glass, and various implements are very well done. Information about the displays is excellent, and the $5 listening devices for the self guided tour are better than any I have previously used. The free tour we took was a good introduction to the gardens, and the listening devices for that tour were outstanding.The attitude of the staff person at the gate was not helpful. When our taxi dropped us off at the main gate, we were told we could not come in walking and we had to leave, even though we had an admission ticket. They would permit us in either with a bus ticket that had been stamped by the bus driver, or we had to drive in. We then flagged down a taxi, and had him drive us in. When we tried to walk out to take the bus, we were then told we had to take a shuttle. out of the complex. There is some bizarre arrangement by which this place will not permit walking guests, and a drive in and out is required for all visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kidssleep

Yesterday was no exception -- it was a delightful afternoon, well worth the drive from Santa Barbara.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AkimboGal

40,If you can't do Italy...,"I had high expectations for this facility. I have visited similar sites throughout Europe. This was So Cal beutiful and had a measure of incredible pieces but overall it seemed a bit shy of spectacular overall. The admissions process and ascent to the grounds is an odd adventure but the facility is gorgeous. The gorunds beyond are interesting but not a part of the Getty Villa tour. The contents of this museum were pretty nice and, as stated previously, there were several larger pieces that were quite breaqth taking. The bronze youth, saved from the ocean floor, is very similar to one I saw in Florence Italy a few years ago and is a real master piece. The jewelery and coin collections are small but very nice. The ambience of the facility when I was there is unmatched. The beautiful fountains, small crowds, warm day....just a magnificent visit. I would loved to have had a docent around but there did not seem to be anyone I saw leading any tours. That would have added immensely to this grand facility. If you enjoy art and beauty, history and grace, then you really should pay a visit to this free museum. Of course free museum doesn't mean you get to park for free. That was $15!! But all in all I look forward to doing it again sometime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oleoiam

There is also a small cafe for either lunch or just a coffee break.Really liked the fact that they monitor the number of people that in the museum at any given time. There is no entrance fee, they just require you to pre-book online. Helped make the time there a lot more relaxing and an easier viewing experience.Be sure and bring a camera as the views in the gardens are gorgeous, but the views of the ocean are even better.

Both are enjoyable art museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtogo09
50,"""Modern Antiquity"" - not an oxymoron","We were staying in Malibu and decided to go to the Getty Villa because it was there. We were able to get tickets 4 days later. It is obvious from many reviews that expectations go a long way in your enjoyment of the Getty Villa. It is an amazing building, built as a museum, to specifically display antiquities. We had the good fortune to go while they had their ""Modern Antiquity"" art show (ends Jan 16, 2012). That show alone was worth the price of admission (ok, admission is free, but I would have paid to go... and $15 for parking was cheap!). They did an amazing job showing how modern artists use ""the classics"" and antiquities for inspiration. It truly was ""Modern Antiquity."" The display of glass was also interesting. The statues and the presentation was fabulous throughout the museum. I was surprised they allow non-flash photography throughout most the museum and my photos turned out great.My 12 year old was interested for about two hours (having just learned Greek Mythology last year). My 16 year old was interested for about 10 minutes and mostly enjoyed the cafe. My husband reads every plaque, so we split up. Overall we spent about three hours there. Our tickets were for 1:30 and after 3:00 (when the cafe closed) people started to leave. At 4:00 it was practically empty and I went back to several areas that had been crowded before including the outside fountain/pool and the art exhibit. I would highly recommend the Getty Villa IF the subject matter sounds interesting to you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ro11WithIt
50,Beautiful and historic,"This was a beautiful, free full day. Beautiful scenery, ancient Roman and Greek artifacts. Marble walkways and columns. Fountains, statues, gardens. A must see.

50,Beautiful setting...,"The Getty Villa is absolutely amazing. If Greek, Roman or Etruscan art or history is your thing, or even art in general, you will LOVE the Getty Villa. Its hard to write a review that will do the Villa justice. The Villa is an exact replica or a villa excavated not so long ago that was covered when Mount Vesuvius went off. Yes, that is the same Volcano that covered Pompeii. The villa is absolutely huge and beautiful, and filled with art from the time period. The docents do a wonderful job, and the entire property is beautiful. The recreation of the setting is so exact they have even matched the gardens to the one that the villa had since the ash preserved all of the plants for identification purposes. If you are anywhere near Malibu this is a must see! There is no fee to visit the Villa, but you must reserve a ticket online, and pay $15 to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CocoM_12
50,The Ancient World in Malibu,"We booked from the UK as timed car park entry needed and we wanted to be sure to get there this time. The online booking didn't work for us, so rang instead - very helpful and got the reference number required.It is very well done. The Landsdowne Herakles alone is worth going for - but the collection here is so good - most pieces on display are in almost perfect condition. There are some excellent infomation boards, for example, the Deeds of Theseus alongside the Labours of Herakles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hampshire123

A visit well worth waiting for. The glassware artifacts are the best we have seen for the periods covered, the gold bracelets and necklaces were unbelievable - and the Picasso's - well they left me speechless. Such a wonderful collection - not only for the Greek and Roman scolar but also for the casual visitor. The Villa is easy to get to by public transport - the LA bus drivers are wonderfully helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeE0
50,A Very Special Place,"Located in the hills overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Mr. Getty certainly knew where to have his collections of Greek and Roman antiquities!As a gardener, I was delighted to see the wonderful herb garden, the unusual trees and the unique outer peristyle.

50,Intimate Museum ..Relive Ancient Pompeii,"This is one of my favorite museums: I try to go every time I am in LA. The architecture is exquisite and is worth seeing alone. I want to live in Italy in a miniature version of this villa! It is hard to believe that Getty commissioned and built the whole thing from Europe before the days of faxes and internet. He actually died before he visited the finished product !As the works are laid out around a peristyle, one does not get museum burnout so quickly. Be sure to order your parking ticket in advance if you are going around a Holiday, as parking will be sold out. The museum is free, but you have to pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bonne306

30,Certainly worth a visit but not a top attraction for Los Angeles area,"If you are on an extended visit to Los Angeles, you might head out to the Getty Villa. The property is perched atop a hill with beautiful views of the Pacific. If you are interested in Roman art and architecture (or have a child taking Latin in school), the Getty Villa will certainly be of interest. I do not suggest travel to the Getty Villa via public transportation. While bus service is available, it is much better to drive your own vehicle. (There is a parking fee but no admission fee.)

Admission to the Villa is Free, but you need to go online to secure an admission. However, they 'get' you by making you pay $15 for parking. In SoCal! Hello.The exhibits are obviously not extensive and doesn't have the depth of the Getty Center or more established Met , but it's interesting to see JP Getty's personal art collection- yes, his personal art collection. hello.There're Roman and Greek vases, statues, carvings from 1000 BC! SheeshBut the main draw here is undoubtedly the property itself. There's a small but interesting auditorium leading into the museum, which i'm sure is used for private and media events and summer plays.The pool and fountains are gorgeous and are great to hang out (there're benches)It's worth just going to check out the premises and gardens and an opportunity to drive to Malibu.Great date place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jocelynlee

They do have a few good ancient antiquities, among them the Victorious Youth bronze, of which there are only about a half dozen originals in existence.However the grounds and building are remarkable.

Enjoy the scenery along the way too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinern
40,"Lovely setting, well laid out exhibition space for Greek, Roman, and Etruscan Art Art","The Getty Villa is a beautiful place to see ancient Greek and Roman material. The building is a replica of an ancient Roman country house, on the slopes of Vesuvius outside of Herculenium. The setting is gorgeous, and there is some great art here if you like Antiquities. They had a special exhibition called ""Modern Antiquity"" that was really fabulous. Modern painters and sculptors that used classical scenes or setting in their art. The modern pieces were displayed with ancient pieces, and the effect was really great. I enjoyed my time there and would go back if I was in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cds_SanFrancisco
50,"Wonderful architecture, ocean views, outdoor spaces - can't wait to go back!","The Getty Villa is well worth a trip to Malibu for the whole family. The architecture, sculpture, gardens appealed to the parents and grandparents. The six-year-old liked the family room and the outdoor cafe. The ten-year-old, who is taking Latin in school, gained quite a bit from the architectural tour. He was also inspired to buy a how-to-draw book in the excellent book store. This Getty is so much more intimate than the Getty Center. Small display rooms have excellent signage. Particularly nice on a sunny day for the gardens and ocean views.

We only drove one car, but the very rude staff insisted that we must pay to park two cars, because we came back, all 4 of us in a different car! We refused, and were denied entry! We left the property, and I called the Getty Villa to complain,a woman I spoke with said she was a supervisor, and would call me back, but she did not. I am absolutely appalled by the outrageous demands by the parking staff, I think the Getty Villa needs better supervision,so guests aren't being robbed!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellel713
50,Most beautiful museum in the world,"The location, among the cypresses on a hill overlooking the Pacific, added to the exquisite architecture of the villa itself, makes this museum/gallery/theatre something truly special. To me it is simply the most beautiful museum in the world. The building is perhaps the highlight but some of the Greek and Roman contents are priceless and stunning, even if some exhibits look a little over-restored. Worth a visit just for the 20th century exhibits with a classical theme - Picasso, de Chirico, Leger etc. Worth an inter-continental journey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NiceMartin

It was a little awkward to make reservations- I had to call, only to be told to send an e-mail; then our names weren't on the list! But, they went & got the fellow who made the reservations & he remembered my name so it was okay in the end. The cost for the tea is $36 per person, which may seem a bit much considering that it isn't a full meal- but you won't go away hungry! We had a very nice, abundant lunch with constant warm-ups on the tea, followed by a culinary garden tour with one of the docents.

If you are a lover of Roman architecture, decorative arts, delightful gardens and water features, wine and cheese, this is a must-see. The Villa is entirely different to the Getty Center. It's grounds have space for the Villa, an outdoor amphitheater for live performances, gardens as well as a patio for food and drink.

50,One of the spots to visit in LA,The Getty Villa is one of the most beautiful spots to check out in Malibu. The museum itself is very large and offers a wide variety of paintings and sculptures from around the globe. The reflection pond is incredible and will also offer you a chance to see a view of the ocean. Make sure to reserve your free ticket on the Getty website and be prepared for the $15.00 parking fee per car (well worth it). Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcasillas623

We were staying in Santa Monica and caught the local bus there and back . The bus driver will show you where to get off. The place is set up on a hill with great seaviews. We took the architecture tour which was very informative, then took lunch in the cafe. Each day they feature an item in the museum and conduct a talk around it. This tim eit was about a mummy.

50,Gorgeous Villa of Art,"A relative mentioned the Getty Villa as a great place to visit as we were planning our drive along the coast in Malibu. I am so glad that she mentioned this beautiful villa with lovely gardens! Be sure to order tickets online because the admission is free. You will have to show confirmation of booking online at the entrance gate. I was not able to print out the confirmation due to computer trouble but I had the confirmation number which I was able to give at the gate. There’s a fee of $15 to park your car.As soon as you get in, see what tours are available. We signed up for a tour which was a discussion for an art piece displayed in the second floor. It was led by an art historian and who guided the group to the art display, a sarcophagus panel depicting a story from Greek mythology. He did an excellent job of lecturing the history and story of the sarcophagus panel. Also, he engaged in conversation with the group and answered questions. It lasted at most 20 minutes. There were tours for the villa and gardens but we just missed the time for it. I noticed for that tour, the group had listening devices to hear the guide as these groups are much larger. Also, there was a mini movie theater showing a short film on Mr. Getty. We enjoyed our visit to Getty Villa. Go early to beat the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jb645
50,"Excellent-A unique experience-quite different from other ""museums""","This is a museum unlike any other. It is a reproduction of a Roman villa but based on historical fact and it does not pretend to be what it is not. Everything is done as a accurately as possible but accommodates the modern day visitor. In addition to the villa itself the ancient works of art are displayed in a superbly accessible way with information points so that you may study things at your ease and make your choice as to what you wish to see. We were not visiting with any children but rooms are set aside to engage children in the whole process and again, this has been thoughtfully set out. So don't worry if you have young children they will enjoy it just as much. As others have commented there is no entrance charge but it is necessary to book in advance on the Internet. However, do not worry if you cannot print off the tickets because if you have an iPhone you can just save the tickets on screen and show the entrance staff your iPhone on arrival. If you arrive by car there is a $15 charge. However, once you are there there are a whole host of things to do. Either you can take yourself around the villa and the exhibits or alternatively you can go on various tours. There is no need to book these in advance and you can go on as many as you like. The groups are not large and some of the guides use microphone headphones which are also provided to visitors and in consequence everything is heard very clearly. We went on two tours. The first was with one of the historian tour guides took us to see four of her favourite exhibits. All the tour guides are experienced scholars/knowledgeable volunteers. The exhibits we saw were were well chosen and varied and it stimulated a great deal of discussion amongst the group in a very casual, informal but interesting way. There is nothing stuffy or overly highbrow about the tours. The second was the architectural tour, which was different because the guide took us round the villa and essentially explained the way in which life had been carried on in the villa and the way in which that it influenced the architecture. This is a very welcoming museum and there are certainly nothing stuffy about it. The setting of the buildings into the hillside is quite spectacular. It is a must see. You can spend as little or as much time there as you like. There are restaurant and other eating facilities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IANandARI
40,Wonderful Gem Tucked Away in Malibu,"We visited The Getty Villa after visiting the Getty Center on our last trip to the Los Angeles area. The Center was a highlight of our previous trip - so we had to make sure to check out The Villa while in the area again.Same general rules apply - free admission but costs $15 to park. However, the Villa is smaller so reservations are required for entry. We arrived early in the morning and there was not very much of a crowd. My advice would be to make a reservation for as soon as the place opens - you get the place to yourself for most of the time! Lovely grounds and plenty of exhibits to explore. Our favorite pice was the Victorious Youth - check it out!We really enjoyed spending our morning here and would recommend to anyone thinking of going here - it was once again a highlight of our trip. When comparing it to the Center, I struggle to say which is better because they are so different. So I say you must go see both.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JTF_1977
50,Stunning - takes you back in time,"I prefer the Getty Villa to the main Getty museum (though both are amazing) - but then again, I am especially fond of the Roman and Grecian era. The Roman-inspired gardens and architecture made me feel like I was in another time and place, and the antiquities and exhibitions are fascinating - a great collection. The location along the Pacific Coast Highway is a destination in and of itself - breathe in the sea air and enjoy the treasures, sights, and atmosphere of the Villa. Tickets for admission are free, but you have to call or book online in advance - and you have to pay for parking unless you go after 5:00. A must for anybody who appreciates art, beauty, and history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebelbelle14

50,Amazing historical treasures plus the villa itself is a masterpiece,"The villa is JP Getty's reproduction of one excavated in Herculaneum that was destroyed in AD79 by Vesuvius at the same time as Pompeii. The museum contains ancient treasures from around the world collected by Getty and others. Lots from the Roman era. Also includes Minoan, Egyptian and other very early items. All displayed in a beautiful setting. Free, but $15 for parking - and you must obtain tickets online and bring them with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/floridada
50,What more I need to say......,"Gorgeous museum with excellent location & view.it is a must go if you are traveling to L.A. (U.S.) or even if you are living within the states.Come here on a weekend or during the week, it will for sure MAKE YOUR DAY!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kitty-hello
50,Ancient treasures revealed for us modern folk,"J. Paul Getty's inspiration to share his collection of antiquities in a replica of first -century Roman country house was brilliant. The villa itself is magnificent, the materials used are only the best in the world. His collections of sculptures and vessels rivals what I've seen in Turkey, Italy and Greece. The glass and jewelry treasures are some of the most unique I've ever seen. It was truly a gift to be able to see the craftsmanship of these pieces. The detail mind boggling for ancient techniques.I highly recommend arriving at 10 am when the villa opens to the public. Allow plenty of time, we spent 4 hours at leisurely pace. You may want to allow time to soak up the ambiance in the multiple gardens, enjoying the water features and landscaping.Reservations are required, admission free, but $15 parking fee. We began by wandering on our own, which is fine, but took advantage of the docent led tours. We took two of the tours ( garden and architecture) each about 40 minutes long. I learned some things I would have missed on my own. Head sets are provided free, simply a way to ear your docent. Photography allowed indoors, but no flash.What was unexpected was the incorporation of modern architecture housing the restaurant, theater, tour staging area, and restroom. After the architecture tour I had a great appreciation for Getty's vision into creating the Villa experience for future generations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattiw60
50,Thought we'd spend an hour or two - they (gently) kicked us out at closing time!,"Wow! What a surprise this museum was! I never thought I'd like antiquities, but somehow in this setting they come alive. It is such a beautiful spot and such a beautiful building. Enchanting from the moment you first start up the steep stone driveway which brings you to the parking garage. (No entrance fee to the museum, $15.00 parking fee. Well worth the cost.)In order to control the number of guests on the property at any one time, you must obtain timed tickets online for entrance onto the property. I obtained mine a week ahead, but understand tickets are often available on the day of admission. Also, I had no use of a printer, so just gave the emailed reservation number, which was just fine with the guard at the entrance.My friend and I took the free Architectural Tour, which was informative as to both the museum building itself and the antiquities within.I will not attempt to review the collection - suffice to say it is extensive and all encompassing. For a bit of background on antiquities collecting, go online and search out the history of this museum's collections and the international lawsuit against a former director of the Getty Villa. The intrigue involved is fascinating.There is a lovely cafe on the premises with various foods and wine by the glass available. In addition there is a smoking area with benches near one of the outdoor gardens.In all, a lovely place to spend the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BellaofPgh
50,Gorgeous!,"Wow, the renovations are amazing! The villa was closed for 9 years and I missed it when I lived in LA. It's free, but parking is $15. Not really fun for kids, but the architecture is awesome. Food is good too, with beer & wine. Closed on Tues and you need reservations to get in (but we caught it on a slow Monday so we got in without them.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ohcarie
50,"A beautiful way to spend a day ""out of town"" while in Los Angeles","I'll leave comenntary about the collections to others.If you a looking to get outside on a beautiful day and want a one of a kind experience, this fits the bill. Every part of the experience has been beautifully designed, the only caveat might be for those with disabilities, as the entire site is a small canyon. The site is completely accessible however.Take both the guided garden and architecture tours. They are short and compliment each other well. We found the collections more interesting after understanding the context provided by the docents on the tours. The 12 minute historical film is also very helpful.There is a grassy picnic area, but we found the cheese plate at the cafe to be an excellent shared lunch. And the quality was much better than the average museum cafe.If you have half a day and can get to the location (the FAQ on the web site is excellent for details) you should give this serious consideration.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManhattanTripper
50,Get Your Greek On with Live Performances at the Getty Villa Amphitheatre,"Every Sept, for 3 weekends only (Th,Fri, Sat PM's) you can enjoy the rare opportunity to see a classic Greek play performed under the stars by a talented cast in a beautiful replica Greco-Roman amphitheatre for less than $50. Over the past few years I've seen excellent productions of Sophocles' AGAMEMNON (with Tyne Daly), Aristophanes' PEACE, and now the current production, a newly-adapted version of TROJAN WOMEN.Comfy cushions are provided and you can order dinner boxes in advance or bring your own food and drink. It can get a bit brisk so be sure to dress in layers and bring a warm throw. General Admittance Tickets usually go on sale online at theGetty Center/Villa website in July. Parking is free/included with your theatre ticket and, unlike daytime admittance to the villa, a separate reservation is not required. Shows on Fri and Sat start at 8pm but generally you won't be allowed to enter the grounds until 7 (unless you book the pricey ""gourmet"" dinner). I do recommend getting there early for the best selection of seats though all of them have excellent sightlines and acoustics. If you want to visit the villa earlier in the day you WILL need a timed reservation AND it WILL cost you $15 PER CAR to park. You will also HAVE to leave WHEN THE MUSEUM CLOSES AT 5pm and come back at 7PM for the play.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zildana
40,Beautiful!,"My family and I spent the afternoon here and thoroughly enjoyed it. There is no fee for this attraction other than $15 for parking but you must print your tickets off before arrival. The grounds are just beautiful with views of the ocean and are meticulously maintained. My children enjoyed the scavenger hunt through the various rooms of antiquities which kept them occupied. There is quite a lot to see here but the museum was not at all busy, making for a most informative and relaxing day. There is also a restaurant/cafe which served lovely food and had nice shade from the sun. Overall, a pleasant experience which we would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gottogonow34
40,lovely art museum,architecturally beautiful and collection is wonderful. Take both tours which are free. Great views of the Pacific Ocean. Only accessible from the north bound lanes of PCH.Reservations for parking needed but we got there earlier and there was no problem.Fee for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deedee1951
50,Beautiful objects in an amazing setting,"Too many museums offer beautiful objects without helping you understand their context, purpose, meaning - without helping you really appreciate them. The Getty Villa does it all right. They place these amazing objects within a variety of contexts and provide a wealth of information on history and cultures, and how art and utilitarian objects evolved.They also do a great job showing things in multiple ways. In one room you might see a bust or sculpture described in terms of how portraiture was done, in another room one illustrating ritual sculpture or some other category. If you really want to *learn* something from a museum, instead of just walking down a row of displays looking at them purely as aesthetic objects, this is the way to go.If you have time, take advantage of the 1-hour architecture and garden tours, for much the same reason. They're pretty gardens and buildings, but the docents' descriptions help you really appreciate them. Knowing why a specific plant would be there makes it so much richer.Other reviews have great logistical information, but I was able to call and get a same-day reservation even when I couldn't get them online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollykmarie
40,Relaxing and informative,"In contrast to the large, modern and more comprehensive Getty Center in Brentwood, this museum-- used as the principal museum before the Center was built-- is almost cozy, and has the look of a Roman villa, with gardens. Rather than sweeping views of the L.A. Basin and San Gabriel Mountains, this facility close-in views of coastal hillsides (Malibu Beach, not seen from the villa, is just outside the main gate).There are a couple of more modern buildings used for presentations, gift shop, cafe (limited selections and not cheap, but not bad), etc. As with the Center, entrance is free though parking is $15. For the Villa, however, you are asked to get a time-stamped entrance ticket online (free). We arrived early and had no trouble entering. The Center has art from several areas and eras, but the Villa concentrates on Greek, Etruscan and Roman art and artifacts. There are free guided tours of both the gardens and buildings, though you can go through either one on your own. There are also occasional special presentations, such as glass-making.The Villa is a bit more difficult than the Center to get to by public transportation, but it can be done. We drove, and spent 3-4 hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sutter

It has an amazing architecture, I loved the combination between materials, it is very original.The element water gives a sensation of tranquility!I watched a short documentary about Mr. Getty and the Villa construction that I strongly recommend to understand all the concept and history of this place.The collections are very interesting, it has beautiful pieces of art.The plants in the gardens are also gorgeous, specially the water lilis",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenaGuerra
50,Must see - fantastic place,"well, not enough words to describe The Getty Villa, must see - one of the best attractions in LA area. Great exibits, faboulous gardens, great views ....... Check their site for parking reservation, print the reservation and take it with you, parking is available for $ 15 fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mtcp
50,"A total gem: the antiquities, the villa, the gardens","Do not confuse this with the Getty Museum. This is a replica of an Italian villa that was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE. Getty had the blueprints and reproduced it to house his wonderful collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan art. The docent-led tours are excellent and use state-of-the-art headphones. On the day I was there, one tour was about the gardens, one about the architecture and one featured the collection highlights. The entire effect is absolutely gorgeous and, at the same time, calm. There is a lovely cafe on the premises for lunch or snacks. The timed tickets are free, but parking is $15. Everyone who works there is professional and courteous. Young children might not enjoy this, but older ones will. It is a manageable size for a lovely time. You don't want to get there too late in the afternoon, as you will not have enough time to take it all in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelinerose5
50,Just Gorgeous!,I do think if you have time to go to Malibu than a trip to Getty Villa would be well worth your time. It's just reopened after quite a few years of it being closed for refurbishment. The redesign has turned out beautifully. Make sure to take a tour of the facilities and garden. I actually found the collection lovely and preferable to the collection at the Getty Center. The collection features antiquities and items from ancient Rome and Greece.Make sure you make a reservation for parking online. You cannot just drive up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mybincs
30,Great If You Are Into Arts & Museums,"If you are a student of the arts, or if your interest is into museum collections, this is the place for you. Great exhibit and presentations of antiquities, as well as very elegant architecture. My overall impression of the place is more of a presentation of pieces of history and of the priceless arts for artists and enthusiasts. There is no fee for the place but you need to pay for the parking and reserve online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joglen10
50,Getty Villa A True Gem,"A visit to the Getty Villa in Malibu is a fabulous way to spend a day in Southern California. Simply go on line and make your free reservation for the time slot you want to fill. There is a $15 fee for parking but it is very much worth it. The location is breathtaking, nestled in the hills of Malibu. You enter another world as you drive off the busy highway into Getty's world. Greek and Roman treasures deck the opulent halls. The buildings, grounds, marble sculptures, archaic jewelry and coins will take your breath away. There is something for all ages. The family 'hands on' room is a delightful attraction for children and adults the same. Do yourself a favor and visit the Getty Malibu, you will make great memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenae7
50,A must see for museum lovers.,"If you are in the Santa Monica/Malibu area and need a break from star gazing and the beaches, then head over to the Getty Villa. First, make sure you get on the their website and book a time for yourself. The admission is free, but without a reservation you will not be allowed in. Parking was $15 for the three of us.-- You can spend either an hour or half a day at this wonderful museum. The grounds are a work of art, and the exhibits are limited(compared to many of the ""major"" museums) but refined and exquisite. The staff was perhaps the most helpful and courteous of any museum I have ever been to. And if you have youngsters, the museum also goes out of its way to provide them with pamphlets to spark their interest in art, and even has a special room with interactive exhibits for the kids. The Getty Villa should be on the must see list for tourists and those who live in the LA area. Bring the camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronther
50,Treasure in Malibu!,"What a beautiful place with a fantastic collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan relics!!! My 10 year old daughter and I spent several hours there and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was concerned she wouldn't be as entertained as I was, but she enjoyed it as much as I did. It is a great place for kids as they have a room just for them. We didn't do any of the tours because we didn't have time, but we will come back when we have more time and do the tours. You can easily spend an entire day here.We had lunch at the cafe. It was okay. A bit pricey but fine.There were 3 different scavenger hunts for the kids that were easy to find but very educational.I highly recommend the Getty Villa! Even if you aren't interested in the relics, it is just a beautiful place to visit...and it's free!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spendacone
50,"A unique, beautiful, elegant, stimulating museum that's architecturally stunning!","My wife and I visited the Getty Villa on Friday 7/1 as part of our week-long trip from Los Angeles to the Bay area. We had long wanted to visit but had never before taken the time. What a treat!Although the Getty charges only for parking, make sure you make reservations in advance (for arrival during a specific time slot) so that the timing of your visit will fit your schedule. The museum is rightfully very popular.Everything about the museum is stunning, starting with the drive up the hill to the parking. Architecturally, the museum was inspired by a palatial Roman home buried under volcanic ash.We rented iPhones with an audio/photo tour that enhanced our experience and would strongly recommend them. We also joined a no-charge docent tour when we first arrived that gave us an overview of the architecture - again, highly recommended. You may want to consider more than one of the docent tours, including the gardens. And the brief film about the creation of the museum is a ""must-see.""The museum was closed for a number of years to remodel the rooms and the exhibits. The results are outstanding. The rooms now group art treasures with an ""affinity"" that goes a long way in helping explain aspects of ancient Greek and Roman culture.Leave at least 4-6 hours to stroll thru most of the two floors of the museum and the surrounding gardens. You'd need even more time to take it all in! This is a unique, beautiful, elegant, stimulating museum that is not at all stodgy or boring. It's provocative, creating some historical context for our lives today.The cafe on site provides serviceable lunches and a welcome break from all the walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RalphSchmitt
20,Over-rated,"We were looking forward to spending a day in Malibu and was told to visit the Getty Villa. Been hearing and reading about it for a while so we were anxious to see it. The grounds were beautiful but the exhibits were not. The staff there were so rude and uptight. From the entrance to the staff at the children's or family zone where children can draw and experience art through their eyes and imagination. Horrible and rude people, shocked to find them so unhelpful and defensive, they should learn to smile and if they don't like working there, then they should leave. I have not been so upset for a while and I find californians to be warm and friendly until I was at the Getty Villa. Will not visit again!!!!!!!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daima1907

50,The Villa is NOT just a 'bunch of pottery and broken Greek art.',"WOW. I read a previous review and was blown away and how much they had missed the point of the Getty Villa. I suppose you cant expect much from a reviewer who visited the Getty Villa AND Universal Studios during the same vacation, yikes.The Getty Villa is NOT just a bunch of crappy Greek art and broken pottery. This museum, dedicated to ancient art, is built as a replica of the Villa of the Papyri and is located in beautiful Malibu, CA. The art comes from the Etruscans, Greeks, Romans, Egyptians and others. It contains pottery, busts, sculptures in bronze, marble and terracotta, coins, jewelry, sarcophogi, frescos, mosaics and items from Graeco-Roman Egypt to name a few. It has very pretty water features, an edible garden, a great gift shop and is a TREASURE of southern California.Like with any museum, if you have little background in the art you are going to see you will not enjoy it as much. The architecture of the Getty itself is worth reading about and worth seeing. Come to the Villa with a full stomach, the cart food is yucky and pricey. Also, most likely your cell phone will NOT get reception once you are parked so make all your phone calls before you get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catsrgods
50,Hidden Treasure - Need Reservations so Plan Ahead - Don't Miss It!,"This was great fun - reservations are required but are free - parking is $15 cash.There is a nice cafe with outdoor dining and a number of free tours - guided tours with headsets and iPods are $5. We took one tour of the ""architecture"" and were guided amplifiers to wear and the guide used a headset - that was great as you could hear everything.The place is amazing - mostly classic treasures (think Egypt, Rome, Greece) - wonderful gardens and ocean views. We did not see it all and we spent about 4 hours there. The tickets are for a specific time but you can go early and stay as long as you would like",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bensus
50,A wonderful experience,"You need to go online to reserve a time slot, but admission is free and parking is $15. The entrance driveway has a section of rough paving stones to get visitors into the mood of the Roman era. From the parking garage, the visitor walks uphill to an elevator or steps, then to an outside entry “room.” It’s supposed to seem that the levels are the levels of an archeological dig.The Getty Villa and the Getty Center in LA are quite visitor-friendly. Free admission, bins of umbrellas, good information flyers, and numerous, welcoming staff all add up to a first-class visit. At the check-in area, we got maps and a list of the talks and tours for the day. The only short-coming is one that almost all US museums share – all the signs were only in English. There were a number of French visitors during our visit, and they didn’t have French audio guides or even printed translations with them, so I assume they weren't available.We arrived at 9 am, an hour before it officially opened, but we were admitted and had the gardens to ourselves for an enchanted hour. The villa is loosely modeled on the Villa dei Papiri in Herculaneum and on other villas in Pompeii. The outer peristyle has a painted colonnade, pool, gardens, and copies of sculpture found in Pompeii. The reproduction sculptures are all painted black so it is clear they aren’t originals.I especially enjoyed the talk about the museum’s kouros sculpture. There are only eleven complete kouri in the world, and the Getty’s may or may not be number twelve. The curator talked about how it came into the museum’s possession, the scientific and art history investigations of the piece, and the elements that make its authenticity suspect. How different for a museum to acknowledge that an important piece in its collection is uncertain!We have seen the ruins and excavations of Roman villas, but we enjoyed the sense of being in a villa in its prime. The collection has some nice Greek, Roman, and Egyptian pieces, but my favorite room was the Cycladic sculpture room. The sculptures have such simple, clean lines they could have been done by Brancusi four millennia later.As at the Getty Center, the children’s space had attractive and fun activities and exhibits. Here there were ""Greek vases"" for them to draw on. A backlit screen and props of helmets, shields and swords was set up so that the children’s shadows looked like vase drawings.The bookstore had very nice books and gifts in a wide range of prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizbuth
30,Expecting more than seeing alot of busts and stirring jars,"My husband and I came here today December 30 for vacation, and was expecting more than just a bunch of Greek busts and broken statues and pottery. A lot of this stuff, just replicated itself when you went to the next room display. The mosaic art was interesting, and reading some of the history. After a while, it seemed like you seen one bust, or stirring jar, you seen them all. I wanted more variety than I was seeing. Perhaps someone who is passionate in this sort of thing may get more appreciation from this. Reservations is required. Although admission is free, parking is $15.00. It still was busy, but nothing like that awful Universal Studio experience where we literally could not move though the crowd, although in some spots, children were standing in your way, could not get to certain displays. I would only recommend this for people who are really into the Greek mythology stuff and the history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcbauman
50,Don't leave the LA area without a visit here,"We came to the Villa on the recommendation of a friend who lives in west LA. Honestly, we had low expectations, assuming we would see the ""usual"" ancient sculptures, busts and a regurgitation of everything we had seen when travelling Italy, Turkey and Greece.Wow, were we in for a surprise. This museum has recently been re-worked into one of the nicest displays of extensive ancient pieces, from jewelry to sculpture to glass work to examples of daily life. You can spend as little time or as much time as you'd like, but do yourself a favor and plan for three hours minimum. Trust me, you will not get bored!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMETravel

The tile work is just incredible, the travertine will last forever! Small blue mosaic tiles assemble in swirling patterns to denote the fountains water movement. Aaahhhh!Mummies, coins and ancient pottery are just some of the the things on display at the Villa. There's something for everyone, even an interactive kids area where they can draw on pottery or have imaginary sword fights!

50,A most elegant and unique outdoor classical theater experience.,"This past July I had the great fortune to visit the renovated Getty Villa in Malibu, California. Upon entering along a scenic walkway that changes elevation and structural materials as we walked down to the central plaza.During the orientation tour we took of the renovated Getty Villa, our guide encouraged us to return to see a Greek Tragedy staged in the outdoor Classical Theater. Our interest led to tickets for the September performance of Sophocles' ""Electra"". We drove up to Los Angeles on Wednesday afternoon, checked into the Andaz Hotel on Sunset Drive in West Hollywood. On the evening of the play we drove Sunset Blvd. all the way down to Pacific Coast Highway, within one mile of the Getty Villa entrance as well as avoiding the daunting freeway traffic. The parking attendents guide you right into the ample parking garage. There are elevators to take you directly to the theater entrance within an easy walk. Large thick cushions are set out at each seat in the theater, no need to bring your own. I brought theater binoculars, but they were unnescessary. As it is outdoors and evening, layers of clothing as well as a stadium blanket would be advised. On this evening we were perfectly comfortable with just a wrap. There is the option to arrive an hour before the play begins to enter the museum. Another option is to dine before theater on the terrace overlooking the theater. It is possible to pre-order a gourmet boxed dinner to be picked up at the Cafe. Wine is available for purchase by the glass. There is a Coffee Kiosk near the Cafe entrance that offers coffee, hot tea, espresso drinks, lemonade, and bottled beverages, as well as grab-and-go items including house-made soup, hot and cold sandwiches, salads, and a selection of baked goods, desserts, and ice cream. We had eaten earlier in the evening so chose to purchase a glass of wine only. As food and beverage is allowed we took our wine to our seat to enjoy pre theater. The use of the balcony and entry area of the Villa di Pappri in staging the play made for a grand and authentic setting. We both thoroughly enjoyed our experience and plan to watch for upcoming presentations to attend at the Getty Villa in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fatjack1

50,Well worth a stop,"Beautiful gardens (formal and more informal herb garden), statues and artifacts, all immaculately kept. The villa is well worth a stop if you are travelling along the Pacific Coast Highway, but you need to book a time slot online beforehand.

Reservations is a must and if possible try to go on the weekdays so you avoid the crowds (except for tuesdays there CLOSED). The Parking is $15 (4/2010) and admission is free. The Getty Villa is not as big as the Getty Center (off the 405 fwy),but what it lacks in size it makes up for in beauty. Walking the grounds really makes you feel like you stepped back in time. This is most definitely a do not miss, I've lived in Southern California all my life and i don't know why i waited so long to visit the Villa.

Admission was free but parking was $15/car. The musem was amazing! Built to showcase a Greek household. It has tours each day and even kids activites. We went for the architecture and garden tour. Each guest wore a headset so we could hear the guide without needing to stand too close. This was good for me so I could follow the tour while walking around with the kids.My kids enjoyed themselves in the gardens and the children's activity room. my 4-yr-old particularly enjoyed the ""Art Detective"" series where we went through the museum searching for art found in the booklet. The cafe is excellent - great food, great view and reasonable price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soj0urner
50,Well worth it,"Visited the Getty Villa last week, really enjoyed the experience, the drive from downtwon LA was interesting, surf was flat and the beaches looked pleasant enough but when have Bondi, Coogee, Bronte and Maroubra at your doorstep then a fairly flat looking Pacific didn't look that inviting. Missed the turnoff to the Getty Villa first time round (it is just BEFORE the traffic lights when travelling northbound. The staff was very, very nice, up the driveway to the undercover car park. Through to the Villa. Lots of very impressive antiquities. Two of the BEST interactive museum experiences I have ever seen (other museums take note). The cafe was equally impressive, indoor, outdoor options, really nice food at a fair price, a very clever system for delivering deserts to the table (I won't give it away, you'll have to roder desert to find out). The musem rooms, the grounds and the whole experience were very, very pleasant and certainly a world away from the rat race of LA. Those living in LA and those visiting LA are very lucky to benefit from the generousity and vision of JP Getty. I thank those have maintained the Villa to a very high standard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/picture_of_innocence
50,"Delightful gardens, great art, lovely views","The Getty Villa has everything - a lovely collection, great views, and the most gorgeous gardens ever, full of the noise of gurgling water.If you are anywhere near, do not miss it - the collections are uncluttered, the rooms themselves decorated with murals, marble, mosaics and beautiful ceilings. You will feel like Lucius Calpurnius, Cesar's father-in-law, who owned the Villa from which this one is a copy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sobrina
50,"Absolutely amazing, a must see",I would highly recommend both the Getty art museum and mansion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris2525
50,Love the ancient artifacts!,"We visited the Getty villa on a sunny day and I was so glad! The outdoor areas are stunning, including the Romanesque pool, with it's quiet places to contemplate and reflect. The collection is a wonderment of ancient Rome and Greece and the outdoor dining area was a perfect place to enjoy lunch. You can do the whole thing in about 2-3 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaBeachGirl
50,The best antiquities exhibit west of Rome,"We have been wanting to visit the Getty Villa in Malibu from our previous visits to L.A., but never got the chance. This time, we put it on top of our itinerary and reserved free tickets a few months ago. The reason they do this is to limit the number of vehicles that come into the parking garage. However, there is a $15.00 parking fee per vehicle. This is a smaller museum compared to the more famous Getty Center in L.A. The antiquities here were started as a private collection by J. Paul Getty that grew in volume, he decided to open up a museum for everybody to see. We were not disappointed. Most of the exhibits here are priceless except for some reproductions because they have to return the originals to Naples, Italy. At present review, The ""Chimera of Arezzo"" exhibit is on going. There is a cafe for meals and a kiosk for snacks and drinks. An outdoor patio is a good spot to relax and kill time on one of those lazy days. On weekend evenings, they have drama plays on the amphitheater. There are different kinds of tours that we participated (Orientation tour and Architecture & Garden tour were the ones we picked). The guides did a superb job in describing the place. An all day affair is ample for this wonderful and grandeur villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PantheraOnca
50,If you are on the west coast & love ancient mediterranean art- don't miss this gem.,"Be sure to order your tickets in advance. There is a parking fee, but to see the gorgeous art is worth it. Lunch is also very pleasant. Kids would probably not enjoy it much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chriskaia
50,Going to Gtty Villa is like going to Pompei,"Recent trip to La I was told to check out the Getty Villa near Malibu. You must get tickets in advance to reserve your visit, however the tickets are free and you can get them on line. You must pay for parking, however, which is expensive for where you are but with free tickets, you can't complain. If you are in the Malibu area or are traveling up the PCH as we were, I highly recommend a stop at Gettty Villa, its worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewJerseyMovieman
50,A hidden treasure...very unique and a must-see!,"The Getty Villa was so interesting. It's beautiful to see all the Roman/Greek artifiacts, artwork and statues plus the recreations are amazing. My 7 year old loved the children's area. Best I have ever seen at any museum. We spent 3 hours here. You must get your tickets ahead of time. Go on their website.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BushkaTexas
30,Cool Place,"Before you go, make sure you register online and print out the ticket. Security won't let you in unless you have ticket. It's free and all you need to do is plan ahead.It's very huge area and it's beautiful. I specially enjoyed the garden.I will go to the other one next time for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorkHardPlayHard2008
40,Where the ancient Mediterranean meets modern Malibu,"Driving up the Pacific Coast Highway, it's easy to miss this hidden gem in Malibu/Pacific Palisades. But this is one attraction not to be missed if you happen to be visiting this famous beach town. Upon entering its gates, one can't help but feel like one has been transported from modern day Malibu to the ancient Mediterranean. From the architecture and landscape to its extensive collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan artifacts, this museum has the look and feel of an ancient European villa. Indeed, it was modeled after the Villa of the Papyri a first-century Roman country house unearthed at Herculaneum, buried by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in A. D. 79. Of course, it has all the modern amenities you'll find in most museums - cafes, shops, tours, etc. You may even notice the new spaces (including a new entrance and a 450-seat outdoor classical theater) that were added since it underwent renovation in 1997. The new and improved Villa reopened its doors to the public in 2006. Now, ready and waiting to be rediscovered!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlustgyrl
50,Better than the Getty Center,"I happened to go to the Villa on the last day of my trip and unfortunately I didn't leave myself enough time to really explore the villa, but I loved what I saw.I had been to the Getty Center earlier in the week. It was nice, but to me, the art got boring after a while. The Villa, on the other hand, had a lot of Greek and Roman artifacts, sculptures, jewelry, pottery, etc. that really kept me interested. The architecture and landscaping were also beautiful. They have different tours, but I didn't get a chance to do them.You need to make reservations, as they apparently limit the amount of people that can visit in one day. It is free, but you pay to park. If you go to the Getty Center first, go to the info desk and you can get a ticket that lets you go at any time to the Villa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sc120
40,some important information about this special place,"Some clarifications are in order: Although tripadvisor lists two Getty Villas (also Los Angeles), there is only one. This ""Malibu"" listing is correct, as that is the correct location and how the Getty Trust lists it. To make it more confusing, the mailing address is ""Pacific Palisades"".An earlier reviewer mentions the ""Getty Museum in Santa Monica"". There is no such institution. The Getty Center is in Los Angeles and listed that way on tripadvisor.It is very important to stress that you CANNOT show up to the Getty Villa without previously getting admission tickets. They are free and can be obtained at http://www.getty.edu/visit/ . Parking is $10. Visitors may arrive by taxi. Public transportation by bus is available (MTA 534), but is not really practical.The hours of operation are 10-5; closed to the general public Tuesday and Wednesday.Note that the museum is a combination of indoor and outdoor facilities. Be prepared to be in direct sunlight for much of your visit. Comfortable walking shoes are a must.A number of tours are available, and all are free, as is an orientation film. Some tours require that you sign up in advance, rather than simply appearing at the departure spot at the time of the tour. There may be lectures and other special events in which you would need to obtain advance reservations on the web site if you which to attend.The Getty Villa's collection focuses on Greek and Roman antiquities. Yes, I can say ""This is the sort of thing that people like, if people like this sort of thing."" A great deal of time, effort and money was created to recreate the Villa dei Papiri in Herculaneum, Italy. The outdoor sculptures are replicas of the kind of works that would be present at such an elaborate first-century Roman country house. Inside, artworks are displayed and grouped according to themes such as ""Gods and Goddesses"". No small part of J. Paul Getty's fortune was used to buy these antiquities.Check the web site for family activities. The ""Family Forum"" is a space especially dedicated for visiting parents and childrenPlease see the photos I have uploaded on the ""front page"" of this attraction on tripadvisor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corona79
50,As beautiful as the Getty Museum,"This is a great place. Take your time and enjoy the beauty. Then explore Malibu, you can't beat it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshbash
50,one of the best museums in the U.S.,"If you're visiting the Malibu area, don't miss this museum, which is known for its collection of antiquities. Even if you're not into the Art scene, you'll enjoy the building, which is patterned on a Roman villa, as well as the spectacular setting. You must reserve a free, timed ticket. Why not make sure you're there in time for lunch - the restaurant really does a great job!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nell55
50,"Beautiful gardens, wonderful collection of sculpture","If you find yourself in Malibu and have some time to spare or want to get out of the sun for a few hours-this is a wonderful place. Don't confuse this place with the Getty Museum in Santa Monica.I went in the late afternoon with a group of friends. Everyone really enjoyed it, even those that don't typically like museums like children. This is not an ordinary museum and it is worth going out of your way to see it. You must a get timed ticket online but they are free. And, you don't need to show up at the exact time you schedule. By monitoring traffic it ensures the place is never crowded and very relaxing to stroll around.Right across the street on the beach is a great restaurant calledDukes. Inside for a delicious seafood dinner, outside for appetizers and/or just drinks. Wonderful place, too. Great beach at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saphfirebluez
50,A Must-See,"I recently visited the Getty Villa with my family (2 seniors, 4 adults, 3 teens) and we all loved this place. Definitely worth your time. The building itself is magnificent and is a work of art itself. The staff is eager to help and to explain the ancient Greek and Roman treasures housed there. Start with the film explaining the villa and its design. After the film, it takes about 2 - 3 hours or so to see the whole museum (3 hours if you like to read the displays about the artifacts). We arrived right at 10:00 when they opened, explored the museum and had lunch in the cafe, and we were done between 1:30 and 2 p.m. The displays are arranged thematically, so my teens who had studied mythology and the Trojan war could focus on the artifacts and art related to those subjects. Don't skip the gardens -- they are a real highlight. The museum is free, but you need to make reservations in advance, and there is an $8 charge for parking (although they waived the parking charge on the day we visited). Even if you are not a regular ""museum-goer,"" I'd say this is worth a visit., especially if you have any familiarity with ancient Greek or Roman history or mythology.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherylmk
50,Spend the whole day here,"This is quite an extensive museum with several gardens and pools to enjoy as well as dozens of rooms, two levels of them, with thousands of exhibits. Most of the exhibits are antiquities from ancient Greece and Rome: statues, coins, jewelry, busts, vases, pots, more. It is amazing how well kept they are, considering their age.The Getty Villa just reopened a couple of years ago after being extensively remodeled for nine years. It is socked away in some cliffs overlooking the lovely Pacific Ocean very close to Sunset.Be sure to allow yourself ample time to pore over everything, see the film, take a tour or two, and take some time to eat. Caution: the food at their cafe is not cheap; split the costs with your companions.It's worth the trip, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caltravelgal
40,Definitely worth an afternoon,"Picturesque setting, great artworks, and lively gardens are words that come to mind when I recall this gem along the PCH. The villa contains many Greek/Roman artifacts worth perusing. But, what captivated me more than anything was the serene environment. The villa property is extraordinary and the garden is grand. The best part - it's free!Plenty of benches for tired legs. Very clean bathrooms. And the staff is polite, including the security guards. Worth your 3 hours on a sunny afternoon.Grab a bite at the local town center a mile or so north of the Getty. You'll see it off the highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roberee
50,A Day in Italy,"My best friend and I (who had who traveled to Italy together a couple years ago) decided to spend an afternoon at the Getty Villa on our day off work for MLK Jr. Day. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision but we were able to find timed tickets available on the same day we wanted to attend. First of all, the drive is nothing short of spectacular down PCH.The Villa itself is beyond impressive, modeled after the Villa de Papiri, a real villa in the town of Herculaneum in Italy (one of the towns destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79). It literally felt like we stepped into Europe for the day. The architecture and gardens (peristyles with fountains are particularly captivating) are enough to keep you busy for a while not to mention the free guided tours. We took the ""highlights tour"" and saw a few of the collection's prized pieces. This museum mainly houses the Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities from the Getty Collection and is organized thematically (""Gods and Goddesses,"" ""Heroes,"" ""Women of Herculaneum"" etc). It is large enough to keep your attention but small enough to not overwhelm you. As museums go, it was just the right size for me...and had a lot of extras thrown in (gardens, architecture) much like it's partner in the Santa Monica Mountains (The Getty Center).It had been raining further inland (where we live) but the coast was clear with puffy white clouds and sunshine. It was a gorgeous day, so that didn't hurt. Best of all (and unlike many attractions in L.A. which cost you an arm and a leg), The Getty Villa was absolutely FREE. Parking is $8 but that is a small price to pay, in my opinion. Definitely worth a visit! We stopped along PCH on the way home to take a few photos and enjoy the crisp air and sunshine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianalvg
50,Highlight of my L.A. vacation!,"The Getty Villa turned out to be the highlight of my recent 4 day vacation to Malibu. The grounds were incredibly beautiful and the staff / tour guides were all very knowledgeable and friendly. The highlight of the tour for me was seeing the ancient sculptures.My best friend and I had intended for this to be a 2 hour visit, and ended up spending most of the morning and afternoon at the Villa. Was a very pleasing experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bronsonator
50,"Didn't expect to love it, but did","Our reservation was for 10 AM and we arrived 45 minutes early. We were admitted and had a wonderful experience walking leisurely in the gardens before the other tourists arrived. We felt like ancient Roman patricians strolling, philosophising, letting thoughts come slowly. Very special time for us. The villa is a recreation of a Roman country house that was destroyed by Vesuvious. The architects plans were discovered so Getty built a reproduction on his property to house his collection of classical artifacts. The collection is very high quality but most interesting is the villa itself, how designed and sited. There have been renovations adding to the facility - theatre, changing the second floor to be more accommodating to visitors, other modern changes. Getty's own ranch home can be seen above the villa and is now used for administrative and educational purposes. Handling visitors is streamlined. Parking garage, elevators, tour guide gives tour members head sets so all can hear the narration, OK orientation film. Enjoyed the villa much more than anticipated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maineexpl0rer
40,Better than I Expected,"The Getty Villa seemed much more relaxed and tranquil than the Getty Musuem. The gardens are nice, but I loved the Villa itself. While we loved the art, we spendt equal time just looking at the stone and the floors and the architecture. I recommend the Getty Villa because it is less time consuming than the musuem and also less crowded. A nice getaway for a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lcat601
50,Getty Villa tips,"I enjoyed the Getty Villa more than the Getty Museum. I thought that the place was more relaxed & the gardens were pretty and not too overdone. They had a mosaic exhibit when I was there and it was great to see not only the mosaics they had there but also a section which showed how the mosaics were made.Also- they have some really insightful short videos and user-friendly computers for visitor information as well. their gift shop has a lot of cool things as well!!!Find tickets on their website and they are free, but only available at certain times. Trafficwise- PCH can be a mess especially on weekends when everyone hits the BEACH. Make note of that and leave plenty of time to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayeCali
50,Fabulous!,"The Getty Villa is now a must see for anyone in LA.You need to book ahead for tickets - a simple phone call to the number on the website.This is the only downside - with the Getty Centre, I can just show up.It is well worth the effort though, and I will certainly return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leesw8
50,Better than the Getty Museum,Just visited the Getty Villa. It was fantastic! The museum flows from room to room and the view of the ocean is excellent. The collection of artifacts was amazing! I must admit I was a little disappointed with the meal I ordered from the restaurant but others really seemed to enjoy theirs. The price was far better compared to the larger Getty. They have outside seating as well as indoors and plenty of room. A must visit and see!!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyk2ski
