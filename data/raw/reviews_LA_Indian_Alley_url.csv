10,Disgusting,Do not waste your time here. Skid row smells like human flesh cooking in an unhealthy mix of day old whiskey and piss. I don’t recommend going as a tourist. The overwhelming smell of Subway (the sandwich shop not the transit hub) dances violently with the smell of deteriorating flesh. It’s a full on attack to the senses with zero reward. There are two murals and neither is particularly impressive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/florinac494

50,This is the gritty LA core - the REAL story of Los Angeles.,"I have watched Indian Alley come of age inside the gentrification of Downtown LA since 2000, and more recently become a cultural landmark featuring prominent native artists. My colleagues and I eat often around the corner and then walk through and past just to see what new street art is up or any other interesting art madness that is happening. Then, today we went by and Stephen Zeigler and his wife (who live in the building adjacent to Indian Alley) were out and took us on a personal tour with full explanation of each work of art in the alley as well as a full history of the alley and building. Amazing! I knew a little of that area from my own personal life history, but Steve really set the mood (including told which movies the alley was used in) for how LA really was, and is. He and his wife run/own the Indian museum and gallery at the Indian building on Winston Street and are very excited and happy to tell you anything and give you a personal tour if you ask. Plus, Steve is a studied and accomplished Buddhist that does a Monday evening (7:30pm) Buddhist meditation in their space. It is worth the stop in and visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorBuckles
