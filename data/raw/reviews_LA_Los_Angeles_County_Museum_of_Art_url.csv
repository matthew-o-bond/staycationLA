30,"Good excursion, but it could have been better !!","I visited LACMA with some cousins, particularly for me it was a nice day, but somewhat expensive, from the entrance and everything else, since the whole museum is not on display, but even so it was a wide tour, something bad that I observed was the amount of people who were in the environments and outside to take photos. I think it has to improve some aspects, I suppose it will be when the renovation is completed in 2024. At the moment I do not recommend it much, but the tour was interesting despite the fact that my cousins thought otherwise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magnarcook
50,Great place for cute pictures,Super fun place to explore and take cute pictures. Very crowded. There is underground parking for $20 an hour. The urban lights itself are free to explore. There’s lots of street food for sale all around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsgiwatravels
40,Morning & Evening pictorial with my love,"Very busy place from morning till very late at night, so many photoshoots happening all over the place specially the light post in the entrance, we actually went there twice to capture both morning and night time. Just be mindful on the others taking picture because it is always jam-packed, tripods are not allowed inside the area but allowed in the pathway outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErwinGeron
20,Stick to the outside of LACMA it's more fun!,"We visited LACMA and on arrival as we paid for tickets were told that some pavilions were closed. Ok this is a world class museum there will be plenty to see...uh wrong. Artwork is sparse and if you dont know as we didn't, if artwork is on loan there is no Photography allowed, if artwork is owned, like at the Getty Center, you can take pictures, no flash of course.We were rudely told off for everything like having a bag, taking a photo, talking, looking up close, etc etc to the point we were done!A complete waste of time and money.We love, really love, art galleries and have been to some amazing ones but this was completely underwhelming.The outside of LACMA has the very instagrammed light installation and that was fun but being told off every 5 mins inside made us wish we had stayed outside in the sun!There are better places to see art in LA, go to The Broad and The Getty Center instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808StephB-NZ
10,Don't waste your money until 2024,"What a waste. $16 for parking and $25 for admission for only 3 sparse floors of art.The Barbara Kruger ""shafted"" installation is only partially visible because one of the floors is closed for installation. The entire permanent collection is not on display.Yet the full $25 admission is an art crime.Given the billionaires involved in financing these construction projects, this museum should be free until the rebuild is complete.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s0m3scr33nn4m3
10,Full price for half museum,"The main area is closed for renovationIn the two remaining areas, about one third is closed for « installation » and one third of what is open is reserved for members only.So you are left with a bunch of random stuff that you can visit in less than a hour.Knowing that the offering is limited due to the renovation work:-Why charging the full price ?-Why not speeding up the installation?-Why limiting a gallery to « members »?So wrong. Don’t waste 25$ pp for that, which is the entry price of the MET in NY!!!Unhelpful staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Romain1136493
40,2 open - wow!,"What a pleasant surprise!! Although only 2 of the buildings on the LACMA campus are open during their renovation (due to end in 2024), the 3 exhibits that I saw in Feb. 2020 were comprehensive, thought-provoking, and fun. Julie Mehret's huge city scapes spread over 2 floors of the Broad Building. No to be missed are the in-depth exhibits on Fijian culture/life (amazing full-size sailing vessel with a woven mat sail) and a paradoxical Chinese artist that poses the question fake or real.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
10,Don’t bother,"We visited the Lacma only to be told that the main galleries are closed for refurbishment. However if you pay the 20 dollar per person entrance fee you can still see the temporary exhibitions.As we visited from England we thought since they are charging to go in it must be worth seeing. How wrong was I The exhibitions were small, absolute rubbish and we were in and out in 15 minutes. What a waste of money. We have visited many museums and galleries in the States and never felt the place was not worth the admission fee before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsmon2016
40,Even with 1/2 closed still good,I was able to use my St Louis Art Museum reciprocal benefits and get two complimentary tickets. This is why I am a member of my local museums. The LACMA has a wonderful campus and beautiful sculptures.I loved the Julie Mehret gallery.The permanent collection will be closed until 2024.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barkus1968
50,Stroll with the Grandkids,"Stopped to see the La Brea Tar Pits and found ourselves in LACMA by accident. Got tix and went inside, a bit on the expensive side. We had heard of a some sort of ""lego"" exhibit. Instead it was a tinker toy type of construct, huge over 25 feet long,15 feet wide maybe and 12 feet tall or more. . Roller coaster-y rainbow colored cars ran together up ramps splitting at the top into snake-like avenues to the bottom so they can start up again. Amazing. Don't recall the artist. Hand made machinery, controlled by a human in the center with multiple transformers. Trains running throughout back and forth. Easily over a 1000 cars, size of Hot Wheels. My grand kids, ages 4 and 6, loved every minute. There is ground level viewing and a balcony.Also on display was a life sized apartment occupied by the artist when he lived in Europe. It was made from wire and silk screen-style material. Opaque and finely guaged he not only depicted the actual unit, but down to the smallest details such as the name of the maker of the steel electrical box housing the circuit breakers. Kitchen and bath as well. Very clever, delicate even.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marksE1284KT
30,Disappointed,"They are conducting a major renovation, so many things are closed. That's understandable. I had trouble finding out what was still on view by viewing the website. I was under the impression that Chris Burden's 'Metropolis II' would be on view, but I learned that it was closed via a small piece of paper at the ticket counter.The general attitudes of most of the staff seemed unwelcoming, cold, and frustrated. One exception was a gentleman who was showing people the new plans and model for the renovation. He was extremely nice, enthusiastic and knowledgeable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeyImaginary
10,(Almost) nothing to see at 50 USD,"We had geat expectations as we have visited art museums all over the world.They are rebuilding and renovating now, hence we were told only two buildings were open. As it turned out, one of which had only one artist (almost) on display and the other one had two exhibitions, of which one was only for members. The other was about Fiji which was nice but FIFTY USD for this!?Rip off and so disappointing. Shame on you for charging full price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HDA101
40,A GREAT ART MUSEUM!,I loved visiting the Los Angeles County Art Museum even though the permanent gallery was closed for renovations. I visited the Fiji and Pacific Ocean Gallery and the guide was excellent. It was obvious that she had research this display thoroughly and her tour was VERY GOOD! I also enjoyed Thomas Joshua Coopers Tour of the World's Edge. I would recommend visiting LACAMA as it is the largest art gallery in North America and you'll see exhibits there that will not be in other galleries.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christenai
30,Most things closed,"Not a great visit, one building with everything prior to 1970 closed for renovation. Two shows getting hung, so closed. Thank goodness for Richard Serra and the other exhibition was great too. Next time listen to the lady at the desk and wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolynp24
40,Interesting Enough for One Visit,"This museum is pretty neat and worth just one visit, but will not take more than a few hours to get through. There are definitely some cool exhibits for art lovers, but there are 4 things that stood out to me.First, the full scale model of the NYC apartment made out of pastel colored mesh was pretty cool. Even though there was a long line, it was interesting to see the great detail of the living space the artist replicated, and the limited guests per visit allows a thorough viewing and good pictures if interested. The other exhibit that was memorable was the scale city transportation model with all the moving cars and trains. When in motion, all the moving vehicles make it fun to watch.There is also a nice terrace with views of L.A. and the mountains behind it as well as the Hollywood sign in the distance for a nice little photo op. And of course, there is the famous streetlamp exhibit that instagrammers flock to, but this exhibit is at the entrance and free to everyone! Good luck getting a picture without some stranger in the background as it gets quite crowded, especially after dark when it is prettiest.Overall, there are other neat exhibits and artwork that art lovers would appreciate, but I wouldn't visit this place again. And by the way, there is a discount for Bank of America cardholders and students, so make sure to mention that... This place was at least more interesting than the La Brea Tar pits in my opinion...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avenjur
30,Interesting But Not Sure It’s Worth A Visit,The overwhelming majority of LACMA is closed for renovations with just the contemporary art building and special exhibit space open for view. So if you’re not an absolute fan of contemporary/modern art you might want to skip the museum for some of LA’s other tourist/art venues. With SO MUCH of the Museum off limits the $25 full price ticket seemed like price gouging. Saw it all in less than an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElTouristo61
10,Rage-inducing,"$70 for a family of four (plus $16 for parking) and we saw a whole bunch of “Gallery Closed for Installation” signs. The “Metropolitan” exhibit only operates on Friday and Saturday. What little art we did see was declared “rage-inducing” by my youngest son. And he didn’t even pay for the tickets. But, yeah, his review was succinct and accurate. Save yourself the money and time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShesaBadMammaJamma
10,Major disappointment,"Major disappointment. I have visited LACMA in the past and always thought it to be a world class art museum. Not anymore. I took my wife there for her first visit. After we were charged a hefty full price and the add-on $10 out of town tourist penalty, we found the museum to have denigrated badly. Empty rooms, broken elevators, roped off stairwells, closed off galleries. The museum is evidently undergoing renovation but they certainly don't tell you that at the entrance. All that's left are a few rooms of stale, second rate, mediocre, widely spaced pieces that can be totally viewed in less than 20 minutes. Even the store is sadly a shadow of the real thing. Less than a quarter of the size with slim pickings. Laughably, they have a membership drive table out front where they tell you the museum will be under construction for the next several years. Don't waste your time or money-sad to see such a great museum to have fallen so badly. Go see the better museums on the rest of the Miracle Mile, don't bother with the current version of LACMA. We felt sorry for the kids who were working there and had to try to explain why it is in it's current state. They had to absorb the complaints and they were apologetic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greenberetateam
50,The Bettye Saar Exhibit,"Wonderful museum and outdoor space. There is so much to see at this museum, so plan to spend some time or just pick a building and concentrate on that space. There is a bar outside and lots of great open space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robin136
40,Approachable art museum,"Part of the museum is under construction, so two buildings house the current exhibits. The Fiji exhibit was fascinating in the intricacy of their art, and display of the culture. The buildings are well laid out and the landscaping was impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenjT5576ZE
50,A beautiful installation,Looks like a walkway through lanterns. It looks especially beautiful when it's evening and lights are on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruditea
50,Well Worth the Time,"I had looked forward to seeing this museum for quite some time. Certainly Levitated Mass was number one on my list and I was not disappointed. The build up of having seen the documentary did not diminish the real installation itself. The rest of the museum is totally worth the time and money. I highly recommend going on a weekday morning, we were on a Friday morning and there were no crowds and no lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanW440
50,Wonderful!,"Enjoyed the interesting art. Three levels of a wide variety of mediums. Art made from glass, fabric, and even one made from cigarettes! So fun! Be sure to see the cars that are turned on about once per hour. There’s an upstairs view of car city it was great video to hear the children gasp “oh wow” when they first turned it on! Bring student Id, seniors 65 and any residents of LA get a discount admission. It was worth the cost to get in several hours of fun. The tar pits are right down the sidewalk from the art. Very interesting. Must see the lights at the entry fun photo op. There’s also a nice dining area with what looks like a food truck if you stay for a snack. Parking across the street was $16.00. Convenient and probably not that bad for LA. I recommend doing this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610charj
20,The Museum charged full entrance and had just two smaller buildings open.,"I am well aware that LACMA has a very interesting an varied collection, but with absolutely no warning we paid a fairly steep entrance price and we saw only one building with contemporary art, which was not much to my liking and also did not contain any of the pieces even in that realm. Furthermore one smaller building with really poor temporary exhibitions. A REAL RIP OFF AND TIME LOST!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel_advisor44
50,La La Land,"If you a fan of La La Land then you have to see Urban light as its known a piece of art work for over 10 years, simple and effective, we saw it on the bus tour of LA and glad we did, would like to see it again in the dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
10,Worst experience ever,Full priced yet most parts are closed and this is a real swindle.The staff is very rude. Bottom line: my suggestion is to stay away from this ‘museum’.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lambertocoppa
50,Bus tour stopped here,We stopped here very briefly for some pictures. We were not able to go inside but the art outside was amazing. We got pics of all of the lamps from La La Land. It was amazing. I am sad that we did not have enough time to go inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hollywood_Help
50,Enjoy the beauty of the city,"LACMA: (Must go!!)地鐵巴士計程車都很方便，在這裡Uber 跟Lyft才是最大宗。Lucky us,we just release today museum day!!So we have free entrance!!!It’s a awesome museum ,don’t be rush,take your time go check one and other art piece, then dot forget the Urban light in the front,nice #IG spot If you have time ,you can stay a longer wait for electricity on!and in the back there is another piece like a big tunnel with a stone on it. Bring you a very unreal feeling.徜徉其中，悠閒的逛著，時光就溜走了！要記得不要踩入作品的標線喔！",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whochen
50,Enthralling,"In a brilliant expansive space we saw stunning exhibits. Beginning with the exceptional Urban Light by Chris Burden. Before entering we saw Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer, an amazing 340 ton boulder suspended over a viewing walkway.The scale of art works was astonishing. Some such were Monumental Steel Bands created by Richard Serra and Tiger Rug from 500,000 Cigarettes by the Chinese artist Xu Bing. The latter’s cigarette themed pieces are in part inspired by his father’s death of cancer after a lifetime’s smoking.Animals in Japanese Art featured exquisite oeuvre such as Zodiac, Grand Shinto Shrine, Night Festival at Shrine, Sanno Festival and Wisteria and Carp.Later saw another fascinating creation by Chris Burden. Titled Metropolis it shows an imaginary city with over one thousand model cars, high rise buildings, and so on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Urban Lights,We didn't make it into the museum but were able to see the Urban Lights. It's beautiful at night. Photo opportunities are amazing but can get crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdizX
10,Entrance fee a waste of money,"With the entire permanent art collection closed to the public during a several years construction project, I felt the Board of Trustees were ripping off tourists and locals by continuing to charge an admissions fee for the paultry two spaces that were actually open to the public for 'special' exhibits. I understand the need to improve, expand and name another building after someone, but, I felt that, closing the entire permanent art collection AND still charging an entrance fee was morally bankrupt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/64nje
50,Loved Urban Lights!,"We didn't bother to go into the museum since we saw that they are undergoing a huge renovation. Apparently most of the collections are closed. However, we did visit the Urban Light exhibit outside. Incredible! We went on a Friday morning and there was hardly anyone there! We had a great time and got amazing photos. I highly recommend checking the Urban Light exhibit out, especially since it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/readerwriter13

20,Wish we’d known that most exhibits are closed for renovation,We were disappointed to learn that most or all of the museum’s Permanent Collection is closed for renovation. The special exhibits open were limited in scope and appeal to us.We were only in LA for the day would have gone to another museum if we’d known beforehand. Understand it is a multiple year renovation so suggest checking on first in what can be seen.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/841stevev
40,Amazing Lights,"This place is $10 away from Walk of Fame by taxi ride. Taking pictures with the lights is for free, you have to pay if you want to see the museum which my friends and I didn't bother to ask because it was already late for us to check the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nejn2015
50,Always something edgy to see!!,"LACMA is always full of surprises! It has edgy new exhibits that challenge us to think in new ways, about things we may never had considered or had taken for granted. It had all the classics we know and love. It has exhibits from cultures all over the world to give us new insights. It has a wonderful cafe with seating overlooking a peaceful Calder mobile over a beautiful fountain. It’s several buildings include courtyards, fountains, and lively architecture , with a major new addition on the way. There are concerts, children’s activities, and cultural performances regularly.And - if all that is now enough, it is located near the famous LaBrea Tar Pits and Museum, across the street from the Automotive Museum, and near other museums and places of interest. A new addition, currently under construction, will enhance the experiences of visitors even more!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/penuinlover
40,What is open is amazing,"LACMA has currently closed their permement collection for renovations, so a decent portion of the museum is closed.The other exhibitions available (as of Nov 2019) were amazing and really enjoyable.It was really unfortunate that so much was closed, but what was open was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucnsam

40,Still a bunch to do despite closure,"Much of the museum is closed for renovations that will end in 2024. You can see the plans for the museum inside. The galleries they have on display are mostly modern art and there were some really cool things. Of course it would have been nice to see the permanent collection given it was my first time there but the Snapchat exhibit (Christian Marley) was awesome, Matter and Form (Chinese modern art), the Metropolis II, among a number of other things like the sculptures to walk through made it a fun activity even on a cloudy day. I would definitely recommend visiting here if you have about 2 hours.Pro tip: Don't pay for parking. Loop around and find street parking. We went on a Sunday afternoon and were still able to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccasichel7
50,So many parts to see!,"One of the first fun things at LAMA can be enjoyed at any time: the street lamp sculpture on Wilshire Boulevard. It's popular with photographers as people can walk between the lamps and play with the angles and sightlines. Other outdoor sculptures are accessible once inside the museum, and there are several buildings.The photography exhibit at the time was about 3-D, many viewed with 3-D glasses provided. A section about Rome had paintings, sculpture, and clothing on view. I especially liked the medieval wood sculptures. Many eras and cultures are represented, with something of interest for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aquazoo
40,Visit at Night,We went at night and it was much better. Didn't have to worry about the traffic or parking. I just pulled up and turned the Hazard lights on and took my pictures. Recommend a decent camera or set your settings for night mode,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C221DVcarlosa
40,Iconic,Very well organised museum. Love the iconic photo opp outside. Well worth doing this and the tar pits next door.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rainy0
50,Make love to the camera (Urban Lights),This place is rife with instagram opportunities. Every turn and corner is a million dollar photo op waiting to happen. We came to visit while the sun was up and it wasn't half bad. Photos would have been more dramatic had we visited at night when the lamps are lit but then again the afternoon light wasn't too shabby for the photos we took. You'll have to be quick at finding the right angle for your photo as you will need to contend will all the other people who are also looking for that perfect angle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulesLarrobis

30,A bit disappointing,"Having previously been ""wowed"" by a visit to the LACMA - we were underwhelmed by what we could see when we returned this September. We gather that they are going to tear down most of it and replace with more earthquake resistant buildings.As a result - a large proportion of the LACMA is ""off limits"" as they begin to pack up.Enjoyed the Japanese animal-themed exhibition, but the rest wasn't great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobandJosie
50,one of the best art venues in California,"LACMA is one of the best art venues in California. this expansive museum has so much to offer and see. there are often outdoor installations as well as the many indoor ones. check the LACMA website for they have so many special events from music, to movies, to after hour viewing and exhibits to choose from. plus they have a nice little restaurant on the premises where you can drink and dine before, during or after your visit. take an iconic picture next to the street light exhibit in front or go around back and take a picture in front of the rock or stroll around the grounds and see La Brea Tar Pits too. there is so much to see and enjoy here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackV846
50,The Heart of LA,"LACMA is an amazing resource for the city, the county and for anyone who visits LA. The campus is the heart of the city. The outdoor pieces like Urban Lights and Levitated Mass draw people in and provide a great entree to art for young and those who don't. regularly go to art museums. Great to walk around the campus, good food, good music during spring, summer and fall Friday nights. Always something great to take in including fab people-watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Auweho
50,First Rate Art Musem,"This is one of the most important museums in Los Angeles, and the premier art museum. With many exhibitions going on simultaneously, there is always something for everyone's taste. Whether you are interested in modern art, contemporary art, painting, sculpture, photography, abd so much more. Plan to spend the better part of a day, and eat in the cafeteria (readonable) or the restaurant (a bit pricier), and stop in at the gift shop (an excellent one.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terrybraun33

When searching the entrance we somehow entered the premises and saw some outside exhibitions.

50,Stunning and Beautiful!!,"Just visited LACMA today. It has an impressive collection of exhibits. It is true that they are renovating the museum but it does not feel that way since there are several blocks/galleries:1. Paul Burden's Urban Light: This is right outside the entrance and very popular for photography.2. Ahmanson Building: This is a part other reviewers are complaining about and used to hold traditional art. It is going through renovation ( for the better ). In any case, better art museums are Getty Center and Broad in case you want to see Rembrandt or Picasso.3. Art of Americas Building: They have a high tech gallery (5) of soundscapes from snapschat. I presume Christian Marclay used voice translation APIs to connect to snap chat clips and makes surreal effects. Must see if you like geeky stuff for your kids.4. Resnick Pavilion: They have a comprehensive collection of Japanese and Korean art, calligraphy and sculptures.5. Broad Contemporary Art Museum ( BCAM ): This is a museum in itself and has 3 floors. Has very unique and diverse art and architecture including the Allure of Matter from China; Metropolis by Chris Burden ( closes 5:30 pm ); Miracle Mile etc. Some of the exhibits are mesmerizing and stretches your imagination.This museum is very different and have feats of engineering and architecture which are unique and stunning by all means.The amazing thing which humbles is that this museum has received donations from individuals for a total of over $840 M since 2004 which is being used to renovate this old ( built in 1965) and largest museum of the US West. Cant wait to visit again in 2024 when the renovation works are complete.For now, I would recommend this if you have 2-3 hours on a Sunday afternoon and have already seen Getty Center or Broad .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulrupesh
10,Permanent Collection Closed,"Showed up to find all the permanent collection exhibits were closed and they still wanted to charge us full price for admission. We declined and went next door to the La Bear Tar Pits, which was fun. The new underground parking garage is convenient and not unreasonable at $16.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PvcM
50,Great,We had a great time at LACMA. They have a dedicate collection of Material Art from China that was incredible. Absolutely recommendable. On a separate matter; the museum coffee shop was a bit expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelWorldMap
50,Overwhelmingly Museum!,So do yourself a great favor and go to see. Gorgeous huge captivating spaces and art exhibits. 🖤🖤🖤💛,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelEds111
10,REALLY DISAPPOINTED AT BEING RIPPED OFF,"Went to visit the museum in August. Bought full-price tickets only to be told AFTER the purchase that about 40% of the museum was closed to visitors and being remodelled. This should be declared clearly and unequivocally BEFORE you are being sold the expensive tickets, in writing and by the ticket seller. This is is shabby, disgraceful and not worthy of what is supposed to be a cultural highlight of the city. Also, get the fountain going again. I know there is a drought on, but you can recycle the water and minimise evaporation. It is not sitting in the plain sun. My view is: DO NOT VISIT HERE UNTIL LACMOA ADOPTS AN OPEN AND HONEST ATTITUDE TO WHAT IS AND IS NOT OPEN. There are other better and more impressive collections to see. And if you are really pining for culture, wait until you get to San Francisco.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moosymooster
50,"Enrich, Invigorate, Enliven","Give yourself over to the fascinating contemporary art on display from around the world (be sure and read the short descriptions that accompany each work) and be rewarded with an inner sense of wonder and marvel at the creativity of humankind. THe building itself, as plain jane as can be on the outside, rewards with a long outdoor escalator leading to a great view of the Hollywood Hills and the Hollywood sign. The oversize elevator gets everbody's attention while the now iconic lightpost sculpture out front is a magnet for instagramers from the four corners of the planet (corners?) There is plenty to show and discuss with children and they will, for sure, love the kinectic electric car and train sculpture as well as the concrete, yet organic feeling, indoor maze.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valtraveler10
20,Under Construction,"I'm sure the museum will be wonderful when the new home for its permanent collection is finished in 2024, but it's a shadow of its former self at the moment. Most of the former display areas are closed and the central fountain looks derelict with no water. We managed to have a fun time with the help of La Brea Tar Pits next-door. Fortunately, our entry to LACMA was free due to membership. Others were less fortunate despite the current limitations. I will return in 2024 and enjoy the new building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerileywriter

30,Kill time,"Went to see the new colorful tents they place this summer and thought it was big . Walk inside with my wife , took a few pictures and was done in less than 5 minutes.They are doing a lot of restorations around the place but was able to see Tar bubbling on ground and some fossils . Stop by Starbucks after (across the street)and that’s it. Good thing we did not pay to see it but if you go to their museum there is a fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAGCALAS1
10,Amazed that they wanted full admission when >90% closed !!,"Was ready to pay full admission when ticket agent casually mentioned that “some galleries are closed”. Turned out that ALL galleries of interest were closed !!!!..Thus american art, american decorative art, art of the pacific, chinese & korean art, european art, islamic art, latin american art, modern art, photography, south & southeastern art were closed !!!.... come on folks, if you have nothing but the Resnick pavilion and BCAM open during construction ....do the right thing and CLOSE UP. TILL DONE !!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelroc12

Reserve time for this place to really enjoy it. Ware comfortable shoes .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6378WFannag
30,How Disappointing!,"Not only is most of the museum closed due to ongoing (4 years!) construction, the ticket seller on Monday refused to honor entry using a Citigold card despite this promotion being digitally announced (my banker also reconfirmed that it was valid). In addition the ticket seller on Aug. 19 between 11 - 11.30 a.m. gave erroneous information that Citigold cards were valid for admission at the La Brea Tar Pits (not true). Currently there's a sale of books (20% off) in their museum shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
30,Art near the tar pits,"There are many art museums in the LA area. We stopped in to the county museum since we were visiting the nearby tar pits. As others have mentioned, there are extensive renovations underway and many areas are closed and objects are not on display. The ticket office was very clear about this and provided a specific list of things that were open and things that were not. We found the price high when you consider things like the Getty center which are free and the renovations. Ultimately we decided to go in and were surprised how spreadout the works were among different buildings and how some spaces had one a solo large work on display. Overall, you might want the make your decision on visiting based on the status of the renovations given that full admission price is charged.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSQRD1

30,I'll update in 4 years,"Unfortunately due to the tremendous overhaul this museum must go through as its been so outdated, most of the exhibits are closed for 4 years until they construct a new building. These closures leave just an OK experience and certainly not worth the full admission price of $20 per person. Not sure how they feel its justified. I'll be back in 4 years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MooshLA

40,Asian Exhibit and View,"Visiting LACMA was a very good afternoon activity. Although about half of the buildings are under construction and closed, we were able to spend a couple of hours wandering around the Asian exhibits, saw some Picasso and Matisse, too. The grounds and view are worth seeing. They have some concerts in the main plaza. There is a Coffee/Milk shop on the second floor by a gift shop which is a nice place to rest rather than the bar area at the main entrance. I look forward to visiting again when the whole museum is updated/completed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0beckyw

50,Great afternoon excursion,"We wanted to spend an afternoon browsing so thought that going to the Art Gallery would be good. We knew that it was the last day for an art exhibit by artists from China although we were excited to see the other collections. But no question, the artists from China displays were incredible. I can’t remember going to an art gallery where I so enjoyed contemporary art. Generally, I am a stickler for realism and art from the past and don’t like contemporary or abstract art much but this collection was fabulous. The different mediums that were used and the descriptions for why the artists did what they did really provided excellent background to the pieces. It was a great experience and loved the exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vernay2014

Also they have a lot of expos, the Pablo Picasso collection, the House of Hairs, Korean section, the must picture is outside with the light poles. You must also visit the La Brea Tar pits, and behind it, there is a museum, and they are actually still digging fossils out. Not because of my comments do I mean that you go in free, but I saw a lot of people walking from the parking lot, getting the stickers, and walking in to the museums for free!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doc_in_cancun
30,Visit with teens,We visited with two teens and only had a couple of hours. At $25 a head for adults and $10 per teen it is quite pricey. The girls enjoyed it but when asked to compare it in quality and value to the MET they laughed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyt200
40,Good Museum,"A good and varied interesting collection however a little pricey for what it is, especially as you have to pay for parking on top, which wasn't that cheap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdm66
30,Listen carefully before paying for your ticket,Many of the exhibit areas were closed. They were very transparent about the closures as we were made aware of this at the ticket area before we paid. I enjoyed the museum but felt we overpaid (non-CA residents) due to the number of closures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaraNelly
50,Summer of 2019,"I have been noticing a lot of not so positive reviews because of LACMA closures. As a local, let me put this into perspective.The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is going through a multi-million dollar transformation that will take nearly 5 years. Part of that transformation includes the demolition of approximately 2/3s of the current complex. The only buildings remaining will be the Resnick Pavilion, Broad Contemporary Museum and the Pavilion For Japanese Art (closed for renovation). Since so much of LACMA is closed, the remaining buildings are chock full of art. I've been to LACMA many times over the years and the holdings are considerable. The transformation means that on a temporary basis, there will be limited space to see LACMA's holdings but you'll still see as much as room will allow. LACMA is second only to the Met in its art holdings.One additional tip for LACMA, if you go on a Friday, go later in the day. They have free Jazz performances starting at 6PM with food and drinks available for purchase. If you go on Saturday, go later in the day and they have free Latin music performances at 6PM with food and drinks available for purchase.But there is something beyond LACMA that I think non-locals do not understand. If you are in the vicinity of LACMA, there is a treasure trove of art and artifacts to see all within a 10 minute walk of LACMA. Directly East of LACMA is a large pond that contains traces of tar, the last of the La Brea Tar Pits. Right next to that pond is the George C Page Museum which is solely dedicated to the wealth of fossils excavated from the tar pits. Saber tooth tigers, Dire wolves, giant land sloths, mammoths, many birds, even a human has been found in the tar pits. These fossils are thousands of years old and unique to this region of what is now Southern CA. The museum has many comprehensive displays to expand your visit.If you look across the street from the Page Museum, you see the Craft Contemporary (formerly the Craft and Folk Art Museum). This museums focuses and expands on craft media and art. Their exhibitions are really unique and contemporary, and a counterpoint to what you would see from LACMA's holdings.If you walk 2 blocks West on Wilshire past LACMA, you'll find the Peterson Automotive Museum on the corner of Wilshire and Fairfax. The Peterson has an extensive collection of antique cars that run the gamut. There are also some types of cars that are indigenous to the history of Los Angeles. That includes the fact that this is the world capitol of Hollywood, movies and television.Across the street from the Peterson is the future home of the Motion Picture Academy's Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. At the moment you can only look at it from the outside but it will be opening shortly in 2020.Since you have walked for all of this, you do not need to move your car and pay additional parking. You're allowed to move from museum to museum on foot. They will not make you move your car 50 or 100 feet to another parking lot.One food tip: gourmet food trucks--the trend that first became popular in Los Angeles--park en mass on Wilshire Blvd opposite the entrance to LACMA daily. The trucks vary from day to day but many of the popular trucks park there. Lunch tends to be around 11:00AM to 2:00PM.Last thing, between now and September 02, 2019, these museums will give people a $2 discount if they present their ticket stubs from one museum to another museum. This only applies to these 4 museums during the Summer of 2019. If you are going to be in the region during this period, take advantage of it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fulgum

30,"Could be awesome, but half the place was not open","Love museums like this, but it seemed a lot of it was closed. Some of the exhibits seemed half displayed. Everything just seemed half there. There were a lot of Picasso's, so that was cool to see more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/preisman
50,World-class art expertly displayed,"Located on Wilshire Boulevard just east of Fairfax Avenue in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is the largest art museum in the western United States, attracting nearly a million visitors annually.NOTE that while the museum has a Wilshire Boulevard address, the easiest access to their parking facility is off 6th Street.On our visit we spent the majority of our time in the Ahmanson Building, which housed an impressive collection of Picassos as well as numerous paintings by Henri Matisse. We also took in some of the excellent pieces in the Broad Contemporary Art Museum. If you are interested in ethnic art, they currently (summer 2019) have major exhibitions of Islamic, Latin American and Korean art.Even if you don’t feel like paying to go into LACMA there is one free outdoor exhibit worth seeing, Chris Burden’s “Urban Light,” which has become a very popular spot for Instagram selfies.The museum grounds were immaculate, the artwork was tastefully displayed and both docents and security officers were there to maintain the proper viewing environment. Our guests visiting from Norway were impressed by LACMA and, as native Southern Californians, we also look forward to future visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruinDan
20,Not worth it,"I had read the review on Trip Advisor - Best Museums in LA. Wanted to see their extensive collection. I drove for over an hour, paid $25 admission and $16 to park. Turns out one building closed entirely and others only open at 30% of regular exhibit space. Not much to see. Over-hyped, over-priced and very disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CardinalsFan1983

30,"Great museum, but partly under reconstruction","LACMA is a great museum for modern art, Next to the diverse collection there are different interesting temporary exhibitions. It was a pity that the Japanese pavilion was closed (under construction), but even more that the Asian department in the museum was also out of order. The small exhibition on Sri Lanka couldn't take away the disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AB_Stb_OZ
50,A little paradise for designers and 3d effects lovers!,"I loved this museum! Before my visit, I had only heard of it because of the cool street lamps installation, but the whole museum deserves a few-hour visit! Among the things I truly loved was an area dedicated to modern poster design (as a designer myself it couldn't have been more fitting, even though I'm pretty sure most people would find it very interesting since posters are a very direct form of art).Also, I was delighted by the 3D effects pavilion, where you could actually try different methods of 3D lenses developed through the years. I never found anything like that in any other museum and I personally believe even kids would have a lot of fun!Also, I loved the huge collection of modern art, with lots of significant pieces from Lichtenstein, Picasso, and Braque!As a final touch, the grounds where the museum is located are very nice and green with the iconic tall Californian palms!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LelaLovesTraveling
50,Definitely worth a visit,"I recently visited LACMA with my daughter and two year old grandson, having taken him before on my own. He really enjoyed the opportunity to paint and draw in the kids art room that’s open most of the time the museum is open. We spent some time in a few of the galleries where he ran from piece to piece asking about what they were, particularly fascinated by some of the sculpture. He loved going in and out of the enormous Richard Serra steel pieces. His very favorite thing though is “Metropolis” which is a room-sized kinetic exhibit of thousands of matchbox cars, trains and other vehicles whizzing around on tracks. It is fantastic but only open Fri, Sat and Sun for an hour at a time, so check the schedule. We bought a membership that includes parking (an add on cost of $80) which turns out to be an excellent value because parking is $16/hr. There’s a lot to see at LACMA, and you can’t do it in a rush. Another good reason to join.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaB157
40,Exploring LA,Came down on a surprise adventure and loved the contemporary art display!

50,"Intriguing, even when mostly closed","Most of the collections were closed for remodeling when we went, but the modern sections had fine works by Richard Serra, Frank Stella, MRC Chagall, Pablo Picasso, Joseph Albers. The Asian collection only had some Korean ( and a very few Chinese) pieces on display at the time, but there was an interesting Sri Lankan exhibit to make up for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IvanSusanin1613
40,Great museum,"This is a great museum, and in the afternoons County residents can get in free (with ID). It is a bit jumbled with the new collections that have been added. Quite a bit of modern art--also cool Japanese Exhibit--plus seeing the Tar Pits in the surrounding garden is cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cookpias
50,Worth it!,"There is so much of the Los Angeles County Museum that I have not seen. What I have viewed has been terrific.We really need to budget at least one whole day for LACMA, if we want to truly appreciate all this museum has to offer. Some day, we will.For now, though, I highly recommend a trip to LACMA for everyone. At the very least, take a look see at the Urban Light exhibit. It is truly amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExpoNationals
50,Oh what a pleasure!,"Visited LACMA on a Monday ( super rare to have it open)Was not expecting to see so many of the galleries open but yes they were. Saw a couple of their temporary exhibits which were very good but the real treasures were in their main exhibit halls. Fabulous collection of paintings from real antiques from the renaissance to super contemporary art. They have perhaps the largest collection of Picasso’s, a good number of paintings by Diego Rivera and Van GoghsDo not miss it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ikemx

40,Its Great but ...,"The exhibitions are great at LACMA, but they need more tech art. They should look towards the Japanese modern art museums and bring in what really is modern art now. Rain room, crystal universe etc that was at LACMA was an year or two after it had been all over Asia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Umayrmasud

30,Too much under renovation,"There was an excellent exhibition of the work by an African-American artist, Charles White.

Be sure to check whether your favorite galleries are open before visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PacificNW_Explorers
50,Urban Lights,"I grew up in San Diego and went to college in Glendale. As I now live in the mid-west, I don't get to LA often. The Urban Light installation at the LA County Museum of Art one high on my list for my short stay in LA. 12-year-old installation at the entry to LACMA consists of 202 lamp posts from Anaheim, LA County, and Portland, OR. Created in 2008 by Chris Burden, the lights are turn on and off by an astronomical timer. There are 16 different designs. It's magical.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kay_Martin67
50,So much to see!,"My daughter is an art teacher, so while on a vacation to the coast we wanted to hit some art museums. We went to the Broad first thing in the morning, then we worked our way over to LACMA. We actually found parking very easily, just across the street and down a block or two from the museum. Yes, it was pricey, but face it, everywhere in a big city has expensive parking. When you walk up to the museum, you are right in the middle of the most Instagrammed location in California - the street light display. Everyone was all over it taking pictures - it was actually funny to see the amount of people doing more legit photo shoots versus the selfies. You would think that it being so busy it would be hard to get a picture without lots of others in it but it really wasn't hard.When we entered the museum we asked for a military discount, as my son is active Navy. They do give a military discount - BUT ONLY IN THE SUMMER. What's up with that? You only count if you visit in the summer, the rest of the year they don't care?The museum is actually in several different buildings, and you don't really know where to go first, so we randomly picked a building and went in. There were very interesting exhibits in all the buildings. The Broad Contemporary building had an exhibit that was literally 1/4 mile long - it wrapped all around rooms and rooms, it was so, so cool. We even got to ride in their ""freight"" elevator which is what they must use to move art - it was the biggest, widest elevator I've ever been on! After a few buildings we were pooping out, so it was nice that right in the middle courtyard area there were some stands where you could grab a Coke and some cookies or chips.Don't forget to go all the way through the courtyard into the ""back"" yard area - there are lots of great art displays back there too that you can have fun with and get some great pictures. All told, it was a great stop and we were glad to have had the chance to visit. We would recommend a stop if you are in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worleybird98

50,Museum worth seeing,We had a few hours to spare before checking in to our hotel and went to LACMA. Parking a bit challenging and expensive. We got to the Resnicj and the Modern Art buildings for 3 hours. The Resnick had two phenomenal exhibits of Central Asian ikats(robes) with a pretty good explanation of how they are made. Incredible colors and great fun. The Charles White exhibit of this very powerful African American artist. Many of his works were exceptionally moving and all were well done. The Sri Lanka exhibit is nice. I especially like the interspersing of photos primarily by British colonialists which placed the art in nice perspective. We went across to the Broad(?) Modern Art with 2 incredible exhibits. Rauschenberg s 1/4 Mile was just the credible. And on the first floor the Richard Serra’s Band made me feel as if I were in a Cathedral.Sorry I couldn’t see the rest f the museum. Certainly this is worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mtroner

10,Why bother - most galleries are closed but the admission price is full up,"A guide book description was that this was the best art collection west of the Mississippi. I couldn't tell since most of the galleries were closed - but the ticket office is open for full price (and for $25/pp pricey at that). Whole buildings and multiple floors are shut down. The current closures are: American Art, European Art, Art of the Pacific, Egyptian Art, Islamic, Japanese, Latin American, Asian Art, and Photography. Not much, right? Some (and I mean few) modern, contemporary, and special exhibits are open. And by the way, none of these major closures show up on their website. I felt completely ripped off.Don't waist your time, money, and the aggravation getting there if you were planning on seeing what was supposed to be a major art collection. Use your time to see The Broad (Downtown), the Getty Villa and the Getty Gallery. At least they were quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ableb2018
30,Most of the museum was closed and being packed...,"I am torn a bit here on my rating... Negatives: Most of the LACMA was being packed when we visited and I felt there was no warning that multiple floors and buildings were closed. They listed that they were reciprocal members with the Met, but then indicated when we went admissions that our membership was not one of the ones included. Ok, a little weird, and they were kind of snotty about it. (Really, museum members are your main supporters, a little comment along the lines of ""oh, we are sorry..."" would go a long way.)Positives: Outdoor sculptures are great. LaBrea is right next door. Picasso paintings were great - although pretty dark display area, especially compared to the Getty. (No clear signage on what you can take photos of and the docents will lecture your teens.) The museum has a great NEXTGEN membership for all kids under 18 for free. I love having teens be museum members young - it gets them used to the idea of supporting our arts early! As a bonus, every child member can bring an adult with them for FREE every time they come. How cool is that?

30,About as average as a museum can get,"Los Angeles has tremendous potential when it comes to having world class museums, but unfortunately, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is still struggling to find its footing in this arena. Its collections provide more of a 2nd class buffet of artwork covering every period and style rather than focusing on local strengths. Furthermore, the museum is undergoing a major renovation and virtually 60% of the museum's collection is unavailable for viewing. Of course this information is not shared with patrons when purchasing their tickets ($20 for County residents and $25 for non-residents of LA County PLUS $16 for parking in a parking poor area so you have no choice but to park at the museum). So if you are planning on visiting LACMA, make sure the collection you want to visit is there and available for viewing. Otherwise I would suggest going to either Getty Museums or just save your money and fly to New York City or Washington, DC to visit actual world class museums of art. TIP FOR LACMA STAFF: While you're undergoing renovations, at least making parking free for visitors so people don't feel burned. Use common sense and customer service etiquette and your patrons will have a much more satisfying experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ardashesk

It’s lovelh to know that most of those lamps once lit the streets of Southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenAspacio
50,"Great Museum, half is closed for remodel","First off, I highly recommend the cafeteria. Excellent food at the price. A wide variety of exhibits- something for everyone. I think they are going to tear down the Japanese Pavilion which is a shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearlessmsla
30,Good Art Museum,"I didn't not enjoy or know that 1/2 the museum is being worked on and closed to the public. I was a bit disappointing by that, but I will return. Great art to see any way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferjS3881WJ
40,Quirky art,Charles white exhibit was amazeballs! Loved all the other art as well. Parking is easy but traffic in and around the area can be backed up so try to avoid rush hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GayBear35
50,Chagall in LACMA,When I was there it was January 2018. Chagall exhibition was going on and it was just so dreamy and fantastic!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Landbridge
50,Fantastic exhibits!,Went in Feb 2019 to see the Charles White exhibit which was absolutely wonderful. I would urge everyone to see this moving exhibit by this exceptional African American artist of the mid 20th century. Also saw the exhibit The Outsiders which also moved me tremendously.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mac0620
50,Allow enough time,Between to drive to get there and a plan to beat the 405 traffic we did not have enough time to do this museum justice. There are at least three major buildings holding exhibits and a huge variety of remarkable art and special exhibits. Get there early (not sure you can delay your departure until the LA traffic eases). Lunch in the Ray’s and Stark Bar provides a nice break however.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgerhardt
50,Just the outdoors...,"We visited the outdoor art exhibits here because it was a sunny day so we didn't want to waste our daylight inside the museum. I can't speak to the indoor exhibits. We enjoyed walking around in the sunshine looking at the statues and exhibits outside.Also, if you haven't already had lunch, there are food trucks parked directly across the street from here (at least on weekdays) and they looked awesome. We would definitely return here on a rainy day to see the inside exhibits and grab a food truck lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrnMtnGirl79
50,Great museum,"My teenager said this was his favorite museum visit. Big, beautiful buildings were empty at 10am on Saturday. We only had an hour, so only saw a few exhibits but they were exceptional. Of course, it helped that our entrance was free due to reciprocal membership with the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunnyb6301
30,Disappointing! 3 main exhibitions closed,"We read many good reviews regarding LACMA and we're eager to visit this impressive art museum. We were quite disappointed that the Japanese Art Pavilion and the two stories of the Ahmanson building were closed. Although the other exhibitions were somewhat interesting, we went to visit this museum mainly to see the impressionists collection. We appreciated the architectural structure of the museum that was impressive. The closing of main exhibition has happened to us before in other cities and we believe a discount should be given when main attractions are not available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Multicolor
50,Remarkable Place,"We had heard the LMAC was worth the visit and we definitely agree. We didn’t have much time and just focused on the modern and contemporary art collections. The place is quite large, but very easy to navigate. It is a well-designed facility with informative exhibits that make the works very accessible to novices (like me!). The LMAC sets a high bar for a County-run art museum. We’re glad went and it was definitely time well spent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FEN_10
30,Just okay,"Maybe I didn't spend enough time here, but I thought that this collection was inferior to both The Broad and MOCA. Also the famous lamp post installation outside better in pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VancouverViolet
30,This museum from the outside shows us why artwork by committee can produce laughable results.,"In a city with world class artists supported by world class private money, this physical plant is an embarrassment. Sort of like LAX. Either too many decision makers or not enough. Either way, it doesn’t work. And it’s so ugly it’s hard to ignore. Gave it 3 stars for its collection and exhibitions",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J6114TVmarkb
20,Meh,"Not too impressed, although my sister (who was with me) said that she has seen great exhibits in the past. Perhaps it was just the current exhibits. Nice facility. I thought $25 was a lot for entry given that the exhibits were so disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jyunllc
50,Impressive,"I'm not in to art, but the light display is impressive. Lots of people getting pictures, me included.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sukhjiwanh
40,Instagram Location,"In LA for the Rose Bowl. We had our Millennial son with us and one of the places he wanted to visit was the Urban Light exhibit at the LACMA. He said it was one of the most popular Instagram locations in LA. We visited around ten at night and it is a sight to be seen. There is street parking behind the museum on 6th as there is very little parking on Wilshire. It was more crowded at the attraction than I expected and as my son mentioned it was crowded with young people taking selfies or posing in front of the lights. It is very dramatic at night when it is lit up. We drove by the next day and while impressive, it looks much better at night. Will try to hit the museum next time we are in town",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RodneyA889
50,To Rome and back with much space between,"A fascinating gathering of objects with a minimum of didactic information makes certain amazing pieces such as the several micro mosaics hard to comprehend if the viewer has not been to the V&A for more information on why the ancient buildings selected are always the same ones seen from the same angle. The rarely seen objects such as two copes of sublime craftsmanship could also have had a little more information about them and the culture that created them. Otherwise, LACMA always provides fine insight into Los Angels art collecting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rolfa832
50,Expansive collection,"The museum has a huge collection of classic, abstract and contemporary art. The buildings are beautiful as well. The layout of the museum itself is gorgeous. My favourite part was the gallery they had with 3d images. That was a visual treat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NidhiC_12
40,Never Disappoints,"So many buildings and special collections to see. We try and visit each time we come to LA, and always see something different. And, amazingly, we always find parking right along the street within a block of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Global-Villagerr
50,Free Holiday Mondy,"Wasn't sure if this was open on MLK day, but thank you Target stores for sponsoring the day. All kinds of great exhibits from Picasso to Rauschenberg.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C134FWmichaelk
50,LACMA,"CRusing drive in the middle of the night is fun, especially got to see some amazing light, like this 1, got to stop by and take some photo, a lot of people also was there, highly recommeded it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srengl2018
50,Always stop when friends out of town come in,Friends come from out of town this is one of the Museums on list to enjoy for a few hours. Easy area to find breakfast of lunch close by as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alwaystravel999
50,Interesting and unique,"Husband and I went here and it took us a whole day to get through. Very interesting and unique. It had a building for the art around the renaissance period and other “older” art. If you’re into more funky and more contemporary and modern art, this is where you should go instead of the Getty Museum. The most interesting art for us was the 3D exhibit. Hard to explain in words but the pictures tell all !Parking is expensive, as it would be in downtown LA. Try to manage without driving around !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leeanntb
30,Cool for pictures,"Cool for pictures, original, a interesting place for a quick visit, specially if is sunny.Then you can head to the auto museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grilopedrogrilo
50,always a fun place,always a fun place for a visit and at night you can stand in the street lights and take some cool photos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mitcho399
50,Garden and Urban lights,"Visited the grounds after being redirected for parking from the TarPits ( they share the grounds)I love the Urban Lights! I had seen them in movies and had no idea where in LA they were! It was a nice surprise to stumble upon them and that they are free to visit! Walked around the grounds because we had little time, but were treated to amazing works of art around the museum. Also, there is the wonderful garden with several of Rodin’s works! Worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tganuza
50,OUTLIERS AND AMERICAN VANGUARD ART,"Most art lovers and museum goers have seen enough impressionist art to fill an airport hangar and enough abstract expressionism to tuck in there as well. It’s good stuff and worth viewing, but almost any museum of note in the world, has a collection of these works. LACMA’s holdings of these works are very, very good—take them in. But if you are seeking a unique and refreshing change from these perennial favorites, then LACMA’s special exhibit, “Outliers and American Vanguard Art” is an absolute must see event (on now until March 17, 2019). The exhibit is presented in three parts: The work of early 20th Century folk art and self-taught artists; the second part begins in the 1960s with folk artists, many associated with the Civil Rights struggle, while the third part shows the continuing influence of outlier art on contemporary art. Some of these artist you will recognize such as Marsden Hartley, and Jacob Lawrence, neither of whom were untrained artists. But the bulk of the work presented here you will not be familiar with, or will not have seen. Herein lies the delight. You will be amazed at the wonder of this work and the talent of the artists who produced it. It will change your idea of what art is or can be. It will challenge your understanding of what the critical opinion of the art world has claimed as art. Here you will find startling creativity and diversity, humor and nuance, the flux itself. A few of my favorites: Judith Scott’s “Untitled 2004” (wool wrapped around refuse); Yasuo Kuniyoshi’s “Boy Stealing Fruit;” Rosie Lee Thompkins, “Untitled 1986 (velvet & velveteen quilt); Perley Meyer Wentworth’s “Imagination Serp;” Christina Ramberg’s “Strung (For Bombois)” 1975; Roger Brown’s “Contrail Crucifix;” Palmer Hayden’s “Cavalry Trooper;” Lucile Chabot’s “Anonymous Craftsman;” Horace Pippin’s “John Brown Going to His Hanging.” This is a magnificent and instructive exhibit and it may just change the way you see art forever after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oborozuki

40,It's Fun To Take Picture,"Driving the car to this place and we come to know that people just parked their car along the road to take pictures.

50,World class,The name includes ‘county museum’ which is slightly misleading. It is the county of Los Angeles’ museum offering world class exhibits. The general ticket gives admission to every part of the museum . The collections are exhaustive . Do wander without aim just to see what you can see. There is something for everyone here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinemL8442JB

Then go stroll slowly through the Museum and get to know the various artists, see which ones inspire you.

50,"LACMA is a True, World class Museum of Art",The collection at LACMA rivals the best of all major museum's around the world. They have a wonderful main building as well as two or three connected units that house a massive collection of all types of art. Also the Museum of Asian art is fantastic and worth checking out. This museum is really meant to be seen over two days. Also the Stark bar is a great place for a drink and app.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spertronic
30,Good- but overpriced,"The collection here is very good- there will be a piece by most artists you would expect/hope to see in a modern art collection, plus a few unknowns- but it is an expensive place. $25 entry if you're not a California resident, plus $16 parking, and the cafe is pretty extortionate too. Maybe it's that I'm used to London where most of our museums are free, but to me it seemed a lot in an already expensive city. Come if you're a big art fan and plan to spend a few hours to get your moneys' worth, but come by subway and try for a free entry day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/994natalies
50,Great art. Great location. Building were lovely,What a great use of art. From the elevators for the parking garage to the open community spaces in the buildings. Special exhibits were very well done. The permanent installations were lovely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture21613

50,So much to see!,"LACMA is a must see Art Museum with multiple buildings spanning all periods and styles with new exhibits on a regular basis making this a place you can visit over and over. And, if you can catch it while it is running, Metropolis, the giant 'Erector' set with over 1000 cars, trains, cable cars, etc. moving around it, is a must see for the kids living inside of all of us,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annmariefow

50,Very Large Museum With A Lot To Offer,I was not planning on visiting this museum until I saw it from the Le Brea Tar Pits. I was very glad I got to visit. It is a huge museum complex with a very large collection. The people there are very friendly and will point you to where to go next. I have been to many museums in several countries and I have never met museum employees that would occasionally great you as you passed. Apparently this is the largest art museum in the western US. Be prepared to do some walking. This is definitely a world class museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Briman747
50,Best Fine Art Museum in CA,"You should know that the 2nd Tuesday of every month is free (saving $25 for adult ticket). Second the place is worth $25 admission. I would give at least 2 hours, wear comfortable shoes for lots of walking & standing. You can take pictures as long as no flash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G5878WRracheld
40,Interesting When the Exhibits are Interactive,Don't try the Food but the Exhibits are always worth going to. It is always changing but when I attended with my sibling I was very entertained with the art being interactive. When LACMA has the Interactive Exhibits is when I highly recommend going if you have children or looking for something new to open your mind to new work/experiences.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danialab
30,good,We went and took photos of the urban street light art and the large boulder. We didn't go inside so can't comment on what is in there but the street light art at the front was very busy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108lauram108

50,Urban Lights was a Highlight!,"Since I've moved to Los Angeles, I've managed to make a trip to fun events, outdoorsy locations, and museums. LACMA was definitely funtresting! Worth checking out if you're in LA. The Urban Lights, however, was a fun experience especially at night. It's a busy spot with people of all ages and families. You can't miss out if you're in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P9361CSmariam
50,3D Museum is awesome!,"We explored the Urban lights out front, 3D museum and gift shop. It was all nice and a lot to view. There was also perfect picture opportunity at the Urban Lights (a must!)

Beautiful Urban Light is set in front of the new entrance to LACMA, is an orderly, multi-tiered installation of 202 antique cast-iron street lights from various cities in and around the Los Angeles area.

20,Caution - Many Exhibits Closed Sept 2018,"The LACMA can, in ordinary times be counted as a 'must see' in LA. However, be sure to check to see what is going on with respect to the exhibitions. This reviewer visited on Sept 19, 2018 and conservatively speaking about half the exhibits were closed for various reasons. The entrance fee is high in spite of the lack of exhibits. Parking in the LACMA lot across Wiltshire is a minimum of $16 for any length of stay during the day, making a visit very, very expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnH881
50,Stunning buildings and great exhibitions inside too.,"Well laid out exhibitions, and lovely surroundings, inside and out. Restaurant available and beautiful views from the upper balcony. Very sad to hear they will be demolishing the Art Deco buildings and replacing with modern ones. I feel the Art Deco ones are treasures in themselves and should be preserved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janepM8179YN
50,For art lovers LACMA is a must,In particular for impressionist and post impressionist art lovers this is a must. Just remember LACMA is closed on Wednesdays,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CountryAdventurer59
50,One of my Favorite Museums,"LACMA never disappoints... The permanent exhibits are great and the temporary exhibits are also wonderful. I prefer to go earlier in the morning, closer to opening, when it's not as crowded. It's a great museum, and good for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globetrotting-elissa
40,Good value,"Due to some planned renovations, a good portion of the museum was closed off. While that sounds disappointing, it actually made the burden of seeing as much as possible much easier. We started off seeing Urban Light, and moved on to some of the more modern art wings. There are quite a few rotating exhibits, one of which focused on 3D art (they give you special glasses for this one). I'd say that's great ""art"" for people who don't like art museums.The location of the museum is adjacent to the La Brea tar pits so you could easily see both in one day, if you're into that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catchat105
50,There’s something for everyone,There are many museums that are oriented to a specific audience but the great thing about LACMA is that there is really something for everyone. Wether you go as a couple in search of romantic paintings or with kids in search of things to keep them engaged or even just for those Instagram worthy moments this museum is a great choice. I personally like to stay on the look out for new exhibits as that always keeps it fresh and new.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1677CVjosep

50,Modern Art and More!,We had a very limited time frame on our vacation so we had to pick and choose wisely on how to use our days. We are so happy that we visited the this museum. We love modern art and there was plenty of that along with a lot of historical exhibits. The ironic lamp posts outside of the museum have been in a number of movies. We also visited the adjoining Broad Museum with more modern art and a Persian art exhibition that we enjoyed. I highly recommend this museum if you like modern art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Megson310
50,Must-go Landmark,stunned on arrival as you will be greeted by the art work right at the entrance. The infamous lamp post.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joey85244
50,Still the Premiere Museum Experience in LA,"LACMA is where you go when you want to be bowled over by the quality and variety of art on display. No one can do it in one day. The works range from primitive artifacts to extreme high tech immersive/participatory exhibits like ""The Rain Room"" and James Turrell's ""Ganzfield"". The permanent collection is dazzling, but the traveling exhibitions are also of the highest quality. WHatever you do Don't miss Metropolis and The Serra Installation on the ground floor of the Broad Contemporary Building. The sculpture gardens are great as well. The neighborhood is fun, and although food on site is pricey both delicious and pricey, there are dozens of food trucks. Save a bit of money with above ground parking across Wilshire. There is even street parking occasionally. I love this museum complex.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WesSDCA
50,Great Museum,"I am happy we decided to go to the museum one afternoon. There are several fun installations outside, and it also connects with the tar pits. Inside, there are multiple exhibits.

50,Always great and fun,Here is a great tip .... make sure if you have any kids younger than 17 to sign up for the nexgen kids program before buying a ticket . It allows your kid to get in for free and 1 adult . We have 2 kids so my wife and I can get in for free with this program . Also make sure to visit the Korean kids painting area. So much fun and free. They always have changing exhibits and today we saw the 3D one. It was fantastic and the wait for the 3D movie is worth it . Also the making of the car movie that’s fantastic. Parking can be about $16 and they have a Starbucks and their own cafe for coffee and beers nearby .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
50,glorious museum,The museum has everything you need in an art museum. It is a magnificent collection. The master painters and artists are exhibited. And what is most welcoming is the space - the physical space and the empty space between each painting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akdav5

40,ART Abounds,"LACMA is like a huge encyclopedia. Even when some sections are closed, you can always find something in the permanent or special exhibits to appeal as there are several buildings, a sculpture garden, several cafes, and multiple gift shops scattered throughout this campus.

50,Excellent Temporary Exhibitions,"LACMA is similar to other art galleries we have visited. Beautiful works on display in various exhibitions. What really stood out to me were the temporary exhibitions.When we visited, there was a particularly excellent exhibition on 3D imaging. It was well worth a look through!The staff were all polite and welcoming. Even though parts of the gallery are currently under construction, there is still so much to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blush1992
30,Many galleries closed. Bit disappointed.,"LACMA is supposed to be the biggest museum in LA. Compared to other cities in the US and the world I was bit disappointed. First many galleries were closed. Asian, Japan, Islamic art all closed. Second the building and rooms were somehow old, or not well maintained. Walls would be not clean. Picasso on a dirty wall...price on the other hand, 25$, is on the high end. Yet some art pieces are very nice and worth spending time here.I did not have time to visit other museums this time, so can’t tell if this The museum to visit when in LA or not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NabilBKK
50,Perfect for Hide and Seek,It is a very cool place to take a selfie. My toddler loves this place to play hide and seek.

But the place is nice just to seat down and enjoy the view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CholetzTravelDiaries
50,A beautiful afternoon,"You can spend a wonderful afternoon in this amazing facility, that would easy make for a couple of days of visit. Go with your friends and family, enjoy the courtyards and parks, the food trucks, the concerts and movies. If you have kids, make them members and on the week-ends they can take you to the museum for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crShelidon
30,Average Museum,"LACMA was very disappointing because lots of rooms were closed and the fee $25 was too much for what they offered. They have a couple of rooms with Picasso and other famous painters, but that's about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adyescu
50,Just Wow!,"What an awesome collection of great paintings (and modest amount, by comparison, of sculpture) by great artists...lots to see, some odd exhibits too (3D one so LA) in this spacious presentation. Artwork presented in several buildings. Takes some time to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
30,"Not worth it - don’t loose anything, u will never find it","I visited the LACMA during my 1st trip to LA. I liked the 3D gallery however others were closed. I guess my timing was bad as we got there and the only museum we really could thoroughly enjoy was the 3D one. Others were closed for refurbishment or installations. So money paid was not worth it.The other serious issue i had was that i forgot my spectacles, on a bench, where there are 2 security guards and CCTV but when i came back less than an hour after i forgot them, they were not there. I went to security for assistance but there was nothing on lost and found. I mean how do spectacles disappear in front of so many people and security, never to be found! I left my details but no one ever called me till date. Very disappointing!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Noks_Sela
50,"Beyond Dead Europeans, This Place is Wonderful!","The whole area is dedicated to wonder. There is too much to take in...even over a weekend. The new, the old, the strange, and the newly strange made to look and smell of antiquity are all waiting for you to oogle and wonder how the artist did it or why. I enjoyed this place on a sunny Sunday and it was hot! so dress appropriately. They offer sculpture you can touch, walk through, marvel at and laugh about. There are buildings and venues dedicated to Japanese work, media, Pre-Columbian finds...you name it! The experience is mind expanding and fun, inside and out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492nathanieln
40,Will be better once renovation complete,"Galleries closed for renovation so less good now than usual. Some nice modern and older art still visible. Open on Mondays (unlike the Getty Centre, or we'd have gone there instead!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pippadina2
30,Park-style museum with multiple buildings,"Good museum but if you like European/American art, the offer is somewhat limited. There is one floor with paintings in the Ahmanson building (a nice selection that starts with German expressionists and ends with American abstract expressionists, some Picasso's too). In the BCAM building, there is contemporary art, we especially liked the Metropolis but the other stuff was so-so. What is nice about the museum is that it is designed as a park where you can wonder around and enter several different buildings and also see outdoor art works. Given this approach, it is really disappointing that they have only one insanely expensive outdoor cafe where you have to be waited. Who wants that? A real mismatch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatthijsK67
50,Lots of exhibitions!,"There are six to seven buildings, lot of fun exhibitions to see. Worth to stay more than half day there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/969weis

50,Enjoyable,Visited the museum with two grandkids under four. The 4 yr old enjoyed the 3 D exhibit and the two year old like running on the grass and thru the open spaces. Had lunch outdoors at one of the cafes. Had a membership with a reciprocal museum and admission was free. Check your membership reciprocal plan before travelling and bring your card.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nowayfaye
40,Very good museum,"I personally don’t go to museums that much, however, lacma is a great place to go. Not to mention it’s famous lights, but also the arts inside are very nice. But it can be a bit noisy inside, which I think can improve.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P292RT_
50,Great !!!!!,"Out door jazz is just the beginning. Great museum, films and exibits for the whole family.... Programs for children, they can make their own art. Great grounds as well as being next to The La Brea Tar Pits for even more.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tishandjim
40,Unique Displays of Art,We visited LACMA on a beautiful Sunny Day in October after a visit to the LaBrea Tar Pits (they are side by side). The lamp post exhibit/display has become iconic and has appeared in some movies. On the side of the museum away from the road is a boulder suspended over a tunnel. If you stand just right you can take a picture where it looks like you are holding up the boulder. There are a few fun things like that mixed in with the art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiKershaw77
50,Great Place to Visit in L.A.,"We went to LACMA on Mother's Day. It wasn't planned but we're glad we came. It's a great place to visit when you're in L.A. There is already a lot to see just outside the museums like the giant big rock called Levitated Mass, the Urban Lights, La Brea Tar Pits and Garden, and nearby museums. One thing we didn't know is that there is a fee to get in to the museum. But we found a way to get in free and that is we had our kids join the Arts for NexGen. It is a free youth membership for anyone 17 years and younger. Kids get visit for free anytime and bring one adult guest for free admission. Simply visit the museum and enroll in person or you can do it by mail. When you're inside the museum, there are a lot to see and do and everything is done so beautifully and artistically. This place is great for the whole family to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melissa405oc

30,Underwhelming.,"There are a few good pieces of art here, but overall I was underwhelmed and somewhat disappointed. I heard good things about this museum, but I could be spoiled by the Louvre and other amazing one's I've been to. The price was 25 dollars and that was about $10 too much for what's here in my opinion. I would HIGHLY reccomend the Getty instead, it's free and has a much better selection with a beautiful view as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imrico
30,"Good, worth a visit","I visited this within 2 weeks of visiting the SFMOMA so I couldn’t help but compare. It’s certainly worth a visit, even if only to see the Picasso’s and the Rothco (take a seat in front and let it wash over you). The buildings feel a little gloomy and certainly not as ‘fresh’ as the SFMOMA but having said that it was a very pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. There were quite a lot of kids on school tours that day and I actually loved that. They were well behaved and inquisitive. Some of the floors are closed for renovation but there’s plenty to see. It just wasn’t quite as well set out - the Matisse ceramics are just part of the entrance and I felt some of the major works needed better positioning. Also earphones with information on the artists and their work would make the experience so much better. There are a few works on the app but not enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heather1997
50,10 Picassos + Kandinsky's,Admission for those out of L.A. County $25. Informative 3D movie and 3D comic presentation. Had an unexpected collection of 10+ Picasso paintings to view with unique 3 x Kandinsky paintings. Japan exhibit closed for renovation. Small China exhibit but nice Roman antiquities. Free street parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haigow8
50,LACMA,"Awesome museum. Currently their Picasso collection has a few from his blue period, worth a visit alone just to see those. Lovely collection of buildings, awesome curators of global artwork! Will visit everytime in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philboyett
50,A MUST VISIT PLACE IN THE HEART OF LOS ANGELES!,"Whether you want to pose (and EVERYONE wants to pose) at the brilliant collection of lamp posts outside the museum (which manage to be amazingly beautiful), or visit the great collections, or even stroll under what must be the silliest conceptual art in the nation (a huge boulder whose purpose still eludes me), or eat in the wonderful restaurant or just sip some good cocktail there, LACMA is a must-see place in Los Angeles. It's just wonderful. Take a full day - you'll need it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miriyamg
50,The Heart of Los Angeles,"LACMA has something for everyone and offers an entre to art for those who have never considered going to a museum and sophistication in curation of exhibits for long-time museum goers. The addition of City Lights and Levitate Mass brought pieces to LACMA campus which draw masses everyday who have to grab a selfie and while this has upset some, I celebrate the fact that these pieces and the growth of the LACMA campus exposes so many more to art every day and draws them in to consider seeing more. LACMA has truly become the heart of this city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aluweho
40,Good Europe Painting!,The museum is excellent. We had only two hours to explore. The Picasso paintings are wonderful. The Japanese building was closed. The European arts are excellent. The South America collections are good. The staff were friendly and helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BangkokSachse
50,Pablo Picasso’s Paintings,"This museum is currently displaying fine artwork by the well known Pablo Picasso amongst many others. We enjoyed the Persian/Iranian and Teotihuacan art. Your best photo opportunity is at the “Urban Light” by Chris Burden, located outside on Wilshire. The “Levitated Mass” by Michael is located outside and maybe it’s just me but I just don’t get it! It’s a rock, connected to two walls and you can walk under it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Homecoming80
50,Really cool place,Great museum with a lot of really awesome artwork/exhibits. My girlfriend and I visited on a rainy day and was able to kill 3-4 hours there without even realizing. The lights outside were really cool too :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sammeir
30,Expected more,"I expected more from an American city and museum this large. It's outdone by The Getty which also has good art, but also interesting architecture, view of the LA basin and ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFF34
50,Beautiful!,The LACMA or Los Angeles County Museum of Art is a must see for art fans on a trip to LA.As a local we often go for special events or just to relax and listen to Jazz on a Friday night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertyL9969PB
50,Best Museum in LA,Huge collection of western art including local artists. The building itself is worth seeing for its stunning architecture. A Big treat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariang293
50,Some very interesting objects of art,The museum consists of four separate buildings and each has its own type of art on display from pottery sculpture and painted articles. It was well worth a visit although not free to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/confused999
30,A ripoff,"I lived in Los Angeles for many years and always enjoyed LACMA. I understand that it's going through a makeover, but no one told me that a good 25 to 30% of the museum would be closed. And the changes that have been instituted since I last visited result in a very counterintuitive layout that's just plain frustrating. Furthermore, it now costs $41 just to walk in the door: $16 for parking (and there are scant alternatives anywhere near the museum), and a $25 admission fee for out-of-towners. Of course, they don't tell you about the closings until after you pay. Go to the Norton Simon, the Getty Center, the Getty Villa or the Huntington instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WithAnchovies
50,Top 5 Museums to Visit in L.A,Parking is easy and you can easily spend the whole day here. Its a beautiful well planned museum with lots of instagram moments available. Wander all the modern and classic art and stay for lunch at the cafe. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is wonderful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
10,No death mask or sarcophagus,our family was very disappointed to complete the tour to find out the two most import artifacts were not part of the exhibit and none of the literature stated it was not included even though they were in every advertisement.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericnO2935XF
30,Not great for small kids,"While visiting the Tar Pits we heard that the kids could sign up for a free membership to the Museum of Art and that we could get in for free. We decided to sign up and check it out. We did not walk through all the buildings but the one's we did were not appealing to our kids. I was worried that they would knock something over or that they were being too loud. There is an art room towards the back that had painting for kids, which both appreciated, but other then that I would skip it unless your kids are really into art or older.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacyCorbin
50,Great exhibits of modern and classical art,Impressive displays of art from different periods and styles. Great to combine with a tour of the Labrea Tar Pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K6992LIjohnl

50,awesome,worth going!!!!the urban lights i.e the lamp posts are the best thing for a perfect instagram #'s or just for having a good sight,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/505ananditam
40,A good experience,"We visited this museum because it was a reference in the culture of Los Angeles. The entrance ticket is kind of pricey (almost $30 dollars), but I think in the end is worthy. There are many galleries, and they are very well organized, many recognizable authors with interesting pieces. The staff is very kind and they solve any doubt that you could have. There are a couple of showrooms with private collections in which you are not allowed to take pictures, which was not that cool. Definitely a must in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rogeliot199
50,Impressive collection,The museum is huge--both the permanent and temporary collections are large. They had one of the largest collections of Picasso's work I have seen. Expect to send more than an hour at this place if you want to really enjoy the museum. It also has a beautiful view of the mountains.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/717armenk
50,Not to be missed!,"I have been coming to LACMA for years, and it keeps getting better. There are many worthwhile exhibits to see on any given day, and it’s guaranteed that you’ll learn and enjoy with each visit. Of course, it can’t completely be taken in with one visit, so choose a couple buildings and exhibits and focus on those. Besides the art indoors, there are many outdoor sculptures to experience. There are excellent cafe options, and a great gift shop, too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBOchoa
50,Wonderful Museum,"In all my times in LA this is the first time I've made it to LACMA, not sure why I waited. Beautiful facility. Loved the modern and decorative arts buildings, and of course the grounds can't be missed. A nice stroll over to the Tar Pits was great too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/augamber

50,One of the world's great museums,"I've been all over the globe, I love art, I make art. LACMA is a relatively underrated museum. I especially like their Native American collection, but the African collection is great too. And they have free Jazz on Fridays sometimes. Admission for LA residents Tuesdays and late Friday afternoons so go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haohuangpianist
40,Culture corner,Worth a chunk of anyone's time to admire the treasures. And even if you're just riding by on a tour bus there's that wonderful piece of artwork made from street lights down the years. Feast your eyes for free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryanedwin
40,"I'm sure LOTS of folks really like this place, but...","I'm obviously not one of those folks. My wife and I had just visited the Le Brea Tar Pits next door and had spent 2 - 3 hours overwhelmed with what we saw there. We decided to step next door to LACMA since we were in the neighborhood.Unlike the Getty Center that we thoroughly enjoyed, LACMA didn't do it for us. As a couple of folks from the Hills of Tennessee, we'd never been exposed to such things that were supposed to be art. It seemed like many, if not most of the exhibits were from people with serious mental issues, or were possibly paid by the government to create something ""Artistic or thought-provoking"" at taxpayer's expense.There's no doubt that some folks will find some of the exhibits interesting and awesome, but frankly it was a waste of our time and our $25 each.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickW11111
50,Free on Tuesdays!,Nice place to take a break from shopping and sightseeing. Quiet and chill. The museum security takes their jobs real serious. Not very friendly. You touch it... They will come. Other than that... Great place to get your culture on and take IG photos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChavSanti
40,Iconic!,Did not go in to the museum however we traveled here to get photos at the beautiful art installation of lights outside. Its a must see in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaFxx

Good selection of pictures and guides at hand to do different talks. We went specifically to see the Hockney Portraits which we had missed in London.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bab5y
20,"Over-priced, disorganized museum.",I say this is over-priced because half of the exhibits are closed. The artwork seems to be displayed in a very disorganized fashion. The map that you are given is not much help at all. Some parts of the buildings are worn and need repair. The wi-fi app gives very little information about the artwork that is shown. The Getty Center is much better!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/337frankw

50,LACMA,World class museum in the heart of downtown L.A. Convenient onsite parking. We visited the Hockney exhibit. On a Thursday. Practically had the museum to ourselves.

They do concerts at the plaza (jazz on Fridays during summer time), monthly concerts inside the concert hall (broadcasted by radio), movie screenings, installations. It is a cultural hub, no doubt. And in a nice surroundings!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/786malgorzatac
40,Brod array of art for all ages; definitely worth visiting!,"We enjoyed an afternoon of art and lounging through the galleries of LACMA today.We enjoyed Urban Light upon our approach to LACMA and proceeded into the galleries of German Expressionism.The art of the early 20th century Germans offered both history lesson and artists’ views of the masses from the cultural, political, bystander’s and victim’s views. Stunning, sobering, stark, and powerful.Video of Nazi propaganda film, “Olympia” and “Triumph of the Will” also showed the masses as conveyed by Hitler’s Nazi fascist regime.Very sobering in light of rising nationalism in today’s political landscape.LACMA offers such a range of galleries, exhibits, and places to take breaks.There is a lovely outdoor patio/atrium with a whimsical balloon monkey sculpture to keep the childlike joy alive in each of us!!The latte and cookies are also delicious!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2beans2000

Seems skeevie but LACMA won't tell you about it. Check BofA ""museums on us"". Not valid for special exhibits and only good for cardholder but definitely a good way to save a little cash and see some free art. Autopia is hard to find but worth checking the schedule and seeking it out while it's running every other hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimo213
40,Massive art museum!,"LACMA is HUGE. It's not just one museum - it's five or more separate buildings with different collections! When my friend and I decided to spend a long weekend in LA, we knew LACMA had to be on the itinerary. It has great permanent collections, from modern American art to Japanese netsuke to African art to Korean art, etc. Whatever period/style/media of art you're interested in, it's likely LACMA has it. We spent several hours at LACMA (they're open until 7 on weekend nights) and really enjoyed our visit!Why not five stars? You'll want to spend as much time as possible at LACMA because it's pricey. Admission for non-members is $25, and parking is $16. And, because it's so large, there are often many visiting exhibitions that opening/closing when you are visiting, which means that many areas of the LACMA complex may be unavailable during your visit. When you buy your ticket, they show you a sheet of paper that shows which buildings and floors you will be able to access.My friend had never been to LA before, and I had only been for a wedding (so I saw nada in the city). LACMA was a great choice for our first visit. It's a great museum with an incredible collection!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisrachelletx

50,"Artwork, Food Trucks & Free Events","Before you visit the museum you should download the free mobile app at mobile. The app provides explanations about the various artwork as you walk throughout the museum. It costs $20 for local residents and $25 dollars for everyone else. Helpful tips: After you pay for your ticket grab a map and Today at LACMA event calendar. Free stuff to do at the museum: guided art tours, listen to music, and activities for kids (On the day I went there was a pottery decoration booth setup). *There is an area to sit on the grass and have a picnic if you want to bring your own food. You can purchase food at the food trucks(across the street), cafe or snack bars. Special artwork exhibits that I liked included Art of Korea and The Gilbert Collection. Additionally, the La Brea tar pits are in front of the museum so give yourself plenty of time to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KoreanConven
40,Great Day,"The LACMA never disappoints. There are plenty of exhibits to explore while at the LACMA. I have been here twice now, over a year apart, and I have enjoyed my visits very much. I would recommend spending a few hours exploring this wonderful museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thesarahbella
30,Come Back Later,"This was my first visit to LACMA, and I came away underwhelmed.Most of the museum is scheduled to be demolished and replaced with a new facility. Considering how shabby and outdated the current buildings are, a new building is much needed. However, the price to be paid is that the much of the collection will be in storage during the transformation. Indeed, gallery closures have already begun, leaving much of the museum dark. I found it frustrating that even with over half of the museum closed off, the entrance fee was not adjusted. I'm always happy to support cultural institutions, but in its current state, a visit to LACMA is not worth $25.In a city with an embarrassment of cultural riches, skip LACMA until the reconstruction is complete. Time spent at the Getty Center and Villa (both free), the Norton Simon and Huntington in Pasadena, or the Broad (free) will be much more rewarding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pricelinetraveler
30,Overwhelming Confusing Disappointing,"There are several buildings with various kinds of collections and only a cursory guide. We wished to see movie posters, pre-Raphaelites, Impressionist, or modern. We stumbled upon one room with a few examples of German Expressionism; a hallway near an exit with a half-dozen movie posters; extensive galleries for the European collection, but largely religious themes, a few landscapes. The cafeteria was small with a salad bar, drinks, sandwiches, and sausage and potatoes, not even close to San Francisco, Toronto, Chicago, New York, or London art museum cafeterias.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertA332
40,Explore,"LACMA is an LA star and must see location. Despite encountering multiple closures the last 2 times we visited (once due to a building fire), with lots of different buildings there's a lot to explore and discover both inside and out. The new museum policy of not recognizing reciprocal memberships, if you are a California resident quite discouraging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
50,Excellent for Pictures,"It's crazy to know that there are so many beautiful places to go in Los Angeles; LACMA would be one of them. I got introduced to this place by my friend who was actually traveling to visit. We took pictures in the light post. If you ever need a place to go or a place to take pictures, this is the spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenneixv
20,full price for maybe half the exhibits,well with hopes high we attended the museum and paid full price admission! i do not reccomend this to anyone. we were informed that the museum was closing soon as in sometime in the next year or so to tear it down and rebuild a new and improved building. nice except half the exhibits are already closed and the ones that are there if they have moving parts well dont expect them to move if its a week day.....oh you pay the full admission but no one there to flip the switch to turn things on.......needless to say the day was well half a day and we will not be back.....a shame because we used to really enjoy the place......and just fyi if you buy a drink in the cafe the iced tea costs more than the soda???? why???? nothing made any sense but i do understand why they sell alcohol.......,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deandgeorge
50,Fabulous!,"You can't say you've been to LA if you haven't visited LACMA. The museum is absolutely gorgeous, so much variety, the buildings, stairs, gift shops, etc. are all really cool. A couple of things I was bummed about when I visited last week was that there were many rooms in transition so I wasn't able to view certain things, and that I had visited 2 other museums earlier in the day so by the time I got to LACMA I was worn out. I recommend doing ONLY LACMA in a day so you can really take your time and enjoy everything. A ton of photo opportunities! Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arissalovesart
40,Lovely outdoor space to refresh between exhibits,I spent about 3 hours here on a Thursday morning and really enjoyed myself. I liked seeing one exhibit in one building and then relaxing a bit before heading to the next exhibit. My only disappoint was that I didn't check what was open in advance. A lot of the galleries were half-closed at the time due to setting up new exhibits...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahn568
40,Cool for pictures!,The trick is getting a shot without anyone in it! This looks beautiful at night and is a fun jaunt from the museums!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnFallonstudio
40,Cheap and very entertaining.,Lots of things were closed on our visit but we still managed o spend 2 hours walking around and being genuinely amazed. We are not art expects at all. But there is plenty of cool and remarkable things to see here. Spend the time. Its worth it. Crowds were not bad when we went (morning),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomaspV6928EA
20,"Visit, But Do Not Become a Member","As members for many years, we enjoyed a number of fine exhibits and programs at LACMA, but things have changed. The museum is worth a visit if you are visiting Los Angeles and there are many things to see and do, often without cost, but be very wary of becoming a member! DON’T DO IT! Also, check your accounts if you used a credit card!One month ago, my credit card was charged $250 for annual membership , but LACMA never renewed my membership. Luckily I checked my online LACMA account before visiting. No one was available by telephone or email for several days. An employee finally responded in an email saying that the charge was a mistake and they were reversing the charges. I said that it was not an error and asked them to please reactivate my membership. It was not done, but they also failed to refund my membership. No response from Membership at LACMA. Not even an offer of a temporary pass while they processed the reactivation. I don’t know if the issue is incompetence or simply not caring, but I sent an email asking for a refund and reported the fraudulent charge to my credit card company.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/260kathryny
50,Great museum experience,"Fantastic permanent collection as well as visiting exhibits. Diverse art forms, suitable for artsy types as well as family and kids. The museum's outdoor plaza is a great space to hang out. Ray's is an excellent restaurant. Even better, the LaBrea Tar Pit is right next door. Can spend an entire day here and enjoy every minute of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dod2015
50,An educational and wonderful tour,This place is amazing and you can learn about historical arts amd also modern culture arts ans design about interesting stuff. A must go when visiting LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/navas2002
50,Beautiful and peaceful,"This place was amazingly perfect. The urban lights at the LACMA was beautiful, and all of the tourist wanted to saver their memories T this locAtion. The artwork within the museum were on point, and uniquely chosen.The outdoor art was perfect,which allowed families to spend plenty of time within the LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiffanyg972
30,"Enjoyable, But","...I was not blown away. I've stayed in mid-Wilshire on a number of business trips and have always wanted to come here...on our visit on a recent Sunday, many galleries were closed, including the Japanese Pavilion; and while the European art collection (say) is impressive, it's presented in a bit of a chaotic fashion. Our ($50) visit was in the wake of a (free) day at the Getty Center, which may have colored our perceptions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yog-Sothoth
50,Just like the movies,"This was our first stop from the airport and it didn’t disappoint. Though it was raining, we were still able to have fun and take pics with the lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jericaaa09
40,Metropolis exhibit is the highlight of this museum!,"Our party of four visited the LACMA on Sunday, 3/11/18. We were pleasantly surprised by the large crowd. Long ticket lines, so we got online to the LACMA Website and purchased our tickets there, and quickly picked them up at will call (saved us 1/2 hour standing in line). Adult admission is $25/person, and we rated this a fair price for this excellent museum.When we moved inside, a helpful staff person suggested we head over to the building that houses the Metropolis exhibit, as their would be a museum Engineer running the exhibit. What a great tip, this is the highlight of the museum. It is a miniature city complete with matchbox cars running on multiple lanes of plastic track, along with multiple trains/subways/streetcars running on tracks. It is hard to describe how cool this is, you really need to see it for yourself! Be sure to call ahead or look on LACMA website to see when they are running the cars/trains: otherwise it is a huge art exhibit.Another highlight is the Street Light exhibit located on the exterior of the museums. It is best to visit this exhibit at night, when the LED streetlights are lit up. Really a visually stunning piece of art, and very unique. Love all the different varieties of CA city street lights that were refurbished and repurposed for this exhibit. The same artist that created Metropolis created this exhibit!We found the cowboy photo exhibit to be boring. The pieces looked like photos that had been ripped in half, then taped back together. One large exhibit area was dedicated to a small sculpture of a boy cowboy. We could not appreciate this.The Korean art exhibit was interesting and different. The Chinese exhibit was tiny and boring.Tips if you visit: The LACMA parking garage is very expensive, at $16/car. We were disappointed that many floors of different buildings were under renovation, and one building was completely closed. The large rock exhibit was closed while we visited due to weather (it was raining, what was the issue?).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCbikerman
50,Huge,"Big place with several buildings, each building showing different art shows, definitively worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rjmoreira
50,An Absolute Must!,"This is a place that whether you are visiting LA or you are an Angeleno, you must visit more than once. The art, the architecture...the everything! Make sure to see Georges de La Tour’s The Magdalen with the Smoking Flame. My granddaughter found it to be interesting that is the painting in the sinked ship in The Little Mermaid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyMeetsTheWorld
50,Fine collections,"Not all the collections are open to view, which is a pity, because what is open is generally of high quality. I particularly enjoyed the paintings from the Dutch Golden Age, more comprehensive than the Getty’s collection, and the twentieth-century art, especially the German expressionists and the discussion of the Nazi attitude to them and to other avant-garde art. The collection of Mexican painting is very good, as is the show on Mexican and Californian design since 1915. This is a museum well worth spending several hours in. The LAMCA is not up to the standard set by New York’s Metropolitan, Washington’s National, or Chicago’s Art Institute, but it should not be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/operalover939
30,"We are members, but museum buildings are shabby.","My wife and I have been members of LACMA for many years, yet, as art museums go, it is a little disappointing. First let me say that they have a fine collection, yes, their special shows are very well organized and well curated, but their buildings are poorly laid out, and poorly maintained and the permanent collection is not well organized, and confusing to access. Docent quality is spotty finding that some are very knowledgeable and others not so much. On some occasions we've found the staff at the ticket window rude. Rest rooms are run down, and there isn't a good place to eat. The cafeteria is grim, and ""Ray's and Stark Bar"" is over priced, limited menu, and frequently poor service.We visit often on Sunday because we like the free classical concerts in the Bing theater, which are put on by Sunday's Live.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T2131JNrobertd
40,Thoroughly enjoyed our brief visit,We visited on one of those days when entry was free. We were a family with a six year old and we found plenty to see and to enjoy. We didn't manage to go everywhere but what we did see was very good. Parking was tricky - not sure where we were supposed to park the car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stotty24
40,Urban Lights exhibit,"Me and my gf came here at night, specifically for the Urban Lights exhibit. It was right outfront and wasnt too crowded. It was what any photos youve seen displays. But the actual museum is massive, and is on a museum-lined street. Lots of people taking selfies and family pics. Really nice area. Parking meters in the curb behind on Wilshire Blvd. Cheaper than their parking deck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craig1086
50,Wonderful collection of art,"While in LA at the end of last year I decided to do some siteseeing on my own. As a member of my local art museum it gets me into various art museums around the country for free, including LACMA, so I decided to visit, on a weekday.Hours are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday: 11 am – 5 pm, Friday: 11 am – 8 pm, Saturday, Sunday: 10 am – 7 pm, and closed Wednesdays. Admission for LA County residents is: $20 - Adults, $16 - Seniors (65+) & Students, Free for under 18, and free after 3 pm on weekdays. For non-LA county residents it's $25 - Adults, $21 - Seniors (65+) & Students and free for those under 18. Parking is an additional cost. They have a parking garage that costs $16 or there are several other parking lots or metered parking in the area, but you probably won't find any parking that's free.The museum always has long term exhibits. Right now they have: Hidden Narratives: Recent Acquisitions of Postwar Art, A Universal History of Infamy: Those of This America, Wu Bin: Ten Views of a Lingbi Stone, Richard Prince: Untitled (cowboy), Pinxit Mexici, 1917/1918: Looking Backward, Stepping Forward Exhibition Image, A Tale of Two Persian Carpets (One by One): The Ardabil and Coronation Carpets, Found in Translation: Design in California and Mexico, 1915–1985, Creatures of the Earth, Sea, and Sky: Painting the Panamanian Cosmos, Alejandro G. Iñárritu: CARNE y ARENA (Virtually present, Physically invisible), and Unexpected Light: Works by Young Il Ahn.The collections is spread across several buildings each with several levels. There is plenty of walking to be done, including crossing a street at one point, LACMA is the largest art museum in the western United States, with a collection of over 135,000 objects. Obviously not all are on display but many are. I thought they did a good job in the way they displayed them, using lighting and space well.When I visited I thought all the costumes from the Magic Flute were some of the coolest stuff on display. They were pretty amazing. There was a good amount of 3D art that I enjoyed as well, I liked several of the wooden pieces and sculptures.There are three dining options at the museum, a coffee shop, a cafe, and Ray's & Stark Bar with nicer meal selections and reservation options on OpenTable. I did not check out the food places nor did I visit the gift shop.I am so glad I visited, the collection was extensive and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jelico8
40,Great gallery to kill a couple hours,"We love art, and we love art galleries, but we can only spend so long looking at all the beautiful works. This place was massive! LACMA has an amazing collection, just make sure you bring your runners!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sloaner83
40,Urban Lights,"LACMA is a great museum with extensive art collections. However, I enjoyed the Urban Lights and the sculpture garden the most. It is located in the central LA and traffic and parking are always difficult. The best parking is the museum underground parking. If you have Bank of America debit or credit card, you may get in free on the first full weekend of the month. If you are a LA resident, you may be able to get free admission on certain days of the week. Check LACMA web site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heguangz
30,lights,"I went here specifically for the lights only. It was very busy with lots of people taking pictures. I went at night time. I walked here from somewhere else, and the neighborhood was a bit sketchy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HM543
50,Magnificant,"The variety of art you will find makes a visit well-worth your effort. Each time we've come, we've seen new pieces and had a completely unique experience. The effect of LACMA's multiple buildings is that viewers have less museum fatigue.The family art room is fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sawadee28
40,Better value for locals than layovers,"This is an enjoyable museum, with a great permanent collection and interesting exhibits, the hours are good (open til 7 on weekends), and there is parking you can purchase. It is also only half an hour or so in mild traffic to the airport.The best deals are for locals, which is reasonable. For those on layovers from a flight, it is a pricey when you add a $25 entrance fee to the $16 for parking. I probably won't come twice unless it is for the day instead of a few hours between flights. But for locals arriving after 3pm, admission is free! What a great deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahf702
40,A bit pricey but excellent collection,If you like 20th century modern art you will enjoy LACMA. The museum itself was a bit smaller than expected. It was $54 for 2 tickets and $16 for parking. A bit pricier than other museums we visited (in large cities).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JodiS145
40,LACMA,Really nice crowded tourist spot. Great for photos. Would recommend coming in the evening time or whenever its getting dark so you can see the real beauty of the lights. Recommend visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blue_Diamond21
30,"Half of museum is closed, but still charging full price!","I was very disappointed in LACMA, as it was one of the main attractions for my visit to Los Angeles. I'm much more interested in pre-20th century art, so I'm not going to rave about the Rothko's, etc. Much of the exhibit space is closed now, I assume for renovation. Thank goodness the European galleries were still open, and there was a fairly good selection, but the American art was not. The museum looks like it needs significant renovation, and I understand that it's going to cause disruption, but I resent paying $25 to enter and finding this out afterwards. If you go on their website it certainly is not pointed out (maybe in the fine print somewhere?). Go to the Getty instead, it's magnificent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebM377
50,Great collections and exhibits,"Although I am non-plussed by most of the LACMA architecture, the actual art collection is superlative. I was amazed by the modernist european holdings in expression and related movements. Some nice Rothko and Jackson Pollock. Very good Picasso's, and many other modern masters. I also took in the holdings in other buildings - ranging from painting in Mexico to Robert Erwin's awesome metal sculpture. I was truly impressed by the scale and scope of work in this museum. There are also many great outdoor spaces and places to relax in cafe style. Really remarkable and glad I could look past the relatively dull architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/profits101
50,A Neighborhood Classic,"This past Sunday, I visited the LA County Museum of Art again for the umpteenth time! I have enjoyed visiting this museum and attending its many seasonal events since my teenage years. The Marc Chagall exhibit recently ended but the current remaining exhibit on Mexico is phenomenal. Ray's & Stark Bar also offers delicious drinks and cuisine in a calming and breezy outdoor setting. The museum also offers Membership and/or free entries to families who may be recipients of California's EBT program. The museum is surrounded by greenery and park space behind and in front. It's a magnificent place for young children and families but also a great place for photographers, seniors, romantic partners and basically any visitor from any walk of life. Go and Enjoy It!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rokce
50,Children can get their parents/guardians in for free!!!,"We’ve been to LACMA twice and only just found out about the NexGen program (after we paid—oh well, it’s for a good cause). LACMA wants to encourage children to visit the museum frequently so they have a program in place that entitles each child under 17 to a free adult ticket of admission (for the parent or guardian bringing them) each time they visit!! You can sign up for NexGen in the children’s gallery, which we accessed to the right of the gift shop. Go straight there and sign your children up, they’ll get membership cards and lanyards within 5 minutes and then their accompanying adults can get in for free! You can read NexGen fast facts on LACMA.org.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryanne1981
50,Amazing as always!,"Having been a Docent for 20 years, every time I visit the museum and the grounds is like seeing the stars at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maruskaiv
40,Urban Lights!,"Due to time constraints the only parts of the the LACMA that we were able to see were the sculpture garden and the Urban Lights. While we only saw them during the day, the Urban Lights are not to be missed. A wonderful collection of streetlights of all sorts and sizes that made for fascinating photographs. Definitely have to go back to see them at night!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swtraveler15
50,Pretty Attraction,"It's defnitely a popular attraction, but worth the stop! Tons of people taking pictures and it's definitely a tourist stop. I would check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melisav72
50,Art is that which lifts the souls of men (and women!),"LACMA is huge - 6 pavilions full of art from all over the world, although the Japanese pavilion is currently closed for renovations. There is something to interest everyone in this place. Post-post modern to Asian, African tribal arts, to traditional and renaissance painting. Everything is at the LACMA.Additionally there are cafes, restaurants and a bar for refreshment. The prices range from affordable to insane, but the insane is so good you might want to treat yourself.Bonus: the tar pits are adjacent to the LACMA, with many interesting displays as well as a large grassy area suitable for picnics, letting the kids run around and enjoying the LA sunshine.A tip: The museum is open until 7pm on Sundays. Go later in the day and you will probably be able to find FREE parking on Wilshire or environs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanjeni2003
50,Great art and fun,"This was a great place to visit. I liked the scultpures the most. Overall it can be a bit crowded, which means it can be a bit noisy. In general you are able to walk around and explore the place with no issues. Restrooms are easy to find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9_Travelbug26
40,Day at museum,Excellent exhibits but not much for kids. We’d leave them at home next time. Parking was kind of tricky too. Great food all around which we enjoyed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomTravelers
50,Great place to spend a day,"I am not a big fan of LA but there are some spots I would recommend. And LACMA is definitely one of them. Nice collections, a lot of good quality outdoor spaces and good eating options on the premises. I think this is a really good option to spend a day for both couples and families with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexandruS23
50,Loved visiting with our reciprocal membership pass the Whitney,We really enjoyed this museum and were so happy to get in for free with our reciprocal membership pass from the Whitney museum in NYC. We thought this museum has a far more extensive collection that the MoMA given the sheer size of it. We enjoyed viewing all the art in one building but didn't take in all the other buildings because we went in the evening and were limited in time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoEden
40,go in night,"this place is fun, if you have time while visiting LA you definitely should go, i recommend going after the sunset when the lights are on, going in the day is good but you wont be able to get those nice pics.the best thing about it that it is free, and you will be able to find some street parking spot.time to be spent there: less than 30 mins",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anasjabeiti
30,Glad I didn't spend $25/person,"We attended the free museum day today and I was pretty disappointed that so much of the exhibit space is closed- I would estimate around 50%. If I had had to pay admission on top of the parking fee, I would have been pretty irritated. The quality was there - just not much to see right now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lupita1868
50,Great museum,"My daughter needed to visit museum to view paintings by Spanish artists for extra credit. What a pleasant surprise, we've never been her but would always head to La Brea tar pits next door. There are about 5 buildings to visit with several floors and rotating exhibits. We could have spent hours here with all they have to see. Famous painting by Picasso, Diego Rivera, and then the French artists. I'm not much of an artist but I was very impressed with the other artwork. Will have to go back as we only made it to 3 buildings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twinmom8
40,Neat Street Light Display,"I have visited this place 3 times only at night to see the LACMA Street Light display. I've never visited the actual Museum during the day while it's open so I can provide any insight what the Museum has to offer for the paying customer.The street light display is amazing because it's art using old street lights that would've been destroyed or thrown away. It doesn't matter what time of night you visit you will find many other people visiting even after midnight. When we went there it was around 1:30am and there were about 25 other people there. We went there hoping to get photos without anybody else in the picture and that wasn't really possible. There are too many people who want to take endless ""selfies"" unfortunately. There is security there at all times so you feel safe there even after midnight.The light display is a very unique attraction and it doesn't cost any money to see and parking wasn't too difficult and I don't know how much the fee is to pay for street parking because we didn't pay because of how late it was. There was another interesting building across the street that was worth taking photos of that was lit up in red (I don't know the name of this building unfortunately).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelLong1963

50,An LA Must See,"The current main exhibition, Found in Translation: Design in California and Mexico, 1915–1985, was an rare treat of so many objects, many unknown to me in this context.

40,For all lovers of art in its many forms,"The major art museum of Los Angeles, one of many. adjacent to the La Brea Tar Pits, it represents a diverse collection of classic and contemporary art contained in a number of individual galleries. It is reachable by auto, bus and taxi. Excellent on site restaurant.Best to allow an entire day and check for rotating exhibits..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesv8
40,A must-do for the art fans,"This was one of the main points in our trip. The museum is not expensive and offers a variety of interesting exhibits. I was particularly amazed by the number of Picasso's pieces they have! If you get tired of walking, they have a little cafe, where you can chill and have a snack. After your snack, I highly recommend to go all the way to the top to have a look at the Hollywood sign :) And last but not least, remember to check out the lights installation in front, as well as the levitating mass at the back, outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martynak571
50,Lovely Museum,I visited this museum many times with my 2 children from the ages of 3-5 to 8-10. They loved it every time. There is plenty to see and there is a great area for kids to do hands on art. You can also see the Tar Pits while you are there. One of my favorite events is the Children's Film Festival that they host every year. Look uo the NextGen Pass. It allows your child (till they are 18) plus one adult to get in for free all year long! The best.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happyowl97
30,Struggles to be a Better Museum,"Im an LA native- but i have lived in many other cities. I would love to say that LACMA is my favorite museum - cause its one of the principal museums of LA.....but it just isn't. Its a mess in more ways than one. Its a confusing jumble of mix-matched buildings. Internal signage is terrible making it frustrating to find exhibitions cause you have to walk in and out and through so many buildings.I do acknowledge that they are really stepping up their game when it comes to better special exhibitions. And hopefully, that massive new wing they're planning on building will be the proverbial game changer....but for now? I go there reluctantly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenlP2940XU

30,Underwhelming...,"Compared to the size of the place and the variety of exhibits, there isn't all that much to see. If you are looking to get a taste of this and that, LACMA delivers and if you are a student there are some good stalwarts to see in person. However if your tastes lean more toward modern art, better to reserve entry to The Broad. The lights aren't as gimmicky as they look and can provide some good photo ops if that's what you're looking for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmznoh
40,Interesting Collection,The LACMA has an interesting and eclectic art collection. I liked the early and modern Europe artwork on display.

50,LACMA,"The Los Angeles County Museum of Art5905 Wilshire Boulevard Los Angeles, CA 90030A great day can be spent here for those who like to browse through some wonderful exhibitions of art. Set out in numerous building, all with a couple of floors, it is easy to lose yourself for longer than expected. There is a cafe on site, along with well appointed outdoor eating areas for quick bites or lunches or even a quick refreshment on your way between buildings. There are also restrooms of course.Between LACMA and La Brea Tar Pits (which are situated within the same complex) allow most of the day if you intend on visiting them both.Naturally, it will be up to you and what time you can spare but I think trying to rush through either of these two attractions will leave you feeling as if you've cheated yourself and wished you had spent a little longer here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heatm27
50,I love the MOMA,I love the MOMO. There I said it. What is not to love. Besides it is next door to the Tar Pits. The place is a wonder and you will love your time spent there. To do it well make sure you have several hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GreenPowerGuy
40,Lits of arts and so called art to see!,"You need most of the Day to see it with a break in between for lunch or coffee there are many departments don’t miss them the only one if you have to miss would be the modern contemporary Art and some of the photography that maybe should not have been there but the rest is worth seeing worth admiring and if you want you can take a guided tour. Don’t miss out on the Japanes building, specially the building architecture itself. Remember the Tar pit and natural history too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barry684
40,A Very Big Museum,"House in seven building surrounding and urban oasis the museum is BIG. I took in the third floor of the Ahmanson Building that contains European Art. One room held a small collection of Impressionists, many of the grand artists, but minor works. Religious and Dutch Art is a strong suit. The second floor has modern and German art. The patio near the main ticket counter and checkroom is a wonderful place got chill, includes free wifi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brwydave02
50,"Love, Love LACMA",One of the great museums of the world and a must see when you’re in Los Angeles. The property is huge so make some time to see the beautiful exhibits. We were there for about three hours and it wasn’t enough time. We will return!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLJSF

50,There's ALWAYS something exciting going on!,"Whether it's jazz night or a crazy installation by James Turrell or photo ops at the lights or under the Levitated Mass, there's always something at LACMA. You can dine at the restaurant, have drinks, have coffee at the cafe, visit numerous exhibits, and you still won't run out of things to do! I love LACMA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YazMaTaz
50,Very Satisfying,This is one of the must visit places if you are in and around Los Angeles. Would recommend going at night and with your cameras.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenDunk
50,Who says Los Angeles doesn't have great museums?,"OK, so it's not the Louvre, Uffizi, or the Met, but for this backwater known as Los Angeles it does offer world class exhibitions as well as a strong collection of it's own.Beautiful setting, great book store, fine movie events all add to the overall experience.Every out of towner I've ever taken here walks away amazed at the quality of the art.Only caveat, it's spread out over a broad area and for seniors or wheelchair folks it can get tricky maneuvering about. There are elevators and ramps, it's just a large space to get around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tvvvv2016
50,Fantastic,Fun and beautiful place to hang out take pictures and just to see in general. I would definitely come back and recommend to anyone,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristobocanegra

40,Always Stimulating,"The permanent exhibit has a lot to offer, and the special exhibits are amazing. Sometimes they even sell out. But my favorite thing to do is picnic and listen to Jazz during the Friday summer concert series. The musicians are incredible and it's free. There are two great places to eat. And a nice bar. The people watching never fails to entertain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soulart99
50,Interesting and popular,So nice to come there at night. All these lights.. It is amazing and so nice. This place is so popular. People from everywhere enjoy coming and taking pics. This place is special and so different.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthogx

50,Our favourite always,We love LACMA. Whatever they’re exhibiting is always of the highest quality. Their permanent stuff is amazing. But today we enjoyed tremendously their exhibition of CHAGALL AND MUSIC. the display of his artwork and costumes for 3 ballets and one Opera. If you can get to LA before it closes in mid January. Highly recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigvicSydney

50,Didn't go in but went twice to the outside,"The first day, we planned to go but ran out of time, and just walked around the sculpture garden and the Tar Pit area. The Calder fountain sculpture was worth the visit. Then, after reading about how fun the Urban Light exhibit is at night, we made the effort to stop by on our way to dinner. It was worth it! Really fun and great pictures taken!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elebau
40,Decent Exhibits & Good Jazz in the Summertime,"Over the years I have been here many many times. The Exhibits are generally decent. Some have been stellar, such as the Frida Kahlo exhibit. The last time I went this past summer, I don't even remember the Exhibit. I just remember having good coffee at the coffee place near the entrance and enjoying the jazz outside. If you are going to visit a museum for the actual art, I prefer the Broad or MOCA downtown, but as an overall family experience with a place to eat,have coffee or listen to music, LACMA is definitely a solid choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5193HZmelissad
50,What a Gathering Place!,"Just to get a sense of the LA community, this set of museums is very worthwhile. Set on many acres, with several distinct museums, you will see locals there all day every day. I overheard someone saying that they drop in every day at lunchtime. We were there on a Tuesday, and there were many schoolchildren, so arrive early if you want to get to exhibits before them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sewkap
50,A world class museum in LA,LACMA is an encyclopedic museum in the Mid-Wilshire section of LA. The permanent collection is superb and exhibitions in the Resnick Pavilion and Broad Annex are typically innovative and groundbreaking. There is an excellent bar on the premises and it's nearby several other attractions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/330ri

50,"Trendy, but still fun","You probably have seen hundreds, if not, thousands of photos of these famous lights on the exterior of the museum. Even long after the museum closes, there are people taking photos and skateboarders cruising around.Yes it's extremely trendy, but just embrace it and check this place out. Besides the lights, there are typically thoughtful and creative exhibitions within. Highly recommended if in the LA area!I am a travel photographer so feel free to follow along for other travel tips and photos on IG: @neonorthSafe Travels Friends!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeoNorth
40,Typical Museum,"I'm glad we came here. Lots of cool things to take pictures of, but at the same time, just another art museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jend859

50,Loved this place!,Visited a week ago while I was in L.A and unfortunately was only able to see the Urban Lights since we had to fly back home. We came during the day but at night it is even more beautiful. Been wanting to visit since I have seen this spot in about every movie. Spend sometime here there is parking across the street for free for about 4 hours. Worth a visit for sure!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404gretell
50,A Must Visit in LA,"You could spend days in this museum. We only went to the building with European art, and only had time to see a fraction of a very good collection. And there is much more in other buildings. It is not easy to get to, at least by public transportation. It probnably akes sense to drive or take Lyft.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrinceConsort
40,Amazing,"A beautiful museum that has several building in a campus like setting. They charge $16 to park in their parking garage.They have an incredible art collection, especially modern with quite a few Picassos.They also have a large Asian collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rschagrin
50,The BEST in Los Angeles,"Strolling through the many isles of art offerings at this wonderful museum is such a treat. Colorful, meaningful and you see the kindness and passion that is put into each of these creations. I imagine myself trying to create such a piece, but it doesn't come through to the hands. The special events that is offered in film, theater and music is so wonderful. The Latin, Jazz, Classical events offered on the weekends at special seasons, showcases some of the best in their field. Parking is easy, prices are fair and what you get for the price is super spectacular. Enjoy the restaurants while on your day of treating yourself to culture. Take a stroll and enjoy. I highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaVerneR116
50,Beautiful,"A friend of mine has asked me to come with her to see the place on daytime, although she already was there at night time which I missed on the last day of my LA experience. I was not regretting to come back in daylight with her. Amazing architecture. Lots of people who pose for a good shot and we did had a fantastic time Thanks LA for the lovely memories",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melds67
40,Fun Place to See,"I was intrigued by the fun lamp posts they have outside. We paid for admission and spent about 1.5 hours walking around. I loved seeing all the different exhibits. If you are in the area, I highly recommend stopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilymO4135ZQ
50,Amazing,It feels like your on the other side of the space? Well it’s a must visit place when you come in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheuk_Miming
50,MUST Visit,If you ever visit Los Angeles. You must stop at LA County Museum of Art.Please remember to come to this place at NIGHT ONLY. As the light pretty cool. and not realy nice if you visit during the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jumaxel
50,LACMA,Really nice museum. You can go online and purchase tickets (can also purchase onsite). There is an IOS app for LACMA which is great. It provides a complete layout and schedule of the various exhibits and which ones require extra fees. When you arrive go to the ticket counter & you will be asked to provide proof of your online purchase. You will get a receipt and a map of the exhibit halls. If you have extra time the LaBrea tarpits are adjacent. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sizzam
50,Nice Museum,I ve been there once and I wanted to go back because the place is very nice and it was fun spend one hour taking pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheGirlOfTerezKorut
50,Worth every penny:),The best place to go is on a Sunday just because traffic in Wilshire Blvd. is very bad during the week. Parking across the museum is 30-40$ all day. There is so much to see and learn and I will rate my experience a 10. They have special presentations on the weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alincali
50,All kinds of arts,"From the big rock in the outside to all kinds of arts inside of different buildings and many city lights to take pictures, this LA museum can compete with New York museum. You may not have enough time to see in one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pldjm
30,Where are the California Plein Air artists?,"We visited here 20 years ago. Much has changed but it's still not so impressive.The title cards need to be much more informative. Heavy on the mediocre European art, and of course, the ""hipster"" stuff. Yawn.This seems like the perfect place for California impressionism , and Western and American sculpture, as well as Western indigenous art. I was disappointed not to find it. Where is it? Didn't have time to go to the new Broad. We parked in the LA Brea Tar Pits parking lot, which is much closer to the art museum than the designated parking across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HanaHouHula
50,Always great exhibits to see,"We go here every time we are in LA. This time, we saw some very interesting exhibits that were part of the PACIFIC STANDARD TIME show all over Southern California. I especially enjoyed Design in California (1915-1985) and Playing with Fire: Paintings by Carlos Almaraz.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelinerose5
50,Maze of ancient to modern art,There are many buildings in the compound. But there are different entry fees for each. We chose the basic entrance and this was an amazing trip within the building. It is multi-level and with many access to the different works of art on display. It felt like going through a maze with each access opening to varied pieces of art. Art lovers will need a whole day to appreciate the pieces on display. There is a small eatery outside the building to satisfy a hungry or thirsty visitor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lanaval
50,LACMA is CHILL,"A wonderful spot to spend the day, look at some art, wander in the garden, grab a coffee, and imagine Saber Tooth tigers. Great for families, dates, or solitude.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelf800
50,13000 artworks dating from past and to the present,"Explore the entire span of art history. We arrived 1 hour before closing, which meant that we only saw fragments of the museum.The positive was that it was easy to find parking, and there was no crowd either at exhibits as well as the cafe.Focused on the Art of America's Building as well as outdoor installations.Guaranteed return visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,Got lost on the way to the tar pits,We parked in the underground garage and came to Lacma the LA County Museum of art! Six buildings worth the $15 per adult cost! We walked over to the tar pits and saw all of the outdoor features for free! I would've liked to see the video but we missed the last showing at 4 PM. The cost to see this museum is $12 or $17 if you include the 30 min video! Great outdoor covered bar where we watched the Friday night jazz show! Suggest sitting here ordering a bottle of wine if you're not with kids!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/387clintv
50,Beautiful must see,This art display is a must for great photo back grounds while visiting the museum area of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missskyangel
50,A great way to spend an afternoon,"Beautiful Concert on Sunday - a must do if you are in the area.. and the light display is magical, too, if you have the right camera to take the pictures. I really appreciate the descriptions on the modern American art section. it is well written for beginners like me to start learning about each art piece.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewH503
50,Excellent Museum to Visit,A huge collection of a variety of art from various periods. Plan on spending at least six hours to do the exhibits justice. And there are a number of famous pieces in the museum that will leave you pleasantly surprised. Well worth the visit. And their free concerts? Wow! Some top names in jazz for free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/316per
50,GREAT PLACE TO VISIT!!!,"So much to see, wonderful places to discover and explore, new editions to LACMA are really cool!! Lots to see in one day, wonderful contemporary art, great exhibits and spaces plus La Brea Pits adjacent is also great to explore and walk around park which is dog friendly as are outdoor spaces in museum. Multiple eating places, wine bar, sitting areas, beautiful landscape and nice sculpture garden. Can't wait for Academy Awards museum next door, which is under construction and looks amazing. Great place to go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanLosAngeles
50,Got to spend more than a day here to see everything,"This place is awesome! I suggest coming for more than1 day to fully enjoy this place or at least get here very early..even then though you won't be able to fully see everything here. The food is good too. If you are a local, they even have discounts. You can find free parking in the nearby neighborhoods if you don't mind doing that thing called ""walking""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LCexplorerTX
50,Fine Art Museum,"The permanent collections are large and varied, really too much to see in one day. The modern art collection seems especially strong, but there are at least one or two examples from most of the Old Masters, Impressionists, and Post-Impressionists too. Temporary exhibitions are excellent. Most recently we saw a really fabulous exhibit on Marc Chagall's work on set design and costumes. The Japanese Pavilion is unique and beautiful. We didn't try the cafe, but the coffee shop was fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tallpinesCO
50,Excellent,"Really worth a visit, great contemporary exhibitions, atmosphere and space. The location is very central, there is plenty to see for half of the day or even for the whole day if you do it slowly and really enjoy reading about the artists. There is also a program for events, so you should also check if they offer anything else besides the exhibitions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anaismalli
50,Excellent General Art Museum,"This is a well-known museum, and deservedly so. It's spread out over about 7 buildings, all within a short walk of each other, many with covered walk-ways. For my interests (modern art), I found it to be excellent.I had lunch there, quite good. Maybe I got lucky, but I did find on-street parking near the museum.It's also adjacent to the La Brea Tar Pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyb993
40,I really only went for the outside!,"I have always seen travlers post the lightposts outside of the museum and I had to seee them at night. Such a neat experience, i loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tthetourist
30,a nice museum competing with great museums,"This museum has the unfortunate position of competing with the Getty, the Norton Simon and others, and comes in behind that distinguished group. The buildings and collections would be wonderful in most other cities, but not LA. Cannot recommend this attraction if you have not seen the others or various interesting things in Southern CA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DocSag
50,Huge Museum in multiple buildings with excellent collections,"We spent a rewarding afternoon touring four of the buildings housing various collections. German Expressionist, Modern Art and the American Art Collections are very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/230jerryj
30,"Decent, not spectacular","The collection is nice, but not great, and a few exhibits are currently closed. If you go, make sure Metropolis is running, as that was easily the highlight for me. Photo attached.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanbM9969TQ
50,Beautiful place to admire art,"Well organized, interesting. Friendly staff. Take one of the free tours! Good for a 4-5 hour activity. Nice restaurants inside. Connected to TarPits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuditE85
20,A disappointment in LACMA,"I had high expectations of LACMA, located in a major metropolitan area where there are people who have great expertise in the arts, are culturally minded and have the capital to deliver a great museum, but I was disappointed. The buildings were tired, not particularly clean, and with a fair amount of deferred maintenance. The elevator floor in one building would sink in certain areas if you stood there; the same was true in the Japanese pavilion in front of one of the exhibits. The LA Cafe had a reasonably OK menu, but the staff there could have worked in any no-name diner ...no personality and the dining area, like the rest of the complex was tired, the windows cloudy and looking like they could use a good washing. I was expecting something fresh and bright with some excitement and rhythm, but it was lacking. It wasn't that they were rude, they just lacked energy and some zip...just like time clock punchers! The exhibits I saw were not particularly interesting or extensive for a major metropolitan area museum. The American decorative arts section had a few nice pieces, but in style and design conscious LA, I would have expected much more. I was thrilled to see the ""made from life"" bust of George Washington by Jean-Antoine Houdon, the famous 18th Century French sculptor. After viewing it I later noticed three young ladies rather frivolously kidding around the bust as one was taking pictures of the others. At one point one of the ladies posed with her arms around the bust. Where was the guard watching out for this priceless and important American piece? At some point when I am back in LA, I will give the museum another try and hope that my expectations will be met.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/59RobertS59
50,Great TIPS to enjoy this MUST SEE Museum,"Hello everyone! So, thinking about visiting this amazing museum? Please do! Below you will find my tips and tricks to getting the most out of your visit.TIP #1 PARKING The underground parking at LACMA is $12, but if you’re planning on just popping by for a few hours or don't mind coming back to plug in coins, take advantage of the parking meters on 6th Street. They’re shaded by trees and have easy access to the backside of the museum.TIP #2 Get your selfies at Chris Burden’s iconic cast iron street lamps known as Urban Light. These are just as cool during the day as they are at night. But be sure to check out the artist’s lesser-known but equally impressive Metropolis II, where every hour, approximately 1,000 toy cars race through the dense network of buildings!TIp #3 EATING! A really awesome thing to do that not alot of people know about is the Cur-ATE series, where ArtBites founder Maite Gomez-Rejón connects the dots between food, history, and art by taking guests on a themed gallery tour that concludes with a four-course meal inspired by the evening’s art at Ray’s and Stark Bar. If that isnt your gig there is an AWESOME cafe that is cheaper and quicker!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinbV8325EN
50,Must go!,We go lucky and didn't have to buy ticket and reserve to get in. It was so fun! This art museum is model and fun. I would come back again when I come to LA next time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IcyK
50,Eclectic collection,From century old sculptures to renaissance paintings to a fast paced miniature metropolis ... the LACMA had loads to impress diverse creative interests! A half day well spent! Then we headed half a mile to the original Farmers Market (near the Grove) for a fresh bite to eat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/turquoise-starfish
50,SPECIAL LACMA SEASON: PLAYING WITH FIRE: PAINTINGS BY CARLOS ALMARAZ,"This is a great time to visit LACMA. It is an encyclopedic art museum, with great collections of modern, contemporary and historical art of many regions.It is also a great place to hang out. Chris Burden's iconic sea of lampposts entitled ""Urban Lights"" is a favorite photo opportunity in Los Angeles. The Museum is now a destination and has a great ambiance. Ray's bar and restaurant in the courtyard is a place to hang and the La Brea Tar Pits and the George Page Dinosaur museum just adjacent. The art collection is magnificent.However, now is a truly unique time to visit the museum.This year is the museum has a beautiful show of Carlos Almaraz's paintings entitled Playing with Fire: Paintings of Carlos Almaraz. As stated by KPCC's Marc Haefele this show is ""probably the most comprehensive show of Almaraz’s work ever presented. Maybe it's the most impressive manifestation so far of Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, an institutional attempt at an exploration of Latin American and Latino art and the way it affects and is affected by Los Angeles.""This show has some of the most beautiful, magical and mysterious paintings ever painted of or in Los Angeles . As Mr. Haefele stated:"" 'Playing with Fire' will truly shake up your mind.""I have been waiting since 1989, the year of Carlos' Almaraz' untimely death to see a show of his work this extensive. It has been worth the wait. Don't miss out on this opportunity, the show will remain open until December 3, 2017.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rono776
50,Worth a visit - plan a half day,There a many building to this museum and it is located right next to the La Brae tar pit museum. Plan the whole day to see both places.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chh19
50,Lots of art,"This museum will be partly closed for the next couple of years in order to build a new building, but there will still be exhibitions and permanent collection to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveledfordecades
50,particularly liked their impressionist painting collection,The museum has a number of buildings and a variety of categories of art on display. The buildings are well lit and accessible. It was a pleasure to walk around and tour the various areas. The layout appeals to guests of all ages.The location was easy to get to and is located in a combination residential and light commercial area. I have been there several times in the past five years.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H44AEgabrielr
50,The Chagall exhibit,"Wow. Never knew about Chagall's involvement with the theatre and costume and set design, so was in awe of the sketches and actual costumes on display. And the portrait gallery with The Dance and a few other incredible paintings, some from private collections, was the icing on this delicious cake. While the exhibit isn't huge, it's well curated, interesting, and a fantastic way to spend Labor Day afternoon. Bravo LACMA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhiladelphiaPhillip
50,Always great exhibits,"I have had memberships for years to this museum. A wonderful place with top notch exhibits. I no longer live in the area, but recommend it with no hesitations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenfA6450AI
40,Easy but basic,I enjoy visiting LACMA but it isn't as stunning as other LA museums. Urban light is a must for a photo opportunity and the specials exhibits are usually decent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C6916QGandream
50,"A place to see, a place to stay","The LACMA is not the most famous museum in LA, yet this place is really worth the trip. I have been there on my way to the airport because I was a bit in advance and had two hours to kill. And guess what... I loved it and I was very surprised but the quality of their collection..You should give it a try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/771michaeli
50,Fantastic,I love this museum!! It's really big so you need time if you want to visit all the exhibitions. For me the best thing to do is to go in the afternoon so when u finish your visit it is dark and you can take excellent pictures with the Urban Lights!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/florash
40,HUGE WITH ECLECTIC COLLECTION,Neat place with some huge outdoor art installations. Then large contemporary collection and then the fine art collection. Very many Picasso's which was cool. It does cost money and the parking is also expensive. I am use to museums being free so I am a little jaded. It is an interesting place and worth a visit but it is certainly not The Met in NYC.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cymcym
50,Urban Light display!,We just happen to drive by this public sculpture of lamp posts in the evening and it was spectacular. It is free and a great place for anyone to hangout. We just stopped at the roadside and spent a couple of minutes enjoying the sight. Visit if you are in the Wilshire Blvd. and you will love it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/222sridhart
40,Fun with Children,"We had a few hours and the shows were very well presented. Also everything is very children friendly, it was easy to explain and made them read the information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArzuUzel
50,Surprisingly Wonderful!! Part of our favorite LA day.,"Originally, this was not part of our ""MUST SEE while in LA"" itinerary, but we are so glad that we stopped in. We spent the morning at La Brea Tar pits (which is next door), but became hungry. We weren't in the mood for food trucks so we walked over to the museum café, which was fine.After lunch, we decided to spend the afternoon in the museum, which turned out to be a GREAT decision. We enjoyed walking around the grounds, surrounded by beauty. There were many sculptures, including outdoor pieces, which our little one found interesting. A lot of modern works. More modern Asian art than we had seen elsewhere. There is a separate pavilion that houses Japanese art. We managed to catch one of the activity for kids (Korean brush writing/painting), which was surprisingly fun. There was so much more that we wanted to see - we would definitely come back if we ever visit LA again.Just as we were leaving, they were setting up for their outdoor concert. We heard the band warming up, which was a treat. It was a great ending to a wonderful day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556helenk

50,"Extensive holdings, beautifully curated!","This is a really big campus of art galleries/ museum buildings in a park. One doesn’t hear much about it but it’s DEFINITELY worth spending a day or two there. They have extensive holdings of very high quality, beautifully displayed and curated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roy-Tto
50,Five stars!!,"This is a large museum with many collections. For any art lovers, you will sure find something you like in one of the halls. We were so delighted to see works of Monet, Picasso, Giacometti, Rodin etc. all in a museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaPei
50,Great collection,This was my first visit to LACMA. I don't know much about modern art but was very impressed with the many exhibits. Don't miss the Shooting Wallpaper.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jonpan2014
50,Great for anyone,"Once a month, they offer free admission and we just happened to be in town on that day. There are so many exhibits that nowhere was really packed. We had a group of all ages and everyone found something they liked. It was new artists, classic, everything you could think of. We were there for a few hours and still didn't get a chance to go through all of it. Wish I would have had more time. A definite must see for anyone visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannonb128
40,Magical Museum of Art,"First time getting out of the car and walking thru the exhibits. Good times, saw great and unique artwork and enjoyed it. A great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lletcher2016
50,Loved the new Chagall and Almaraz shows. Do catch them in 2017,"Most of us know Marc Chagall as a painter whose characters fly with love. With his skill, whimsy, and joyful color palette, Chagall designed stage sets and costumes for five operas. ""Chagall: Fantasies for the Stage"" displays the lavish backdrops and quirky costumes with music. You can hear music from Ravel, Tchaikovsky, or Mozart while you view the costumes and sets. What would be finer?Another new exhibit, ""Playing with Fire"" by Carlos Almaraz, features dramatic oils, many set in Los Angeles locations like Griffiths Park. His paintings are intense, dynamic, dramatic. Enjoy!One somber note to both of these is that the painters lived with the specter of death. Chagall escaped Europe in 1941 to do the theater commissions, evading the Nazi net for Jewish people. Almaraz was caught in the AIDS epidemic, dying too young in 1989.We didn't make it to the permanent collection because the visiting exhibits drew us in. I'd like to go back, especially if the traveling shows live up to this level.The museum is also a fine venue for people-watching. Families flock to this place. The installation of Urban Light by Chris Burden (the arrangement of found light poles) is a magnet for anyone with a camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WideEyedTraveler
40,Lots of art collection inside,"All kinds of art can be found inside the museum, from Japanese art, Egyptian art, Chinese art, Mediterranean art to all kinds of different culture historical art & paintings are all kept here. The museum is very big to walk around, be prepared to walk alot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N9031ZLnathanc
50,Unique Art Collection,"First time visiting and its really unique and contemporary. The restaurant inside LACMA (Ray) has very good salad. John Mason's Red X stoneware art was very interesting so as the Six Part Bars cast urethane art. Robert Grosvenor geometric abstract also took my attention. Ken Price 2011 zizi, fired and painted clay is unique art should I say. Lastly Craig Kaufmann, untitled wall relief (acrylic lacquer on vacuum-form plastic) also captured my attention. Beautiful art, I shall say.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693mariaelisac
50,Wonderful visit,Just as beautiful outside as inside. Unique exhibits in several buildings as well as beautifully curated gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justineandjim
50,Bring the family for a day of culture from around the world.,"Great place to bring the family for a day of culture and art from around the world. Coming from China, we particularly liked the Native American Art which we found very new and educational - and there are great exhibits from every continent.Our three year old really enjoyed the Children's art room - very friendly staff, kids get a brush, a palette of paint and unlimited paper to crank out their own masterpieces.On the day we visited, there was a lovely outdoor jazz concert which was a lovely way to end the day and had our two kids on their feet dancing. The one downside is perhaps that the parking was expensive.Local residents of LA county can enter for free so if you are a local, bring your ID.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andrew_L_008
50,Excellent museum!,"I absolutely loved this museum. Its huge collection spans from classical to contemporary art and you could spend hours here just taking it all in. I especially loved the series of Russian abstract expressionist prints. Admission is quite reasonable, considering the size of the collection (it's free to members) and they offer special exhibits for an additional fee. During the summer months the museum had been hosting music concerts and on the afternoon we went, it was a jazz concert, which attracted a lot of people who set up picnics in the shade waiting for the show to start. It's nice to see people so enthusiastic about a museum (same about the people we saw exploring the collection). It's also conveniently located next door to the La Brea Tar Pits. Garage parking was $16 when we went. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longstrangejourney
50,Country,Very nice. Particular. It's a different high view of LA.and its history. Very American Style. Don't loose it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/194gianlucav
50,Great place to go with kids,"We come here frequently but our most recent visit really exemplified why I love this place. I took my two young children and met another family with kids and we had a super fun day out. From the Boone gallery where kids can paint (and read great books while they wait) to the Metropolis exhibit to the easy walking access over to the tar pits (not part of LACMA, but more broadly the ""museum mile"" experience), the kids had a GREAT time. I particularly love how LACMA offers the ""Next Gen"" experience to families - offering children and one parent free admission through the kids' eighteenth birthdays as a way to introduce art to the next generation/younger kids. Bravo, LACMA, for offering this very special option. Because of LACMA, my kids are better exposed to the wonders of art and will hopefully continue to visit and appreciate museums throughout their lives. Only complaint is I wish food in the cafeteria were a bit better (easiest place to eat with kids, otherwise I would've dined at their very well-regarded restaurant) and parking is a bit steep. Must visit for LA families and visitors as well. Don't miss the Metropolis exhibit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marieny524
50,Must See!,"I read about this place prior to visiting LA and although probably not at the top of everyone's list when they visit LA, the promise of some Kandinsky made it an essential for me. I got that and so much more besides that I spent a full day here and wished I had longer, so many fantastic exhibits through out art history, the foyer itself is a thing of beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeSaCRAE
50,5 buildings of very varied art works.,"I booked a ticket in advance but it was not necessary, there are two big entrances and any queue moves quickly. It is possible to go on to the site without a ticket (of the sticker type) to go to the cafes. There is enough to see to last most of the day and there is a park next to it too so you can go in and out when wearing the sticker. The buildings contain quite different works of art and all well worth a visit. The shop was a bit limited compared with other museum shops e.g. New York.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueKeo
50,Artist bucket list,"I knew I wanted to go to Urban Light in LA because it's iconic. We ended up going to the museum itself after seeing the pricing. Students are $10 and 17 and under we're free. We whipped out our student IDs and it is easily one of the best $20 i have ever spent while traveling. I have been to the Louvre and I live close to the Dali museum in Florida so I'm no art rookie. They have a wonderful gallery space and wonderful artists! Saw my first Picasso! And they an iconic Warhol piece. Sadly, The Great Wave by Katsushika Hokusai was not on public display but I suppose I'll just have to go back.Tip: If You want good pics in Urban light be careful of your placement within the lights due to the suns position it's easy to be overshadowed by the tall lampposts, also, in the middle it's a cleaner aesthetic as you can't see the rest of the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ambersahoy
50,Lamp posts,"I grew up in Orange County and never had I gone to see the famous lamp posts. So visiting from NM where I live now, we went to check them out. It's pretty cool. There are lots of people around all the time but it was cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ocjax
50,ART FROM ALL DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES,"We really enjoyed the opportunity to take in all different forms of art. From Mexican, to American, to Far Eastern to Modern. The buildings each offer their own unique aspects. We found the design and calming nature of the Japanese edifice to be one of the most unique and enjoyable layouts ever.Be sure to time your visit to see Metropolis 2 in action (check your sheet when buying your tickets) That alone is worth the price of admission.We spent about 3 hours and found we were able to see a bit of everything at a leisurely pace",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho
50,Beautiful museum,"Plenty to see, plenty to do, clean, and well maintained art museum. The museum contains famous artwork from noticeable and distinguishable artists. It contains art from every time period of human existence. Truly an amazing experience! Will always visit here when I am in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meghanjansen
50,Excellent traveling exhibits for art affectionatos,"Always a great place to spend time for the changing exhibits, the physical environs-tar pits as an example and people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hakccmd
50,A Must in LA,"LACMA (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) is a must while visiting the city of Los Angeles. The museum is filled with art from all over the world. My favorite thing in this museum is the ""This is Not a Pipe"" painting by Henri Magritte; LACMA is its home. LACMA is also home to works of Picasso, Warhol, Miro, and Lichtenstein. If you're an art fan, go to LACMA! It's worthy of an afternoon of your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingjamie
40,City art museum,"Enjoyed going to visit LACMA after many years. Parking is excellent. It has an outdoor installation of grey lamp posts close together.The buildings are not significant architecturally, unlike Richard Meier's Getty Center or FLWright's Guggenheim.Indoors, It has a nice mix of art from different countries and time periods. My favourites are by Kandinsky, Warhol, Van Gogh, Cezanne, Matisse, Picasso, and the exhibits of Japanese ketsuke and Chinese snuff boxes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MGN777
50,Great museum inside and out,"There are a lot of interesting things to see here and on a Saturday night, they sometimes have live concerts on the lawn. You'll have lively music and some food and drink stands. Great to hang out with your picnic blanket and chairs and enjoy the music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbsmsp
50,Great special exhibit!,"We were at LACMA in March to see the Pablo Picasso and Diego Rivera Exhibit. This is a must-see. It was fascinating how their lives and art overlapped. The exhibit space is beautiful. We spent two hours there, and didn't have time to see much else other than the Tar Pits. Wow. That is like nothing else!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/374helenm
50,Great place,Great variety of artwork of different periods all under one roof. One can easily spend an entire day over here. keep a note on the temporary exhibits as well and enjoy a free cool photography with the lamp posts..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouradiptaG
50,Great collection!,"Good layout, great collection (Tintoretto, Picasso, Warhol, Goncharova all under the same roof). Plan to spend about 4 hour here. Make sure and check out the Rodin sculpture on the outside,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vdshkolnikov
50,Great Art Collection A Must See when in LA,"You can spend a day easily here. There is too much to see and the collection is quite impressive. The dining area/bar was expensive, but there are maybe cheaper cafes on the other side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BishkekFishlips
50,"Wow, Incredible Place! Ammazing Art!","We absolutely loved this place. It's definitely in my Top 2 art museums I've ever been to. The museum contains incredible art from many of the masters, as well as art and historical items from all over the world. Some of it dates as far back as 5,000 B.C.! I especially enjoyed the Rembrandts. We spent many hours here and never got bored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PowerTrippersTravel
50,Just an amazing museum and area!,"Love this place. They work hard to curate their art exhibits and what they have permanently is beautiful. It's a peaceful yet energetic place. Highly suggested. The area it's located in is called ""The Miracle Mile"". Lots of restaurants and places to check out. Plus the legendary Labrea Tar Pits are pretty much next door. Love that place as well and the whole area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/89dustinf
50,WorldClass Museum that is overlooked.,"WorldClass Museum that is overlooked. Amazing collections. Beautifully maintained facility. Excellent experience. I liked hiring a personal guide, worth every penny. Like any museum, do not be in a hurry. Take time to look at every picture and read about there, or have a guide explain them for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jess90069
50,Amazing a county has a museum of this qualiity,The variety of the art work was food for the eyes. I could have spent more time but not all in one visit due to the quality and different exhibits. Definiely a place to go back to. The layout of the buildings was special in that you dd not feel crowed being in one place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marainnapa
50,A wonderful day,This is a great way to spend a day in Los Angeles. The art collection is fantastic and it is a beautiful space in the heart of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherylf32
30,Lots to look at,"The centre comprises 5 buildings displaying modern art in various categories so it's easy to go the the topic you prefer.The labeling is clear and informative.The range of exhibits is quite wide, covering paintings, sculpture, ethnic art including Egyptian Sarcophagi, moving wallpaper jewellery household objects,You could spend all day there but I found 2 hours was enough for me.,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Otteraswas
40,An Adventure for the Mind,The extraordinary collection of art at the County Museum is thought provoking. It makes you think. It challenges you. There are a host of other museums in the neighborhood so check them all out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/895johnw
50,Great day of culture and art,"LACMA is a great complement to the Getty in LA, with extensive collections and some memorable individual pieces - Hockney's 'Mulholland Drive' particularly memorable. Sit in the sun in the courtyard and enjoy Coffee and Milk's great baked goods and excellent coffee. Not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/107kathrynm
50,A day in Art,"I might have logged around more than 20 hours here already. This museum is just amazing. I found Xu Beihong here one time, Jeff Koon's ballon dog another, and Bauhaus art retro this time. The museum never stops to amaze me in terms of its exhibition selections.I will definitely come back the next time I am in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sherry_Geek
40,Usually Great,"Usually I enjoy discovering new things and exhibits at the LA County Museum of Art made up of 6 different buildings/museums. However, on the last Monday in June a fire alarm went off and no one was allowed into the Ahmanson Building during the 10:30 - 13:00 block fo time that I visited and had especially wanted to see the special exhibit on Margaret Mead paintings. Instead I rediscovered the Asian collection including the wondrous calm soothing (much needed) Japanese nature screens, the very modern and historical Dwan Gallery show, and the spectacular ""The Inner Eye"" (African sculpture and weavings). There are several museum shops and at least two indoor and patio places to eat, if you want to make a full day of it. Alas, I'll have to make another trip to LA to travel with Mead and Bateson to Bali and the South Pacific.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
50,Enjoyable Experience,"Came here as part of a private Bible Tour.Facility is easy to find. Parking is $16 and there are ample options. Elevators are interesting and easy to find as well.There are many places to sit and eat or rest/people watch. Maps are easy to read, with six main buildings.Photo opportunities include the Levitates Mass, Urban Light (all the street lamps), Pavilion for Japanese Art and the Three Quintains.Eateries include LAMAC Cafe, Ray's and Stark Bar, C + M (Coffee and Milk).Backpacks can be brought into the museum but need to be in front (as backpacks on the back rub against displays). Or you can check the bag free of charge at Ticket Offices.HOURS:Monday, Tuesday, Thursday - 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.Wednesday - ClosedFriday - 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.Saturday and Sunday - 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.Download the Museum's app. Connect with the Museum on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and Tumblr",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VegasBling
50,Favorite LA Museum,Love the content of this museum. Surprising that they have so much famous art from Warhol to Picasso to Mondrian. Paid admission also gets u access to the Broad which has some interesting modern art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrangeCountyJay
50,World Class,It does not matter which way one looks there is another great piece of art. LACMA or 'The County' to those in the know is a vast warren of buildings on a huge campus. Visited and loved by locals and international visitors alike. It is hard to find fault. It would take days to see everything. I like to wander aimlessly and see what I come across and I am never disappointed. There are plans to demolish and rebuild bigger and better facilities in the near future.In addition to exhibitions there are events like live jazz and I am told that 1000000 Urban Light( the assemblage of Los Angeles street lights) by Chris Burden is a popular engagement and wedding location.Remember the Museum is closed on Wednesdays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinemL8442JB
40,Fun,"I visited primarily because it was suggested by my son - but, as an LA travel consultant - he did well. I enjoyed the art and the surroundings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstauf51
50,Wonderful visit,Compelling ceramic installations and beautiful paintings. The architecture is also quite appealing. Greatly enjoyed our visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bdurand3
50,Summer fun,"Beautiful art. Many pieces are short term (rotating), so if you go back each year, you'll see different art. Actually several (6) different buildings. Right next to La Brea Tar Pits. Don't miss the sculpture garden. Food in the LACMA Cafe is pretty good, and not too outrageously priced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimbabble
40,Fit this into your visit to LA,"I can't wait to go back to LACMA. When I went it had been on my list of places to see for a while, but I never managed to fit it in. The campus is large and if you have good weather, its easy to spend an entire day here. I regret that when I visited I didn't have time to visit the special Mapplethorpe exhibit they had. But searching for parking significantly cut into the amount of (little) time we had to devote there for the day. It was very challenging to find a parking space, we almost left. But definitely don't give up, and do your research ahead and look into the special exhibits they have and consider which you want to see. I can't wait to go back again, solo, and spend an entire day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaSuttonE
30,👍🏻,"It was a really great exprience, staff was pretty nice too. Will probably go back soon with friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightseer716595
50,LACMA is not Lacking,We went to see a photography exhibit and ended up staying to tour the rest of the museum. Rembrant to Hockney - it's a wonderful collection. We heard the cafe was a good place to eat but it was full and we didn't want to wait.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/volturnus
50,LIGHTS CAMERA ART,"I was so excited to visit this museum in LA. The iconic LA lights was a beauty to behold I had much fun taking pics here. Fortunately for me on my visit there was a Picasso and Rivera exhibit. It was unbelievable. The general exhibit and installatiins were also impressive. The sculpture garden was also unforgetable. I was not able to complete the tour of this huge museum but what I got was artistically satisfying, the lights, had my camera and the art!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lendyl
50,One of THOSE museums!,"Awesome exhibitions, truly interesting guided tours in a huuuuge museum. Also, there's a nice outdoor sitting area with some cafes and dinning options. Highly recommended! :))",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifermico
40,Nice museum,Was only able to spend a couple of hours but the place was certainly worth spending more time than that. Spent much of my time at the Japanese Pavilion (easy to overlook as it is a bit further off); found the setting interesting and thoroughly enjoyed the small but fascinating collection. A number of outdoor attractions (including but not limited to the well known Urban Lights) offered good chance for some nice pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ECWorld
40,I live 2 blocks away...Worth your time!,I frequent the grounds of LACMA all the time. The museum has become top notch and is well worth a half a day. FYI...FREE Jazz and classical Concerts from June through to the end of August. Friday nights (outdoor} Basic Jazz. Saturday Latin/Afro/Cuban (my favorite) and( indoor) Classical Sundays. You'll find the coolest locals where you can picnic and dance. It' with them. AWESOME crowd. Always a bopping good time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LocalLALALocal
50,AMAZING,LACMA is the perfect place for the outing in LA. Experience great art and culture. If you find yourself looking for something to do in LA I highly recommend checking out this museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveFawley
30,Urban Lights Tour,Just been there for the urban lights outdoor. Great for photo shoot as you can play around with depth of photos in many different ways. stayed around 15-30mins and if you are a IG-active user - here's a place you may wanna drop by - its easy for parking as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giligulu2016
40,Short trip !,The museum is scattered with multiple different buildings. We had a short time to visit the museum so we did not see everything. The art was OK. I think it's enjoyable according to preference. No regrets !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Selinawongg
50,Great museum,This very large museum is a challenge because it's so big. There is so much to see here. I especially like the paintings and the sculptures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/906beckyv
50,nice museum,this museum offers a wide variety of collectibles from all over the world. Very worth visiting would love to come back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G7418VKfrancescad
40,Just Saw The Urban Light Exhibit Outdoors,"I really enjoyed seeing all the urban street lights from the 20's and 30's. Of course, this is a place where you will see lots of Instagrammers! I had to take photos for my daughter, but was able to enjoy the exhibit in between shots, haha. It's just such a cool vibe to walk in between all the lights. This is a quick and easy thing to visit and I would highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donna224488
50,Incredible Collection of Art,"The LACMA has an impressive collection of iconic modern art. Thoroughly enjoyed the 20th century art as well as the Art of the Americas. A fun feature is that most of the art on view (in the exhibits we went to) is owned by the museum, so you can take pictures freely. A wonderful destination for photography and art lovers.Also, if you want to take a break, you can walk through the La Brea Tar Pits. It's a fascinating natural history aside, and then you can revisit the LACMA for an afternoon dosage of more great artwork.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WishingYouTheBest
40,It's Okay,"A good place to visit when you have kids with you, The lights are just the light. The story about the Tar is very impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msfilipinatraveler
50,Oasis of Culture,"I am not a arty person, but I know what I like when I see it. This place gives you a lot of choice, from the classics, to contemporary and paintings to sculpture. The outside area is just as impressive and peaceful. You will love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648karls
50,"Love, love, love",Such beautiful art! The LA County Museum was one of our main reasons to visit LA. I love this museum and find it easy to navigate so to see as much as possible. Good cafe!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanB986
50,Amazing Breadth of Art,"LACMA is like a city of museums, requiring at least several days to fully explore. We know great museums from around the world and LACMA matches them all. You can choose from modern, contemporary, American, European, African, or Pacific themes and spend your time exploring some truly great art. When it comes time to recover from art exposure there are good cafes and restaurants with outdoor and indoor seating. Definitely a world class museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/areview28
50,A real gem with great temporary exhibits.,We always visit because you never know what new exhibits will be there. We love the permanent American and European exhibits. Good to get a little culture on a cool day!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventureBiker21
50,City Museum on a par with other great city art museums,"This is an important city art museum with a major collection covering all periods of art. Well worth seeing. Right now, National Gallery, Metropolitan, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit probably rank higher but that doesn't mean LACMA isn't a top museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phillygirl2017
50,Always a great visit.,"We always try to visit LACMA whenever we are in LA and this trip was no different. There are so many permanent exhibits you can never see them all in one visit and then there are always special exhibits with limited duration. If you love art, don't miss this great institution.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliotr977
50,Top Notch Museum,This place is AMAZING! There are several multistory buildings housing art. The collection is phenomenal. From Pre-Columbian to modern art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runningandmusing
40,Beyond Bling!,"I hadn't been to LACMA since the first King Tut Exhibit in the late 1970s. I didn't recognize the place with all the new buildings built around it. I understand a new round of building and refurbishing is beginning soon if not already. I chose the venue for my ladies' group to see a small jewelry exhibit called Beyond Bling!. It was the right size for the group as the entire exhibit was in one room and viewable in about 30 minutes. With out price of admission for the special exhibit we were welcome to tour the rest of the museum. We stuck to the first floor. We could not enter the special Diego Rivera and Pablo Picasso exhibit but there are some of their works in the permanent collection. It was a very enjoyable visit. I had already planned lunch at Cassell's on 6th St. but there is dining at the museum and a raft of food truck parked across the street which could have been a real adventure. Parking is conveniently located across the street. I think it is $14 flat rate, not too bad for L.A. I won't wait forty years to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marylouiseh2014
50,Always enjoyable,"I have had a LACMA membership for years. I like that there are many different exhibits that cycle through as well as regular exhibits I can return to again and again. I celebrated a birthday there one year, which began with drinks at the bar. There are many things to see for people of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/metabean
50,Loved It!,"Beautiful venue, great exhibits, so much to see. Thoroughly enjoyed our day at the museum. Can't wait to return to this museum on our next trip to LA. Our favorite exhibit during this visit was a light exhibit that involved a separate reservation which we were able to make onsite. I cannot remember the name of the artist but if you make it to the museum, ask about it. It's very worth taking the time to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cloverleaf3218

40,"Currently, Rivera/Picasso special exhibit","$25 to get in to this special exhibit which compared and contrasted the works of Diego Rivera and Pablo Picasso. Unlike the previous comparison exhibit we saw elsewhere, these artists were communicating with each other and working contemporaneously. Interesting. Also enjoyed the Japanese pavilion with beautiful screens and netzges. LACMA is right next to LaBrea Tar pits, which you should visit as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chitownsam
50,an LA favorite- always visit,I always try to come to this museum when I am in LA. Right by the LaBrea tar pits. the collections are wonderful and the special exhibitions are great. This December there was an installation with lots of moving cars. We all loved it. I love the giant boulder uspended between two walls. planty of fast dining options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dlsoduku
40,Amazingly good collection for a county museum,"I didn't expect much compared to the Getty. And in fact, LACMA is a step down but not a big step down. I can't cite specific artist names, but there were a lot of stop-and-study paintings, even for myself who is more into music than the visual arts. The campus is also appealing, with multiple buildings and a courtyard with a coffee/pastry shop.Located close to the La Brea Tar Pits. Has its own parking garage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulsS4151FO
50,Great Place to spend a few hours,"My stay in LA was short and other wise occupied but I managed to spend a few hours LACMA. So many great exhibits, not too crowded, and just a cool place to be. I particularly loved the street lamp exhibit and the French advertisements from the 1800s. I was very inspired.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesliel487
50,A must-see place if you're in Los Angeles,"A world-class museum with an ever changing collection of exhibits, be prepared to spend an entire day enjoying what's on display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banerman
50,Awesome Museum. A must if you enjoy museums.,"$60 buys you the individual membership if you are a resident of LA. The exhibit I went to see Rivera/Picasso had a $25 entrance fee. If you will visit the museum a few times during the year, membership makes sense. New updated restaurant on site is quite nice. This is a large and lovely museum with an excellent permanent collection. And they also stage meaningful traveling exhibitions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
40,Leave nothing but Photos,"Home of the most photographed Urban Lights. Spent half a day exploring the variety of collections. LACMA left me in awe, I get to see Picasso, Warhol, and a whole lot more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodcrawlph
50,A must if you are going to LA,"This is an amazing museum with a lot of diversity of Art, they have around 5 buildings with many options to see, if you are looking for sculptures, modern art, classic art, you will need minimum a whole day to see everything and maybe 2 or 3. This and the broad are very well known at LA, you must go! This museum is also well known because ""The Urban Lights"", an expression of artist that is available outdoor, with no need to enter or pay a ticket. Many films have shown this space. But belive me, to pay the ticket and see the rest, makes worth it every cent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gloriaverab
40,Great museum getting even better,"The exhibits are hit and miss but the expansion will make it even better. The citations leave something to be desired. Example, a Calder Mobil exhibit that didn't move. Isn't the point of a Mobil to move? Some times great though but the new buildings are perfect for exhibitions",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yolidog
50,Where culture and commerce meet for lunch,"When I went they had several blocks of Wilshire closed off for road maintenance or construction. Took the opportunity to snap a few photos of the streetlamp exhibit out front from the street. The museum is great and reasonably priced. The special exhibits are affordable because of the reduced cost of admission to the LACMA. Currently the Picasso and Diego Rivera exhibit is exceedingly worth the price, just make sure you ask at the ticket booth for the additional exhibit ticket ($10 more and worth the Picasso and Rivera hand drawings and rare work). Go with the family, go for an afternoon adventure, but just go. Worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamessZ7081ZP
50,a Gem in LA,"When our friend came from Hong Kong, she specifically wanted to see the LA County Museum of Art. We having been all our life and had never visited the museum. When we get there, we were supervised to find out there are many scenes were filmed here in front of the old lamps. For her memory, she took many pictures with us here so she can show here friends back home.If you're an Oriental art lover, now is the good time to visit. We saw many Japanese arts on display. May of the arts are ancient and I have never seen them in other museums.So visitors out of town, this is a good place to go. Parking is plenty inside the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/34regisk
40,Lots to see,"wide ranging collection, though I concentrated primarily on their western, premodern art. Spotty but some great works worth seeking out.Enough of a range of things that its a great place to go as a family since everyone can find something.Warning, food on site is VERY expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AvB2DC
50,A lot to get through,"The museum is huge: comprising many buildings so involves a big effort if you plan to see everything. Not my style. I chose a few exhibitions and was still exhausted. Broad collection: love Chris Burden metropole. I could spend hours with this work. It some how puts urban life into a meaningful context. It has a viewing balcony which amplifies the experience. The Islamic Art section was smallish but soo divine. The repetition, motives, colours and proportions are so comforting. Saudi artist Gharem's modern work had me mesmerised. Materials, modernity and messaging: elegantly challenging beliefs and tradition. Love. I needed a coffee and had a lovely cup from coffee and milk in the sunny courtyard. Revived I explored some more before I felt overwhelmed. Surprised that an entry fee was charged to the state run museum when all the private ones a free. I guess it's bit of ""user pays"" philosophy. At $15 it is well worth it but if taking whole family would probably choose one of the many free venues innLA eg the Broad!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiceylulu
40,Picasso and Rivera,"Excellent special exhibit representative of the unique relationship shared between Pablo Picasso and Diego Rivera. Despite the fact this huge campus is incredibly eclectic and a little tired, it offers something for everyone and will keep you coming back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogiacomo
50,One of the world's great Art Museums and such a pleasure to be at LACMA,"We go to LACMA most eveytime we are in LA and are never disappointed. Such a thrill to see the Maplethorpe Show July 2016, James Turrell, and many of the finest modern artists in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CatherineBF
40,Unexpected rich & varied collection of art in a must see museum,"Although we were originally set to visit the LA museum of contemporary art, located downtown, a LA friend suggested a visit to this museum instead. That was a great recommendation!The LACMA (regular entrance fee of 15 USD, special shows/exhibitions not included (these cost an additional 10 USD)) offers an impressive range of periods, styles and movements in art, so doing allowing to discover centuries of art in a modernist building.The building could be given a more contemporary look & feel, as well as a more modern way of displaying the art (we found that the rooms are sometimes lacking some light and that the art is not sufficiently 'dramatically' displayed).You need a couple of hours if you want to see a large part of what is on display, because there is several buildings spread over the grounds.Very convenient is the parking lot right under the building (but with a cost of 14USD).There is also a café/restaurant, well located in the central court of the building. We didn't use it but we would have, should we have had more time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlivierFromBrussels
40,The lights are being turned on even when the museum is closed,My friends and I visited LACMA on a day that the museum was closed but still waited around 45 minutes before they turned on the lights. It was a wonderful photo opp and can get crowded. La Brea Tar Pits is on the same block so you can visit both in one day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/averywildchild
40,Nice complex of buildings,"We visited this place late in the afternoon so I did not have the chance to visit the interior. When you go there, take your time and wander around this complex of buildings, there will be a lot of surprises!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexiosVandoros
50,Art Yes!,I have been a member of LACMA for over 30 years. It has grown into one of the finest museums in the world. The new parking garage was a boon as well. Our fave place on the campus is the Japanese pavilion. Expertly designed and imaginatively curated. I only wish that they had more than Jazz and Classical music programs. Never the less: Go. Be. Do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradp705
30,another museum,"Maybe it's my fault. I'm not a big museumy person. But we only spent like 5 minutes here. My 13 year old didn't have to pay, which was nice, but after parking it was a waste of $25 for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allisonr453
50,Well worth a visit,"We came to see the special Picasso and Rivera: Conversations Across Time exhibition, and payment for those tickets also covered general admission for the rest of the museum. The special exhibition was wonderful. We made a start on the rest of the exhibits but unfortunately ran out of time. Allow plenty of time to visit all the buildings and exhibits, there is lots to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karencV4785NQ
10,Nothing much,"The best thing about it is that it's not expensive. Other than that, I can say that someone who has seen several museums in their lives will be bored.. The pace was nice though, the best thing to take photos of were s home poles in the yard, and also the staff was very helpful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Onoufrios-Dovletis
50,Flashy Lights,What is better than becoming part of the art. The wonderful way that you get to interact with the various sculptures and art settings is insane. The lights is a highly tourist attraction but worth it. If you go to LA it is a place you must stop and visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockyR148
50,LACMA makes it easy for you to see art and culture and even science!,The parking is easy and accessible from 6th Street in the Mid-Wilshire area. It's a beautiful well thought out place with helpful people everywhere!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaSenora8484

50,Free for LA residents after 3!,"A very beneficial perk for LA residents, free after 3! Lots of nice art on the premises, I really enjoyed the Buddhism, Hinduism and Catholicism artifacts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/as-sherman
40,This was on my xmas wishlist,"I live in San Diego but I love a weekend getaway to LA. LACMA is one reason why LA is a great getaway destination. There is always a good exhibit going on, the grounds around LACMA are good for relaxing, walking or a picnic. There are often food trucks parked across the street if you don't want to eat at the nice, but expensive, restaurant connected to LACMA. The people watching at the museum is also great and if you have friends or family under 25 bring them for free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seesumigo
50,Hours of entertainment,"This museum was an excellent way to spend half a day - I should have arrived earlier!!I saw the Picasso and Rivera exhibition - well worth it. The general exhibits were also excellent, especially Abdulnasser Gharem's 'Pause'.I didn't have children with me - but children seemed to have a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rowenas504
40,Enjoyable art museum,"My wife enjoyed this museum, and while modern art is not my thing I found it amusing enough. The layout was very confusing, and it was easy to miss whole floors. It took us 3hrs to get around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattr6284
10,a $15 rip off parking fee,"It is hard to find parking in here especially at night. My wife is not a museum lover, and she only want to go for the lamp post at night. So, we went there at around 8:30pm and park inside the building, it has a big poster said parking after 5PM is FREE but i still get charged $15 after i get out. bad bad management. It is only cool to take photo at night in here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BunLay
50,Must see during the day and night,I really came to see the lamp post exhibit. It's best to see it during two times of the day. Mid afternoon so that the sun isn't blocked by the building in the front. At night when it's lite up.There was lots of construction around it and it was hard to find parking and something to eat. The cafe by the museum was meh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janneur
50,Excellent display of works of art,"A $10 uber pool ride from downtown LA, this museum is a must visit. Entrance is free for under 17 and $15 for adults. Unlike museums I've been to on the east coast, every piece of art seemed thoughtfully laid out and very well blended with other works of art in the room. Make sure to make it to the third floor to the India and south east Asia section. Artworks in this section are from Burma, Nepal, Cambodia, Indonesia, to name a few, hence very unique.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eve212015
40,A Must for Art Lovers,"With the artworks spread amongst several different buildings, LACMA is a treasure trove of gems from around the world. From contemporary sculptures to Mesoamerican artefacts, there is a wide scope of styles on show. There is a special kids' section, where they can create their own painted masterpieces – my children enjoyed this very much. Don't forget to check out the installation called Urban Light by Chris Burden, located at the Wilshire Boulevard entrance to LACMA – it's a mesmerising collection of antique street lamps set up in rows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DV226
50,one of my favourite places,"There is so much to see and look at here, its got loads of space to walk around, enjoy the art, architecture and wildlife in the stunning Californian sunshine. Most of it is free and you only pay to go into certain exhibition spaces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/408francese

50,"Fabulous Museum, Beautiful Spot","I live just blocks from this museum whose welcoming grounds (including those fabulous street lamps) make it a welcoming spot for the community and for tourists. It's got exquisite exhibitions, great Sunday evening free concerts, and a fine restaurant, Don't miss it if you're in L.A.!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miriyam
50,Allow more than one day!,"We had an opportunity to spend one day at te LA County Museum of Art. The overall collection is a bit overwhelming and I would suggest looking over the information before going to select specific areas for attention. Watch for special exhibits--when we were there we found a remarkable exhibit on the German Reformation that alone was worth the trip. The museum is in several buildings and plenty of walking can be involved. There is a small coffee shop that offered comfort and rest. We were there mid-week, I suspect it would be crowded on a weekend or during school holidays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shri420
50,The light is heaven,"One of the most fascinating things I like in life is good lighting. Went to this place with my sister and I was perplexed. The premises is also good for photo shoots and the people there are also friendly. If you ever visit LA, make sure you touch base with LACMA 👍🏾",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Queencrez

50,Musuem weekend,"Wilshire Blvd in front the of LACMA is all torn up with contruction. I walked from my B&B so there was no problem for me, parking maybe an issue just to get to. So check your directions carefully. The musuem is actually 8 buidlings clustered together. Each buiding has a theme or era of paintings. I was there from 10 am to 4pm and covered 7 buildings . they provide a map and the guards are very helpful directing you. The cost was $15 (senior) and I wanted to see an special exhibition for another $10. I hae been lucky to see the Vatican Musuemes and the Lovue. While the Lacma isn't that great it is good. I found modern masters :Matissee, Degas, Picasso,Warhol, Modigliani, Riveria. I also enjoyes a few Sargeants. My only complaint was I wish that the map gave specific locations to where the more popular painting where. The is also a cafe with somewhat reasonable prices ($23 for half and snadwich and bowl of soup). There were a lot of families ( there are special programs for little ones) , teenagers, seniors and everyoen enjoyed it. I loved it and would go again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gallaghera416
40,Nice museum. Picasso/Rivera exhibit not impressive,I do love art museums so decided to stop by after being at Petersen auto museum down street. Very large and spread out museum. My teen son was free which was nice. Paid extra to see Picasso and Rivera exhibit. It was quite small and I wasn't too impressed. Different buildings for different art made it confusing for us to know where everything was. La break tar pits right next door so easy walk. Wilshire is a mess due to construction currently.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DL9022
50,Massive museum,"What a fantastic museum! I thought this would be just contemporary art, but it really spans almost the entire course of art history. There are probably about 5 buildings that are part of the museum, each containing a different area of art history. It would probably take years to see everything there is to see here! We went to the Japanese building which has a unique design and some great art, and we also saw the art of the Renaissance. The street lamps installation in front of the building are of course another draw, and there is a very small sculpture garden to the right of the street lamps that is nice to peek in to as well. Fun place to go spend a couple hours (or more!) in LA. A bit pricey but well worth it. There are cafes as well in case all that art gets you hungry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bigred86j
50,Tar Pits plus museum. How can you miss?,"As a long time Los Angeles resident, I've probably been to LACMA more than 100 times and have been in every gallery multiple times. It remains a constant source of fascination and with the La Brea tar pits adjacent, one can easily spend a full day there.The museum, under Michael Govan's leadership, has sprinted to the forefront of cultural attractions along with the Getty Center. LACMA provides an irresistible mix of scholarship and showmanship in arranging onsite attractions and exhibitions.There are so many attractions that it's hard to know where to start. Chris Burden's lamposts and Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass are magnets for young and old. However, don't miss Burden's Metropolis in the Broad Pavilion. Check to see when it's running (only on weekends at specific hours, I believe) but it's also a must- particularly if you have children.If you want to experience a different exhibition environment, visit the Price Pavilion (traditional Japanese art on paper). There are spiral walkways (somewhat like the Guggenheim) but the atmosphere is serene. Almost like being in a Japanese rock garden.For movie buffs, check out the listings. This is Hollywood, after all.And don't forget to check out the Page Museum and tar pits which are directly adjacent. Tromp around the grounds in back of LACMA to view the tar seeps and the ongoing fossil excavation (open on weekends but closed, I believe, on weekends).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorrinw2016
50,Save at least 3h to visit,The museum is huge. Save enough time to visit it. Parking cost $14. They have from ancient (greek) art until modern art. Go there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gustavo321
50,Great museum,We took a trip to Los Angeles especially to see a curated show at the museum. The entire site has a variety of exhibits and spaces to explore and was well worth a visit beyond the artist we came to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mouseangel

50,An Absolute Must,"Easy to get to, a beautiful campus-style museum, brilliantly curated - just a lovely experience. At the moment they have the Diego Rivera Pablo Picasso compare-and-contrast exhibit up and running, which is absolutely worth the extra $10. It goes into similarities between their classical studies & training; their companionship & competition; their use of ancient local art in a contemporary manner. Even pretty familiar with both artists I was exposed to a tremendous amount of new information & ideas. We also had fun with the Serra exhibit, the McLaughlin Exhibit, the LA Exuberance exhibit and a few other installations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SidneyW50

50,Large Collection With Something for Everyone,"A friend and I visited LACMA during the excellent ""Picasso and Rivera"" special exhibit, which was well-done (although I was surprised that the descriptions were only in English - I normally find dual-language descriptions particularly when the artists involved are non-English). The layout of the museum can be a bit tricky, but I found the staff helpful and generally non-intrusive (except when someone got too close to a painting or ignored the 'no photos' warning). Overall the collection is quite good, covering a wide variety of styles and genres, but don't expect to find an iconic work in every room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyA56003
50,Love this place,"What can I say, surrounded by beautiful paintings, sculptures and passing through one exhibit room to one other, I can spend a whole day here. Too bad I can't take this place home with me. Walking shoes is recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginaiscooking
50,Creative Central,"You would expect to see a plethora of creative, imaginative art, at MOMA LA..and you will. MOMA has new exhibits all the time and the permanent stuff is thought provoking, fun, and at times, crazy. Crazy is in the eye of the beholder.Go check this place out and enjoy yourself...you can thank me later.Happy trails!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertsJ8565RW
50,Only was there at night,"We went at night to see the street lights exhibit located outside. It is free but you can't park in the museum's garage after 8:30 ish. They start to kick you out and lock up the place, so you won't be able to get your car out. You can park on the street down the road and walk over. It was a very cool site and definitely worth the visit there. Just a heads up there are a ton of people there seeing the lights with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sclour
50,Jakuchu and Latour,"Because of Jakuchu and Latour, I visited here, one is more than expectation and the other was....Regarding Price collection, I expected a lot of Jakuchu paintings were in Japanese Pavilion but it is only one small paintings. (It is impossible to know if this is one of Price Collection) only one Sohaku's paintings as well.On the contrary, Western paintings, during renaissance through impressionist, while Picasso is too difficult for me, was marvelous. I really recommend to visit Getty and this museum at same time, as two facilities are very close in vast LA region. In addition, currently Special exhibition Duerer and Cranach collected from Germany is incredibly high level. Plus African art special exhibition was very impressing and personally thought Picasso must have obtained some instinctive images from these sculptures. Someone reply me if this is histrically right in light of Picasso's evolution in his style. In conclusion, felt inresistible jealous to people in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yuji16
50,Excellent Collections,"This art museum is huge! My husband and I spent 4+ hours here and still didn't see everything. They have a pretty amazing and extensive collection.

Not a place for kids to explore but it's nice for kids to walk outside of the museum and artworks for photos. The cafe outside of the Japanese exhibition hall runs VE~RY SLOW~.

50,Amazing Exhibition,"We saw the Picasso and Rivera exhibition and it was fascinating. The museum is enormous with many buildings, walkways, bars, restaurants and coffee houses. It is also adjacent to the Los Angeles Tar Pits, where prehistoric mammals were trapped thousands of years ago. It's interesting to note that the Tar Pits sit over a huge underground oil field from which oil seeps up through the soil in various place on the huge property. Great interest and lots of outdoor viewing and tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mary101678
50,Worth many visits if you live here,"We visit here frequently. Just was there again yesterday. Metropolis II is a recurring delight for the little one (and for us too).

50,Like art-- spend a day with it,"This is a great museum to enjoy the art. If you have a slight interest in art or want to learn something new-- this is a good place to be.

50,Under rated gem!,"I've been to LA a couple of times but had never heard of this museum, until I started looking into accommodation for a 24 lay over, without a car.This is an absolutely fantastic museum with a large and varied permanent collection, a couple of cafes to hang out in and pleasant outdoor space with some fun installations. The entrance price (from memory about $20) was reasonable and well worth it.Unlike a lot of museums this one doesn't feel crowded and it's a fun way to spend a morning/afternoon or indeed a whole day.It's also not far (walking distance) to the Orange Grove shopping area.Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Victoriaonholidays

The 4 year old is a lover of museums but found this a bit boring.We went to the kids area and the staff were very uninterested in being there.Its. beautiful space and I enjoyed some of the exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pet87a
50,Great experiene,This is free on certain days. The museum has a lot of different historic points from all different cultures. You can pay more to see special vendors that are there for a limited time. They have a lot of artifacts from all over the world and different times. I enjoyed the history of Native Americans and Asian religions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmittGonzalez12
50,Great Collection,"Really a stunning and expansive art collection that would take days to see. Don't expect to whiz through this museum, but it's worth spending some time here. May be pick a building and spend a few hours. I really enjoyed the central building with the more modern art, but the asian collections were fantastic as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eluper
50,Rich variety,"The museum is made up of a number of buildings each with interesting architecture of which for me the star was the Japanese Pavilion both outside and inside. At the entrance to the complex the display of lampposts makes a wonderful impact, the only drawback being the number of enthusiastic selfie photographers hanging off the posts. We started in the Ahmanson Building and made our way through all of the other buildings. Such a rich array of wonderful paintings and sculptures. Among my favourites were the Art nouveau & Jugensthiel posters some Feininger paintings and a beautiful sculpture of an American Walking soldier 1917 by Alexander Archipenko. The Art of Americas Building was displaying a fantastic collection of work by Moholy-Nagy including a room of work in a set up as he had imagined but never managed to achieve. We spent several hours here and it was deeply enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lavarcham
50,The Japanese Pavilion: perfect blend of art and architecture!,"This city has an abundance of riches regarding art museums! LACMA is yet another. Take a photo (a must) in the streetlamp exhibit at the entrance and then explore this large collection. There are several buildings containing a variety of genres, but our favorite was the smaller Japanese pavilion at the end of the campus. An absolutely exquisitely designed structure with walls that look like Japanese screens, a circular ramp leading to the 4 or 5 open levels, gorgeous silk wall hangings, statuary, pottery, and wall panels. We spent most of our time at the LACMA enjoying the serenity and beauty of this building. A perfect blend of art and architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/952lindag

40,Good Value for the Price (Free),"We are spoiled in LA, we have lots of great museums. From The Huntington Library, to the Getty, there's a lot to see here. LACMA (as the locals call it) can vary. Sometimes the installments will be, well hard to appreciate I guess is a nice way to put it. Sometimes it seems like a dude painted a wall red for millions of dollars, and umm, ok? That's weird. Other times the displays are REALLY REALLY impressive. My tip is to see what is on display before you plan your visit, and head to those sections that interest you. There is a lot of see here and its a great visit whether solo, with friends or on a date.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MykeC166
50,LACMA is cool!,"The museum begins before you enter the building: the streetlight installation and the outdoor sculptures are fun.Inside, the exhibits and collections well curated and easy to explore.With all the indoor and outdoor space, I would think even young families would love an hour or two here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlotteWalker
40,Eclectic and engaging museum,"Quite a lot to see here, some great contemporary art and exhibits, and tar pits to boot. Fortunate enough to see the Picasso/Rivera exhibit, which was amazing, and a variety of great artists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BLtrvl
50,Fabulous visit to an iconic art museum!,"Whenever possible in my travels, I try to visit art exhibits. I have done so in a number of major metropolitan cities. This was our first time for LACMA, and a fine day it was.The big draw for us was as special exhibit of Picasso and Rivera in the Contemporary Art building. However, LACMA, not just a building but a campus, is considered the largest encyclopedic art museum in the western United States. See the LACMA website for full details.We took particular interest in the sculpture garden, which houses a fine permanent collection of Rodin bronzes, having recently visited a large special exhibition of the same master at Portland Art Museum in Oregon.Adjacent to LACMA are the Petersen Automotive Museum, the Craft and Folk Art Museum, and Page Museum at the LA Brea Tar Pits. We took a stroll through the grounds at the tar pits, but ran out of time to do the Page. We did spend time at Pit 91, the only long-term excavation effort of the La Brea Tar Pits; museum staff has been exploring it for approximately 40 years.Specimens include Ice Age fossils — including saber-toothed cats, dire wolves and mammoths —  from 10,000 to 40,000-year-old asphalt deposits. More than 2,500 saber-toothed cats have been excavated from the La Brea Tar Pits and studied at the Museum.An extension of the Metro Purple line is under construction that will have a stop for LACMA environs, to open in 2013. Meanwhile, explore your needs for parking in advance. Lacma receives somewhere north of a million visitors each year, so be prepared and go early in the day. You will want to do that anyway, with so much to see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAYS472
40,Huge museum in need of a face lift,The museum is full of interesting exhibits. The modern art section is rather crowded and we were told not to take photos of the Picassos. I still enjoyed this area but was pleasantly surprised that the Latin American art section wasn't crowded at all. The buildings and elevators are quite worn down and in need of refinishing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chelslynne
40,Astounding art collection,"Best to go after lunch so that you can wait for the urban lights. You can probably spend 3-4 hours looking at the 4 floors of collection. The huge Matisse tile art greets you and you know already there are more treasures inside. Lots of Picassos, Klines, Kandinskys, some Warhol, Pollack, Monet. Amazing collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaofalcis
40,Looks best at night,"This place has become a new landmark and must-visit spot in LA. Great for photoshoot location or just a ""regular"" touristy picture. Can get crowded on certain nights though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nyotista
50,Loved the light sculpture in the front!,"The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is one of the most beautiful architectural designs in the area, and overall I had a nice experience. I loved the selection. Thoroughly enjoyed it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L6272PKmatthewd
40,"Great place to enjoy art, music, culture","It is fun to go on an evening after work or for a day if you have the time. There are always changing exhibits. We had a great time viewing the art, getting some food, and enjoying some Jazz music outside with our food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susansM9588XE

50,A Great Museum,"LACMA is one of the country's great museums, despite its somewhat confusing plan and outdated buildings. The collections are excellent, and the shorter term exhibitions excellent. It's really several museums in one, all set in a lovely park. A great place for the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18554travel
50,Well worth a visit,"This is one of those places that is equally worth a visit during the day, or at night. Night is likely better since you get to admire the lamps fully lit. There are always a lot of people here, so be prepared to dodge and weave to make sure you get a photo without a lot of strangers in it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelbug13Canada

50,worth a trip and next to La Brea so combine the two.,"Unless you drive you'll have to taxi or Uber here. The Broad Museum and La Brea Tarpits are both on the same block. It's an all day experience. Don't go when it's too hot to La Brea. You'll swelter next to the bubbling pits. LACMA has many cafes, open terraces and sitting areas. Families will love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaC1964
50,So much to see,There was so much to see in this museum and I actually went back as I didn't get around it all in one go. The grounds are great too so you can spend all day here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Linda_UK_2015

40,I Liked it!,"We had a museum day for my husband's birthday and ended up at LACMA. It had been years since we'd been there and the compound had definitely grown. I greatly enjoyed the visit. Yep, the buildings seem a little dated, a tad tired, but I truly appreciated the eclectic feel. The curation was all over the place, a couple of Egyptian sarcophagus, some old masters, a Rembrant lecture going on around the corner from the religious art, but I have a short attention span so I enjoyed the 'surprise' around every corner. I also enjoyed the Japanese Pavillion. Natural light, interesting paintings but the sculpture, kimono and samuria exhibit were my favorite. It is a small, quiet museum and you won't leave feeling awed - you will leave satisfied. I prefered this Broad Pavillion to the one downtown. All in all it was a great way to spend a rainy afternoon and would be even better on a sunny one. Oh, and don't miss the Levitated Mass. Simple and awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaForster
50,Everyone will find some art to love.,"One rainy day while we were in Los Angeles we visited this museum. There are several buildings to explore all kinds of art. Modern art, sculpture, Classical American art, Picasso, Furniture that qualifies as art. You name it and its there, as well as art divided by origin. Native American art, central America, Japan etc. There are some fascinating exhibits and some we just walked by with a glance. It was a weekday, so there were many school groups visiting, with volunteer docents to explain some of the art. There is a Picasso exhibit that requires a separate admission. I found some of the fine furniture very beautiful. There is an exhibit called Metropolis, that is hundreds of small cars which go around a convoluted route over and over. We spent most of a day here, It was an excellent collection with something for everyone.Its a great museum to visit even if it is not raining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mazuza2
40,Picasso,"The Picasso display was excellent. Some of the other displays a mixed bag. Pardon my ignorance but some of the others are stealing a living. However, well done Pablo and great building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cricketdad
50,Lots to see - something for every taste,We spent a long rainy day checking all of the buildings and collections. There were so many beautiful surprises. Make sure you go online & get advanced tickets to James Turrell's Reignfall - AMAZING! Also surprised by the lovely Asian art building & its' exquisite collections. There was just so much fabulous stuff to see that we couldn't see it all in one day. Also there are several places to eat on the campus and all of the ones we hit were delicious!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shellco
40,A hoarder's treasure trove,"LACMA like the city it represents is a pastiche of every form of art known to man, from renaissance, to Chinese snuff boxes, Pollocks and some impressively banal modern art like ""Levitated Mass"". Unlike other museums with larger exhibits LACMA takes the time to explain the context of its pieces...maybe because they are few and thus more precious. Worth a visit.If you mispark (or ache at the thought of paying $14) you can leave the lot for free up to half an hour after entering with the same ticket. Park nearby and pay per hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LikeBear
50,So much good art!,This is a treasure trove of amazing art and unique creations by some of the worlds best known artist. My personal favorites are all the great Picasso but trust me that's only one aspect of what's there. Plan to spend sometime wondering in awe and slow down to enjoy the works.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBrooks2334
50,Amazing museum.A day is not enough to see everything!,We spent about four hours viewing the exhibitions and still we didn't have time to go into half the buildings.The exhibitions were awesome.We particularly enjoyed the Chinese ceramics and the Picasso and Rivera exhibition.I would advise visitors to check the website and choose the exhibitions you want to especially see and view them first.You won't have time to see everything.If museums are your thing you will love LACMA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/airmount
50,Friday night free jazz and free entry for LA county residents,Friday is my favorite day at LACMA. They have a good local jazz series in their courtyard and they let in LA residents for free. What could be better? Art and music for the soul.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haohuangpianist
50,"Contemporary Arts, well worth a look","Contemporary Arts, well worth a look. I have to keep reminding myself that if I see a pile of sand with a pitch fork sticking out, that this within an art museum IS ART! While I may have little appreciation of this type of art and I'm always hoping for so much more. To me some of it really doesn't belong however thousands of people would disagree. There are interesting pieces, it would've been helpful if upon payment into the museum that we had been informed this didn't include all exhibits. So please be careful ask a lot of question to avoid disappointment and it confusion. I conclusion a must visit some fascinating pieces to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marlainac2015
50,Fabulous museum,"LACMA is one of our favorite places to go. Not only that the permanent collection is great but there are always visiting exhibits and shows. There are music concerts, films, tours, walks and talks, programs for kids and many more. Well designed, attractive backdrop for good photography and the beautiful Rodin sculpture garden not to be missed. Wonderful for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAVict0ria

50,Take Your Time,"There is so much to see and unfortunately we ran out of time. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to wander around and really appreciate the works on display, inside and outside. If you are visiting near lunch time, don't miss out on the wonderful range of food trucks which are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/An0nym0usC0ntribut0r
30,meh,had an ok visit here with my husband last Saturday. I didn't see one artist I recognized but it was good to get out anyway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaribbeanFan79
40,Very Diverse,Has something for all tastes in art. We love medieval exhibits so spent a lot of time there. We managed to make our way through all the buildings. There are empty spots where they are getting ready to set up new exhibits. You can go often and see different things. I don't recommend eating here. The food looked good but very pricey. We bought 2 soft drinks and little bag of chips cost $10.87.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharon4554
40,Good just not great,Unfortunately we skipped the contemporary art building after being disappointed by the exhibits that were closed. The American Art and Pacific Art sections were closed. The art we did view was spectacular and there were groups of school kids enjoying themselves (that was lovely).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulietL164
40,Spend a whole day here,"Interesting and varied museum with beautiful art inside and outside. You could enjoy a full relaxing day here with the adjacent restaurants and outside walking areas. Full disclosure, we went on a free day so it was packed and parking was a nightmare (stood 30 minute line just to pay the machine the $14 standard parking ticket price, although we were just here for one hour).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susan90405
40,Too many people,Although this is a pretty place to be. There just too many people and its hard to take a picture without a stranger in the background. Parking is super expensive as well!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/801suev
30,As Museums go.....it's a ok.,"As Museums go.....it's a-ok. We went to see the Diego Rivera /Pablo Picasso exhibit, billed as ""see the similarities"" but the curators didn't do a good job doing so. Perhaps it was a bit of a stretch, or it could have been that I'm not well-educated in art history but I know what I like, and I found none of the 2 artists best pieces there and found no excitement generated by the exhibit. People didn't seem engaged, nor was I. For the most part: boring, actually.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesDye
50,LOTS OF SURPRISES,This is a high quality museum that offers interesting & surprising exhibits. We saw a mixed exhibit of Picasso & Diego Rivera which exposed some of their similar attitudes even though they came from different parts of the world. In addition there was a great exhibit of James Turrell called Breathing Light or Ganzfeld. It is meditation magic done with lights. There was also a great Rube Goldberg construction by Chris Burden called Metropolis II.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulesM913
50,LACMA Is Central to Los Angeles Arts,"Not only are the galleries and changing exhibitions always worthy of seeing, the area is too. From a huge suspended boulder to a lamp post forest outside, to other wonderful museums just next door and across the street, none should be missed. This museum and area is a treat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/275dianei
50,Great Museum keeps growing,A complex of several Art Museums good rotating exhibits; large crows should have bought tickets ahead Worth 2 days to see fully,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tote1940
50,Love the essential LA experience with large areas of land between buildings.,So much to see and yet easy of the traveler. There are many restaurants snack areas and seats to rest at and the organization of the museum I excellent. There are many visionary exhibits as well as tradition permanent collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinea750
50,One of the best museums in LA,"Worthy of a membership if you live in LA, and definitely worthy of a day trip if you are visiting. Check out their website for all the current installations, and their calendar for free events they host. Summer nights hey have free concerts, and member get many ""free perks"". I've been going to this museum since I met bed to LA 32 years ago, and it has never disappointed me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X902NWpaulag
40,A Few Closed Exhibits,"This is a good museum to visit if you are in the area. Just keep in mind that to get here, one uses the local streets, which takes time. There is underground paid parking.During our visit, there were a few closed exhibits, which was kind of disappointing. But otherwise, we still enjoyed ourselves. While it is unlike the Getty in terms of scope, depth and views, there is still so much to see. We even ate lunch at the cafe, which offered a great variety of items on the menu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josh_p01
40,Facelift Needed for this Conglometation,"I remember being awed by the LA County Art Museum when it was first built in the 60s. They had edgy installations like Barney's Beanery by Kienholtz. And it was shiny and new. Now It has lost an exterior unified style with additions and extensions. Elevators creak along. Art is well presented but the years on the edge of contemporary art was ceded back to SF, Chicago and New York long ago. Safe modern art, mostly dead people. Good dead people though. Ignores CA Funk art and major CA abstract expressionists or ceramicists. No Chicago Hairy Who?Still you will be awed by the Masters and you'll see plenty of great Asian ceramics. This Museum is fairly sparse in sculpture.We are next headed to the Getty, Huntington Library and Norten Simon with our tour group. Hopefully these other collections will fill in the gaps.I was spoiled by the renovated MOMA in San Francisco and the de Young. Frankly, I expected better of this fine ""old"" LA museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarshaS74
40,Huge but...,"Huge multi building site - very impressive and some great pieces of work - An oasis in a town that lacks all culture. Not that crowded which is great compared to European galleries.The bad news is the areas are very sparse, the building with the main exhibition had a 5 person lift with the main lift not working and no stairs.2 staff New their stuff and were very engaging, the other few hundred did not give a toss, in fact had chips on their shoulders. They did enjoy stopping us taking photos and when we pointed out the photos were allowed they skulked off.We went to the restaurant and was asked if we booked? Similarly in the Resnwick pavilion there was a wired electronic session - 3 month waiting list - next time I even think of going I will book things in advance - Not!Parking was $14 dollars in the lot opposite - seemed high but we were there for 5 hours.The shop were very small and very few posters or piccies of their art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bar_kochba
40,"Cool, but I like the Getty better.","This came up as one of the top rainy-day activities in Los Angeles, so we used it and the Petersen Automotive Museum to fill a very rainy day. I mean pouring rain that created rivers in the streets. We mostly went to connected buildings but covered and ran to get to the Japanese pavilion. We laughed at some very odd modern art and were awestruck by other art. Nice day, but I like the format of the Getty better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/44sabrinac

40,"Art, art, and more art","LACMA, as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is known, is not just one building, but several, each exhibiting a different type of art. There is a central courtyard with ticket and information booths and tables and chairs for visitors as well as a snack and drink stand, a café, and a more substantial restaurant. There are also a couple of lovely sculpture gardens. There were lots of young families with children enjoying themselves. Wonderful way to spend a few hours in L.

50,Never a Disappointment - Wonderful Exhibitions,"This is my second visit this year. Unfortunately just missed the Del Toro exhibit on Living with Monsters, but will catch it in the fall at the AGO in Toronto. Was able to view the Picasso and Diego Rivera exhibit which is very worthwhile. Was visiting LA for the holidays and visited with my adult son. There is something for all ages. Especially interesting was the exhibition of gifts of artists, several of whom bear watching for the future. Also, the Rainbow interpretation was memorable and one of the installations is captured in my photo. If you love contemporary art, this museum is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Art-Fashion-Travel

20,"Labyrinth of rooms, inappropriate art and extra fees spoil the visit",We have visited museums all over the country and the world. We are open to many types of art forms. But I must say LACMA was the worst museum ever visited. Various genres of art pieces were mixed together spoiling the appreciation of one form versus the other. Too many little rooms with long empty corridors to pass. Silly abstract art and some pieces that were right out revolting. Then extra fees needed to be paid for the most exciting collections. First time I ever been disappointed with a museum. Go to the Getty instead.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globewalker13
50,Take A course,"Museum offers art classes regularly throughout the year. We signed up for an ' Acrylic painting ' Class. Initially we were somewhat ambivalent about the instructions but as the class progressed through the weeks ( every Sunday for 3 hours for five sessions) the process of learning became enjoyable.Mr. Thom Dower, the artist, our instructor was congenial, knowledgeable and supportive.He was not intrusive yet guiding, showing different ways to handle the complexities of color mixing and handling of all the tools necessary for the art.I highly recommend this course for those who are desirous of learning to paint in acrylic. This is an excellent course to begin your exploration toward the hobby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laymya
50,Guillermo Del Toro Exhibition,"We came here to see the Bleak House Exhibition by Guillermo Del Toro. As it was a special exhibition, we had to pay an additional fee to the standard entry. But this allows you to roam around the entire museum for the day.The Bleak house exhibition was utterly fabulous and had a fantastic composition which allowed you to feel fully immersed in the land of Dickens and monsters.LACMA has a wonderful array of collections from all over the world and I feel as though a day could not do the Museum justice as there is just so much to see and take in.There is parking out front, but this is not exactly cheap and I'm sure if you do a bit of research, cheaper parking could be found close by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beadsbb
50,Wandering through Arts,"As we were in West Hollywood looking for an activity we went to LACMA, I never heard of the place before but it was definitely worth the time. There is a large range of art from ancient Egypt to modern Picasso including master pieces like Rembrandt paintings and iconic ones like Urban Light. My favorite parts is the open layout of the museum, you get a sticker with your tickets and you can go in and out without been checked and the rooms and buildings are interconnected so you can wander guided by your mood from one period to another from an artistic movement to a different one, so you will be lost in space and time allowing your soul to breath with the art you watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clauded290

40,LACMA Member,Just visited the Picasso and Diego Rivera exhibit and Los Angeles has definitely become a major Art scene with the Broad and various other museums and downtown art scene in Los Angeles. I have lived in the Bay Area for thirty years and Los Angeles has definitely surpassed San Francisco from an arts perspective. LACMA is definitely a world class museum and that is why I am a member of this museum and several others in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RBryan1011

Extensive collection of European pieces as well as Asian ones.Con: no audio guide. Even the guide app merely provide written intro. Also a bit easy to get lost in each building.Be sure to reserve if you want to check out the rain room.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msjessies
40,Great space and presentation,This is a large museum with collections housed in several buildings .. You need a full day or more to see everything. Like the large spaces and room for viewing the art. Outdoor patios on each floor and smaller rooms to make viewing comfortable and manageable. Only disappointment: the gift shop is not very good. Museums are known for their great gift shops-- still managed to purchase some items!! Will definitely need to return. The outside street light display was awesome- good photo pop!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharkisland

We did a lot of touristy things -- the usual photographs :)) The structure/displays were nice, especially the toy care one that showed different parts of the world (not sure what it was called) If you want to go to the rain room, you need a reservation. Since our visit to lacma was last minute we weren't able to make a reservation :( the lamps outside were beautiful at night.

But they do not have the grounds that we do unless you count Central park in NY.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180carlj
50,Well curated art from all over the world,"extensive European collection, both classical and modern. They have special exhibits with timed entry--get your beforehand. We found the lighting to be a bit frustrating at times as even though it was low intensity, some statues could have been illuminated from a better angle. It's massive in size with multiple buildings. Allow 4-5 hours if you enjoy art as much as we do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garlec

Whether you like figuring out where the eyes are on the weeping woman of Picasso, or the beauty of a 500 year old Japanese screen with gilded gold, or even the contemporary furniture of the Bauhaus, you will find new discoveries around every corner. Even though we had a laugh at the over sized pop art comb, and uttered the words, ""I could have done that"" while looking at white hexagon, we were very happy and appreciative of the amount of quality artwork on display.We would like to come back when we have more time and see the rest of the collection and take in one of the special exhibits. We would also like to check out the Japanese exhibit during the day to see the diffused light in the space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/105tjg

50,Great way to spend a day,"On a recent visit with my boyfriend, we jumped at the opportunity to go to the LACMA and see the special Guillermo Del Toro exhibit that was being showcased at the time. It was the first visit for the both of us and I was really impressed.The parking garage was an absolute godsend on a Saturday in LA and the museum itself was very convenient to get to. The museum campus has all sorts of cool exhibits on the outside that the general public could enjoy, as well as some nice sitting areas and cafes.The museum itself had an amazing collection. All kinds of artwork through many different periods and mediums. There's a little something for everyone. We, of course, really loved the Guillermo Del Toro exhibit and will definitely be on the lookout for other cool temporary exhibits that will be coming through.Would highly recommend this to anyone with a love of art or an afternoon to fill in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813caitlink
40,Great experience,"Me and my family visited LACMA last Sept 2016 and it was a great experience to see art. If you're travelling with children, you could enroll them for free at the childrens art museum at LACMA for free, each child gets free entrance until they reach the age of 18 years old, they will be issued a LACMA membership ID tag. Each child goes in for free together with one parent or guardian for free. If the kids have no membership, the guardian pays for the entrance fee to the museum. Also tripods and selfie sticks are not allowed to be used within the LACMA premises. If you wanna use your tripod or selfie stick to take a photo, you can use it on the sidewalks outside LACMA premises, I'm refering to the sidewalks on the roads. Also any kind of liquid is not allowed inside the art exhibits and also backpacks are prohibited inside the art exhibits. Also the best time to take a photo at the famous lamps would be around sundown where you could see the lights lit and still catch a little bit of sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spooncar9

Make sure you take time to view the world class exhibits and if you have time go next door to the La Brea Tar Pits or even the Petersen car museum- all within a few blocks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelledY3269JY
50,Truly a must for anyone interested in art,"As with most places in L.A., parking and traffic are a pain. However, it's all worth it (or just take the bus) if you get a chance to go through this museum. There are nearly always fantastic traveling exhibits, and the permanent collection is pretty amazing. Look for the Asian art collection, which is also fantastic. Spend time in the garden area and take it all in. It's one of the best art collections in the nation. My only issue with the museum is that, even if you are a member, the lines are tremendously long for special shows. When one joins, they don't expect to stand in line for an hour for an exhibit they already pre-paid for and have a ticket in hand. It feels like the Will Call counter line regardless of your planning. Be prepared for that, especially on a hot day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJD50

50,Never dissapointed.,Visiting LACMA is always special. The collections of art are outstanding as well as their special presentations. Their attractions always superb and worthy of many hours to browse or to see something unique. Spend a couple of hours - or most of the day will equal pure enjoyment.

Definitely can't wait to go back.For the price of admission, LACMA is a bargain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28WilliamS
40,Fantastic Day Out,"I've visited LACMA on two memorable occasions - the first to see the Tim Burton exhibit and the second to visit the Guillermo del Toro. I make a point of checking out as much of the artwork generally available too but I think their Master Filmmaker exhibits are the most interesting as you cannot see so much of it together in one place anywhere else/better exhibited. Loved all the concept art, statues, journals and films available. The artwork by others included in their exhibits that kept in the theme were fascinating too.The Japanese building is always worth checking out - architecture and artwork. Ray's & Stark Bar as well as C+M offer yummy food and drink though the former is a little on the pricier side. I had a Pumpkin Latte (I was living the American dream :P) at C+M which was the best I've ever gotten. There is so much to see here it's worth planning a little ahead to make sure you get to all of it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrancescaLW217

50,Guillermo del Toro Exhibit,"We recently spent a half day at LACMA, the premier modern art museum of LA. We took in the Guillermo del Toro exhibit of all the ghoulish constructs associated with his movies--just in time for Halloween. There's always a lot to see at LACMA. We experienced the sensory deprivation room which was fun. Also ""Metropolis,"" with hundreds of whirring little cars on dozens of tracks amidst a fanciful multi-level modernistic urban landscape. LACMA has food and wine for sale at multiple venues, although they are a bit expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebelVirginia
50,This is my favorite museum in Los Angeles,The amount of joy this place has brought me is priceless. They often have great special exhibits like the rain room or the Del Torro exhibit but the collection that lives there is stunning. There is a lot of great art that ranges all the way back to the BC. Be sure to check out the renaissance art upstairs. Its stunning!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBrooks2334

50,Huge and eclectic collection,"Most of the art on display comes from very large donations of private collections.An example is the collection of Armand Hammer, an oil man,His collection, as a personal statement of his ability to pick good things, is truly incredible. Unfortunately it is not a good collection to study a particular period in time, or a movement or a country. While there a number of master works that any visitor to LA must-see; there are numerous lesser paintings of lesser Italian, Dutch, German, etc. painters. I walked from a room with Egyptian artifacts into another room with 18-19th century porcelain; then back into a room of 17th century paintings. Confusing!While it has a wow-factor (how on earth did he assemble all of this?), it is not a very good place for art education for the general public. It is however widely used by college-level art students.Just like the British Museum and the Louvre, it is difficult to visit this place in one day.It is highly recommended to take one of the guided tours. I also recommend that you consult the website and use it to plan a visit. If not, you will be bewildered.The are 4 or 5 more large individual collections, each of which would take at least a half day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincent-dirks

50,May Be One of the Best Art Museums in the U.S.,"Wow. I really liked this place. I go to art museums in nearly every city in the world I visit but this has to be one of the best. Far from stuffy, this place makes you want to linger. Exquisite Islamic art, Art of the Pacific--and Picassos that will make you re-think the artist. There is a view of the Hollywood sign from one of the platforms and special exhibits worth the extra money. I especially liked one of the exhibits where there was no explanation next to the piece of art. You had to pick up a guide to read what you were seeing. It's counter-intuitive but it made you look closely at the art rather than gloss over the description. It is not so much just an art museum but rather a place that seems to integrate art into real life. How lucky LA is to have this gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhartig1
50,Friday Evening Jazz,Went to the museum and decided to attend a live jazz concert. The concert was free and lasted for 2 hours. The atmosphere was wonderful. Really enjoyed my Friday evening at the LACMA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erbdan1954
50,"Great exhibits, music and pictures",LACMA begins with the old street lights that defines the museum. It is great to take pictures there any time of day. Personally I think the exhibits are far behind other museums in technology and some special exhibits are curated poorly. Despite all of that it is well worth going. The newer buildings are set up better and more is to come as the museum gets new construction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yolidog
40,A worthwhile Experience,I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this museum and loved a great deal of the art displayed and found the architectural layout of the displays very pleasing. I sincerely hope that I will be able to spend more time here on my next visit. I recommend it warmly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/31Extensivetraveller
50,Wonderful collection,"There is quite an extensive collection of various types of art. If you know a lot about art and various artists, you could spend hours here. My husband & I spent a couple of hours & had seen enough at that point. If you like to rest periodically I don't think there are seats scattered around to do so. It is a large museum and the items & paintings are presented very nicely. The La Brea Tar Pits are located next to the LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EC6393
30,Great pieces to see but...,"While visiting my sister in LA, we decided to hit up LACMA for the del Toro exhibit. We went on a Sunday which, unbeknownst to us, was Family Day. So hordes of people and screaming kids are what you can expect on the weekends.The museum complex is huge and we were there for a little over 2 hours before the construction, closed exhibits like the Rain Room, and all those people just got the best of us. When I could view some displays and pieces without getting bumrushed by people who probably don't really care for art, I did enjoy what LACMA offers.The del Toro exhibit was wonderful, but again, overrun with people so the whole exhibition hall was hot and noisy. When it comes to appreciating art, no one in the crowds really seemed to care. I've been to art museums in other large cities and enjoyed the quiet, calm experience of admiring work I could never do. If that's what you're hoping for, LACMA will not deliver.I go to LA every couple years and I don't have any plans to return to this museum. Parking is underground, $14, and not payable by cash. Irritation and annoyance at other museum goers is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/78Andriamar
50,Very large and very nice,"Great museum with extensive collections - I spent 4 hours and only got through 2 buildings. Exhibits are well-curated and informational signs tell about not just the works you are looking at, but others add larger context. It is also well-visited. So great to see people all over actively talking about the art. A nice break from studio tours and theme parks for the LA visitor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrMomPhD
50,Sprawling art museum requiring an extended visit.,I was surprised how much I enjoyed LACMA and how much I enjoyed their collection. I lingered so long in their G. del Toro exhibit that I ran out of time for their collection.

40,Diverse and Worthwhile Experience,"LACMA is gorgeous! I love the sea of lamp posts and the overhanging rock exhibits outside of the museum, perfect locations for beautiful picture taking! Inside the museum courtyard is a fun interactive yellow exhibit you can walk into, it was so fun going inside and feeling all giddy like a kid again! There's a large array of artwork available, from contemporary to renaissance to medieval. The building housing Japanese artwork is beautiful, I love the incorporation of zen themes into it! Definitely a worthwhile experience, although at a bit of a price. For college students such as myself, the $30 student membership price is well worth it, although I don't think I would ever pay the regular $60 membership price. Great museum, and still growing! Worth a visit and a return visit or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParkerGreen

Restrooms are sign posted and never too far away.The landscape around the museum is also lovely and worth including some time for wandering around there too.All staff I spoke to were friendly and helpful.Roadworks is causing some detours to get there at the moment but didn't add a lot of time to travel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F9803HAhelenc

50,World class museum.,I've been member of LACMA for several years now and never tire of going through the galleries and the grounds. Good food and drinks (including cocktails) are located at any of several places within the grounds also a nice cafe that makes a great cappuccino. The changing special exhibits always add something new to see or experience and the permanent galleries are worth viewing multiple times. It takes more than one visit to truly experience LACMA. Friday night jazz concerts in the summer are also a great time to come. Currently the Guillermo Del Toro exhibit is fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/101johnnyboi

I am so glad I did!The Urban Lights are free to the public and I think they are open everyday. We visited in the evening after they were all lit up. You get amazing pics here, color or black and white. It's a very romantic setting, although the day we went there was some construction going on right there so not that romantic, haha. Nonetheless, it's an amazing exhibit, it's free. If you go after 7 pm then you can even park in the museum parking for free.Absolutely loved it! Find empty spots and click away.P.S.: I wanted to visit the museum too but unfortunately it was closed on the very day we visited (Wednesday)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriyamGopani
50,A Lot of Art,"Although I have a LACMA membership and volunteer at the Page Museum at the opposite corner of the park, I hadn't been to LACMA in over a year. I saw about half of it, including the popular temporary exhibit Del Torro.The four original 1965 buildings still stand, although one was enlarged long ago and they are slated to be replaced soon. The Bruce Goff designed Japanese Art Pavilion is filled with Japanese art as you might expect. There are dedicated areas, floors, and buildings to many types of art, Chines, Indian, Korean, American, Contemporary, etc. The two new buildings to the west of the original are mostly contemporary. The LACMA West building is now being remodeled into a new Academy Museum so no longer part of LACMA. Between and around the buildings are plazas, areas with sculpture, and don't worry, there are several gift shops and at least three places to eat. There is usually enough parking in a small lot south of Wilshire and a new large underground parking on the north side.LACMA is part of Museum Row and while the number of museums varies from year to year, at this moment, the Page is in the same park, Folk Art and Petersen Automotive Museums are across the street, I'm not sure if the A + D is still there. Long ago there was a Miniatures Museum and a Holocaust Museum and in a few years will be the Academy Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
50,"Amazing museum, so much to see","LACMA houses a diverse collection of art from round the world. Contemporary US artists next to European classical pieces, alongside Korean and Islamic art. I happily spent 3 hrs here and could easily return to see more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarsywarsy
50,Love LACMA,"This place continues to grow, with two recent additions and one on the way. They continue to have all sorts of things in their very eclectic collection. Since we were with a four-year old, we were delighted to be able to take her to the water-painting class, where she had a great time. She also the must have spent the better part of an hour running through the outdoor spaghetti sculpture with several other kids. In short, they've got something for everyone here and it's all high quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaTraveler7777
40,Very rare collections in a beautiful park setting!,"The museum is full of rare and expensive collections especially from Picasso, Degas, and Warhol. I liked the tour of American art. Well done! A perfect activity for a family or couple! A little pricey for a county museum, but you can go on certain holidays for free! Just not on Labor Day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelaM7103IC
30,Interesting Experience,"This place has been on my radar for quite a while, however it ended up being an eerie experience for me. There is an essence at this place that is a bit spooky. I'm not sure if anyone else feels what I feel but it's a little unnerving, with a slight tension in the air. I can definitely tell that there is paranormal activity there...could just be me though! :-/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/390dezg
50,Awesome!,"This museum is a must see for anyone who enjoys beauty. I saw James Turrell's big light room exhibit for the second time. Also the Reignfall, which is an 11 minute solitary sphere experience of both light and sound.We topped it off with Guillermo del Toro's exhibit of monsters, quite interesting.We became members because we will go more often.We went into the Rain Room which was an experience. It stops raining where you walk to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scigris
50,Fantastic Exhibit,We didn't go inside but the Street Light exhibit out front is really cool. Great for artistic photographers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WineauxAlexandria
50,Huge and impressive collection,A little bit of something for everyone! From modern to Asian to Impressionism and more. If you are hungry or wants glass of wine there is a nice outdoor restaurant. Also walking distance to LaBrea Tar Pits,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimporterfield
40,Incredible art collections and spaces,We spent a really interesting half day at LACMA. We bought an all exhibitions ticket for $25 eachThere were so many different styles of art displayed in a wide variety of locations within the grounds.I particularly liked the mesoamerican and pacific island exhibitions. I've been to lots of exhibitions in the past and yet saw things today that I'd never seen before.There was also an excellent exhibition on monsters. That was so engaging and you could take pictures of every piece in this exhibition.The only suggestions I have is to improve the quality of food served in the cafe Milk and Coffee. Also a shame that we couldn't see 2 of the exhibits as they were fully subscribed.Never the less definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S6027VHmarias
30,Beautiful architecture,A very beautiful architecture and design for a museum. Modern and quiet and neat. Great to spend a couple of hours wandering around with family. I don't think there is much work of art though. Maybe I expected more. One may visit the Brea park just next to it. Parking costs usd 14 but one might just park at the street outside for usd 1 per hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yoy555
40,"Saw the lights, it was neat","Came here at night, everything was closed so we took some pictures at the Urban Lights along with 100 other people. It was kinda neat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnlightenedExplorer
50,"Great museum, both for its shape and contents",Beautiful buildings for art masterpieces.From XVI century to contemporary art.Mostly enlightened by natural sunlight. Gorgeous!Not to be missed.A must-do activity in L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elisabettal174
50,Imaginative,Haven't been to the museum for yearsWe went to see a special exhibit byGeirmo del toro Great timeThen we just wondered around all the other exhibits. Nice day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardgregg11
50,Had to see the Frank Gehry retrospective in models!,"For our Retirement from Teaching trip, my friend and I decided to go to Paris (to see Frank Gehry's latest architectural masterpiece, Fondation Louis Vuitton) and to Bilbao (to see Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum). Upon our return from Europe, we went to Los Angeles County Museum of Art's exhibit of many of Frank Gehry's architectural models! It was a great way to cap our trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenak63
50,give yourself plenty of time,"it's more suitable for art-lovers/education... well, it a good-to-go too if you dont mind.. ""look-see"", give yourself plenty of time... and head back after sunset to see the public art : urban lights! petersen automotive is around the corner too!definitely worth a trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asylumescapee
50,Amazing place,I was there with my friends and we have a great time. You can't miss it if you are at LA. I will come back soon!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/685janam
50,You need more than a day!,I was very impressed with my visit there. I've lost count how many Picasso's they have. Such a huge collection of everything. We were only there for a day and that was just one building! I wanted to see the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibit but I didn't have the time. There are exhibits that photography is not permitted but you are allowed most of the areas. Definitely would visit again next time I'm in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spooky_dooky
40,great museum,I really enjoyed the many different buildings that are home to so many different types of art. Some were completely NOT to my taste-but were very appreciated by others. I love 'old' artwork and styles-and they do not let you down here. I could have spent the entire day just looking at the magnificent old world paintings and statues.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenayK1
50,A world Class Museum,It is fitting that the largest County in America has one of the finest museums. You will love their accumulation of art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithp867
40,Fun,"I definitely enjoyed visiting LACMA, it was an awesome experience with friends. I loved the little eatery at the front where you could sit and have drinks. Very chill. Also if you're into Pokemon hunting, there are tons running around. I love to people watch, so it was nice to grab a spot under a tree and just relax and observe everyone. Would definitely come back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/615shael
50,Awesomeness,The rainroom is Breathtaking amazing experience! I would recommend it to everyone! Park on the street! It's metered & cheaper,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judyblonde86
50,Reigning Men and Guillermo Del Toro,"I traveled to Los Angeles specifically to see the ""Reigning Men - 400 years of Men's Fashion"" exhibit. It did not disappoint me. It is a special admission ticket as was the ""Guillermo Del Toro: At Home with Monsters"" exhibit. The monsters exhibit was an un-expected treat. However, the graphic content of this exhibit may be inappropriate for younger viewers. There is a LOT to see even if you visit just for the permanent collection. Too much to see in one visit. Check out their website and you can plan on viewing what you would be most interested in seeing. There are some interactive exhibits which would keep young ones interested. Also, it is next to the La Brea Tar Pits, so you can take a break from the art and look at some of the pits oozing tar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelredearth
50,LACMA AN LA MUST SEE,"Every great city should have a fine art museum. When you visit LA see LACMA, The Broad, and the Getty Center in that order and will be thrilled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
50,Give yourself plenty of time to enjoy the museum,"You are going to need many hours to get lost in the collection this museum offers. There are free guided tours that give you more details about the artwork, or you can explore on your own. Either way, you are guaranteed to see art that will make you think as well as make you feel. I would highly recommend seeing this museum in combination with the Tar Pits next door. It will be a fun and educational day for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SrarMilor
50,Bigger and Better than you think,Away back in the late 60's I found myself in LA and went to the museum. The tan concrete building looked to me like a suburban bank. Inside there were a few gallery full of 3rd rate works by various artists. After less than a hour I left. At that time I lived in NYC and had worked in the MET so my impression was informed by where I had been. Outside in the blazing sun I wondered if Wilshire Blvd went right to the beach. Just last month a friend was in town and wanted to be meet at LACMBetween the parking and the plaza I got lost in the maze of buildings. Some old some new. When had all this happened ?She and I went around to see the special show on her to do list.And I stayed to check the monster out. Long before I had seen the half of it --I retraced my steps back to the car and tried to beat the rush hour back home. Museums often have more than they show due only to a lack of space. And a few years had passed so new donors had clearly been giving grandly. No it is not the MET or Louvre but it is very LA. True some of the galleries could be anywhere but many have a sense of fun and spirit that could only be found right here.Could this now take 2/3 days to see it all. Depends on your interest but I know that one hour will not do it even if you only wnat to see the top ten things here.d,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divagreta2016
40,Great place,I recommend coming here early in the morning because they have six different buildings! They have interesting exhibitions to people with different interests. At one point it gets boring because every building is a least 3 levels....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fozb703
50,Excellent museum,One of the best modern art museums we have seen - spectacular at night time - one of the highlights on our California trip - highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GRAHAMMMCFARLANE
40,Beautiful by the Night.,Not to be missed during one's trip to LA. Huge museum and go with time on your hands. Go by evening and wait till the lights around the arena illuminate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KIRTI3723
50,Really Neat Museum,"LACMA offers a great variety of art and interactive displays. Our 5 year old had fun walking through displays and painting in one of the kids' rooms. LACMA offers special temporary exhibits that require paid tickets, but most of the museum is free. It could be a great all-day or half-day activity. I highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z4128QPmariab
50,Great museum,"This visit I concentrated on the permanent collections of mainly American art and Modern European and American art. Outstanding. Love the Pollocks, Rothkos, Hockneys.Even on a very busy day, there always seems to be room to view at LACMA. Also recommend a break at Ray and Stark's bar. Really friendly staff.Have now seen my 3 favourite Hckneys - the Australian National Gallery has A Bigger Grand Canyon and A Diver. LACMA has Mulholland Drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arncliffegirl
50,Great Museum,The largest museum in the West USA. Collection of more than 150.000 piece of art spanning all over the history of human kind,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pierrec577
40,Curation is Spot On,"Having visited the LACMA on many occasions, I have had the pleasure of seeing numerous temporary exhibits, and I am consistently impressed by the quality of the curation. The new Guillermo del Toro exhibit, ""At Home with Monsters,"" as well as the men's fashion exhibit, ""Reigning Men,"" are perfect examples. In the del Toro show, snippets from his films play in the background, demonstrating the themes discussed in every room, which are connected by winding passages and discourage a direct trajectory through the work (I went with three other people, and we all ended up meandering through separately, taking totally different routes). Additionally, allowing guests to flip through digitized versions of del Toro's journals was an ingenious touch. Everything feels creepy and personal. It is perfection. Similar attention to detail is displayed in the other exhibits. The Mapplethorpe exposition is one of the only instances in which something was left to be desired in the curation. As for the permanent exhibits, they are enjoyable, but not totally transporting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliaDay7
50,Guillermo del Toro exhibition,Very interesting place first time there with mi kids and they loved it. Guillermo del Toro exhibition was phenomenal highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/440alejandrab

50,A great museum for all ages,"The L.A. County Museum of Art has something for everybody, ranging from children's activities to concerts, as well as an excellent collection of art. Their permanent collections are quite varied and they bring in interesting temporary traveling exhibits. There is a nice gift shop and there are places to eat. LACMA is next to the La Brea Tar Pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/letsgotochina
50,Monsters Exhibit-Guillermo Del Toro,"Great exhibit! Might not be suitable for little kids. Saw a couple that had to leave because their child was very scared.There is a lot to see-take your time and circle through a couple of times!You have to look ""into"" some of the displays and this was a challenge due to some inconsiderate patrons who acted like it was a private showing.Miss Manners says, ""Don't be the moron who stands directly in front of the write up on the wall/exhibit/display case when others are already engaged and are politely standing back far enough so everyone can see.There's always that one museum patron who is oblivious...jeez!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/624lauriem
50,Definitely one of my favorite museums in LA,"Excellent collection, Ive spent many days here!Their exhibitions are astounding. The views are fab. The entire place has a great style.Guillermo Del Toro's monsters are on display until November ~ can't wait!Free on the second Tuesday of each month & LA county residents get in free every weekday after 3pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VodouGza
50,Love it!,"If you like contemporary art, you'll enjoy LACMA. Nice variety of artwork, great layout and cool architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethp938
50,Never dissapoints,"LACMA always has wonderful exhibits that appeal to every taste. Perfect for all kinds of visitors, solo, families, dates, etc.LA residents receive free general admission after 3pm every weekday LACMA is open. (Closed Wednesday)If you live locally, it is certainly worth getting the membership because it offers priority tickets to some special exhibits, discounts and not to mention free general admission.There are usually free jazzier dormancy in the open outdoor area. No fees to attend but it does get crowded as it's quite popular. Several brought picnics but confessions are available right there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadamVeuve
50,Should be top on your LA to-do list,"Outstanding art museum in a gorgeous setting and environment. Me and my 14 year old son went last Friday. !7 and under are free. Think adults are around $30? I was partial to my Philadelphia Museum Of Art but I might have to become a trader. On top of it being a terrific art museum it is surrounded by interesting outside art and is adjacent to another museum. We got a 3 for one last Friday when we paid regular admission prices but were given access to a terrific early evening Jazz Performance and access to a ""Guillermo Del Toro"" exhibit on top of access to the 6 buildings of art. Give this one a full day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BargainHunter247
40,nice enough,"The LACMA is just your basic collection of fine art....it doesnt really have anything that is the best example of its type....most items are just nice examples of the artists work...still,a nice place to visit and spend an afternoon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988mathewm
20,Eh..,Basic art museum wasn't exactly impressed with anything in there. I'm not big into art so it was rather boring to me. Plus we paid extra to see two exhibits and one was about like sex in the 80's and it was literally naked men holding each other and giant pictures of penises on the wall... Not my thing... Sorry.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tkeenan1
50,Always a good stop,"This is a wonderful art museum, probably even for those who are not ""big"" on art. There is great variation in the exhibits. I hate having to pay more for the special exhibits but that is typical in many other museums as well. The construction has caused many of the regular pieces/exhibits to be placed in storage so that was disappointing. The docents are either extremely informed or do not have a clue. There really does not seem to be an ""in-between"". There are multiple locations for a snack, drink, or meal that are all quite nice and some nicely priced as well. I am sorry the Rain Room tickets are always sold out in advance....It sounds like an experience to not miss if you can plan your visit ahead of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanny1419
50,"Must see ""Guillermo del Toro: At Home with Monsters"" exhibit!","LACMA is a large, beautiful museum! My husband and I went to see the special exhibit, ""Guillermo del Toro: At Home with Monsters"", and it was fantastic! The exhibition is from the collection of movie director, Guillermo del Toro. It includes art, costuming, and props used in his films and many paintings, life size figure sculptures, and oddities from his Bleak House collection. The exhibit runs until November 27th, 2016 and then will travel to Toronto and Minneapolis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/logcabinlady
50,Great variety - too much to see in one visit,"My 17-year old son picked this museum to visit before ending his summer break and was pleasantly surprised to find that he qualified for free youth admission. The LACMA parking lot was full when we arrived at 1:00 pm, but there was ample parking within a few blocks. Our family of four spent three hours touring the various exhibits and still did not get to see everything even without paying for the specially ticketed exhibitions. We covered quite a bit of ground walking to / through the various buildings, so I'm glad we wore comfortable shoes. We explored the exhibits without participating in any of the free tours and particularly enjoyed the Pavilion for Japanese Art and the various works of Pablo Picasso. I appreciated the variety of art presented at this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GinaR400
50,Fabulous museum,"Lots of buildings, great art, knowledgeable attendants, great architecture, wonderful open air spaces. A true gem in the heart of this massive city. Not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyCamperNorwalk
40,Great art museum,"While my wife shopped with a friend on Rodeo, I slipped down Wilshire to see the La Brea Tar Pits I had always heard about as a kid. While there I saw the LACMA and saw how renowned it was. I actually started by getting a drink at the cafe and just deciding to buy a ticket.Let me just say, I am not the most artistic person but I really enjoyed some of the exhibits. In fact many great works of art including the museums own architecture could be enjoyed freely outside. While I did see some Picasso's and other artist, I was drawn to the modern art building mainly for the view from the 3rd floor which provided a great panoramic viewing point for the Santa Monica Mountains or Hills as they are often referred in LA.After taking pictures, I went downstairs and saw my favorite piece in the museum. It was like a miniature city made of various building with ramps for cars and this was an active exhibit that began to move feeding toy cars to the top where they would run down the ramps through the city. It was not only a fun exhibit to watch but it really spoke to the emphasis we place on transportation and mobility.I then visited the exhibit across the way that included several historic Hawaiian ceremonial robes made from bird feathers. They to we're exquisite when you saw them. While I would have like to have seen more. I had to visit the tar pits as well. Great museum even if you only see a fraction of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
50,2nd Visit Worthy,"I don't remember much from my first visit back in 2011, so I decided to go again the second time. It was my friend's first time coming (and he lives in LA!). I think the exhibits were quite captivating this time around. My favorite part has to be the giant red elevator in the exhibition hall. I was sad to find out the rain room required reservations so that was a no go for me. Depending on the time of year you come, you'll find something different.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fieryx21
50,Must See Museum,"Every time I go to LA which is twice a year on average, I always make time to go to LACMA. This time I visited I even purchased a membership for my son and his partner. The Rain Room is spectacular experience. Walk slowly and feel the elements surround you. The exhibition on the history of men's fashion was educational and wonderfully curated. There are tours to add to your knowledge and experience. The Mapplethorpe exhibition showed a good representation of Mapplethorpe oeuvre--his courage over fear. Take time to see the Metropolis installation which made me think of LA freeways as the cars whizzed by. An exhibition of capes and headdresses made from flowers was a surprise find and worth seeing. And don't forget the Boulder suspended above you. A perfect spot for your Instagram photo. I have only touched on what I saw in July, each trip is another discovery and delight. Check out LACMA's website before visiting to plan your trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Art-Fashion-Travel
40,The Ligts are On But Nobody's Home,"This is cool, little attraction attached to the LACMA. Spend a few minutes under the lights, maybe take a romantic selfy, and then move on to the main attractions -- the LACMA and the LaBrea Tar Pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drucksterino
30,A decent museum,"Good for a half day/couple hours.Various buildings and exhibits that obviously change.The dining options here are good, but of course pricey.Currently a bit of construction going on around the area.Parking is cheaper at the Peterson museum across the block.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobChills
50,Iconic art museum; must-do selfie with the installation of URBAN LIGHT,"The exhibits here can be hit-or-miss but there is a permanent small collection of German Expressionist paintings that are always worth the drive. We love them and so do our nieces and nephews...we debate which is the loveliest. When visiting LACMA, we almost always enjoy a meal at RAY'S STARK BAR. The atmosphere inside or outside is terrific, the service is stellar and the food is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxskin
40,Hit or miss depending on what you expect to see,"My preference is modern art, so I am thrilled to see that Lacma has expanded and continues to have current shows. I'd love to see more LA artists represented!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Webisan
30,Not the Louvre!,"Crowded, information packets that are wrong and don't have the current exhibits listed; exhibitions that are just okay. Mapplethorpe and Menswear currently playing. The former not for kids. My complaint is that your general admission ticket does not include the special exhibitions. You pay about $25 extra, which if you're accustomed to European museums, is annoying. I pay less at the Louvre and Uffizi for more interesting art. The Rain Room tickets are sold out for months. And much of LACMA's art is so so. Sure, Monet, Renoir, the modern fare. Often, a disappointment. But you can dine al fresco at the Snack Bar, which is pretty good. Order the fries, and a nice glass of wine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarreJ
50,Finally...Some culture in LA!,LACMA has come leaps & bounds in the last few years-Amazing exhibits on par with some NY museums.Pleasant staff and easy parking. Highly recommend purchasing a membership or at least tickets ASAP for new/special exhibits!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acla1026
50,First time,Had a great time going. My friend got the membership their. The rain room was cool accept for the ppl that didn't follow directions and that one lady that let her child run in the water back and forth was annoying. The workers should of said or some something. Waiting on the guillermo del toro exhibit to come up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtaizan
40,You'll (Probably) Get Wet in The Rain Room,"Fantastic and whimsical short term installation - they just released some more tickets - so definitely don't miss this opportunity. It's summer in LA and the heat has been intense so this was a welcome respite from the weather. Without giving too much away, you will 'control the rain' (cue the maniacal laugh) - but if you don't listen to instructions (or don't care about listening to instructions) you will get wet. If you do listen carefully, you still might get some drops on you. A man in front of us had fully covered his expensive camera with a huge lens in plastic and rubber bands. My unwrapped and unprotected digital camera was fine, although I used some napkins in my purse to shield it from the big drops that came down towards the end. The museum staff are vigilant about exiting guests after 15 minutes - so don't be surprised when it's time to go - It's Time To Leave! All in all - very special and my kids loved it too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineess
50,World-class museum!,"LACMA is a world-class museum! It is great for kids, teens, and adults. There is fantastic art and even hands-on art for the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/57TomW
50,Unique !,"An impressive modern complex of buildings . I wisited American Art, galleries with modern paintings,the Stowe vase, Agnes Martin exhibition .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aikaterini2013
50,Mapplethorpe exhibition,"So we drove 3,000 miles to see the Mapplethorpe exhibition, for real - and it did not disappoint. Showing at both LACMA and the Getty, the collection here really highlighted Mapplethorpe's skills and told his story well. Very well curated. The men's fashion exhibit was also interesting, and the Anges Martin one helped me gain a better understanding of her work. We were here on a Saturday, and while crowded it did not detract from our experience. It just took some patience to park in the garage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carly_V_McCoy
40,Museum visit,"The place has a great atmosphere. Its breezy, good for jogging/walk in the park, and try to be there during sunset because it is the perfect time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3056OJjamess
50,Very good exhibitions,"This time, we only really saw the Mapplethorpe exhibition, a fashion exhibition and the European 20th century in the permantent exhibition. A very good museum with great permanent and temporary exhibitions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BjornSm
50,Ah-mazing! Love love love this musrum,Wonderfully curated exhibits. Really interesting. Soooo kid friendly. Really good cafe onsite. And a kids center that does arts and crafts and painting daily.Local kids have a free membership and can take one adult with them. (Doesn't apply to special exhibits but there is s lot to see that IS included),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culinary-widow
50,"GREAT - art, grounds, next to the tar pits, LA MUST","As a native Angelino, proud of what i consider the heart of LA. Every time we have visitors we send them to LACMA...tell them to enjoy the beautiful, diverse collections and then enjoy the outside...walk over to the tar pits.On Friday evenings (i should hide this) there's great music outside, huge fun for families.On Sunday mornings kids get to participate in hands-on crafts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arielmc
40,Interesting Galleries,If you enjoy art and design you'll enjoy this place. The Agnes Martin exhibit was well curated and interesting. We had a limited amount of time so we did not explore the entire collection. The parking was reasonable and easily accessible. The restaurant had delicous food at mid-range price. Overall a nice 2 hour place to visit for us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ms67ca
50,Take your time or hit the Highlights,"I believe this museum has enough to be a whole day affair with a break for lunch at the very good Ray's restaurant. However, I understand fatigue especially with families. So, if you cannot take your time, here are my suggestions to hit the highlights.First, the special exhibits are worth it. For instance, the rain room may be sold out, but if you ask, there are openings. Also, James Turrell has an exhibit (think of the lighting inspiration for Drake's Hotline Bling video as well as commercial) that is more than worth it. Also, the retrospective on Agnes Martin is wonderful. So, schedule these and then find the major works in the museum's holdings from the Hockney, Matisse, Diego Rivera. Also, Metropolis as well as the outdoor installations are fun for smaller children.Parking is easy if you can get it in the lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j_otter_1111
40,Huge variety of art,Student admission was $10 and the size of the museum makes it worthwhile - a range of art not just European but Asian and Latin American.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8643LNmatthews
40,Lots of photo opportunities,"The main attraction for me was the Urban Lights, I have seen it in So many movies, it's a nice place to roam around and just enjoy the grounds, it's also nice and cool if you want to escape inland valley heat",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanedwardazcueta
40,"Good museum, a little disorganized",For art lovers this place is certainly a must. Nevertheless the museum is too big and not so well organized for its size. It's easy to get lost so bear in mind what you would like to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuMenMo
40,Architecturally Arresting,"I was struck by the different buildings that house the collections. There are vast spaces between buildings so you get a sense of the place and of its unique outdoor installations. We spent time in the modern art area viewing the Mappelthorpe exhibit which is not for the squeamish but very interesting. We also saw Metropolis which is hard to explain but memorable. You have to go when the cars are running which is every other hour Check the schedule. Finally, we viewed the museum's extensive Picasso collection in the Ahmanson building. It is clearly impossible to see all of LACMA in one day but there are nice outdoor cafes to rest at. If you are like us, a few hours and we are done but very happy to have been there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Corn1789
20,Hostility in a sea of tranquility,"Last week I visited LACMA with high hopes. My fifteen-year-old son, who is developing an interest in art, did a lot of research on the museum's collections. Here you can find Picasso's works in one area and classics by Rembrandt in another. Also, throw in a provocative exhibit by Robert Mapplethorpe and you have the making of an intellectually stimulating afternoon, right? Not so fast....I have traveled to museums from New York to Paris to St. Petersburg (Russia) and have yet to come across such a group of hostile employees as we did at LACMA. Don't you dare breathe in the direction of an Impressionist painting, or take a photo in a room where you were told cameras were allowed only to be upbraided by a security guard for taking photos. My wife and I spoke to a supervisor about the aggressive behavior of a guard in the Picasso room only to be told that ""it's stressful guarding the Picasso art"" and that we need to be mindful of that. Guarding it from what? From who? To be talked to that way in a museum that is not a first-rate institution is laughable as well as insulting. I was hoping that a LACMA visit would help instill a love of art in my teenage son, but he came away with the feeling that viewing and enjoying art is a stressful, frustrating experience.Take my advice. Go to the Getty or other museum in LA. It's a big town with more to offer. I'm sad to say that this was a low point in our trip. Otherwise, outside of LACMA, the people we met in LA were exceptionally polite and a pleasure to interact with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LHD1967
50,a day in the life of Los Angeles,"Always fun to take the kids to see the current exhibitions at LACMA, take a stroll around the property on a beautiful day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherryG487
50,Exceptional attraction,This is one of my favorite art museums. I love the variety of exhibits. It's a fascinating place and I enjoy learning about the background/history connected with the displayed artwork.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelRobs
50,"Highly entertaining, family/couple friendly area","I went to LACMA solo which is great because there's so much to see with multiple exhibitions, some of which are only there for a limited time.You pay an entry fee with the option of seeing some limited edition exhibitions for a little extra.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73natashaa
50,Free days are a steal,When visiting a city we are always checking out free days offered at local museums. You will be surprised at how many places offer such a deal. We ran into a number of tourists at LACMA who were unaware that the day we visited it was free to the public. LACMA is a treasure in LA and when it's free it's a real steal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoboTravlr
40,Something for everyone at this Museum complex,"Art; photography, sculpture, paintings, installations, cafes, and even tar pits!The Richard Serra Structure RIBBON was the highlight for me this visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltect
20,Art is great but staff is not!,"We were very excited to visit LACMA. The art was wonderful but the security staff were overwhelming and a constant disruption. They would constantly follow us to be sure we weren't stepping over the line even though we were not close. We were told we could take photos but then we were yelled at in an area where that was not the case without our knowledge -- so tell people nicely when they enter that portion -- not afterwards! We could not enjoy the artwork because of the constant badgering. Funny -- as we are all adults -- not like we had little kids. We've been fortunate to travel to art museums all over the world -- with much better exhibits -- and have never been accosted as we were at LACMA. Please give your security staff a lesson in customer service. And they added me to their mailing list when I made a reservation for one of their exhibits without my permission -- annoying. We do not recommend this museum based on this experience. And keep in mind that they charge extra for some main exhibits, which we thought were included. Very disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaD741
50,Favorite museum in LA,"Great collection, interesting and unique exhibitions. A must see if you visit Los Angeles and are interested in art",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tohamas
40,Impressive,We were visiting LA for a week and my adult kids wanted to visit LACMA and they quite enjoyed their visit. Impressive collection and easily spent an afternoon wandering throughout. There is a gift shop and a cafe to catch a quick bite. Would visit again on our next trip to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leesat2013
50,very interesting art museum,this is where the famed LACMA lights are located. Very interesting collection of art pieces on display in the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlennSutrisno
50,Broad range of exhibits,"Loved the variety of exhibits, the museum itself is art. Loved the large art sculpture at the entrance. Spent a lovely afternoon by myself walking through the art museum - came back feeling full of inspiration and wonder. Especially enjoyed the modern art sections.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/709preetir

50,Extensive Interesting Art Collection,"We visited this museum complements of Bank of America who sponsor museum visits on the first full weekend of every month. My wife and I toured the European art exhibit which was very entertaining. There were several other interesting exhibits which we simply didn't have time to see (men's fashion, Robert Maplethorpe, oriental art, etc.) The museum consists of several large buildings and is next to the Le Brea Tar Pits. We visited on a Sunday when street parking is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_Retirees
40,A must see,"On holidays you sometimes don't want to be bothered with museums, especially in LA where there are so many other attractions, however, we were so glad to have visited the museum. We took a leisurely day wandering around checking out all the exhibits. So glad we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda1363
40,This was nice but tickets do not include Page Museum,Saw some really great works of art. Had lunch at the entrance restaurant and the apple salad was delightful. The tickets do not include the Page Museum so be prepared to pay add'l $12 for Page. Otherwise the Tar Pit grounds were interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistiMorningstar
20,Very disappointing experience,"Visit with a friend arriving mid afternoon. At first it seemed like it would be a very interesting experience as it's a large place, many galleries with a number of unique exhibits.However from the start the lack of communication and poor staff really begin to spoil things. There are too many types of tickets to buy to see all the exhibits, and many of them were already sold out. We went with the basic exhibit, and proceeded to start viewing the exhibits.After walking around the first exhibit for 20 minutes a staff member comes and tells us ""no backpack front"". it took awhile before I finally understood that she I wasn't supposed to wear a back pack on my back, only in the front. well, I had camera equipment and water and it was very heavy, so extremely difficult to put on the front. So I ended up basically having drag it around in my arm. Aside from her bluntness, there had been no signs, messages, indications before I went in about this rule, or I would have emptied my pack to make it easier.Then in another hall, after 10 minutes of going around, taking pictures, another blunt staffer comes and says ""no pictures here"". I asked politely if this was just in that hall or everywhere. the reply was ""see sign in front, no pictures here"". well, I checked and there was no signed anywhere in the hall entrance, or by any exhibits. and many other people were taking pictures, but he seemed to just pick people at random.I found the layout and selection of the exhibits lacked any real theme. it just seemed that whoever the donated the most art, got to have an exhibit no matter what it was.The only real hall/exhibit I enjoyed was the Japanese art, which was in a very unique building, well laid out, and followed a theme.After about 2 hours we left since the rest of the exhibits were off limits. So not worth the money in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpgyvr
50,"Get here early, so much to see in one day!","First time at this museum, didn't know better so I got here late morning on a Saturday.Joined one of the tours for the Art of Americas bldg, realized right off the bat that it was a huge mistake to sleep in! After the tour, had lunch/brunch at the cafe which took forever (waiting in long lines because people were not understanding the system, plus not enough seating for all; of course) After lunch, spent most of the time in just one building, Ahmanson Bldg, (very interesting with variety even for me with not much art background) and after that only had time left for a quick walk thru the Japanese pavillion and the contemporary art museum before closing!!!My advices:1) Come early2) park across the street for $12 all day3) If you have the LA metro ""tap card"" show it for a $2 discount4) Don't join the tours if you don't have much time or patience5) Might as well take a brief stroll thru the pits in the adjacent ""La Brea tar pits"" area, and be sure to peek into Pit 91 viewing area to check out the live excavating process before they close at 5pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chia2005
50,Don't miss - allow lots of time!,Firstly be aware that there are different levels of entrance ticket. Our first ticket only allowed entrance to some floors and excluded the Rain Room. General admission for an adult is $15 but some ticketed exhibitions require a Special ticketed admission which costs $25. It is usually worth the extra $10 and is hassle to have to go down to the ticket office to upgrade afterwards. We spent a few hours in LACMA and could have stayed a lot longer. Really worth at least a half day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mariao6
50,"great collections, accessible","Besides the excellent collections and the great museum shop, there are regular outdoor concerts in a large area behind the museum during the summer months. The museum is right on Wilshire Blvd. easily accessible by public transportation which is not a given in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobsopinion
50,Great special exhibits,"I've seen many good exhibits here over the years: Mapplethorpe, Tim Burton, Costume Design, Female Surrealists, etc. If you intend to see a few of the special exhibitions I recommend you become a member or it's pretty expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pennief2014
50,The Rain Room,My girlfriend and I finally got tickets to this exhibit. It was lots of fun. Don't wear dark colors or you will get wet. The price of admission includes the rest of the museum so we enjoyed some of the art as well as a cocktail at the restaurant/bar in the courtyard. Lots of fun for the whole family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessec748
50,Great Museum,"I really liked this museum, some interesting installations and lots of art from artists both well known and not. I only wish I had more time. It was a nice refuge from the madness of LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ains0808
50,"Varied, high-quality art collection","Everyone calls it ""Lacma."" Housed inside this architectural hodgepodge of buildings is an outstanding collection of modern and classical art. Highlights include Asian art, especially in the quirky (almost kitschy) Japanese Pavilion. The newer Broad and Resnick buildings contain major temporary exhibitions that are always worth seeing.Hint: There is usually on-street parking available on 6th Street behind the museum. South side of the street has meters; north side is free. But pay attention to the signage regarding parking restrictions and time limits; this area is constantly patrolled by parking enforcement cops.Note: There are two completely different art museum buildings in L.A. that carry the name of billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad. At LACMA is the Broad building, which he funded but does not contain his art collection. In downtown L.A. is the Broad Museum, which houses his extraordinary and comprehensive collection of contemporary art, mostly 1970's and newer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JVPURINS
50,Always something new to see,"Although we live 120 miles from LA, we have been LACMA members for many years. We visit every few months for 2-3 hours at a time. I cannot stand for longer than that. The specially ticketed exhibits bring us there and then we visit a section of the museum we have not walked through before. This is such a large museum, you cannot see everything on one visit. We highly recommend joining as members so you can go back again and again. Make sure to see the giant rock behind the museum. Great opportunity for selfies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanR365
50,Great exhibits,I was in LA and visited this museum. The Mapplethorpe exhibition was excellent (adult only) as well as the Royal Hawaiian featherwork exhibit. Being a collector of ethnographic art it was especially appreciated as well as the permanent collection of Oceanic art that was small but noteworthy. Just check on the Museum's website to see what are the current exhibits as there's something for everybody. PS: the café offerings are good- go when the jazz music is playing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buhoDallas
30,Too many separate tickets,"They had some cool things but nothing not really wowed me. The lights outside are iconic, so those were probably my favorite. The biggest issue I had was the different exhibits you would have to buy to do all the areas. The rain exhibit was booked out for weeks and I could understand an extra ticket for that, however there was 3 other exhibits that were extra. They were $25 a piece I think. I just couldn't do that. The regular museum was decent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelhR4757OG
50,Insightfull,My friends tricked me into the tour and boy am I glad they did. I'm not an artist but I do love history. The paintings show cased at the museum dates back to the early 1400's and includes the art work from Picasso. A great way to spend a day for little money. They have cafés that sells food and drinks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wynmardel
30,Lack of communication.,"LACMA had some good exhibitions on display... one in particular by James Turrell (Light Reignfall) was very meditative. There was also a good display of Islamic art, German Expressionism and French Modernisim.HOWEVER ... it is expensive for a general ticket based on the exhibits you're allowed into. We repeatedly got turned away from certain parts of the gallery saying we needed to pay more money to get in. Also a lot of exhibitions were sold out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BebeDrew
40,Two important exhibitions,"Two exhibitions of note at the LACMA at the moment: Robert Mappelthorpe and Reigning MenThe very bold and now very dead photographer Robert Mappelthorpe is the subject of an exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He is best known for revealing the gay bondage and discipline culture in New York in the late 1970’s, and there are certainly some confronting images from that era. But that is only part of the story: his pioneering work and innovative approach made photography into a full art form, and that contribution goes well beyond his very indulgent life style – a way of living that ultimately killed him. The exhibition is well curated and worth a visit.The most interesting thing about the Reigning Men exhibition now on Los Angeles County Museum of Art is how war has shaped fashion. The Eisenhower jacket, buttoned up from the collar to the waist and belted, and made popular by Ike in WWII, came back in better fabric and better design as fashion hero in the 1940s. In the hands of Yves Saint Laurent, the Norfolk suit used by English gentlemen for hunting and shooting came back as the safari suit in 1968. Japanese crane and pine motifs were used in the “aloha shirt” popular in Hawaii in the 1950s before Hawaii became the 50th state. The exhibition is representative of the 1850 to the present day, but it is a taster not a full history of make fashion in that time. Interesting; a little limited but with enough to entertain and amuse for an hour or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnSB3
40,I love the Tuesday matinee movies!,"I usually make one trip to LACMA per trip to LA, usually on Tuesdays as they have movie matinees, usually old classics like from the Marx Brothers (where I watched the movie with Jason Reitman, who btw does an awesome series of script readings every month or so at LACMA). Last time I was there I saw a display of Stanley Kubrick and this work that was amazing. And you can even stroll around and see alot of cool stuff! I highly recommend LACMA when in LA/Hollywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrismQ4711XU
30,Famous pieces in a rather sterile environment,I wouldn't have missed the LACMA but I got a bit disappointed I have to say. It contains beautiful pieces but the exhibitions lack explanations and the staff was quite unfriendly. I regret that some installations were only working on weekends. My favourite parts were the Japanese art and the pieces by Edward Kienholz.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tamilde
10,disappointing,"The collection here is hardly ordinary. To make it worse, the staff stared at me like looking at a thief and the layout made me lost again and again. I would suggest anyone to spend time at The Getty Center instead of here even after you've already stayed in the Getty for a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yuantaol
30,You don't have to go inside,"I think that the art that was outside the museum was more interesting than the exhibitions. So you don't have to go inside, you could just take a walk around the park to see interesting things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickylito
40,Huge museum,"Have an art lover or two in the family? This is a fantastic way to spend a few extra hours in Los Angeles. (Additionally, it is right next to several other unique museums.) We enjoyed checking out and photographing the outdoor sculptures and our teenage daughter loved the large varied inside exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paul-delaware
40,Decent Modern Art Museum,"This is one of LA's signature museums. The native exhibits are OK, but the visiting exhibits they get will be the ones you want to see. Unfortunately, the visiting ones (like most museums these days) are not included in the base price and if you want to see them, it can be an expensive family day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyh120
50,LACMA is awesome!,"I went to a LACMA special event for teenagers a few months ago, and it was an awesome experience. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is a perfect mix of old and new; of creative and traditional. I recommend it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280zacharyw
50,Wow!,"I had one day sightseeing on my own in L.A., so I decided to spend the morning at the La Brea Tar Pits then headed over to the LACMA for the rest of my day. The museum is huge, and spread out over several buildings. They have an incredible collection of art from ancient to contemporary, and the exhibits are well-spaced so you never feel crowded with other patrons. I'd ask before snapping pictures of the artwork; I noticed in some rooms the exasperated staff stopping people from taking photos, while in other rooms they were happily offering to take pictures for patrons. I do regret not buying a ticket to the famous rain room, but there was no lack of art to see!There were plenty of food options that were affordable and delicious. Definitely bring your walking shoes, and give yourself a minimum of 2-3 hours here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/humbledaisy
50,Unique experiences,"My husband and I picked our top 5 things each-excluding the rain room because that was both of our favorites. I really enjoyed the turrell room, Michael heizer's levitated mass, the Hawaiian feather work exhibit and the self portrait at the beach photograph.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyJana
50,Ceci n'est pas une pipe,"Great museum with very interesting art! We chose to go to LACMA after hearing about the ""rain room"" (an installation where you can walk through artificial rain without (almost) getting wet. it's a really cool concept and experience!) and then ended up roaming the museum afterwards. They have a lot of classical and contemporary art and I was able to see some unexpected pieces, like Magritte's ""Ceci n'est pas une pipe"" which was quite a wonderful surprise!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vbutrimova
40,Rain Room - Worth the wait!,"It was hard to get tickets, but well worth the experience. We also enjoyed the walk around the tar pits outside and the Metropolis and Hawaiian feather exhibits.

Nice to be able to walk and see things in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pupit

30,"Extensive collection, the spaces are outdated","The museum has a large collection with a broad variety of art. The collections are divided over different buildings, accessible by an outdoor route. Some of the exhibitions you can experience are open with an extra fee. The museum spaces are outdated and require replacement and renovation. Noise from airconditioning and flaking paint. I was there on a Friday, live Jazz music outsider and the park full off people hanging out there, drinking, dancing and singing. I was hoping to see an impression of the new LACMA museum design by Peter Zumthor but the exhibition was moved. Less impressed then I expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leanderjansen
50,Great for a lazy afternoon or evening date,"Sometimes one just requires a little culture. This place has improved so much over the decades. Jazz in the evenings, areas to get a bite to eat or a cocktail between exhibitions. Definitely a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dar37
50,Unexpectedly Spectacular Museum,"I don't know what we were expecting, but this was not it. You could easily spend the day here, or even two. Holds up well in comparison to the Getty, which has spectacular architecture in its favor but has nothing on this place in terms of exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NOLAfamily
50,Exceeded All Expectations,"The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is a major art museum in Los Angeles. It is a fairly standard art museum—there is classical art, impressionism and other movements from that period, and modern art. They have a good collection of European art and American art. The permanent exhibit is about the same size as the Getty Center (the other famous LA museum), but in my opinion LACMA is simply better. Here is why:While its collection and scope is similar, LACMA just seems to have more interesting stuff. It's one of those museums where you will certainly discover something new, even if like me you have visited nearly all the major art museums in the world. Often people come to art museums to see what they have already seen, and the Getty probably offers more in that regard (although personally I had always wanted to see Magritte's pipe), but LACMA is just overall presented well it's more of a museum where you come to discover.Also: The modern art installations in LACMA are just as weird as anywhere else, but they are not annoying. LACMA is not a pure modern art museum so you don't have to even look at the modern art, but if you do choose to look, it's also presented well and there are a bunch of interesting and thought-provoking exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ynhockey
50,Don't miss this,"Don't miss this opportunity, even though there are so many options for sightseeing in LA. It could fill up a whole day or more. The tar pits are next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laladavtoo
50,Intriguing exhibits,"I've visited multiple times. This is one of the few museums in Los Angeles that consistently brings unique, extraordinary exhibits to LA. We've got lots of museums. How many dared to bring the levitating rock? The miniature city? LACMA specializes in bringing in the large scale, three dimensional, and experiential arts in an environment that invites us to spend the entire day.I usually go with my best friend and finish the day with drinks at their outdoor bar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShyneBright
50,The Best Art Museum in Los Angeles,"This museum is wonderful. It has great art that is always there and they always have something visiting and it is always great. Parking is for a fee as is the museum, but it is reasonable. They have it all, from the Impressionists to modern works. It is truly a lovely museum. I love the benches to sit and take a rest from all the walking or just to stare at a particular piece. It is, I think, the biggest art museum in the West of the U.S.As I write here are the fees:$15 | Adults$10 | Seniors (65+) & Students with valid IDFree | Children (17 and under)Have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
50,Great place to spend few hours at least,Great place to spend few hours at least. Quiet for the bustle of the city but right in the middle of it. Nice exhibits.

40,Don't underestimate the time you would like to spend there,"So, the biggest problem would be the size of this place. Well, it's not their problem, it was mine.Don't think that three hours are enough. You would need much more than that.

50,Children's Room,"What a glorious place, where children of all ages can sit at large tables, painting to their (artists') hearts' content! Pots of paint and paper are supplied, and the children are welcome to make as many paintings as they want to. Their creations cover the walls, and more of their paintings line the counter tops. You can hear a pin drop in here, as the children are completely engrossed in their work! Never have I seen dozens of children so quiet, and so mannerly, as I did that day in the children's painting room. A wonderful, relaxing, and perfect space for little ones and their grown-ups!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q7828VLsueh
50,Weekend fun!,My boyfriend and I live down the street and decided to take a stroll to LACMA. We are both So Cal natives but hadn't visited since we were children. It was nice and relaxing for us.

Because of this we ran out of time, so make sure you allow yourself sa good 1/2 day if you are going to do both (and have lunch or a snack there as well).We may have been lucky but the featured exhibition (which cost a little extra) was of an artist i had always wanted to see more of. The free (static) exhibitions were also great, and could of spent more time if the kids werent hassling to go home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlieu44

I was still able to take pictures and walk around it.It was pretty cool and very art-sy.I would recommend everyone to see this place in LA. It is one of the MUST-SEE and will definitely go back when I have more time and when it is day time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/800abigaili
50,Wonderful collections,I enjoyed the special shows and the permanent collection at LACMA. They try to push the envelope in terms of the artists shown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/772kyungy
50,A very pleasant surprise. This museum has it all and it is laied out very well making it easy to navigate,"We really enjoyed the collection of Rembrandt and the other Dutch painters of his era.Also the Picasso's and the many Impressionist painters including Monet, Gaughan,Sisley, Pisarro to name but a few.Overall a very pleasant exxperience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/82jime
50,"Well-located, something for everyone inside as well as out--the prefect LA experience","They had us at the outdoor exhibits (the very large rock, the street lamps), the jazz band setting up for the late afternoon performance, the cafe choices with outdoor seating and then there was the art. There is something for everyone at this museum so plan your time well. You will move from floor to floor and building to building according to your personal artistic taste. The changing exhibitions can be controversial but this museum is not afraid to push the envelope. I have never seen a young child as engaged in ""art"" as the 5 year old who jumped up and down and ran all around the Metropolis II miniature train ""art."" I did find the security guards on their game with eagle eyes out for sitting outside where one should not (no signs) but that was OK with me. This is a perfect LA gem that should not be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaViajera007
50,Awesome Museum,"This museum consists of several buildings from contemporary, modern, Japanese etc. I spent about 3 hours here and enjoyed a nice appetizer at the outside diner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OverjoyedK
20,Poor collection. Anarchist policy. Hostile security,"They have three fundamental problems:1- Limited collection to the point that some of their galleries like 1-2-3 in front of the box office are waste of real estate space.2- They have a inconsistent picture taking policy and they do not make it clear in front of each gallery with a sign like any well disciplined museum do. They will warn you if you ask, that you can take picture here, you cant do it there, then here you can take still photo but not panoramic or video, it is very confusing and if you don't ask then you get to problem number 3 hostile security.3- They have the most uncivilized, poor manner, hostile and rude security in LACMA that any European museum that we have visited or even local art gallery, specially in the Latino section which was the i believe the 4rth floor of the main building; where we have encounter a an elderly African American guard who was the embodiment of poor mannerism, unprofessionalism, aggressive and hostility. The guard ask us whether if are we taking picture or filming, I told him obviously picture since i am still and not moving and it take only 3 seconds. He then said you cannot take panoramic picture or film. We said okay, then while we literary walk to next gallery, he come and shout “You just took panoramic picture! I saw you took three pictures.” I explained to him that for panoramic the phone must be vertical and not horizontal. My phone was horizontal therefore its not a panorama and I am in within your regulation.He replied very aggressively, ""All right that' it, you are leaving, you will never come back here again."" and start to bark at us my girlfriend told him, ""hey easy, you cant yell at visitors, if you don't know how to your job! Be specific and keep your rule consistent, and if you don’t know how an iPhone works then don’t assume.""He didn't even know what the word 'consistent' means and told us ""you will leave and never come back here!"" it was unprecedented, to have such a hostility and lack of understanding, I wanted to wait and call for his supervisor but my girlfriend said, ""lets go, he is an old bitter man who clearly hate his job."" Its ruined our day and visit.He shouldn’t be hostile toward visitors and act civilize, versus being bullying and give himself the right to even ban visitors from return to the museum. Does he even has the right to talk like that and assume that he can ban people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frenchh2015
50,Wonderful gem in LA,"LACMA isn't just one of my favorite museums in Los Angeles, it's one of my favorite art museums period. They have a wonderful collection ranging from classics to modern. My favorite sections include their incredible collection of Islamic Art, as well as their modern art collection. They also have a wonderful Japanese pavilion with intricate panel art installations. Every time I visit I discover something new at LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bookgal

50,Fun museum with modern and older art,"This is a great place to spend an entire day. There's enough art to keep you occupied from morning to dinnertime. The lampposts outside and the spaghetti yellow strands inside are iconic LA photo spots, so bring your camera. The special exhibits are usually worth the extra price, so make sure to sign up for those right when you get there to be sure you get in. Many have a limited number of visitors a day. There's also a nice view of the city from the top of the stairs on the modern art building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsRubySongbird

30,Arty!,"Large rooms with various displays, some for the more 'Arty' person than the general public. Loved the collection of Picasso's and the special exhibitions made the visit worthwhile, we were only going to see the Brea Tar Pits next door but decided to visit both :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clarao135
40,special exhibit disappointing,"On the whole, LACMA is a great museum but the Maplethorpe special exhibit was limited and disappointing, especially at $25/person. We realize curators may have to be selective with this photo exhibit but even so, a lot of his work was deleted. Men's costume display didn't make up for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmaWines
40,Allow plenty of time!,"Opening at 11 am, there's plenty to see even before you enter one of the several buildings of this museum. They provide a list of each day's special exhibits. So you can follow your interests. Membership is a good value as it usually includes access to special exhibitions for which there are separate fees. The variety of exhibits is amazing. You can absorb much in three or four hours. More visits will yield more treasures. Closed on Wednesday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrganistaGratciella
50,Let's celebrate downtown LA!,Outdoor art installation that is made up of old street lights from years gone by from downtown LA. Visually spectacular and open on street for all to see day or night. We just drove up to it at night and there was an area at the curb for cars with gawkers. Next to the LA County Museum of art. Close to La Brea Tar Pits. Full day for the family just here in a couple of blocks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VARobinson
40,Enjoyable day with the kids,"Took my two girls (9 & 13) to the LACMA. We started off the day heading over to the kids area where we got signed up for the NexGen (the girls will get in free until they are 18, and get to bring one adult for free each time too!) and to do watercolor paintings. The girls thought this was great! I even had a great time painting my picture. After we wandered around to the many buildings and took in may great and strange sights. I had to keep my eyes opened because there were a few exhibits that I didn't think were appropriate for the girls, but all in all it was a great day looking at some great art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angieh460
30,"Big, Lots of Stuff, but Not Impressive","I ove art museums and go out of my way to visit them. I have visited them in many countries, but Los Angeles is near my home and I really wish a huge and wonderful place like LA offered a museum worthy of it. Sadly, when I think about art museums in California, this is the one I am the most unimpressed with. Compared to the art museum at Blaboa Park in San Diego the Getty in the Hollywood Hills, or the Norton Simon in Pasadena, this really offers little to make it worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L6953YVpaull

40,"Kids play outside, learning to love art","We arrived relatively early on a Sunday morning, having taken the 720 bus from downtown. We immediately went into exhibit halls. The first one, showing arts of the Pacific was disappointing as its small collection, though thoughtfully distributed throughout many rooms, does not have adequate descriptions. Perhaps there were earphone-guided tours, but for those who prefer to visually browse, the marvelous pieces remained a mystery as we left. Descriptions were better in other galleries and it's clear the museum has a wonderful collection. Best of all, though, were the activities for children. It was joyous just to watch their joy as they calligraphed to music, or drew and painted at a messy table just meant for fun. Seemed like hundreds of kids from all ages and hues; they were engaged, focused, and enjoying their foray into arts and culture. Good job LACMA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JWP8
50,Always Interesting...,"We visit LACMA several times a year, really, every time we are in LA. We are never disappointed here! It is such a lively place, and fun to be there inside or outside. This is truly a world-class museum, and the shows have great range, so if you don't love one, you'll likely love the next. Our advice is to leave extra time here as the shows are complex, many rooms, and wandering is the ideal way to see everything. This museum is the owner of one of our art works, and we will happily donate others in the future. We encourage all to visit, revel, give as you are able...and to appreciate the gem that is LACMA!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyCalifornia
50,"Worthy of a visit, short or long","I had two hours on a Friday. On Fridays they stay open until 8, so this worked out well. Also, free outdoor jazz concerts on Friday at this time. Great ambience, lots of people out enjoying the music. I visited two great exhibits in those two hours, and walked around the whole place. Wonderful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chermanka

50,Jazz at LACMA,"I was here with one of my friens and we really enjoyed. :) If you like jazz music, after a hard week it is a perfect relaxation. This event usually starts early in the evening and many people are moving in from all around it. Performers are great and give you a full of experiences hours. The museum area is really nice in the light from art urban lights at the Wilshire Blvd. And of course you can find many other events at LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/czedlkata
50,A great museum,"While I do not get to LA as often as I like, I usually make a trip to both the Annenberg space for Photography and LACMA. This trip coincided with the Rain Room, but tickets were not available. I had tried to buy them on eBay or Craigslist, but there were none for the day I wanted to go. So we went to the museum hoping to see if anything came available. We were told that it was sold out but that if we were a new member, there were tickets available for purchase. Bingo. We got to see what we wanted along with all of the other great works on display. There was a Frank Geary exhibit and this was fascinating as we had recently been to Paris and saw the Louis Vuitton Foundation building. Here we got to see the models for it. While it is usually not possible to see the whole museum within a few hours we always pick and choose what we want to visit. I recommend LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MisterKenn
50,Special Exhibitions at LACMA,"There are always special -- and I do mean SPECIAL -- exhibitions at LACMA that usually cost extra from the regular museum. I encourage people to go online and see what are the newest special exhibitions. While my sister was visiting last week, we went to see the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibit and the Reigning Men: Men's Fashions from 1700 to the present. The Mapplethorpe part was very interesting in showing the arch of his creative growth and experiences, but the Men's Fashion exhibit was truly spectacular. It was so fantastically curated, so well put together, extremely entertaining and hugely interesting. We loved it. I have friends coming to town next weekend and of all the things to see and do in Los Angeles, I am taking them to LACMA. A few years ago, LACMA did a History of Fashion exhibit that was truly stellar. So if you are visiting LACMA, see the special exhibits first. Then decide whether you want to see the permanent collection. Plus, the outdoor bar is always a pleasant and interesting place to sit and visit with your friends. I have never eaten at the restaurant right there in the open air plaza area, Rays, but it looks like fun. I think you might want to make reservations, because seating looks limited. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelwU6145VQ
50,LACMA's Rain Room,"Yes, the art is world class, with over 150,000 items. But what I really like is The Rain Room. It's fun to walk into a room with rain and be able to walk through it without getting wet. It is closing on April 24, but will re-open May 19th. Advance tickets are required and they must be purchased on-line. There is a $15 charge in addition to the admission, but treat yourself to this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambersea
50,Ingenious Works!,"We weren't able to go inside the museum since we were out of time. But we had fun with the art outside. We enjoyed taking a lot of pictures at the ""Urban Lights"" and the ""Penetrable in Neon Lime"" (Noodle Rain) which were both free of admission. It was one of our highlights of our day. I'll be looking forward to come back here someday and explore the whole museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niicoco

50,A Truly Great Museum,"We spent a leisurely Saturday afternoon at the LACMA. The Mapplethorpe exhibit was amazing. This is a huge museum and a week would not do the place justice. I would advise the visitor to plan ahead and decide which exhibits are of interest for the time available. Stopping by to see the Urban Lights (light posts) at night is very worthwhile, and free! As a side note, the La Brea Tar Pits are right next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968kippm
40,Urban Lights,We didn't go into the museum because we arrived at 9pm but we wanted to see the Urban Light Exhibited. It was really neat although hard to get pictures of because of the amount of people and it's right along a busy street so your only option is to really take a picture from across the street. It's cool though. Old restored street lights from around LA in the 1920s and 30s.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bits58
50,In Love with LACMA,We enjoyed LACMA! They have some amazing exhibits. It was $15 a person for general admission! We visited a couple of hours before we had to fly out. It was relaxing and fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbrookeb
40,Very happy that we visited,I must admit I didn't know much about this museum besides the Urban Lights streetlights exhibit outside- that was what drew me here. I never expected the museum to be so big and incorporate so many different buildings.We paid $25 each for admission which included two special exhibits (Mapplethorpe and Men's Fashion) We were disappointed as we weren't aware of the extra ticket required for the Rain Room. We would have purchased that as well if we were made aware of it.The museum was a little hard to navigate. The map isn't very detailed. I actually downloaded the LACMA app to help us more and that proved to be useful. The layout was a bit confusing- it was hard to keep track of the rooms that you already visited and it would be very easy to miss a room. There is no natural flow through the exhibit floors.All that aside the art collection is very impressive. We only had a few hours so we didn't get to see everything. You could easily spend the whole day here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Confettigirl77
30,Just those pillars outside.,"nothing special about the museum, very wide and tiring and time consuming.just go to take some pictures in front of those pillars outside.I went at the morning so I don't actually know if those things light at nights or not.that's it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnhanna62
40,Great Place to Spend a Rainy Day!,"Nice collection spanning most of the artistic spectrum, and organized in a methodical and easy to tour fashion. The only shortcoming from a curatorial perspective was missing placards on way way too many pieces in the collection. Also, the elevators and bathrooms were dirty and outdated, a sort of constant reminder that the museum is run by LA County and not a private 501-c (3).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princeofwaldo
50,I LOVE IT,"It was amazing!! it not to cheap, but if you intrestid the arts, and some modern arts, it is must have in LA, but it is a all day program, so i think you bring yourself some food, because the food in the LACMA not so cheap. hot dogs- 7 dollar",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabriellas321
40,not as good as the smithsonian in DC but still worth it,Lots of Asian art and a good bookshop plus just behind it there is the tar lakes of park la brea......the exhibitions are well laid out and it does get quite crowded.......its natural to compare it to the Sackler and Freed side of the Smithsonian museums but maybe that is unfair.......its definitely worth a trip though if you are in los angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donaldr645
50,Definitely worth a visit,"There are a lot of outdoor displays that you can walk around for free, then a ton to do inside for an admission fee. Even if you don't want to do the inside exhibits, it's worth walking around and enjoying the things outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deltaduck2
40,Great venue even for two hours,We had 2 hrs to spend. We bought a basic ticket. No rain room or extras and be aware some parts are closed for renovation. Worth the admission price. Great exhibits. Special exhibits too but extra cost.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/REDJUG

50,LACMA puts LA on the Creative Arts Map,"I LOVE art... and LACMA helps nurture that love... so much so that I decided to become a member. It costs $15 to get in ... do check website for free days because they do offer these on occasion. (note New Years day is always free and a lovely option to bring in the impending 364 days). Additionally Los Angeleno's get in free during the week after 3 pm (proof of residency needed). This info is imp because I ultimately believe that viewing art should ALWays be free....enough of my beliefs... Let me get down to the Nitty Gritty. At the front desk go and sign into the Light Room exhibit... It is a room installation by California born artist James Turrell. There is usually an hour wait and only a minimum amount of occupants allowed in at a time. And the wait and experience is so worth it. Be prepared to feel transported to another time and place... It may even make you tune in and chill out... Sadly no photographs allowed but let your mind and retina do the capturing.The next stop at this museum has to be the iconic Chris Burden installation of vintage Lamp Posts. It offers a graphic image to viewers especially at night when the lights are turned on. He really did leave his mark as a grounding breaking artist in my view. (He is famous also for a performance art piece in the 70's when he had himself shot) but he has come along way since then. Go and visit his gigantic Metropolis piece in the Broad Contemporary section... adults and Kids will be enthralled by the racetrack course filled with thousands of toy cars.Now just go and wander and explore the many buildings filled with art from South America, Japan, Korea and modern art and so so much more. There are also the specialized exhibits on view, which sometimes need an additional fee. Ultimately I guarantee that you will not be able to view everything all in one day.My other favorites are the Robert Graham ""retrospective column"" in the America's building, the wall paper installation by a German artist in the Hammer building. I dare you to go and stare at it and see what It does!!!! Its amazing and shocking and you'll go back ... to look.The cafe's offer great food. Beautifully presented and tasty but on the pricey side.I highly recommend taking the time to visit this great museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edenrox10

40,"Current Exhibits: Rain Room, Mapplethorpe, Modern Muslim Art Part II","The Rain Room exhibit has been extended three times, now through April 24. They hold tickets for members daily but they still cost $10 because it is by an outside exhibitor (whatevers). As for the exhibit itself, they let in groups of about 15-20 so that the rain almost completely stops. There's still the occasional dripping but the trick is to walk with your arm extended when you walk into the water to ensure it stopping.You get about 15 minutes in the Rain Room and frankly, I think it would have been better as an attraction at Disneyland or the Science Center.The Mapplethorpe exhibit *NOT RECOMMENDED FOR FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN OR THOSE WHO ARE SHOCKED BY FRANK SEXUALITY OF ANY KIND* is excellent with some of his iconic photos including those that are shocking, frankly sexual (with an emphasis on the homoerotic) and the non-provocative, though not boring (if you can't love a wall dedicated to his ex-partner Patti Smith than this exhibit is not for you). TWO STARSLastly I checked out the [small] Art In the Modern Muslim World which includes paintings, prints and a short animated film about an ancient warrior who travels to the future to get medicine to save his son's life [SPOILER ALERT: the son dies because he brings back a cheap Chinese knock-off.] Fascinating photographs of women and yet, more homoeroticism in the panels on an Iranian Bodybuilding competition. One of those frames captures two men positioned as though they are about to kiss! FIVE STARSAt the entrance are huge portraits of two royals, a prince and a princes, wearing gorgeous capes, yet curiously their bodies are blacked out. FOUR STARS",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HowardBanister2015
40,A nice place,"The museum is eclectic and its grounds are very nice. A fee is asked for parking and a separate one for the museum. This does not include the temporary exhibitions. We focused on the European art, mainly Impressionism and expressionism. Both are well represented. On the minus side is the museum store which is disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aburel
30,Okay..,"Not floored by any of the exhibits, Getty is better but the Tar pit is a fun feature to visit for kids and adults alike (I brought my ""grown"" boyfriend).

50,Must-visit museum; special exhibits sell out,"This museum is right next to the LaBrea tar pits! There are a number of different areas to explore/relax outdoors. Excellent outdoor installations and special exhibits. The James Turrell exhibit is a must-see, but please be mindful of others. This sensory experience (you make reservations and wait hours to be in a room with a small group while the environment shifts colors) was marred by a family (mostly the adults) that would not stop talking loudly throughout. Lovely museum with a wide range of exhibitions.

40,Encycopedic,"Over the years LACMA has developed its collection and expanded its campus to become a first-rate art museum. Its special exhibits are usually very interesting. The permanent collection is encyclopedic, offering something for everyone. The restaurant is very good, but little pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnN121
50,Fun and interesting museum,The LACMA has some excellent art exhibits with many well know artists represented. There is a large variety from ancient art to modern. There are also some whimsical experiences. There is parking on the street 6th st. Or you can park in the garage or lot for $12.00. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbara115de
40,Plan Ahead - The Exhibits Can Be Challenging/Rewarding,"We've visited LACMA many times and always find something to enjoy and something not so enjoyable. This time, the Japanese pavilion was marvelous, with artifacts, paintings and an amazing kimono on view. It can be quite challenging to find bathrooms, since not all of the spots on the brochure/map are accurate. The restaurants are quite pricey, so go for the cafeteria - the pizzas are yummy and made to order.Best advice: plan ahead online and stick with your plan which museums to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msirani

50,Super museum with wide selection,Have to mention we came for the installation RAIN..... WOW!Strolled through two floors of the museum with a focus on Matisse and Picasso. Lots of other outstanding Modern art as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seattlesez
40,Worth the visit especially for special exhibits,"LACMA is a forgotten treasure for many Angelinos. While it might not have the recognition associate with the Getty or other places, it is a fine museum and worth the trip to mid Wilshire. The special exhibits have been quite interesting over the years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRwestla
50,"Great contemporary art and,of course the LACMA Urban Lights!","It was well worth it to visit the LACMA particularly at night. I wasn’t able to go inside the museum as my bus commute trip from San Diego got awfully delayed but at least I was lucky enough to catch the Urban Lights switched on and with not too many people hanging around and taking photographs around it. This is the main attraction I was chasing upon anyway so I really had a good time with the Urban Lights.Hanging around the Urban Lights is free, no need to pay for anything. The museum, however, has entrance fees. If you just plan to hangout at the Lights then there is no need to go into the museum.However, it is always best to go inside the museum and check what's on exhibit.Simply one of the best spots I visited in the US!It is an easy drive from downtown LA though it’s very near the Tar Pits and relatively close to a Park (not sure if it its Wilshire or LA County Park). Buses ply around the area but definitely no trains pass near this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scrattie

50,Great art,"Fabulous art, well curated. Some big names are mixed in among some more unknown but equally impressive works. Don't miss the hotwheels city freeway exhibit, which I think runs hourly. And since you've already paid for parking, you could also take a stroll through the La Brea Tar Pits, or see one of the other museums in the vicinity. Some holidays offer free visits, check their website, and on weekdays, at least, there are some great food trucks up and down the street at lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shortcircuit601
50,Wonderful value for the money,"For only $10, general admission gives you access to all but two very special exhibits. From contemporary to ancient Colombia, in just one of the buildings, whatever your art interest is, you will find it at LACMA. You can spend little time or all day - your choice. And with sustenance available at two cafes in the complex, or restaurants a short walk away, it is your choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elysekomer
40,"Several visits now, and just better each time.","Mostly modern and contemporary art. Some classic works, but not much depth or many important works (though some). Some great exhibitions there, but for the most part to see european classics go to the Norton-Simon in Pasadena. The Urban Light sculpture outside makes for a classic tourist photo at this point.Also worthwhile to grab food from the food trucks outside or to see the sections of the Berlin Wall outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/learnincurv
50,Wonderful visit!,"We love visiting LACMA when we are in L.A. The most recent exhibition we saw was the Frank Gehry (GREAT!). Our favorite past exhibition was Stanley Kubrick. The museum is beautiful, the exhibitions well-designed. It was fairly crowded when we went, probably because it was the end of the exhibition. Eat lunch on the outside patio for an end to a wonderful visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MmeFrog
50,Our Very Own Art Museum,"Yes, art is appreciated in Los Angeles and nowhere better than the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The biggest attraction is The Rock, a huge chunk of granite that was dragged throughout the streets of Los Angeles early one morning before being suspended over a walkway at the Museum. See the ""Breathing Light"" room, it will creep out your depth perception. (pleasurably)."" There's so much to see, you can't see it all in a day. It's wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marklG8499ME
40,Interesting collections,"Liked my visit there and the atmosphere of the area, but 4 stars because its collection is surprisingly small for a county of such size and import city. But definitely worth the visit. The food choices are excellent especially if you count the food trucks across the street. Recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teslamate
50,Fantastic,"The musuem always has different shows going on and they keep the museum in immaculate shape. Take some time and visit the LaBrea Tar Pits if you have never been there before. It is close to the Grove, so plan on going over there for lunch or dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496davidr496
50,Frank Gehry!,"Such a multi-sensory, multi-level experience. You have to go.We only went to the Frank Gehry special exhibit, due to limited time. The museum is in a lovely setting, with a very modern feel, and kind and friendly staff.The special exhibit was totally worth it. I'm into scale models, and seeing the very rough conceptual sketches transformed into the models, and seeing the models realized as actual architecture in the videos was a 360 degree experience.Try to visit before it closes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenAnnB
30,"Beautiful Museum, but pricey","A large collection, and lots of variety, but the entry ticket is quite pricey. Save this for a day where you have plenty of time to really take in every inch of the museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roadie218
40,Lots to see,"Parking was full when we got there in the afternoon and had better luck parking across the street. There's lots to see and we will need to go back another day since we didn't see it all. The tickets to the rain room were all sold out and we would like to see that. We ate at the LACMA Cafe and it was okay. We enjoyed looking at all the art, the matchbox cars, and the Urban lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/878cheyennep
50,Excellent art museum with a local flare,Most recently I went to LACMA to see the Frank Gehry exhibit. It was curated beautifully and offered a massive number of pieces that were clearly displayed and explained. Other special exhibits have also been excellent. I also enjoy the museum's own art collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorne29
50,Too many good choices for one day!,"This museum has so much to see that you have to choose what you want carefully. We enjoyed seeing a few special exhibits, especially the Columbian art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtogo09

50,RAIN ROOM IS A MUST DO,"The special ""Rain Room"" exhibit and experience is fun but study it for its artistic creativity. Take a silhouette photo. You'll be fascinated by its outcome. So fun to experience and great memory of the silhouette photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mac32655

30,Rain Room review,"This review is only about the current Rain Room exhibition. After waiting months to get tickets we were actually a bit disappointed. While very clever we really did not feel it offered much in the way of actual art. Cleverly hidden sensors stop the ""rain"" and that's really great but that's also the end of it. You'll be pretty much done after 15 minutes or so. The museum itself is still great and we have a family membership.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StudioCityMark
50,Amazing Art and Exhibits,"We spent the day here, viewing the Frank Gehry exhibit and making it through the Contemporary and Americas buildings before we had to go. There's so much to see we will have to go back on a future visit. Loved the sensory displays including the yellow string maze and Metropolis, where we watched cars whirl around in an incredibly huge structure.One of the nice things about the location is the amazing choices available for lunch. Visitors can brown bag it and eat on the plaza, in one of the on site cafes, head across the street to one of the eight food trucks that were parked there, or walk down the street to any number of restaurants.Definitly recommend this for a visit while in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ymceight
40,Good variety of art and artifacts.,"This is a nice museum, with ancient to modern art, a fair amount of archeological exhibits and some cool sculptures and special exhibits. Unfortunately, when we were there, there were a number of areas that were under renovation and not available. The special exhibits required a separate reservation or ticket. We did one -- the light room -- that did nothing for us. To really see the museum, you need several hours. We did not allow enough time. Teens up to 17 are free, so that was a bonus. There are days when the museum is free if you plan agead. Parking in their underground lot was pricy, but I guess to be expected in LA. We definitely were glad we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelMasterJ
40,"There amidst the Tar, is the Art!",So much to absorb. Best to see it in stages. Go on different days. Don't try to absorb it all at a single immersion!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Primo54
40,Light the Night,"We did not visit the actual museum but stopped to see the ""Urban Light"" exhibit outside after going to the car museum down the street. What a great light display! Who knew that people would have so much fun with 202 cast iron lamp fixtures? It was interesting to watch people interact with the lights - from those taking selfies or group photos to professional photographers shooting a young couple. Well worth a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/composthappens
50,Beautiful Museum,This is a must see in LA. The exhibits are fascinating and much different from other museums I have visited.The sympathetic imagination in the Diana theater was our favorite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathyCole
50,Relaxing,"My favorite piece is the street lamps out front. I was able to catch the sunset going through them, and it was beautiful. This is a nice place to visit just to get out of the house and see something new, and learn a little bit! Locals get free admission, just show your DL. You have to pay for parking, so it's pretty much your entrance fee. Even if you have to pay admission, it's worth it!Check out the La Brea Tar Pits next door.Keep in mind that both places close at 5pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/658tanayr
40,Interesting Museum....a Bit Overwhelming,"We were at LACMA for the Rain Room. Parking underneath the museum was a challenge but we followed a guest until she got in her car and snagged the spot. The computer for the Rain Room broke just as we were to enter, but they rebooted it and it worked after about 20 minutes. This special exhibit was different and fun. Afterward we wandered around outside and saw the urban exhibit and the suspended rock. The collection is large and one needs a full day to really enjoy it. We had already been to the Broad in the morning across town, so we were running a little low on energy for a place this large. i will definitely go back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YorbaLindaStar

50,Dont miss it!,"This is a wonderful museum with great indoor and outdoor spaces. The modern art is intriguing and challenging and looking at pieces that caused a great stir years gone by is fascinating. Lots of Picasso here for a good study of his work.But don't forget to go upstairs for more classical art.Try the Japanese pavilion for great drawings in a purpose built environment.Even the lunch place had good fresh sandwichesA must see, i will go back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hoaile1987

40,Pretty good museum,"We visited the Frank Gehry exhibit which was large and well done. The permanent collection is good, but not really special. There is a good collection of German expressionist paintings. The adjacent tar pits and tar pit museum are worth seeing. There is paid parking under the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech1
50,Best of the best,This is THE LA museum to visit. They have many rotating exhibits that are second to none. The Rain Room is amazing but it's sold out for the next few months.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gdavison4

A wing devoted to Japanese art, modern paintings and sculpture, and a forest of old street lamps outside complete the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerrillC_12
50,Picture Perfect,"If you are looking for something to do in LA, this should be on your list. So much to see, the presentation is wonderful. So many different pictures to take. If you have a camera bring it! I would suggest allowing much time for this stop. There is much to see, backed up with much to read. It appears that there is always many visitors, so be prepared for lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmrusin

50,Frequent visits to this fun museum,"THe row of lamps in front of the building have been saved from bridges in LA. The museum has frequent fantastic art exhibits. It is so easy to go there and easy to park. $5.00. When visiting LA look up events there. The LaBrea Tar Pits are right next door, another LA wonder!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malibumaven

50,Urban lights!,"These were a bit of an accidental surprise. Someone recommended we check them out, but we sort of just stumbled upon them. As we were visiting them, the lights turned on, and everyone in the area went, ""oooooh"". They are simple, and yet somehow magical. A favorite stop for everyone traveling with me during our busy day in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waterangel21
30,Some interesting pieces,"Visited with business colleagues as we are all designers and looking for inspiration. To be honest many of us were from colder climates east and north, with the beautiful weather (80+ degrees) most of us were really more interested in spending time outside! The museum is quite large, and the staff seemed overly concerned about where many of my friends wore their backpacks. I understand the possibility of knocking into something by accident, but way too much pestering. Will aim for a visit to The Broad next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luv2explore50
30,Underwhelming,"Our visit to LACMA felt a little lackluster after spending the previous day at the Petersen Auto Museum. Originally our plan was to visit the grounds only to see the giant rock installation. The NARM program for LACMA is very limited, so we had to pay full admission though we were members of two other museums in NorCal...disappointing. Staff was diffident at best, from ticket sales to security to the museum store. The message seemed to say ""We don't care about what kind of experience you have with our art.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MizMaxie
40,Interesting mix,"We spent about 3 hours at LACMA. It has an interesting mix of art, furniture and utensils. The layout can be confusing. It seems that some exhibits were placed many years ago and not updated. I wish there were extended placards describing the background to the art. It appears that there is a shortage of money as maintenance is needed throughout the complex. Overall we enjoyed our time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillySpr
40,A big place with hidden gems,"LACMA is a huge museum on a large piece of land, so it could be difficult to locate your favourite exhibition without checking the map. I didn't look at the map so I wandered aimlessly in contemporary art exhibitions and Japanese art exhibitions before locating my favourite things, Art of the Ancient World, on the second floor of the Ahmanson Building. I was amazed by the classical sculptures, although there weren't many. Overall, there are lots to see in this museum, though not everything would be of interest to everyone.Quite needless to mention, but remember to take pictures (after sunset) with the Urban Lights in front of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emmabearx
50,Good place to visit with the kids,"SO typically this place is $15 / person, however i found out that you can sign your kids up for this program called ""Next Generation"" and they get free admission + they can bring a guest. Since we have three kids, this was perfect because a visit that would have cost us $45 (the other two kids were young enough to be free anyhow) ended up being totally free. Score!They have a hands on art class that the kids decided to try the day we went. They let you enter in groups and it is mostly parent supervised and lead by one of the staff members. Our kids loved the yellow hanging ropes outside of LCMA which they got to run through and play hide and seek with 40+ other kids that day. We also took them to the park that is directly behind the museum (la brea tar pits). They got to run and play and be free for a while before going back to see the other special exhibits. It is an all day trip. I would suggest packing a lunch since the cafe is a bit overpriced. Take a stroller (if your child tends to need one) because there are so many different things to do that they are likely to get tired.They also have a lot of special events that make this place a perfect date night location for couples. You just have to check their website for details.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/745danieller
50,Urban Light at LACMA,"I have always wanted to visit this place and finally have a time to go there. It's very easy to get there, just search for LACMAand you can direction from the web site. The parking underground is $12.00 per visit. Urban Light is free, but you have to pay for museums. I would recommend nighttime visit, because when the light is on, they're very beautiful and romantic.Bring your low light camera if you wanted to have a good picture, because the phone camera not going to do the job.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/opdragon11754

50,Afternoon Delight,Excellent place to connect with others. Make the visit as long or short as your choose. Attractive for all ages and a place to return to often. If you can get there the Rain Room is a fascinating experience. If you choose dthe outdoor dining adds to the fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariew702
50,Recent Visit to LACMA - Rain Room,"Recently visited the museum, especially to see the Rain Room. The Rain Room requires advance reservations but is a great experience, especially for those with kids. Bring a towel to dry them off. Many great exhibits, the hot wheels car ramp in the Broad building. Also saw the Japanese cultural art exhibit. Good if you appreciate art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/439garyt
40,Great Museum - if you don't stop and rrad everything you can ser it all in one day.,"Great museum! Just visited it las week, and they always impress me with the quality of excibits. If you visit with kids, they have a great hands on area. you can draw anf leave your drawing to be displayed at the wall of the chilfren area. They provife everything needed, you add the creativity.I wish their staff was a bit friendly, I still have not seem in more than 10+ visits a smilling face. They have top knotch art.

50,Loved the Hockney!,Lots of different buildings housing different genres of art. Loved the Contemporary American Art and of course the amazing Mulholland Drive paiting by Davis Hockney. Shop very disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatashaD31
30,Second best art museum in LA,"It is very hard to top the Getty museums, but our major art museum makes a valiant effort. I always frequented new York's many art museums so I cannot help but go to this one periodically to see what is new. I like the Asian section and some of the classic works but AI am not a fan of the modern art exhibits and some of the donated personal collections. I have recently found out how great their children's art programs are and I would highly recommend weekends with your kids there. The theatre also has some very good music events for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinkQ7630MZ
40,Good museum,"This museum consists of a few separate buildings, which are not connected from inside, so you have to put a visitors’ sticker visibly. It’s a very good museum – some artists are famous and some or maybe the majority are not and you wonder why, as the quality of paintings is no less worse than the world known. There is more than just paintings. I was very impressed with this museum, though was somewhat skeptical and hesitant if to come here at all, as I visited many other museums all over the world. This museum consists of a few separate",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/k0za

30,"Nice public museum, more Asian than usual",Visited on Christmas holiday so the place was pretty crowded. A nice & varied collection with more of a slant towards Asian & Middle Eastern than most public museums. Didn't think much of the contemporary art which was heavily weighted towards video. Adjoins the tar pits which were pretty underwhelming.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NMBomber
30,Not much!,"It is ok museum, we spent like 3hours there, first let'dps start with the parking $12:00Across the street from the museum. The admission is $15.The museum doesn't have enough or outstanding items, that can catch my eye.Nothing can't be compared to to metropolitan or natural history in my beloved NY.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/173hanyg
50,Something for everyone,"Visited the museum with my 10 year old, my mother and aunt. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that they were offering a free museum membership for kids and teens!! This also includes a free adult admission. We got there after 12 pm which didn't give us enough time to visit all the buildings and exhibitions. The museum is a great place for the whole family since it is also right next to La Brea Tar pits. My favorite place was the Japanese exhibition. We can't wait to go back!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adriana2travel
40,Always has something worth your time,For years did not go here because I figured a County Museum would be a small place! WRONG! Its HUGE! This time the Frank Gehry exhibition left me uninterested but the German art of the Weimar Republic I found fascinating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cubecritter
50,Yes Yes Yes...,"We so enjoyed the LACMA--Likely to become members.We went on MLK day and there was free general admission.Usual admission is $15We paid $27 for the special architectural exhibit…Specifically for the Frank Gehry exhibit.Loved this exhibit and all his many many buikldings. So surprising that an architect of his stature will still do residence every now and then. I never knew all his work throughout the world: Museums, concert halls, hospital, high-rise tower and university buildings. Simply amazing to see how his initial sketch evolves to the model and then photos of completed structures. Almost makes me wanna go on a tour of his buildings throughout the world!Easy parking across the street IF you get here early ($12). If not early, you’ll wait for an open spot.Lots of food choices with a line for food trucks along Wilshire.We’ll return for the rain exhibit and also explore the rest of this amazing museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle

30,LACMA Urban Lights,"We came to see the Urban Lights at the LACMA. Definitely better to see the lights at night. The lights are solar powered and it's a cool experience to be able to walk through them. Other than that, it is basically multiple street lights bunched together. Great place to take pictures though! The lights are free to the public and can be viewed even after the museum has closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdortiz

50,Great day in LA,It was an unusually rainy day in LA and we decided to check out the LACMA. We would have loved to see the RAIN exhibit but it was unavailable. You need to have tickets well in advance of your visit. We enjoyed viewing the art on the main floors and we all plan on visiting again to see what we missed. Great day!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dmay2015
50,Always something to see!,"EVERY time we go to LACMA we see something new.

Check the website often to buy tickets to the temporary installations because the sell out fast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allypjc
50,Two for the price of one,The museum has an interesting collection and usually there is a traveling show of note. I saw a lovely Georgia O'Keefe show and a glittering exhibition of Klimpt paintings. The museum is is in a small park that includes the LA Breja Tar pits where you see the bones of prehistoric animals that got caught in the pits and died there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slynnmirell

Children are always free, but with NexGen a child and 1 Adult are permitted to enter for free. Amazing.Located near the Miracle Mile, restaurants, and shopping you can make a total day of it.Don't want to go in? No problem. You can picnic on the grounds and on Fridays and Saturday nights, during the summer you can take in either Latin or Contemporary Jazz concerts.If you're searching for a bit of culture or some repreve from city trauma, make your way to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joycelynnq
40,Rain Room is amazing,We visited LACMA's Rain Room exhibit in November. It senses people as they walk thru very slowly and the rain overhead stops. They issue tickets for certain times so they can control how many people are in the room at one time. As you look from outside the raining area you can't believe the rain overhead will stop as you walk thru it but it does. Taking pictures with cell phones do capture the rain and dry areas with the lights above.We also saw Breathing Light and it was interesting how your perception of the end of the room changes because of the colors and the light. The architectural models of various buildings were fascinating to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fancythis72
50,A world-class museum in a world-class city,"First, if you're a fan of architecture and Hollywood, this is the place to be amazed and delighted by the stunning buildings that adorn this campus. I swear I've seen these buildings and settings used in television and movies and to me that is a thrill in itself. Oh yeah, they have amazing art, too!Check out the sculpture garden on the southeastern side of the museum. I was impressed by the collection of large and small sculptures that surround the centerpiece sculpture/water feature. Again, this is one of those little niches where a person can find some solitude and beauty in the midst of a bustling city.Once inside, I was amazed at the myriad of displays available. The broad range of art from classical to contemporary pieces from all over the world is overwhelming. We viewed one gallery dedicated to a really cool, interactive audio/visual display and then tried to view as much of the other galleries as possible but we didn't have enough time to truly appreciate many of these masterpieces.When you go, plan to spend several hours for the main galleries and at least an hour each for the others. Also, please be respectful of other viewers and use mature voices when discussing the works on display. Finally, don't touch the art. These are world-class, historical, and culturally significant pieces. Your hand prints damage and destroy some of humanities best efforts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joe_Cool68510
50,Plan to spend more than a day,"Interesting, well laid out exhibits. I expected more from the Diana Thater special exhibit: Sympathetic Imagination but perhaps it was just not my thing. Loved Art of the Americas. It can a bit tiring to the feet if you want to see everything so perhaps best to do two half days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dequanna
50,glorious light display,this is definitely an all day event and the great thing is that the La Brea Tar pits are right next to the museum I also recommend that you stay until night so you can watch all of the lampposts light up the night sky,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1445FWrachelw
50,"Sprawling, Surprising","Some really great pieces in their permanent collection. They were showcasing their German expressionists when we were there. Also strong in 17th century Dutch. The Rain Room, a current exhibit, was fun. There's also a pretty good contemporary collection, although the Broad is the place to go if that's your priority.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davemh333

40,really interesting architecture,not wild about the permanent collection; and really didn't enjoy the special exhibits that took up much space and were just not interesting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lzkazk
50,So much to see,Depending on the feature exhibits the LACMA can be a whole day affair. It's also not cheap. If you love more modern art then this is the place to go. We've seen exhibits from Calder to Diane Von Furstenberg featured here as well as the current Rain showing. All incredibly interesting and well worth the time and money. It's a must see when we visit LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/refinnejy2018
50,don't miss this,"Saw a visual ""display/experience"" I will never forget. Worth the money to pay for the special exhibits but the main museaum is great as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/singlemomJane
40,Take in the Outside Sculpture Exhibit,We spent about an hour touring around LACMA checking out the wonderful sculptures and people watching on a beautiful sunny afternoon. There was no charge and we got to enjoy some wonderful sculptures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpatters
40,Huge museum,"LACMA is a large art museum comprised of multiple buildings housing art from various eras and collections. The buildings are connected by outdoor pavilions and some pedestrian bridges, but are all part of the huge complex. The collections include everything from paleolithic pottery to Renaissance paintings, South American artwork from the pre-Columbian period through Diego Rivera, art from all over Asia and modern installations. You could probably spend an entire day in each of the buildings that make up the museum.The collection definitely seems to have some of everything, though it does not have a lot of pieces that are particularly famous or that really stand out. The Renaissance paintings are by lesser-known artists, the pieces by famous Impressionists are often early-career pieces rather than masterpieces (though the collection of Picassos are strong). There are certainly some exceptions, and I admittedly did not have time to see portions of the collection such as the Asian artwork, but my overall impression was that LACMA is more quantity than quality. It's not bad, it's just not going to be impressive to those who have been to large world-class art museums or even smaller specialty-collection museums.The best thing I saw was the special exhibition on art from Weimar Republic Germany; a huge exhibit with expressionist and futurist-style paintings that are both engrossing and creepy in their depiction of a nation deeply wounded by its defeat in one war and sadly susceptible to the Nazi party that was soon to take over.Overall, LACMA is a museum with art for every taste, but you may have to hunt to find works that are truly memorable here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brend482
40,"Modern art, for those who appreciate it.","That was the most Picassos I've ever seen in one place, but I've always been partial to chicks with one eye on each side of the nose. Also, the sink hanging on the wall looked to me like a sink hanging on the wall, not art, proving that I am a Philistine.At the museum cafe, a cup of decaf coffee, an apple tart and a cookie cost $20. Welcome to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milquetoast599
50,Fabulous Museum that Goes on Forever,"I was only able to get to the modern art this visit, but they have a great collection of the main ""players"" in the modern art movements. In addition, you can walk through sculptures. Even entering the museum is cool, as there is sculpture outside and as you walk in. Give yourself at least 4-6 hours if you want to do this museum justice. However, even on a short visit, you will have a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fromRoseville
50,Nice Visit,Do not make the mistake of going to the museum after 3 PM! Apparently it's free for California residents and the ticket line is crazy! That being said- after our crazy wait we enjoyed the museum. There are a few different buildings to visit. Collection seemed a little small to me (compared to the museums in NY and Chicago) but enough nice pieces. If you have to pick between the LACMA and Getty though I would prob pick Getty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/106dinahd

50,Must visit all year round,"The LACMA museum has it all, from modern to ancient Egyptian artifacts dating to 2000-4000 BCE. Currently the exhibit houses modern art on the second floor, ancient roman and Egyptian on the third floor, and Islamic and south and Southeast Asia arts on the fourth floor. The museum is free to anyone under 17 and general admission is $15 for adults and $10 for students and seniors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donaldinc
40,Great value,"Spent a delightful day here. There are several buildings and many collections so there is something for everyone. The day I visited, there was an exhibit of art from the time of the Weimar republic. This exhibit was so good that it was worth the price of admission. At $10 for a senior (and $15 regular) it was a bargain. The exhibit of modern Islamic art was very interesting but I wish it had more pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wardnick1

40,LACMA on a Sunday,"Don't miss LACMA when in LA, and take your time. A lot to see, from Warhol's soup can to Chris Burden's lamp post installation. Bring your kids! Check out the program in advance. Great Frank Gehry exhibition while I was there. And if you're bored with art, go up the escalator and get a glimpse of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrondL402

40,We Went for the Gehry Exhibit and Saw Lots More,"First, there is parking! You have to pay $12 per visit but at least there is parking. After spending the day trying to find a place to leave the car so we could enjoy the city, it was a pleasure. We had tickets for the Gehry exhibit and it also gave us admission to the other collections. The museum complex has a lot to offer. We were worn out before we saw it all. Everything was well thought out and exhibited with flair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/650JulieS650

50,Great art experience,"I am a member here, so, of course I love LACMA. I also take visitors there. Even if you don't feel you are interested in art fan the environment is unique, walking between different buildings. I suggest choosing a couple of exhibits to focus on rather than trying to cover everything (and also making any special installations a priority, although they may require timed tickets). The curation is always wonderful, helping visitors engage with the art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljm_8
50,Enjoy the exhibits,The exhibit that I saw was the 'Rain Room' and that was my favorite one. They have multiple art work and constantly changing the art exhibits therefore a membership is worth a great deal especially if you like to go to museum more frequently,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimiT3
50,Accessible modern sculpture,"Loved all the sculptures - the outside installation of lights, and an indoor groups of concrete blocks. Also particularly loved the rock over the entrance way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cros4256
50,Lots of blue chip art in one venue,"LACMA is one of the two best museums in LA (along with the Getty). It has contemporary art and sculpture by blue-chip artists, frequent special exhibits and a great film collection and Asian art gallery. It's a great place to spend a day, catch a free jazz concert, watch a film, and watch people. Don't miss the Turrell and the the rain room (advance tickets needed for both)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suesinla
50,art watching and people watching at LACMA,"Watching LACMA grow and thrive is heartening. Delicious art and delicious food. focused and knowledgeable docents abound. I visit on every trip to my regular Amnesty International Western Regional meetings, sometimes for two hours, sometimes I stay all day, several days, and let myself get totally exhausted. Often, I watch school groups, happily surprised at the kids' attentiveness and their gifted teachers dialoguing about ""the best piece in the room"" or ""sculpture verses painting"". Don't miss falling in love with LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evmmoore
50,Great Photo Ops,"It's not just a museum. People love taking photos in front of the street lantern installation (just google engagement photos - haha) and the spaghetti installation as well as the big rock installation. If you're in town or are a local and you want to go to a museum but don't feel like going to a ""stuffy"" one, try the lacma. In the summer, they have jazz nights and their events calendar is just really chock full of interesting screenings, etc. There is always something cool happening and it is pretty kid friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saikoxpooh
50,This a nice place to visit the Los Angeles Country Museum it call (LACMA) for short.,Me and my Grand-daughter went to the LACMA with is Los Angeles Country Museum and it a nice place to visit because so my painting from different places and different Artist and it family friendly. And next door it has the LA Bera Tarpit and that nice to see too the children would like it to both place have so much to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hopeg382

Fun, relaxing, and ever expanding. A few years back they had King Tut! The Labrea Tar Pits are close by, make a day of it then go eat Ethiopian in the nearby neighborhood of Fairfax, or Jewish deli! Great classic hood of Los Angeles, from a native.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joy_Villa
40,Interesting expositions but the rules are a bit too strict,"We organized a family visit to LACMA: 4 adults and 2 babies.The museum is located right next door to La Brea Museum and has a common area for walking with it.First of all, I think you should allocate to this museum not only the full day but also several visits as the collection is pretty large.The expositions were interesting - there was one devoted to Japanese miniatures, to Korean and Chinese art. My baby was attracted by the collection of oceanic art (sculptures and other elements). There are some nice Impressionism pictures; a room with Picasso works, the whole centre devoted to Latin American Art (Diego Rivera works, Mexican ceramics). There are some installations, too.We chose to go to LACMA because our friends read that there are some baby areas in the museum. It turned up that there was a room for painting (you can get paper, paints and pencils to create something). However, I think that such an activity is too early for 11 month-olds. My baby was happily exploring the brush, trying to pull it into her mouth. Finally she got all dirty with paint. The other baby didn't risk to touch the paints and brushes. The funny thing is that to draw with paints one uses water to wash brushes but when we opened a bottle of water to give to the baby, we received a notification that it's prohibited to drink water in the museum (though it was kid area) and eat something.Separately I should say about the ticketing system - at the ticket office besides the actual tickets you have to get stickers for each visitor. For some reason we were not given ones and were stopped by the employees of the museum at each exposition until a nice gentlemen provided us with stickers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anastasiag79
50,Stretch your imagination,"Four hours here does not get out of the category ""Drive-by"". If you try to interact with the pieces, you could spend weeks. We were enthralled by the Gehry exhibit, watched its entire video, and took too many pictures. The Rain Room was oversold.Consider getting here on the bus, and the Farmer's Market / Grove is less than a kilometer away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drwtwilner
50,My favorite LA museum!,I love this museum & for me it's a must when I visit Los Angeles. I was just there & was so happy to see new exhibits which had opened since my last visit. I was disappointed not to be able to get in to Rain Room which had been sold out for weeks. I did enjoy the other exhibits I saw & walking the beautiful grounds of the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/934debbys
40,Love lacma!,"Lacma currently has the rain room exhibit going on. The tickets must be purchased ahead of time. Each group gets 15 minutes total to explore and take pictures. Only 8 people are allowed in under the rain. It's very cool.If not exploring that, the rest of the museum is very interesting with a lot of diversity as well. There really is something for everyone: from Picasso, to the imagination room to the famous street lamps. Definitely worth checking out and while you're at it check out the broad too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahlY4469SM
50,A Wonderful Contribution to LA culture,"Full disclosure - I'm a member and have been for several years. My kids have grown up ""being forced"" to see major/temporary exhibits at LACMA over the years. And we have seen some amazing shows: from Tim Burton to Magritte to VanGogh. I recently went to an exhibit that will be open to the public soon - the Rain Room. It's very cool - an interactive rain environment that stops raining where you stand but it still rains all around you. Plus, they screen films and they have music nights and family days. Whenever I start to lose faith in the world, I go to a museum and feel better knowing that humans love to look at beauty and art. And since I live in Los Angeles, this is the place I go to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogamom65

40,European collection a pleasant surprise,"We visited LACMA after having seen the Getty, Huntington, and Norton Simon. Not expecting great things, we were surprised and impressed by the European collection, which is especially rich in 17th Century Dutch art, the result of a substantial bequest of a private collection. Art lovers visiting LA should not overlook this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Botticelli1105

30,Not a must see,"I visited five museums while in LA, and this is the one I could take or leave. The holdings are large, but they only display a room or two of certain periods at a time, and although the buildings are clearly labeled, I found the layout confusing. And I was very surprised at how few benches are available throughout for resting. If you have limited time. I'd pass on LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marftrip
50,"RUN, don't walk, to see this exhibit!","The title is: New Objectivity: Modern German Art in the Weimar Republic. For the next month and a half you can marvel at this striking exhibition of German Weimar Republic’s many talented and dynamic artists, who reflect the years of 1919-1933 and its major transformations. Germany was undergoing rapid modernization, with political and economic upheavals between the end of WW I and the Nazi rise to power. The art absolutely breathtaking and beautiful, sometimes shocking, mirroring the artists’ times. For added interest, the curator provides a background of the sociopolitical events that colored those years. Economically, inflation was astronomical: the mark went from 8 to the dollar in 1918 to over 4 billion per dollar in 1924, and million mark notes were so devalued that they were used for writing paper. With about 190 works by over 50 artists, the show runs until January 18, 2016. The regular entry fee covers admittance to this jewel also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adenine
40,Expansive County Museum Features Provocative Exhibits,"One of my favorite museums, the Los Angeles County Museum does not disappoint, especially with its special exhibit. During this visit to Los Angeles, the museum featured the found art collages of Noah Purifoy, the founding director of the acclaimed Watts Tower. Most notable about the exhibit, called ""Junk Dada"" were pieces he and his colleagues created from the burnt items they collected immediately after the Watts riot in 1965, including articles of clothing and photographs. Also challenging were the two pieces, ""The Last Supper,"" both based on used sardine tins shaped as plates as well as the heads of the apostles. Another exhibit offered 180 German paintings and photos from the Weimar Republic, 1919 to 1933. Most of the artists were banned after Hitler was made chancellor, but before their art was discarded, it provided views of a culture that was at various times brutal and challenging, but always changing with mass produced commodities and new rights for women. Rawest were the paintings of sex murders, prostitutes and disabled war veterans. There's always something to appreciate and learn at this museum, a Los Angeles cultural touchstone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/322janetc
30,"Great publicist, mediocre museum","This is really a collection of museum ranging from traditional (western art) to Japanese on to contemporary art. The Japanese pavilion is a great space, but a minor museum with a number of classic screens and pieces of art. The contemporary art pavilion is in the shadow of other venues in LA. The Americas pavilion (including Mexican art) has a few very good pieces, but a lot of questionable pieces. The American art collection, unfortunately, shares the same fate...a few outstanding pieces. The hammer wing remains an anomaly....there is negative energy in this building.....many mediocre piece poorly displayed with abysmal lighting and signage. I assume they gave lots of inflated valuations to encourage individuals to donate mediocre pieces so they could claim large tax write-offs.The real positive of the museum is in the building devoted to special shows....the museum has put on some really 'must see' exhibitions. The tar pits (what remains of them) are well worth the visit...this is essential Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/attillathehun

50,Don't miss the James Turrell exhibit - breathtaking!,"So much to see, very hard to do it all in an afternoon. Get signed up right away for the James Turrell exhibit because it sells out on a busy day. The Rain Room is a must, but long waiting list unless you are a member, still a wait, but less. The impressionists section was a little hard to find but lovely to take in. The BCAM has some fun pieces on the first floor but with the Broad downtown, not their best collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CVP626

50,So much to do,LACMA has always something happening. You can visit over and over again and find new exhibitions and artists. Make the time and visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/480riccardor
40,Well worth visiting,"This is an excellent art museum with special exhibitions from time to time. Just how they have set up interesting outdoor pieces (free to look at) is a great introduction to what follows inside. The areas that hold different periods and styles of art are well marked and allow the visitor to choose what to tackle. I say this as the centre is quite extensive and, for maximum benefit, should be tackled in small doses. Trying to take it all in in one day could be exhausting. While we had plenty of highlights (including the Gehry exhibition while we were there), there is something for everyone so I won't try and play favourites. Excellent undercover parking on site at moderate charge plus good restaurants and cafes within.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emanpee
50,ALWAYS WORTHWHILE,"The Rain Room alone is reason to visit LACMA. It's a limited-time exhibit, and advance tickets are required, so book before you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidcZ2214DJ
50,Rain Room is worth going,I visit this museum every time I visit LA if I can. The collection is first rate but the special exhibitions are SO creative and different. This fall the Rain Room was a room where it rained everywhere but on you when you walked slowly through it. Advance reservations are necessary to experience it. I was a little disappointed in the variety of items in the museum store this time. I was hoping for Christmas shopping but there were mostly books and strange ruffled clothing. So I bought nothing there. The parking garage is a nice feature.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prettywoman65
30,Disappointing and expensive,I had read good things about LACMA and was excited to see it but was disappointed with the high cost and the low standard of the venue. Firstly the cost is high in comparison with the Getty Centre and Villa where you pay $15 for parking and can visit both venues for free. LACMA is $25 for entrance to the museum and special exhibitions and $12 for parking. The exhibition spaces looked dirty and tired and most rooms didn't have anyone watching them. I felt quite stressed while walking around as it was very hard to navigate from the poor map diagram that had been provided at the entrance. I asked an attendant why there was no signage anywhere to direct you to the various sections of the Museum (or even the exits) and they advised me that the Museum Director does not believe in wayfinding signage. Apparently you are supposed to just discover the art and feel your way around. I found it frustrating and annoying as many of the rooms were the same colour and it was hard to work out whether you had seen everything or were actually just going in circles. It was not an enjoyable experience for me and the attendants were grumpy too probably from the many frustrated people asking them for directions. I was also told off for taking a photo in a section which apparently was a special private exhibition but again there was no sign to identify this differentiation. The exhibition itself has some high points but in my opinion the curation was jumbled. I far prefer the Getty Centre which had a simple chronological order from start to end. The highlight of LACMA for me was the Frank Gehry Exhibition which is well worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/strategicallyb
50,Too Much to See in One Visit,"The place is over-whelming and we were over-whelmed. The docents were very helpful and everything is well laid out. You can't help but love it all.

30,Good - not great....,"I used to be a member and go regularly - the base collection rarely changes, but there can be great traveling exhibitions - over the years, I've seen Tut, Charles Renee Macintosh, Kandinsky, and so many more. Street parking used to be easy/free - over the years, it has become annoying - you can be lucky and park on the backside or pay the price for offical parking - ? ~$10 now. On Friday nights, I think only during the summer, they have Friday night jazz concerts in the square - free to attend=. Get there early to get a seat and best view; it can be good meeting spot. On Tuesday afternoons, they show old movies in the theater there. See their website for what's one. I like LACMA but due to traffic/parking, I only go for special events now, rather than swinging on by when I was a member..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneM806
50,Do not miss the lamp posts at night,I think the lamp posts at LACMA are one of the coolest attractions in the area......AND IT IS FREE. I have been there during the day and seen people taking pictures of a wedding party because the backdrop is so interesting. At night it can be a very busy place also since the light effects are nice to capture in a photo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stoketun
40,Not Bad,I never knew about this place until my fiancee mentioned she wanted to see the lamps. We went and were pleasantly surprised by this place. The modern art exhibits were mostly weird and goofy but the paintings from before the modern age were pretty good. There was a jazz concert going on while were there too which was pretty sweet.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/975chasew
50,"A ""Must Do"" When in LA","We've been going to LACMA for years, and always check out their temp exhibits when we're in LA. On this visit, we viewed the exhibit on Art of the Weimar Republic, which was one of the best curated art exhibits we have seen, with lots of accessible information masterfully relating the art on display to the times (1919-1933 in Germany, between WWI and the rise of Hitler). We also attended the Frank Gehry exhibit, which displayed models of many of his projects through the years--including those still in progress.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebelVirginia
30,I love this museum,"This museum is really great. They have a NexGen program that grants children free admission along with free admission for one adult. What a wonderful way to encourage a love of art and museums at a young age. My kids love coming here. We spent 4 hours here recently and only covered half at most. The only negative thing I have to say is that we encountered a few employees in jackets that weren't as kind and welcoming as they should be. The employees in aprons at the Boone Gallery were all very friendly though. If you've not been, it is worth your time- just make sure you set aside enough time to cover it all.Pros: for how big this place is and what it has to offer, what cost us the most on our visit here was at the C+M Cafe.Admission w/ student id's: $10 a person(Admission is free for LA residents)Parking in their parking garage $10",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/playb0yc
40,Art in LA,The family had a great day at LACMA. It is a gallery with very varied spaces and exhibitions. It appears to change very regularly. As usual it had a great gift shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GCsk50
30,OK..,It was worth to see Tim Burton's exhibition. Good for taking pictures with the lamps but careful since they don't allow you to climb on them :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cnsbyby
40,"Beautiful museum, make sure you take pics of the lamps!","Huge museum, so it's a good afternoon of walking. Went there for their special Tim Burton Exhibit and it was awesome. Tip: it's always so busy at the lamps exhibit outside, but if you are still awake and in the area in the middle of the night, lie 2am onwards, stop by to take pics with the lamps, great photo op and hardly anyone around. It's well lit - haha so you don't feel creeped out. It's not locked in so its cool to wander there for a little bit at night. Kind of romantic too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/selinav
50,Take time to Relax!,"So many great things to say about LACMA!The history, the notoriety, the opportunity... Its a peaceful place. Spend the day here to just walk around and observe Art!Affordable, and offers free admission to BofA account holders the first weekend of every month!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalograms
50,great collection,Did not get to see entire collection as it is a very large complex. Lots of space and well curated. Loved the Frank Gehry exhibition. Easily accessible,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaElizabeth62
50,Great rainy day activity,Connected to Le Brea Tar Pit and Peterson Automotive Center so it would be nice to pay one admission for all. Enjoyed the visit and a wonderful experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/932lizam
50,Let it Rain!,"Wow. Thank you LACMA for bringing us The Rain Room installation. What a sensory experience. Refreshing. I highly recommend this exhibit. I saw it as a member only preview event, no lines! I will visit this experience again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAR411
40,Friday Jazz at LACMA,"They have free concerts on Friday's. They are busy though so get there early. The also have the street lamp exhibit. Very popular for pictures and a date night. The art is extremely varied. It's in the same location as the La Brea Tar Pits. Worth seeing as well. They are excavating them so you learn about what lived in the area many, many years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philetos
50,Best art museum in L.A.,"Huge great museum that is difficult to see all in one day. Awesome famous works of art, lots of history about Los Angeles, the gift shop sells cool (expensive) hand made stuff and lots of books and trinkets. The building its self is beautiful as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisaY2421LA
50,An excellent museum with a wide variety,This was our 3rd visit in as many years. Always impressed with the quality and diversity of the art presented - a great location as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/263RobertB263
50,John Turrell light exhibition and reception,Went with friends for the John Turrell light exhibition. Attended the reception and had drinks and light appetizers. Loved the light posts out front and thoroughly enjoyed the Turrell exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live2trade
40,A very popular place for visitors,"I did not know how popular this place is until I've been told it's in movies and read about it. The museum (paid) behind it is a contemporary art museum, I did not have good taste for it, there is one huge room with one ""subject"" in it and I have no idea what it was.LA Fitness gym is right cross the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adac1121
50,Beautiful Lights!,"We didn't go inside the museum. Came here after dark just to see the lights outside. It was beautiful! There were a few groups doing professional photo shoots there, which were fun to watch. If you have a bit of time to spare, I highly recommend you to stop by and take some fun photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvay
50,Very Nice Art Museum,Very nice museum with very good collection of art. Great view of the Hollywood sign from the top of one of the buildings. Good cafe. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lrising
40,Outstanding collection,"We were favorably surprised by the quality of the collection. The museum building is underwhelming, particularly it's maintenance. This collection deserves a better building",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nunya354
50,Probably the best museum you have never heard of,Visiting LA from Europe we had first headed for the Getty - which is rightly World renowned. Our daughter living in LA suggested that we might also like the LACMA - of which we had not previously heard.Boy is it both very large and also crammed full of World class Art from all Continents. We spent 5 hours here - and only managed to complete two floors in just one Building.The Getty has a worthy local rival snapping at its heals giving it a run for its money. Well done LACMA and all its Patrons.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobandJosie
40,Glad the antiquities are there- Palmyra is going fast. :(,"We went to see the antiquities especially. There were a couple from Palmyra, nice sarcophagus from Egypt; several other early civilizations represented with urns, walls in relief, pottery, masks, etc. It is not overwhelming, but well worth a visit. There were also lovely items of porcelain, dinnerware and snuff boxes from Europe in the very next room. Some of the artwork seemed to not go together with other items in the room; the curators were kind of light weight. The school children seemed to take it all in though. If you can grab a metered parking spot on Wilshire Blvd, it's still worth a visit. The installations outside are as nice as those inside. Be sure to poke around the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodielicious2
50,Great Museum!,"Thinking that this was a small county museum, we allotted 2 hours during our visit to LA. Well we ended up spending 8 hours! What a find and the best value in LA.There were Monet's, the famous Frida Kahlo portrait by Diego Garcia, Picasso's, classic and modern art abound. A delicious sit down restaurant was also at the museum ground floor as well as a cafeteria. Spend a day. This museum is world class!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kamaina2014
40,"If you love museums, then stop if you must","London, DC, NYC all have miles of museum space which showcase fabulous art and artifacts. LA is not really known for that kind of magnitude of museums, but luckily it does not fall short and has this little gem called LACMA. LACMA houses some interesting installation art which is definitive of LA. The Urban Light is quite popular and it's free as it is outside the actual museum. Worth seeing inside is the Metropolis, works by Matisse, Cezanne, Gauguin, Degas, Picasso, Warhol, Mondrian,Kandinsky. I also like the Japanese Art section.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadarien
50,Lovely galleries,Absolutely great photography exhibitions at this museum - would definitely recommend.The gift shop is great too - treated myself to 4 art books for under $20.A lovely place to wander around.Loved the Barbara Kruger piece which you can see when waiting for the elevator in one of the buildings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliciaInfinite
50,Love it! Metropolis! Lots of fun things to see,I can't believe I haven't reviewed this great Museum yet. I live in LA and my tween son is a member of the NEXT GEN...(a great program by the way) and I have been here with school groups and with my mom. But this last visit just before school went into session was my fave! Saw METROPOLIS with my tween. Google it. Defies description. It's an experience. Make sure to go when it's 'on'. Then we hit a special exhibit. There is ALWAYS something to see here. Then hit the food trucks across the street after.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFoolForTravel
50,Great Mind Food at this Museum,Very much enjoyed the extensive collection of works that are displayed throughout the grounds (inside & out). My husband who was reluctant to visit an art museum was over the moon to find that most of the displays had historical facts presented alongside as well. We spent hours meandering around and still had not seen everything. We would definitely go back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisainsaintlucia
40,Very good museum,"Good place to be for half day. However it was a little confusing to visit. There was no special visiting order. While some of the expositions are very good for the general public, other are only for people with a special interest. I recommend to stop by the info booth and plan a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kartikmexico
30,Drove By,Drove by and did not know that it was!We just drove basically from one end of Wilshire Blvd. to the other end of Wilshire Blvd. downtown were we had to turn left or right! Saw a lot and it was fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Route66travel
50,Art expression made fun,LACMA is a fabulous museum that exhibits art of all media. It's my daughter's favorite place to go. Experience art in it's many forms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lkstumm
40,LACMA - why is everything closed?,We were in the LACMA in the weekend of September 13th. We saw a lot of great pieces of art but a lot of floors (and even the entire building of American Art) were closed. That was a bit of an dissapointment. It might be a good idea to park at the street since the garage is $15.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Duwstang
50,Great Art,"LACMA is a great place to spend the day. From the special exhibitions to the wonderful permanent works of art, LACMA never disappoints.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamie2561
40,Perfect Instagram Picture,"I had a friend visit the art installation the week before me and it was beautiful! Very intriguing to use the city's old lamps as art. Definitely better to see at night and light up, rather than during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/235samanthan
50,"Great art from multiple centuries, and a storied modern collection","We have been members of LACMA for many years. Its exhibitions are generally very creative and collaborative. Its modern collection is excellent. many of the pieces at the new Broad Museum were mainstays at LACMA for years. I would not miss ""Bands"", Richard Serra's huge continuous-metal-loop sculpture. The Resnick Pavillion hosts many new and touring exhibitions, and recent ones include the Gehry Exhibit, a Tim Burton exhibit, an Impressionist Exhibit, a California Style exhibit, an insanely amazing Ken Price exhibit and many more. Of course, the Burden Street Lights piece outside the front entrance is now iconic. The museum is accessible, and non-flash photos are allowed of many pieces in the permanent collection and in traveling exhibitions. As a member, you also get periodic previews with coffee/tea and desserts, as well as discounts in the gift shops and reciprocal memberships at many museums worldwide. Even if you are not a member, enjoy the free Friday evening jazz series and Sunday jazz and classical music as well, as well as movie screenings. The museum also has wonderful and relaxing food choices, including Ray's and Stark's. If you have friends in from out of town, take them to the museum. An added bonus is the Peterson automotive museum across the street, the Page/La Brea tarpits next door and the upcoming Academy museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/477kenr
50,LACMA,"We visited the wonderful V&A exhibition last year. The quality of the exhibits was fantastic. We are still talking about the costumes and the way they were displayed. The whole museum complex is well worth visiting. If you stand on the observation deck outside, you look across to the famous Hollywood sign on the top of the hill. There facilities are excellent. There is also a really good restaurant in the complex. It's in a beautiful area. As others have also found, it's a must for art lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoneyWSussex
40,Genuine suprise on the Miracle Mile,"I should begin by making it clear that this review refers only to the modern art section housed in the Ahmanson Building, one of the seven main venues on the LACMA site.Not having read a great deal about LACMA prior to our visit, I wasn't sure what to expect, in fact we were only in the vicinity in order to visit the La Brea Tar Pits Museum next door. However, LACMA turned out to have one of the most discerning collections of modern art I have viewed outside of the big museums (MOMA, Tate, etc). At the time of our visit there was a superb feature on German Expressionism which included some fine examples of Bauhaus-designed furniture. The permanent collection features works by many of the household names of 20th century art and generally they are represented by very fine examples of their work. The spacious viewing rooms provide a relaxed ambiance for enjoying the art and our only regret is that our visit, by necessity, was a short one. I believe the modern art collection at LACMA compares quite favourably with the Tate Modern in London, indeed this is the standard of collection I'd always imagined I'd see in the Guggenheim (NYC) until I realised that that institution preferred to leave its best works in storage to make room for car wrecks! No car wrecks here, LACMA, definitely a must see for art lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
40,An unforgettable trip to the museum! The 50 for 50 exhibit at the LACMA.,"A truly enjoyable experience! This museum contains more than 120,000 objects of art and it is the largest art museum in the western United States. It is located in a beautiful and quiet area of LA, near Beverly Hills, and adjacent to La Brea Park (also worth visiting).The beautiful Urban Light by artist Chris Burden greets you at the formal entry. It is made of 203 vintage street lamps (6-9 meters high) and featured in one scene of the movie ""No Strings Attached"". It makes for a great photograph place!The Resnick Pavilion was one of my favorites with masterpieces from Degas, Toulousse-Lautrec, Monet, Warhol, Chagall, Klee, among others.Another highlight is Metropolis II, also by Chris Burden which represents an entire urban complex. A must see and enjoy by both adults and children. Also, check the observation deck in the Broad building for a clear view of LA and the Hollywood sign.Lastly, don't miss Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass sculpture which is a 340-ton boulder, 21.5 foot-tall in an amazing setting. Impressive!Tip: if you choose street/metered parking know that the amount of allowed hours will not give you the time for the visit. Instead, park in the lot on Curson Ave. it is less expensive ($10) flat rate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azen11
50,Frank Gehry exhibit,"If you are a fan of architecture you will enjoy this current exhibit at the LACMA, if you are a fan of Frank Gehry or even questioning his creativity you MUST see this exhibit.The exhibit opened on September 13 and will run through March 20. Rooms are filled with models of Gehry's built and proposed structures. A highlight is being able to see all of the places I experienced in person through the perspective of the models. This includes two of my favorites, the ""Pritzker Pavilion"" in Chicago and ""Fred and Ginger"" in Prague. An hour and a half documentary was also one of the highlights for me. Although I doubt that they really want you to sit and watch it for the entire length because the stools provided as seating are among the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced.The exhibit also includes information concerning the current project that are under construction, many of which are in LA.A small bookshop is filled with wonderful print material about Gehry many of which I had never seen before.Park on the street (four hour parking) or in the LACMA lot.The cost is $25 for entry into LACMA and this special exhibit, well worth the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fro2
40,Very nice,"A large and very diverse collection, leaning towards the modern, attractively housed in a spacious building. It did get pretty busy on the Saturday afternoon when I visited, but I suppose that's inevitable. The highlight was a sensational milkshake in the gallery cafe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meveshan
40,Extensive collection of art. Very interesting place to visit,"The various pavillions at LACMA have some great collections of art from around the world. The pavillions change some of their exhibits from time to time, so its best to check the LACMA website for what's going on currently. The entrance fee for students is a mere $10 and is totally worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJDMello
40,Private Affair...,Nice museum. Enjoyed it! Was there for a private function so there was an open bar and food. This place would be beautiful for special occasions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gots_2_travel
50,"Braod, Accessible","A very appealing experience, with a broad, accessible collection across multiple buildings. Also, there are several establishments for drinks and/or food at several locations across the grounds, making it a great social setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/265jamesi
50,The World of Art to See and The Occasional Free Event,"I went to LACMA thinking it was going to be one solid building to roam around, but quickly discovered otherwise. It is not only one building and to say there is a lot to be seen is an understatement. I had a very wonderful employee explain to me what each building had to offer and personally recommend a few of the most popular pieces. I went to LACMA thinking I'd be spending an hour or two tops, but I spent a good five or six hours and still didn't see it all!There is always something for everyone to see at LACMA. I like it especially because it's all very spacious and the separate buildings give everyone some space to breathe, so even with it being busy it doesn't have a crowded feel.There was free jazz on the night that I went, which was a great experience. There were so many people and it was a great atmosphere. If I were staying in LA longer, I'd become a LACMA member. If you're passing through LA, please do not miss LACMA. There really is something for everyone. They also have a few places to eat in the establishment (cafés, cafeteria) and a nice souvenir shop. You're also within a short walking distance to many great restaurants on Wilshire, so don't worry about not being fed after a long day of art!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nakates
50,Day of Art at Lacma,"For a day of discovery, definitely visiting LACMA is the way to go. Architecturally designed to promote a numerous visual experiences, LACMA's permanent collection has some really must see pieces from the second half of the 20th century, an amazing Japanese collection, and a sophisticated collection of key pieces reflecting contemporary art. Lacma offers a variety of venues in which to explore and experience its holdings. The newer buildings house modern shows, and a visit is well worth the trip as you're bound to find some thing that pleases the eye and heart. The museum stretches at least two city blocks and is nestled adjacent to the La Brea Tarpits and across the street from the Folk Art museum, hence the name ""museum row"". Great to venture in with kids under 16 (who get in free and can bring an adult with them!), break at one of their three restaurants on the premises, and return for more. I have been at least 20 times an they never cease to surprise with their exhibits and offerings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinel227
50,Something for Everyone,"Research your visit ahead of time so that you can hit the ground running and maximize your time there. I visited the ""Clock"" exhibit which is Christian Marclay's cinematic tour de force that unfolds on the screen in real time through thousands of film excerpts that form a 24-hour montage. Appropriated from the last 100 years of cinema’s rich history, the film clips chronicle the hours and minutes of the 24-hour period, often by displaying a watch or clock. The Clock incorporates scenes of everything from car chases and board rooms to emergency wards, bank heists, trysts, and high-noon shootouts. It's a MUST SEE if still showing. Otherwise there are always numerous exhibits from which to choose and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJeanneWashington_DC
40,FREE concert,"FREE Jazz performance!!!This is the 23rd year they are organizing Jazz Nights. Tables & chairs are setup in the courtyard, next to Coffee & Milk shop.People will come in the early afternoon, setup their picnic table and enjoy the food & wine.The show starts at 6pm sharp for 2 hours. No better way to enjoy a beautiful evening with live Jazz music!!Parking: $12 (since no admission fee for the show, come with your family or friends in one car, totally worth it!!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
50,Best place for art lovers!,"I went here in September this year at around 2 PM.Entry to this place costs 15$ and the place is literally sooo huge that even a day is less to explore each and every display here!I went to the African, Chinese/Korean and Japanese exhibits since they had a free guided tour of the first two exhibits and Japanese culture is something I am obsessed with.The LACMA cafe is easily the most economical cafe nearby and they serve a plethora of stuff that any one can get irrespective of what they eat at an affordable cost.Highly recommended if you like art, pottery and traditional clothing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dheer_c
40,Great art museum in the heart of LA,"Everyone goes to the Getty, and they should, but don't miss this treasure of an art museum right in the heart of LA.

Well laid out, nicely presented. Not to be missed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K2307NAandrewg
50,Art,"For those who love art, history, and culture.Beautiful pieces of art from around the world and from time periods. To just skim through each exhibition would takes days. But would take weeks to fully appreciate what this museum has to offer.(Be sure to wear good walking shoes and enough money if you plan on purchasing anything. Drinks and food are overpriced. And the gift/souvenir shop is a joke.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shmoi

50,Most recommended museum for first-time LA visitors,"Quintessential museum for first-timers visitors to LA. Contains several buildings with various exhibitions, some of which are permanent. Checking out the website to see what is available is highly recommended. Heavy crowds on weekends, certain holidays and certain exhibit openings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tute66
40,Nice place to spend a few hours,"If you like American art, this is worth exploring. They have some interesting modern pieces - Pollock, Rothko, Matisse, Litchenstein, Warhol, a section of Picasso's, and a really interesting exhibit of German post WW1 Expressionist lithograph posters. If you are not afraid of heights, take the extended outdoor escalator for a view of LA. Hollywood sign is viewable if you squint.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emmykeats
50,Great visit,"Went to tour the Museum with a friend that vollunteers there and is a member which made it a very special and enjoyable, knowing how is is set up with a variety of art from deferent times was just great.

50,A Must See While In LA,"This museum has a very strong collection of art across several periods and artists. While no single section or exhibit was the penultimate one, the sheer diversity and variety of their works, and the settings they were presented in were top notch. We were especially impressed by the Japanese pavilion housing handpainted screens. Tremendous harmony between the architectural setting and the work within, that extended to the surrounding gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HapkidoNinja

50,Incredible museum,"I really love abstract expressionism so this place was right up my alley. If you're a fan of Stills, Pollock, Rothko, and Guston you'll love their permanent collection of modern paintings. They also had a ton of cubist paintings and sculptures from Picasso, Braque, and others from that school if that's your cup of tea. Aside from those exhibits, they have several other collections that should appeal to any art enthusiast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlh871

50,Fabulous art museum with the buildings being part of the attraction,We spent the better part of a day here next to the Tar Pits. The art was covering a wide gamete of styles and periods. We especially liked the outdoor exhibits of the street lights and the boulder. Good examples of Hispanic art and modern art along with many others. Nice selection of casual restaurants for lunch and a drink afterward.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rogtravel
40,A fun place to get some culture!,"This museum is one of my favourite go to's in Los Angeles. Various collections of art.. from the modern, classical and asian.Besides seeing the regular collections... this museum really does a great job with visiting exhibits and features. A great place to spend with my family and friends.Take a break with friends at the cafe's and restaurants. LA is one of the best places to enjoy outdoor cafes cause of the great weather we have.Enjoy the perks of membership. See some great concerts outside and enjoy the visiting speakers.They also have art classes and weekend fun stuff for the kids.I love just bringing my friends here without telling them... they usually are skeptical about museums.. but leave happy that they came.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tobina928
50,A diverse and eclectic collection,"The exhibits are spread through a number buildings each with its own style and character. The outstanding one for us was the Japanese purpose built building that echoed the culture and collection inside. Delightfully spacious and windows that look like the typical screens found in Japanese homes.The café serves excellent food made on the premises including bespoke pizza, at a very reasonable price. Parking in the underground carpark is $12 for the day, and you can easily spend the day here.Entrance is generally charged for but one day a month it is by donation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/david3b

50,Fine Art in Air-Conditioned Bliss!,I was advised to visit LACMA by a good friend who worked at nearby offices. Outside was a sweltering 40 degrees celsius. Inside LACMA was an air-conditioned heaven!! My student day Film/Art History came flooding back! You can fine everything here - especially liked the Giacometti sculptures and was told off by staff for trying photograph them - so check details beforehand. Also check out Chris Burden's Urban Light Art before you enter the gallery/museum (it's the most photograph location in LA apparently!!),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/klive1961
50,A must see,"I have found LACMA super interesting. I was spoiled living in DC for years, but this museum really works to bring out artists, speakers and deserves the international reputation for excellence.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanetMcE
50,Great museum,"Great location right by the La Brea tar pits, and interesting garden to walk through with beautiful Calder mobiles.

Well worth the visit hope to come back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Koshka1606
50,A fun but cultured place,"This is a ideal place for young children. First you have to sign them up for NXTGEN. Up until your child is 18 they can go for free with a guest. They also have classes to bring out the lil Picasso in all. Also, the Page Museum(La Brea Tar Pits) is right next door. Now with the actual museum, this is the perfect place to visit in the Spring and Summer. There are a least four difference buildings to visit, my favorite is the building with the extra wide elevator(that is where the ""modern"" art is located. It also has a hundred foot escalator( supreme awesomeness!).There is a restaurant and snack bar. There use to be fountains but because of the water shortage they have been drained. In the back there is a wide grassy area perfect for a picnic and hanging out with the kiddies. Also during the summer they have jazz concerts in the park. If you become a member you can go for free anytime they are open, they have early viewing for certain exhibits and there is also Muse after dark for your high school kid. There is a DJ ,taco truck and museum browsing. Lastly there is the WORLD FAMOUS HALLOWEEN COSTUME BALL!!! Where you see anything from period dress to, folks dressed a famous artists and more! A great place well worth the price a admission. Lastly if you don't want to pay metered parking or parking lot parking($10), park a block over for free. Oh! also the Petersen Auto Museum is a couple of blocks away and will be having their grand re opening soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnawhi
50,Very Nice Saturday,"I came on a Saturday afternoon so you would think it be packed here but not the case. Everyone is at the beach!This I believe is way better than the Getty Center. I would actually skip Getty because I believe it's so overrated there. The problem with Getty is it is quite far from Hollywood/Beverly Hills and then you have to take a train there. Not to mention the parking is quite sparse as there will be many people going there. If you are going on a day when it's very hot, it will be extremely hot there since it's up on a mountain. You will get some nice views of LA but best to go elsewhere for this view like a hotel preferably.There are also some very famous artwork here by Picasso, Monet, and Warhol.Highly recommend coming here on a slow Saturday or Sunday. You'll have a great time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxD87
40,A grand old lady - still good for a visit.,"LACMA has been the major museum in Los Angeles for 50 years. Built by noted architect William Pereira, it has been added on so the original campus has changed. The most notable visual is the Street Lamps which welcome visitors and have become the most popular place to take a selfie in LA. There's a very good restaurant and bar. The art collections are among the best in the country but many of the galleries are tired and difficult to see the art at its best. Still worth going to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/habitatp2014
50,Wow,Didn't know what to expect coming in. Well worth the admission tickets (15$) so many great exhibits to see. A large variety of art styles. Highly recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandarD4985LX
40,Lamps & Food Trucks,Ok so I can't review the museum itself because I didn't really go in. I stopped by here on my way from Los Angeles to Claremont because I wanted to see the famous Urban Light installment. It was smaller than I had thought - but still cool nonetheless. Great picture op. There's a pretty expensive restaurant in front of the installment which we went to and not worth it. Save yourself some cash and instead go across the street to food truck heaven. There's like 12 of them parked there. There's paid street parking or a $10 parking lot available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sptaz33
40,URBAN LIGHTS,Urban Lights is worth an evening visit. Simply beautiful! Chris Burden created this iconic piece that gently lights the barren landscape of LACMA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/403cw
40,"Interested, if non cohesive, museum","Great location right by the Le Brea tar pits, and interesting architecture / sculpture garden to walk through. The building itself sometimes feels confusibg and claustrophobic.There are several gems scattered among an uneven, eclectic collection. While the European painting collection is not great, don't miss the Bay Area painters, Deibenkorn, Park, and Joan Brown. The Contemporary Art wibg is excellent, as is the Japanese wing.TIP: reserve a space for the James Turell installation. It fills up quickly! I didn't realize it required a reservation, and couldn't get in :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/batnadivh
50,Essential art attraction,"This is an essential arts and culture attraction, up there with the Getty Center for what it offers. There is loads to see so allow time to plan and select, and factor in about 4 or 5 hours, which will go fast! We approached through the park off Fairfax, underneath the sculpture - make sure you take in the Chris Burden street light installation at the front of the building as well.There is an entry fee but not that much, especially when you consider the amount there is. We visited about 4 buildings, to see the Noah Purifoy, Richard Serra, Metropolis (worth scheduling yourself for when it runs - check the daily schedule that you pick up on arrival for the times), the German Exprssionist work - some fantastic political posters, pamphlets and leaflets, and Christian Marclay's The Clock, amongst others.If you go see The Clock, a brilliant 24 hour montage film, expect a line and a waiting time, but if you are prepared to give over some time for it, it is worth it. Once in and sat down we spent an hour there and it's hypnotic.There is food on site in a few places, and if is fine, and an okay gift shop, but not much in the way of postcards or catalogues, which is a pity really.I'd recommend this to any art/culture fan, and anyone really who would like to dip their toes in as there is such a range of material on offer, something will suit you - allow time though as we had to speed up later on to get round what we wanted to see.Afterwards you can stroll to the Farmer's Market on Fairfax and a Third for some nosh.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X2823RUchrisa
50,Wonderful museum for day long visit,"As mentioned by another reviewer, this museum offered far more than I had expected.. There were 7 buildings of various types of art spread out over a large and attractive campus. There are several places to eat or have a cup of coffee and a snack. I found to be a little pricey but tasty. The cafeteria was crowded even at 2pm, making it hard to find a seat. At the end of the day we sat outside in a wine bar and had an opportunity to listen to a free jazz concert that went on into the evening. It was a day well spent",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/106gailc
50,"Great Art, Poor Staff, Mediocre Food options.","Amazing, Amazing art. I'm not sure if they ask their staff to purposefully look intimidating, so that people behave around the art, but geez - not friendly or helpful at all. The food stand outside could use some improvement, but hey - it's a museum not a restaurant. They also have a small coffee shop that was too busy due to there not being many other options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marilyng394

50,This is LACMA as angelenos fondly refer to it.,"Probably the only time I 've waited in in a very very long line was at LACMA""s spectacular VAN GOGH EXIBIT. OH! the joy of it. Those colors blaze into your brain and never come out. The canvas i was most absorbed by and had never seen or heard of before was prisoners exercising on an indoor circle walk, the grey walls glistening with yellow damp. He must have spent some time in the slammer,( maybe after an argument with his house mate Gaugin) I stared and stared,unaware that my nose was close to touching the canvass, until a long boney finger jammed into my shoulder and a suspicious flick of eyes caused to me to take a swift step back. Anyway,you could hear the sound of shuffling feet and the pervasive sense of heavy, hopeless hearts in the exercise area, as i moved on to the next glorious work. LACMA does not have $48 million dollars a year that they HAVE to spend on works of art,but they do very well indeed.The next glorious exhibit (and long Line wait )was the Picasso. Extraordinary!! The work i adored was the iron Goat made of buckets and bolts,screws and door nobs and any other steel/iron object Picasso rooted out of the detritus in his garage. I laughed my head off with delight when i saw the goat and the suspicious eyes stared,not getting the joke. Picasso obviously had a huge sense to humor and was probably laughing along with me. We inspected all of his girl friends and mistresses,from the height of his skills to the canvasses his family encouraged him to create after they calculated death taxes with horror. The permanent collection is also very prestigious Modigliani with the strange sgraffito eyes and sensuous lines was a treat worth millions and many others. access to LACMA is free once a month on the second Tuesday. There is a live music event every Friday evening( Jazz) which is also free in the fore court You can buy wine and food at the event and there is seating with tables. If you are into museums ,annual membership is the way to go. If you have something you have an idea is historic or otherwise valuable you can write in and ask for a meeting with a curator at no charge. . The SHOP is big and varied with tons of art publications, and amusing pottery/glazed animals with cheeky expressions. Have fun+lunch..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7453DTmarkk

40,Best Art Museum in LOS ANGELES - Wish it was free all the time,"The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is the best art museum in Los Angeles. Great exhibits - the grounds are interesting too - it is adjacent to the La Brea Tar Pits and the Japanese Pavillion.There is a permanent collection as well as modern collections, traveling collections, photography collections and whatever they feel is relevant - recently Diana von Furstenberg had a retrospective there.The only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is that the museum's permanent collection is great but not as deep as other art museums in the country.The one negative is it is very expensive to visit - $15 each person and more if there is a special exhibit.That said, the second Tuesday of every month is free admission to all - so that would be the best time to visit.There is a restaurant, cafe and cafeteria on the premises. Be prepared to walk as the grounds are fairly large.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123DRDEAN

Picasso, Monet, Degas, Rembrandt, Warhol, and other greats grace these walls.My favorite part by far--and the most moving part--was the Noah Purifoy collection in the Contemporary Art building. His pieces ""Hanging Tree"" and ""Strange Fruit"" have to be the two most poignant pieces of modern art that I have ever witnessed.We were there for three hours and saw about 3/5s of the content, while moving at a pretty rapid pace. A seriously amazing collection and the underground parking is convenient. We arrived at 10 when it opened and it didn't get morbidly busy until we were on our way out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HopeGracePeace

50,Lots of Great Art.,"LACMA is a very large museum in multiple separate buildings on multiple floors. Some buildings are quite old and confusing to the flow. There are plans to tear down older buildings and build a giant building that looks like a black blob/tar pit. The new ones are specific like Japanese art or contemporary. The art inside is quality from Asian, American, Latin, to European, and ancient Egyptian. Takes more than 3 hours. The art outside like the lights and rock are impressive. Free entrance every 2nd Tuesday and free for LA County residents from 3pm to close Mon-Fri (with LAC Identification). Views from the top floor of the Contemporary museum is really nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoseWasHere
50,Superb museum,"We visited LACMA without knowing what we would face. And we are totally delighted. The museum is really huge and holds many of the most trendy and classic works of many artist. But the exhibitions go beyond paintings and sculpture. You can find artifacts of ancient civilizations, videos depicting the body and the environment or the astonishing metropolis which moves dozens of cars through the scale city, reminding you of your childhood.The prices are really good and the staff is friendly. This is a must for every tourist visiting L.A.P.S. You can follow LACMA on snapchat for fun posts about art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarianoN_11

The museum is really great, instead of being only one building, it has many, each one with one kind of art. Some exhibitions are in constant renewal. I really liked that any word in the paintings are translated to english, which in many museums don't do, and it's really great cause you get to know more about the painting. There is a yellow walk through thin tubes exhibition and it's really fun, you must try it, here's the pic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933karlisg

There are numerous, different exhibits at the museum. The exhibit that I truly enjoyed was the Larry Sultan exhibit that was a series of photographs of his parents. I usually don't take photos of exhibits in art museums but I noticed that the workers allowed photography on some exhibits. I think it would be polite to ask someone before taking photographs before you do take them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piarod
40,Terrific museum,"This was another surprise in LA, a city I'd never associated with great art collections. The museum has a wonderful collection of art, covering the entire spectrum of pre-Christian statues to modern pop art, with an impressive collection of impressionists. Huge collection of Picassos and Monets. Our young kids enjoyed a painting room at the Boone Children's Gallery. The staff at the Boone were particularly good. The only reason to take away one star is that staff in some of the galleries were quite rude.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripasucks

50,ONE of my favourites for modern art,"I loved this museum and I am a museum junkie. There are great examples of modern artists, including Lichtenstein and Picasso, Warhol and Mondrian...and the design of the museum itself is just lovely. Take a walk up a few flights of floating stairs, ride in a GIANT elevator that will make you feel tiny, climb a spiral to ancient Japan. This is a BIG space so allow yourself some time to have a look around. Stop for a craft beer. The gift shop is tiny so don't get your hopes up but there are a few kitschy things you will come away with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vee33Mag

We were only able to see 3 buildings out of 6 and we went around like speedy gonzaleses which was a pity. But we were so glad we came.For us Pacific art and the art of the Americas were the stars of our visit as we don't have a chance of meeting this art in our country.We were sorry that we did not have enough time to see Japanese art building.

Went to the Asian building and then to the art gallery. The paintings from the periods were amazing and you can see them up close to view the details. I could have spent another 2 days looking around. When you go keep that in find. A great history lesson in viewing all the items. They also have a good restaurant on site for quick food and service.

50,Enviably expansive art collection showcases LA at its finest,"I wish I could tell you I had a grand esoteric reason for coming to the LACMA, but no, I don't. I just happened to see Chris Burden's splendid art installation, ""Urban Light"" (2008) in a movie, ""No Strings Attached"". It consists of 202 antique, cast-iron street lights were painted a uniform gray and set up in a grid pattern that emulates a forest. Director Ivan Reitman must have thought so because he had Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher have one of those silly, only-in-rom-com-land arguments amid the lights. Ever since I saw that scene four years ago, I wanted to see those lights up close, and they didn't disappoint. My partner and I decided to come here before heading out to the beach for the 4th of July.Considering how expansive the collection is here, the largest on the West Coast, I was surprised it wasn't more crowded for a holiday weekend. Admission is $15 for non-members who aren't residents of LA county, a paltry price for their more than 120,000 works. We spent much of our time in the Ahmanson building where the modern art collection is housed. there were works from Chagall, Matisse, Rothko and Warhol among many others. Walking out to the central courtyard, we discovered the Pavilion for Japanese Art, a wavy-curvy building with modern takes on rice paper panels and cylindrical towers that features artifacts from four millenniums.A detour into the La Brea Tar Pits, not the tar pits themselves but the walkways that surround them, eventually led us back to the grounds of the LACMA where we were taken in by Michael Heizer's large-scale sculpture, ""Levitated Mass"" (2012), wherein a 340-ton boulder was affixed above a concrete trench through which you can walk and pretend to be holding it depending on your vantage point. What we enjoyed about LACMA was just the sheer sense of space you can't possibly get in New York, Chicago or San Francisco in similar museum spaces. We plan to return when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences opens their film museum in the old May Co. building next year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ed_Uyeshima

40,Too much modern art for my taste but a nice museum,"If you like modern art you will like this museum more than I did. I like the classical arts which there was a good selection of. The museum is nice although, much like all public bathrooms in the Los Angeles area, the bathrooms could use some work. I would have thought they would have been cleaner in a museum.

50,Friday night Jazz nights are great! Art is plentiful.,"The live music on Fridays is beautiful. The outdoor famously photographed streetlight exhibit is exhilarating. There are a lot of featured exhibits that change several times a year and parking underground is easy and convenient. Art ranges from modern to ancient. Good place to bring children to educate them in the arts and a nice place for families, couples, friends to gather.TIP: L.A. County residents receive free general admission after 3 pm every weekday LACMA is open :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoxTheTrip
40,great museum,"of course, it's not the met in nyc or the art institute in chicago, but it is a very fine museum. food available, also a plethora of food trucks parked across the street. a very good location, the prehistoric tar pits are next to it, also a bird and reptile refuge. nice way to spend part of a day. i like museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler0991
30,Jazz on Friday night - summer time,It was the best music i have heard in along time. Top notch musicians playing jazz.There is some chair seating and some grass seating and some cafe seating. We probably should have gotten there earlier to get a better seat but did for the 2nd set.I never hear music like this in Santa Monica so it was truly a treat to hear fabulous music. Loved it. Parking is there in several lots. People picnic or can eat there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73helenew
40,A wide range of art - Contemporary to fine art,LACMA has a number of buildings and the art is mostly organized by building. There is something for everyone I have taken high school students here for a field trip and everyone found some piece that struck them. There is plenty of sitting space in between . The only negative is you have to pay for parking and pay entrance fee. If you are a Bank of America customer you can get in free the first weekend of the month Another plus is on weekdays there are food trucks across the street on Wilshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mctrvl
40,Center your Mid-Wilshire trip on LACMA,"Today's trip was all about enjoying the surroundings of LACMA. While I truly enjoy the exhibits here, it can be a little overwhelming. I wanted to take time to see the grounds, and enjoy other local attractions. I so appreciate how easy LACMA made it to do this. With plenty of parking downstairs, for a very reasonable fee (locally), I was able to spend time covering ground with a friend, rather than struggling to find parking, as I had done in the past. (I will be heading this way more often.) The art on display on the grounds was inspiring, and it was great to see families walking up to not just ""the rock"" or ""the lights"" , but all the works exhibited outside. The LACMA gift shop was open to the public, and we found many excuses to participate in the local economy. From here, it was a short walk to the La Brea Tar Pits, a most unusual shop in the Craft and Folk Art Museum, a piece of the Berlin Wall, a gathering of food trucks, and street entertainment. #satisfied",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christina_onthe_road
50,At least twice a year,"I try to visit every quarter, love their gallery, their location is great too and so is their cafe. I like that they have jazz on Fridays. A must is the Chris urban lights. Amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Missellen1
50,"Great Displays, Clean Buildings And Grounds","So much to see, so much to see! We spent quite a bit of time there and didn't make it past 3 floors of one building!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/farfisaj
50,Great Exhibition Space,"Spacious well presented exhibition space. European and Indian art is exceptionalBroad Hall was interesting, although not to my taste. Photography of Los Angeles exhibit is great. Great view of Hollywood hills from mezzanine.Cafe food quite good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derekw181
50,Immense,"In a city well served by attractions and museums this has to be at the top of the heap. We spent half a day here and visited half of one gallery ... and there are about five depending on whether you count temporary exhibition space. And what a collection, the quality impressed as much as the quantity. Well laid out and with ample cafes, restaurants and sitting space. A bit of a trek from downtown - which is where we staying - but the Purple Line Metro Extension should make it much easier in time to come.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucienOSS
50,Great location inside and out,The exhibits in the galleries are beautiful. They range from ancient to modern art. The traveling exhibits are also amazing. The gardens and out door installations should not be missed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PunyS
40,Always worth a visit.,"I am a member so I visit often, there is always something interesting to see, they just made a Turrell exhibit permanent, the lamps at Wilshire always attract a crowd and the Ray's & Stark Bar & Restaurant is delicious!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbisbal
50,"Who knew, great museum downtown","Truly a pleasant surprise all the times to Los Angeles, never heard of this...was a rainy day (rare) so thought we'd kill some time. Rain or sun, a very interesting sight next to the La Brea Tar Pits. Asian art, current exhibits, classic collections, definitely worth a visit, at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gocathyl
40,A must-see in L.A.!,"We had been wanting to see the lamp post exhibit for some time and decided to make a day trip of it. There was so much more at this museum that caught our interest in addition to the perfect photo op of the Urban Light display. We enjoyed riding the freight elevator, the family photos of Sultan and other modern art displays such as the Metropolis II, junk art, and bronzed crows in the Broad Contemporary Art Museum. The price of admission was well worth it ($15 adult, 18 and under FREE). My teen enjoyed the time spent there and the photo op of the Levitated Mass :) We also enjoyed creating our own painting at the Boone's Children's Gallery!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellemR8471DI
50,Well-organised and helpful staff,What a great museum! The staff were really friendly and there were lots of different exhibitions to see. We enjoyed the Larry Sultan exhibition.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dewy79
50,LACMA Fun,Love all the lamp post in a row...so fun going all around trying to get the best shots and all. Worth the visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JannetteB_13
50,Top quality art museum,Top grade art museum. We were very impressed on the thoughtful way the exhibits were displayed. The range of art exhibited was select but wide. There was a good balance between historical and contemporary art. Plan on spending at least 1/2 day there - we spent 5 hours and did not cover the full museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/971rickig
50,Great fun for the entire family,"Not much to dislike. It's a laid back environment. Great for even small children. Lots of places to sit and chat, eat and drink with friends and family. There is a place where the kids can paint but it was closed by the time we hit that activity around 5 pm on a Sunday. Latin Jazz Festival going on so that added to the atmosphere. Not crowded compared to other venues but it could be that the open design and easy traffic flow contributed to that peacefull atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donna27272015
40,Worth a visit if you like art museums.,"If you go to LACMA, you might as well go to the Tar Pits & Peterson, too. Parking is lot only & the traffic sucks, so arrive early! Worth doing once if you're in L.A. & have the time, but I wouldn't say it's a ""must see"" if you time in L.A. is limited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332marleneh
50,Something for everyone,This art museum is a collection of several buildings containing a wide range of art from time periods and locations around the globe. I spent most of my time in the gallery containing European art including impressionists and cubists. There was a nice gallery of polynesian art in the same building. I also spent time in the modern art building and especially enjoyed the exhibit of Ed Moses' art. The buildings are connected by covered walkways and courtyards with places to sit and enjoy food from small cafes. It is easy to spend a long afternoon enjoying this museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoAlong2
50,Great place for hanging one afternoon!,"Definitely an interesting walk. The museum features some of the most interesting and random stuffs I have seen. If you are a photography enthusiast, this is the place to go with a couple of your friend and get some amazing pictures, starting from the streetlights all the way to the huge rock at the back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddypartyrock
50,LACMA and James Turrells Ganzfeld Experiment,"If you happen to be in LA the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is a must see museum. Moreso for the Ganzfeld Experience exhibit which is now happily permanent.This exhibit is an absolutely MUST SEE exhibit. We saw it in May this year and we were thrilled and amazed by it. Ganzfeld is a German word to describe a total loss of death perception. Describing the experience is far beyond my ability as a writer but if you see it you will most likely be amazed and even stunned by the power of it.It is necessary to book a time slot for this room but it is included in the admission price. The reason for the reservation is that only 6 or so people are allowed in at any one time. This adds to the enjoyment of viewing it.By the way we were staying in W. LA and had a rental car but we decide to take Uber to the museum and back. In LA Uber offers Uber ""pool"" which is a very low cost way to get around if you don't want to drive or if you'll be drinking. The way it works is that you my (or may not) share the ride with another rider. We took it to the museum and back for about $8. which considering that the parking there is $10 is a pretty good deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronricho
50,Beautiful museum!,"From the iconic entrance (streetlights repurposed as a sculpture) to the regular installations to the special exhibits, this is the best of Los Angeles! The cafe/bar is a great place to rest your weary legs. You could spend a full day here, or stop in to see what piques your interest (get a pass that let's you visit time and time again).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tenighir
40,What a great Museum,"We visited here on the final day of our stay and were disappointed with our planning. We should have allowed more time to discover and enjoy this establishment in all its glory.For starters the modern collection of buildings is interesting and varied in their design yet they appear to sit comfortably on the block. We also enjoyed the upfront street light sculpture. Did t have time to explore the other outdoor sculptures in the garden.Because we were constrained by time, we choose to do two tours with volunteer guides and were not disappointed.We also enjoyed a delicious light lunch in the Cafe.We would return there without hesitation anytime we are in this city again.Well recommended, but allow several hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763lynettew
50,A must!,"Wonderful German expressionist exhibition, fantastic and friendly. Interesting gift shop, great book selection and many purchases made. A must for all art lovers/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twins021
30,Beware: closes at 5 on Thursdays,"The architecture is stunning and the outdoor sculptures are breathtaking. However, the complex closes at 5 on Thursdays, which I did not know, and I had arrived at 4. I was asked to leave the outdoor sculpture area -- I wasn't even in the galleries so I did not get to see the interiors at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/792laurencer
40,It was nice,"The light posts out side were neat, the modern part of the museum... I just didn't get at all. Finally saw some Monet etc made it worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brandiok
50,Happy 50th Birthday LACMA,"I spent the day at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art yesterday. As a member, I try to get there several times a year to see the fascinating variety of exhibits that a world-class museum such as LACMA attracts. The Noah Purifoy ""Junk Dada"" exhibit was noteworthy and the 50 for 50, gifts that have been donated to the museum over its life was an eclectic mix of traditional, modern, and video art. Enjoy the grounds and the ""tar pits,"" the spectacular Levitated Mass, and have lunch outside at the LACMA cafe to enjoy the Calder mobile as it turns gently with the breeze. Altogether a delightful day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/961vickis
30,Missed out on James Turrell,"Always visit when in L.A. Lots of Modern Art and installations.Was very disappointed the ticket office did not tell us there was a James Turrell installation and when we arrived to view it, we were told we had to book at ticket office!! Not enough time to go back to ticket sales, so we missed it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbarajano
40,LACMA does modern better,"I tend to think that LA museums do modern art better than other museums I've visited in the U.S. I know it's the association of LA with trending art and celebrity culture. It also has to do with the cultural diversity of artists in the area.LACMA has everything to like: good exhibits, good permanent art, good contemporary art. Masterpieces here and there.This particular trip was boosted by the celebration of 50 years of LACMA exhibit with a work from each of the years and 50 more contributed by contemporary artists. The Hudson River School exhibit was a reminder of the incredible craftsmanship of those artists and their romantic optimism, or might that be romantic fakery? There's a lot of both.Check out the architecture as well, including the Japanese Pavilion (name?). The interior feels like the inside of a plush box. The spiral ramp, with lucite banisters, echo the Guggenheim in NY.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mindkandy
50,Don't Miss if you have time!,"Outstanding collection! Great tours. If you're into art, make time to spend a day here. You won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clearbrook6
50,Good museum with appealing layout,"LACMA is a very pleasant place, a handsome set of buildings, a very good cafe/restaurant, and some appealing exhibits. Although there are galleries with classic art, Egyptian artifacts, traditional museum offerings, we spent our time looking at some of the more unusual and modern things. In this case, there was an exhibition of Junk Dada art, some very creative and amusing pieces using, well, junk, in a very impressive way: a last supper setting made of sardine cans; a woman with a mop for hair hanging out the wash, you get the idea. But don't think it isn't art. You will come away with an appreciation for what a truly creative artist can see in ordinary things. We had a lot of fun and also a delicious meal at the restaurant (not cafeteria).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanBerkoG
40,Great seat of art in the heart of LA,"Actually a museum complex composed of several separate buildings it houses numerous works of art as well as several food establishments,which makes it a bit overwhelming.The best place to start is at the Ahmanson Building which houses the most number of pieces...from works of the European masters such as; Picaso, Monet and Renoir, just to name a few, to various art forms from the Ancient World and Asia. It will be no small feat to finish, as this building alone has 4 floors!Dont forget to make time for the other venues, see eye popping modern works at the Broad Contemporary Art Museum to special exhibits at the Resnick Pavillion.If you want to maximize your trip check out their website to plan ahead,they have free wifi and an app one can download to aid in going around the place,several free walking tours are also scheduled within the day...general admission is free every second Tuesday of the month,one just needs to give a minimal donation.Bring your cameras as picture taking is allowed in most areas,use comfortable walking shoes and make it a whole day affair.In case one plans to bring kids it might be good to know that just beside the complex is the famous La Brea Tar Pits.Lastly, do not forget to take your pictures I front of the iconic Urban Light along Wilshire Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pam22S
50,A Must!,"Interested in art? How can you visit or live in Los Angeles without spending time at LACMA? The permanent collections are terrific and there are always wonderful special exhibits to see. On my most recent visit, I particularly enjoyed the Larry Sultan photography exhibit. Many slice of life large prints of 60s life left me grinning ear to ear. Loved it. There are also some very powerful images in the Islamic Art Now display. LACMA also has wonderful free concerts on the weekends. Hang out for jazz and Latin sounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
50,Makes art accessible to all types of people and personalities,Recently I visited LACMA while visiting from the East Coast and found the collection extremely varied and interesting. I used to work in art museums and remember it was hard to come up with collections that appealed to a wide range of people and personalities. I believe LACMA achieved this and has something for every age and calling! I spent most of my time in the building for art of the Americas but know I just scratched the surface of what this museum has to offer. The most fun I had was interacting with the sculptures in the garden around the museum. I loved the display of Rodin sculptures especially.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMLove226
50,A must if visiting LA,Wonderful museum in a very nice area in LA. The collections are very interesting as well as the museum architecture.It is nicely organized which makes the visit easy and pleasant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UgeA_12
50,Large museum!,"LACMA was more than I bargained for. There were multiple buildings housing different exhibitions, from Degas to Warhol, a large variety. I spent around 3 hours going to all of the exhibitions allowed on general admission (which is all of them, with exception to one or two areas), It was time very well-spent! When visiting LA, LACMA is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A117H
50,Better than I expected,"My expectations were a little lower because it's a 'county' museum. Had only 3 hours to spend and was more than pleasantly surprised. It was a Monday and I was originally hoping to go to the Getty. It was closed. But all said, I was glad because I wouldn't have gone to LACMA if Getty hadn't been closed. Had some wonderful Matisse and Monet and my favorite, Chagall. Definitely worth the time and money. Count me as impressed. GO!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dalpokes
50,Great art and a wonderful complex,"We happened to go on the second Tuesday of the month, which is a free day! There are multiple buildings with various exhibits. Way too much to see in one day, but fun to explore and find what you like to see. The grounds are really nice, with great outdoor places to relax and people watch. You can also walk next door to the La Brea tar pits. Also lots of good places to eat in the area. We often travel and go to art museums in other cities and now wonder why we have not been exploring this amazing place in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G5205CPsteves
50,A great place to spend a day!,"What a wonderful place to visit. Sooo many exhibits, easy access and they accept other out of state Museum memberships.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mukilteomike44
40,Worth a trip,"Came to LACMA few times, the best time to come is in the late hours prior to closing. Walk outside before going in. Lights is pretty at night. Too much to see inside and out including the Brea Pit and the other museum around it. Kids really liked it. Parking is little problem here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sugaylange
40,A great place to visit,"As a long time member I was reminded that I have never rally reviewed the museum. My family and I have been going there 6-8 times a year since the early 90's. It's a wonderful place to spend a few hours and occasionally has spectacular exhibitions. They tend to not go for the ultra splashy, expensive ""shows"" such as Pompeii and the Dead Sea Scrolls at another local museum for instance. We particularly like the Modern Art section of the museum. Given the many planned updates I won't slam the older buildings as they are going to be replaced. The art is good, the building not so much. LACMA isn't on the level of the great European museums for instance but it's well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StudioCityMark
50,Nice Place to visit,"Beautiful Urban Lights display if you go at night beautiful pictures :), also the museum is nice and easy to park close to walk to the tar pits after",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JVDreamBig
40,"My second visit, still enjoyed it","This was my second visit to LACMA, I was there in September '13 and came back September '14. On my former visit I became obsessed with James Turrell's work and came back to one of his exhibits on the latter visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hamada217
40,I have been to the Museum Manny Times,There is much to see in this County Museum in Los Angeles From the outside the old Streets Lights were install by a local artist and people love to see them. They are more enticing in the evening when they are all lit.There is a move to redo the whole facility with a strange design that will have a bridge from one side of the street (Wilshire Blvd) to the otherside. I am not an enthusiat but the interior of buildings need to modernized. However all this being said is the permenant collection and the traveling exhibits makes it worth your time in spending hours in the Museum.The most inetesting thing is on the grounds is the La Brea Tar Pits ( which means Tar Pits Tar Pits) So one can visit the Page Museum to hear about the oil and tar that was under the ground and when Los Angeles was young Wilshire was covered by many oil wells. At the page one can see people cleaning the bones found in the tar pits from prehistoric mammals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineA705
50,fun and learn something new with every visit.,"I use to pick a museum every week when my children were small and take neighborhood kids during summer. Pack a lunch best cheap entertainment, keeps them amused. As an adult I love going with my husband beautiful museum very art deco style. Sit in the rose garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spfeismom
50,Lots of exhibits,"Saw paintings by picasso, mondrian etc. Visit the modern art gallery if you have time.You need a day or two to visit the whole place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joycea278
50,A Special Place………..,A wide variety of art in many buildings. Plan to spend several hours here -there is so much to see. The grounds are beautiful too. Stopped for a glass of wine and appetizer in between buildings to take a break. Looking forward to going back on our next visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharyln2014
40,Mid-Century & Modern Art,LAMOA is light & airy compared to the Philadelphia Museum of Art or MOMA; they put a lot of wall between the exhibits. We enjoyed the kinetic sculptures in the garden as well as the pond.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GailCooks
50,Interesting exhibits,Too much to see in just a few hours. Went to the tar pits and thru two of the museums Could spend a whole day there easily.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tennbrad

There's almost always people who are here, too, which can make it hard to take pictures without other people in the background!There is street parking and sometimes after a certain time, parking is free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c00kyc
30,Disappointed.,"Huge disappointment when I went there since the main urban light exhibit was under big construction. Place's closed so we could only take pictures surrounding it. BUT, still a beauty you cannot miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DinnaMargaretha
50,A must if you like art,Great museum. Great public places. Excellent programming. Excellent art from early to contemporary. I go a few times a year and love it every time. Jazz weekends are fantastic. Food is good too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/urbancaroline

40,Art on a Grand Scale,"I hadn't been to LACMA in years and could not believe how it had grown. We went specifically for the Japanese Pavilion this time. It is a beautiful building but the way the walls and railings are set up, one can't get close enough to the art to really see it. For lunch, skip the museum restaurant and head across the street where a line of multi-ethnic food trucks await.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffcC5003KM
40,Awesome rock.,This is a really impressive place. I just wish we had had more time to look around. We parked at the tar pits and just walked through. Really nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elwood_Seattle
50,A Wonderful Art Museum Cultural Spot,"I lived in New York City for 20 years, and traveled extensively in Europe going to some of the top Museums in the world. When I first came to LA, I couldn't find a museum that appealed to me like the Met in New York. One day I did the James Turrell special exhibit at LACMA, and loved the museum. I became a member. There is just so much to see here with different wings exhibiting different styles of art. My favorite is of course the Masters of the Renaissance, & Modern Art especially Impressionist. I found a very well stocked collection here. The Urban Light fixture exhibit is at one of the entrances to LACMA & is fun to walk through and photograph. LACMA has a walk through art sculpture garden, a Japanese Pavillion, and is right next door the the La Brea Tar Pits Museum. This made me giggle. There is this insane rock sculpture outside that is balancing between two points, it is a thrill to walk under it. LACMA is located on Museum Row near The Grove, and is very much worth going to. I go several time s year. Weekends are busy...parking is in an underground structure. It does have a fee to get in, about $12 and extra for special exhibits. Membership does have it's perks plus it supports having a great museum like this. You must go, if you haven't. There are tons of places to eat by the Museum & it is not far from The Grove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/651CathyA
50,Exhibits not to be missed,"Every time we come to LACMA, there is something new and wonderful to see, from the Turrell Space, to the city of moving cars and trucks, to the famous Street Lights or the spaghetti straps, and more! Skip the big rock, though. It's just a rock.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanfordkuninrubin
50,One of the best museums EVER!,"Soo much to see here! Such a wonderful weekend experience! Loved it so much we ended up going again the next day! If it's still there, the Turrell experience is a must. Such a great museum for a great price as well! Would definitely recommend for all occasions! As for parking, there's a garage for $12 a day, but the meters along the block are $1 per hour, and across the street are spaces for FREE (besides I believe Tuesdays)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imtrulytiff
50,Great photos ops,We didn't get a chance to inside because it was closed but you can still take pictures outside with the Urban Lights exhibit or go around the back to the big rock and you can also walk around to the tar pits. All for free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlj2k
50,Get Some Culture,"It has been wonderful watching this museum expand and improve over the past 40 years. The collections are large and varied. It will be impossible to see everything in one visit, so pick the kind of art that interests you most and focus on that. This past visit we spent time watching Metropolis II by Chris Burden in BCAM. This is not art in the traditional sense as you watch hundreds of hot wheels race through a fanciful city. It is, however, mesmerizing. Chris was also the artist behind ""Urban Light"", the collection of street lights at the entrance to the museum that has become a tourist favorite for photographs. These are even more poignant with his recent passing.The museum can easily hold its own with all but the very most top tier of museums in the world in its permanent collection, and mounts large and impressive exhibits with art from all over the world on a regular basis. What you see this month may be changed out to something new next month.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VNahmias
50,Amazing Exhibits!!!,My husband and I love going to LACMA. We have been members for many years now and go to the museum at least once a month. There is always something new to see and they even have jazz in the summer on the weekends in the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jet7777

50,Great family friendly museum,"Great way to spend a day. With multiple buildings, indoor and outdoor space, a cafe and food truck options, LACMA balances a cultural experience with more options and rooms for fun. LACMA has an interactive art room and lawns for the kids to run around in. City Lights allows you to play and hide among its posts and Metropolis is a moving art piece featuring hundreds of matchbox cars. There are treasures of paintings and sculptures, rotating exhibits, traditional and modern. On top of it, they have good coffee and people watching is excellent. This is a great couples date place apparently.There is street parking (free if you're lucky, metered if not) or you can park in the lot, which has a convenient elevator to the plaza.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuanneL

30,Collection of Collections...not a museum,Extraordinary individual collections housed in purpose built buildings and pavilions. Each new donor has created their own legacy mausoleum...and brought their tastes with them. Some are magnificent...others are pretty miserable....if you like German inter-war allegory...eek.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/880alexanderb
50,The best attraction in Los Angeles,"The people at LACMA have done a great job of creating an experience fit for all ages and for the novice art appreciator to the advanced art critic. You will find the iconic lamps out front (free if you don't want to pay admission) and the Metropolis II model car active sculpture which everybody likes. You probably can't see it all in a day. The exhibits are changing and are gathered into buildings featuring Japanese, Korean, German Expressionism, Contemporary and other art styles. When I visited recently the Japanese building held a great exhibit on Tea Bowls by Raku ( a generation of tea bowl artists) and a stunningly intricate set of miniatures in their Neshuke exhibit. They also had a great exhibit on american art through the years called Faces of America and a special alcove devoted to Louise Nevelson. The James Turrell light installation is breath taking and the scupture Levitation is surreal and real at once. If you are an LA County resident admission is free after 3. Fridays they have cheap jazz concerts. On premise food is also better than expected. Just go with no fixed agenda and explore!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeY892
40,LACMA's 50th Anniversary definitely worth the visit!,"I was fortunate enough to attend on their 50th anniversary free admission day. My 3rd visit over the years and always an enjoyable visit. Several buildings each with a different region and era of art to experience. Nice, diverse collection. Well worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brayette
50,An amazing collection of art!,"The artwork was amazing, You get to see tons of art from the old mesoamericans civilizations to Ancient Egypt to even the Far East. There's a little bit of everything. Just don't miss the famous street lamps installation, every body is taking selfies there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chouj652
40,"Good art collection, but not great","They have some very nice special exhibits from time to time that are free for members of art museum. In our last visit to LACMA, my wife was disappointed that they are no longer displaying one of her favorite paintings The Baptism by Julius Stewart in the American collection. They have a very comprehensive collection of art that is very good, but not great in any one area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidfromLaPalma
50,Go for a Visit Before Everything Gets Torn Down,"LACMA is celebrating its 50th Anniversary with a misguided newly design space which will tear down the iconic old gallery spaces. So if you've always wanted to go, do it before it's ruined. Also, the jazz series on Fridays evenings is a blast and the Latin music on Sat afternoons is loads of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelaFoodTravelGuru
50,IMPRESSIVE,An ideal place for art lovers. It is built in a very large area. There are different sections which very charming. It is recommended to assingn a half day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/805levents
40,Nice place to see some interesting installation in Los Angeles.,"I have mixed feelings about LACMA- it could be so much more but can't compare to NYC met or Chicago Art Institute, For a new city LA is trying hard to have something that can provide permanent art and new exhibitions. I found the cost to see speccial exhibits quite high. Loved the cafes and coffee available to visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/450juditha
50,excellent!,"So many things to see! this is a very complete museum with a big variety of things to see and/or do. I totally recommend it but go with plenty of time, since you will probably need it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriac892
50,One of my favorites!,Selection of ongoing exhibits is good with an excellent variety. Visiting exhibits are sometimes outstanding. Friday's have extended hours. You can check these out on line. I have visited many times and am always ready to go back for more. Reasonably priced entry price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janepI9693UV
50,Interesting museum with an extensive and varied collection,"I wasn't sure what to expect on a recent visit to LACMA and was pleasantly surprised. The museum complex is quite large, with the art spread out in various buildings. I would definitely recommend getting a map and making a plan for your visit from the start. The Japanese galleries were a highlight simply for their unique architecture, although the exhibit on view was somewhat underwhelming. I particularly enjoyed some of the large format works in the contemporary art section, as well as the sculptures outdoors. LACMA has something for everyone since the exhibits include art from a wide range of time periods and regions. I also stopped for coffee at the main museum cafe and was quite impressed by the quality of the coffee and food on offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephandgio_m
50,An oasis of art and culture in an often jaded land.,Loved the layout and design of the museum and great variety of collections. The landscaping is as lush as some of the visitors are dressed. The free Friday Evening Jazz Concerts attracted an appreciative and animated crowd. Wonderful setting for a date or a picnic where you can relax at cafe style tables or on the lawn. BYOB or buy it right there. Parking is conveiently located in a safe lot across the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/230kathleenr
50,Worth the visit just for the architecture,One of my favorite places (along with the Getty and Santa Monica) during a visit in Spring 2015. A tip: don't miss the James Turrell installation - it would be easy not notice. You have to sign up for timed entry where you buy tickets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ives
50,Go Visit LACMA on Fridays (Extended Hours into PM),"When I used to go to LA on business, I used to always go to LACMA on Friday evenings, esp. In the summer. I loved wandering around and a different, after-work crowd shows up in their work attire, hanging out in the patio. You can purchase a glass of wine like many people do. I love their cafeteria where the food is pretty good! Evenings at LACMA are relaxing and you can pace yourself with the permanent and special exhibitions.I regret that the permanent exhibit of the old garage, is no longer at the museum. I used to step into this old garage with a tool shed and old car and imagine being back in time as a youth, decades ago. It had old music playing, too. This realistic exhibit is what drew me back to LACMA year after year, whenever I was in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SacMax
50,Best art museum in SoCal,I've been to a tons of art musuems and LACMA is pretty much up there. You get to see tons of art from the old mesoamericans civilizations to Ancient Egypt to even the Far East. There's a little bit of everything. The facilities are top-notched as well. Recommended for those art enthusiasts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattMarquez
40,Art in its right place,"The Museum occupies an entire city block. The new wing by Renzo Piano is the last addition to the ensemble, an austere building, that forms an entry plaza with the original building, and very much in the same tone. You enter through the ""Urban Light"" art installation by Chris Burden, a feature of L. A. these days. The permanent exhibition of contemporary art in this wing shows an array of new artists that really made me think about what art means these days. Some pieces were really great. There was a Larry Sultan photography retrospective in the upper floor, some of it very interesting, some not so much. The Museum experience is very nuanced and diverse, some good, some bad, some average, but it is also totally L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pablogui56
40,Top Museum and free on tuesday,"World class museum with a deep collection of Pre Columbian pottery, and Islamic art. Very light (when compared to the Met) in Impressionists and other areas....but very good and world class in their areas of expertise. Definitely worth a visit. Look for the parking lot which is at Fairfax and Wilshire. Hard to find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesM370
50,An amazing collectio of art,"The artwork was amazing, from the 1300's to more modern art - very impressive and outstanding. However, I feel there should be more security in each room - too many valuables to be left ""alone"" :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eternal411
50,Beautiful Museum,"Right next door to the La Brea Tar Pits, we had a lovely afternoon learning about the history of LA, and then viewing the extensive collections at the art museum. It is a real turning point when your teenager says that the art museum is the place he wants to spend his day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scubagayle30196
50,Photo spot,Drove past here several times and decided to stop in the day then in the night when the lamps where lit up its neat to see all the different styles of lampposts from years back great place to take some real neat 1 of a kind pictures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luna6373
40,I didn't go inside but the exterior art was free and fun!,"So, being poor-ish on my trip, and also time constrained, I wasn't able to go inside for the full museum experience. However, after walking through the LaBrea Park and seeing the free tarpits sites, we walked by the museum. There are several free art installations outside but here's where it gets good for FREE. Across from the ticket counter are some red steps/stairs going up a few floors. Go up these. On the top landing is a beautiful view of the Hollywood sign and LA. Now, go inside the doors right there. No, you aren't stealing the museum. Go straight through the doors and there is a big elevator. It is HUGE! The biggest elevator EVER. You can ride it down and then thats the free ride. Silly but the elevator is really impressive. Okay, now across the street there are 2 other installations. One looks like a valet kiosk. The other is a chunk of the Berlin Wall.You are welcome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ikirol
40,LACMA - getting there.,"LACMA has or should I say had great potential. LA has some of the biggest art collectors in the world. The wealth centered here makes for great collection. LACMA has some of them but has lost some of the lately. The complex has great works and wonderful touring shows. It is also a ""town square"" where you gather for a cocktail or a food truck lunch. It is a great landscape in the middle of the city offering cool grass and walks. But the art can be hit or miss - so check out what the shows are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266jerryp
50,Perfect museum,"Great museum, amazing exhibitions. Very open environment. We went for Easter to the Museum and visit Metropolis 2, the urban light and the rock. Kids had so much fun. By the way, they have an amazing restaurant ""Rays"" in the center court. Inventive food with great service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/175benh
50,Stellar Collection in an open air environment,This is a great place for families because of the wide open spaces. We only saw 30% of the collection and were impressed. Love the Americas collection the best. Great outdoor interactive exhibits for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tfizzle
40,Really great place,Well worth a visit. It is very extensive and covers a wide range of art and periods. It is of interest to all in the family. It is good also to get out of the sun and have a slower pace while visiting LA. It is not free though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/expatEdinburgh
50,Excelent collection!,"The permanent collection is worth it, you can see art even before you go in, don't miss the famous street lamps installation, every body is taking selfies there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliciaBoy
50,One of the best; often free access,"Enough art to satisfy anyone (check out the options before you start walking around); free evenings, occasional days (check website). Parking a bit of a challenge",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/equally
50,LACMA is the Best,"The place is fantastic. I really loved how the Greco-Roman art was integrated with other artwork that was inspired by it. Every room had something astonishingly cool and beautiful. The outdoor art was wonderful. The only complaint I have is that there was too much to see, and I experienced true art fatigue -- but that's a wonderful thing in an art museum. And I loved how it was next to the La Brea Tar Pits, and all the great food carts across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mongo2015
50,Plan Your Visit (If you can),"First - if you have Netflix, make sure you watch Levitated Mass - we only ""happened upon it"" because we parked on the street (plenty of 4 hour metered parking when we visited). And it is very cool! Second, plan your visit in advance, if you can. This a BIG museum with rotating major exhibits. And while there is OK info about the collection on the website, there is no floor plan so you must rely on devising a plan once you arrive. Unfortunately, we got no help at the info desk - we were just handed a map. We actually skipped the Hudson River School exhibition because we had just visited the Church and Cole studios in the fall but still did not have enough time in our 3 hour visit. Simply put, we spent too much time wandering and back-tracking because there is so much that's worthwhile AND unique in this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pcyork
50,adults are free with child!,"Our whole family managed to get in free when we signed up our 2 small kids with their NexGen program, which was a bonus (and we don't even live in the USA!). Lovely exhibits with great variety, loved the toy cars ""Metropolis II"". Wonderful cafe food as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/936darcyz
30,Big Complex-- Lots to see,"The exhibits at LACMA are spread out over several buildings. It's probably a challenge to see all the artwork in one day. I didn't-- chose just two buildings to see on our visit and it was enough for me. Went to the Ahmanson Building and the Broad Contemporary Art Museum. Been to many contemporary art museum, I'd say these two buildings housed your average exhibit-- nothing too exciting. I do like the latter building and its oversized elevator and view of the Hollywood sign.I wished to see the Hollywood Costumes exhibit but I couldn't find it and it was another admission ticket, and so I quickly abandoned that plan. If you can find a discounted rate to go to the LACMA, that would be great value. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kk_vacayMN
40,some amazing exhibitions,The James Turrell perspective with colored light is mind boggling...had read abt his work and was THRILLED to try his immersive light envts...ending soon...very nice bar cafe very hip outside,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catvee1
50,Wonderful Museum,Loved the exhibits! The docents and security staff could not have been any nicer and helpful. Gift shop is pricey.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luv2travelkw
50,Almost too much to see,"You could spend several days seeing all the installations here. Loved the Deigo Rivera collection and Early South American display. Docents were very well informed, not stuffy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/917maureenw
40,Good museum--confusing layout,"Good museum with good rotating collections but nothing great. Special shows are usually better but at an additional cost to an already expensive visit. The Norton Simon, Getty, and Getty Villa are better choices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler1062
30,Handful of World Class Objects... But the Curating...,"Let me start by saying this is a lovely museum, but to go without any preconceived notions. It definitely does not live up to the hype... nor other LA museums for that matter.The museum definitely is not lacking in quality objects but throws in a lot of fluff, so be prepared to look past the grime. One of my biggest concerns with the museum is the layout and curating. The museum is spread out across multiple buildings and levels, which is fine, but the curating, even on a per room bases, is out dated. The overall feeling is to cram as many relatively connected, either by region, period, style etc, together and the pieces will convey the message. I usually wouldn't have a problem with this if the choice in pieces was extremely curated, cut the fat, there is no point in having two objects that show the same qualities, region, period, style etc, if one is spectacular and another is more moderate. With a museum of this size most viewers will not look at every piece, one by one, and be able to absorb it will. Tightly curate the objects, show the best example from each area, and the message would be more poignant.One of my favourite parts of the museum definitely has to be the James Turrell light room. Admission is free with your general admission ticket, but you do have to reserve a place at the ticket counter via an i-Pad. Its like walking into Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, the part with all white hazmat suits, very sterile and futuristic. When you enter the room your perception of depth and your overall surroundings are lost. Amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiferinLondon
50,Too much to see in one visit,"My family and I visited to see the Samurai Armor exhibit before it closed. This exhibit was excellent and worth the extra money. We also visited the permanent Japanese art exhibit, which was also outstanding. We'll be back for many future visits. It's also next to the Page Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longnex
50,The museum that keeps on giving...,I took over 2 hours to go through the contemporary exhibit and stroll around the grounds. The sculptures had me fixated...This is not see it all in one visit kind of place. Look forward to another visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardG310
50,Fabulous museum on Wilshire and Fairfax,"A visit to Los Angeles will not be completed without going to LACMA. The Museum gardens and outdoor cafes and restaurant are exquisite. The permanent collection is beautifully displayed in an environment conducive to delight in the artists expression of their feelings, culture, and everyday life. The Art of the Americas building is a journey to Pre-Columbian cultures, North America, South America, Central America as well as artists from the Caribbean islands.If you like Japanese, Korean or Chinese art you will be glad you choose LACMA!Children and adults alike will enjoy Metropolis as much as Urban Lights by Chris Burden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dresthercita
50,Wonderful spot for kids and adults to enjoy together,"Not only are there amazing art collections housed here, but good casual restaurants, fun areas for kids to explore and great jazz outside during the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psychjudy
50,make this a must see,LACMA has the beautiful quality art work. Always trying to do better and bring in traveling pieces to be displayed at their LA Venue. Take a day. Use the audio. Make sure to see the lessor know rooms - such gems can be found in them! Explore. Use the talents and knowledge of the docents! That's what they are there for. Enjoy. Don't go when you can not spend several hours there. Lots to see and do!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mecoh
30,"My Last Museum Was the Louvre, So I'm Spoiled","Here we are in a world-class city and I wanted this to be wonderful. It was okay. There were a few good Impressionist paintings in one room and a decent collection of European art in several rooms. There were also a few notable pop art pieces. In Los Angeles, I favor The Getty Museum and The Huntington, which both are standouts to me. The old May Company building is in development for a Hollywood museum, but that appears to be years in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edyrp

50,A Jewel in the middle of Wilshire Avenue,"LACMA is a collection of buildings that may not look like much from the outside, but the collection is varied, well-displayed, and very interesting. And they are not afraid to dedicate a large space to a single piece of art if it needs that -- The atmosphere is great, very urban and family friendly, and the collection, especially of contemporary and Japanese art, is extensive. And it is right next to the La Brea Tar Pits, a paleontological dream site to visit and well worth a couple of hours -- you can see scientists at work preparing fossils to add to the 5 million already extracted from this amazing place. Spend a full day and eat in the neighborhood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/483RichardC
50,Budgeted a couple of hours; stayed all day...,"...and still didn't see it all. Went on the 2nd Tuesday when it's free. You still have to get a ticket and you're asked to donate a buck. Well sure, one dollar? No problem. The whole layout seemed very friendly and inviting. We took two free tours where we learned a great deal from the expert docents. Pick and choose what you prefer to see; there's so much you won't get it all in.Parking tip: You can park for free all day on the north side of 6th street. Prohibited on Tuesdays from 8-10 am only. When entering from that side, be sure to check out Levitated Mass - a gigantic rock over an underpass. it's art, apparently.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucky_Eddie

40,Focused review on the Pavilion for Japanese Art; definitely stop in,"During my most recent visit I concentrated on the Pavilion for Japanese Art, so I’m going to review only that building here.First of all, the pavilion’s exterior and layout are vastly different from the rest of the campus. The pavilion opened in 1988; I remember the hoopla. The architecture (streamline moderne) really stood out at first, and it’s still looks highly stylized. My recommendation is to take the elevator up to the top floor to see whatever is featured, then just work your way down to the bottom. Give yourself about an hour to see everything.The top level gallery is the largest and it recently featured armor, weapons, Buddhist and Shinto sculpture, and various artifacts from long-ago periods. There is also a separate area that displays prints. The remainder of the museum is set up in “ramp gallery” style over six levels, where one uses sloped walkways (reminiscent of the Guggenheim, but far less expansive) to access the art on different tiers of the pavilion. The works on display consist mainly of large screens, panels and hanging scrolls. The lighting there is quite dim, probably to preserve the artwork.Off to one side on the plaza level is an installation of hundreds of netsuke … one of the best collections I’ve seen. Do not miss these! If you looked at each one for 30 seconds, you’d still be in there for hours. [Netsuke are tiny sculptures that helped secure little cases and tobacco pouches to the sash of men’s kimonos; the detail is amazing]Do venture outside a little. On the north side of the building there is a grassy area with some benches that allow one to see the La Brea Tar Pits area next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimL239
40,Loved the history and dinosaurs!,What a wonderful day trip it was and perfect for the kids too.My sister and I took the kids and spent the morning exploring and learning. The kids enjoyed seeing the exhibits as much as we did. Very family friendly and fun for people of all ages. Make sure you bring your camera!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaraM323
50,always worth a visit.,"Very well laid out. Great mix of contemporary and historical. Not too big but enough stuff for everyone. Special exhibits are always well chosen and broad in appeal. Kid friendly. A special shout out to the older African American woman who directed us to ""not miss the Veronese exhibit"" in the side room. Loved all the staff who seem to want to help you navigate the space. COuld use nicer more modern uniforms on staff!!!!The restaurants are good.

50,Best collection in LA,"By far the most expansive collection in town. We took two days to see it all but that included a few breaks outside, a side trip through the tar pits and some time just sitting in the sun outside for a bit. Great docent led tours both days. One on modern art was very informative. Glad we stopped in to see the Turrell light sculpture exhibit in its own area. Home of the Magritte ""This is not a pipe"" and some fine sculpture. So many things there I could not begin to list them all.We also had lunch at the cafe in the main courtyard and it was very tasty.I had a whole grain farro dish with pear, brocollini and goat cheese which I can recommend. My wife had a cheese plate that was OK.We also stopped in at the Hollywood Costume museum which was amusing for my wife but I thought they could have done something to improve the lighting to help people walk through the exhibition at the costume exhibition. Maybe something around the feet would allow people to walk easier?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miken655

50,Amazing collection,"There is so much to see here we felt like we only scratched the surface. We didn't pay to see any of the special exhibits, but the cost of admission to the regular collection was amply justified.

If you sign your children up for Nex Gen (a free program for under 18s at LACMA), each child gets to bring an adult in for free. Contemplating having more kids now (husband does not know this!), so I could get a whole village in for free.

I was subletting a room for about two weeks in the Miracle Mile area and discovered a lot more that LA has to offer as well. This museum is well endowed and pleasantly steeped in nature and greenery (a welcome departure from the vertical concrete and brick of New York museums) When you aren't walking through the exhibit halls you ca venture out to the decorative gardens or sit in the plazas and grab a coffee.I thoroughly enjoyed the Thomas Demand exhibit of sheer chaos aboard a cruise ship. Inspired by a storm in the south Pacific but created in Los Angeles, it stands as a clarion call for the need to restore a semblance of order in our minds when we are bombarded with haphazard imagery (or chairs, tables, etc.) and incessant mass-media messages.And by the way, I am thankful to Faith, who sublet her room to me while I as in town through subleasehub.com. Her advice and guidance on where to go and what to eat was priceless. Thanks again, Faith!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/681nird
30,Disappointing,"The admission price didn't include any of the exhibits we wanted to see. Even as seniors, general admission plus the two exhibits we wanted to see would have cost $45, and $60'withiut the senior discount.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karendX3471EP
30,Too many extra costs.,"It was a beautifully laid out museum, with well done lighting and room displays. Very disappointed about the additional high cost of $25.00 to see special exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyZ168
40,Great place to spend an afternoon,"I enjoyed my most recent visit to LACMA, especially some of the smaller, temporary exhibits. Make sure to stop at the cafe for lunch or just a glass of wine and a snack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsirin
20,Closed on a Wednesday,"The only significant Art Museum in the world which closes on a Wednesday!! Only explanation by very rude staff was ""it's our quietest day"" - well excuse me you do not open for your enjoyment. Join the club and close on Monday like all the best Museums!!No outdoor displays to satisfy when the place is closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carrotmuseum
50,Great Exhibits & Food Trucks outside for lunch,"This is a wonderful museum. The exhibits are first rate, both the permanent and the special exhibits. The museum is a fun way to wile away several hours. The food trucks that set up outside on the street are diverse - lots of goodies to choose from.The whole area is a delight, you can easily spend the day, or come back for more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geezegood
30,Collection Just OK,"The LACMA permanent collection is not worth making the trek for. If you're visiting LA, go to the Getty Museum instead, which in many ways is a far superior destination. LACMA does get some good visiting exhibitions, though. Go for those.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssperl
50,Worth a visit!,Wonderful experience..Also has an average restaurant & nice Jazz concerts on Fridays during the summer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeBTraveler
50,Make art not war!,"I come here often, sometimes for a quick look at a new exhibit or some times I spend several hours. There is always something great to look at, and if all fails, checking out Metropolis is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LocalLAtourguide

50,Great Museum Wonderful for Pure Art Lovers,"I like to take my kids here for a immersed Art Lesson. It's a wonderful museum. Be sure to go in the older building, upstairs to the Madonna & Child Floor. The modern art wing is great for younger kids. Tough to manage if you don't want to park in lot. But surrounded by park and Tar Pits. Great food trucks out front. Excellent educational museum. For field trips or Homeschoolers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buddhamom81
50,Great Collections,"A treasure trove of art galleries, with some great collections. A pretty good restaurant also. I have visited multiple times, for different purposes - to see a temporary exhibit, or a recently acquired impressionist collection, or a newly opened contemporary art gallery. I would not attempt to do everything in a single visit, but I would recommend that the visitor to LA should set aside two hours. There are free concerts some evenings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RNPSHP
50,Excellent Museum Complex,was in town for the Rose parade and had opportunity to visit and had a great experience. The people were very helpful - I asked them what was best to see in a few hours and they recommended three exhibits and will were very interesting. There are multiple museums you can access with your ticket so check out what you want to see and then plan your day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9435RIdavidm
50,Must see,"Great museum with lots of galleries to view. Although our youngest child is 17, we all enjoyed the racing car sculpture with hundreds of cars moving around the course. Any child (and adult) will enjoy this. Lots of permanent and rotating galleries to choose from. Parking is the only negative here. We went on a Sunday and it was near impossible to find a spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MDXP
50,Must visit if you are in L.A.,"It's a great museum, it has several galleries, my favourite was the Picasso gallery and the Indian art gallery. Make sure you get the map at the entrance so you'll know where you're heading. The bookstore is really nice and also the small cafeteria.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/majomaol
50,Great Museum,We spent almost 4 hours walking all the galleries. Be sure to walk outside and visit the La Brea Tar-pits. We didn't eat lunch at the Museum Restaurant but instead had the experience to order food from the Food Trucks that parked just across the street from the Museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LinchyTica
50,Eclectic and absorbing,"My wife and I are staying in LA for a couple of months and found LACMA a superb and ever-changing attraction in this city of diverse museums and so much to do. We attended an in-depth display of Japanese samurai armor, followed a couple of weeks later bya how in the Hudson school of 19Th century art. There is a great bookstore and shop, as well as a cafe and other places to eat. The group up of food trucks on Wilshire outside the museum is als an attraction. Wonderful exhibits for kids as well. We liked it so much we joined and saved money after only two visits. By the way the view of the Holllywood Hills from the third floor of the Broad building is alone worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elandeds
50,Fabulous place to explore with the kids,"We enjoyed our time at LACMA very much! Admission price was extremely reasonable, and kids under 17 are free! The exhibits were fabulous- and the outdoor spaces were perfect for enjoying the beautiful day as well as the beautiful art.The shop had a nice variety of things and everything was priced nicely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlustfamily17
50,WORLD CLASS EXHIBITS!,"Come during the summer for some free Jazz music...exhibits are world class! Very, Very nice! Another MUST place to visit in LA,. Not far from the GROVE, Beverly Hills, La Brea Tar Pits! Lots to see & Buy :-)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprilg463
40,First time visit,"Great day out at LACMA. Saw a lot of new items from a previous visit. The special exhibitions, especially the Samurai were outstanding in their presentation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_G_1970
50,Memorable experience,"The varied collection of quality art housed in several buildings, some architecturally interesting and connected by gardens, makes a visit very much worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/421dwightd
50,LACMA is not to be missed,The breadth of the collection will keep anyone that has any interest at all in art fascinated. At least one whole day is needed or you will become frustrated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RodneyD250
40,Great Samurai Exhibit at LACMA,"Love LACMA! If you get there early on weekends, street parking is free and easy. Yes, free! And the food trucks parked nearby offer an amazing array of tasty food and drinks at fair prices that compete with LACMA's cafe and restaurant where the food can be ho-hum.Clean and neat, the annual and special exhibits and collections at LACMA are a delight to cruise around and admire.Bring your own cold water and snacks AND a shade hat or umbrella so that you can walk outside and enjoy the flora and fauna without wilting. It's fun to stroll about and gaze upon the treacherous and odiferous tar pits where so many beasties have died. And what beasties they were, right in our own back yards!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FortunateTraveler99
50,Must return!,"This was one of the featured attractions on our grand tour of L.A. The tour bus drove past the exterior of the museum and then pulled over so we could see the exterior exhibits. I was blown away just by the art that was displayed outside. We didn't make it inside but based on what I was able to see outside...I can only imagine how much there is to see inside. We didn't have the time to fit this in, but I wish we could have. This is a museum on my list of things I must do when I return to the area again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
50,Love LACMA,"We have been members of LACMA for a couple of years now. The entire family loves it. Besides the wonderful collections and special exhibits, LACMA has a lot of other activities for different age groups. We love the summer concerts they offer. My only suggestion is for them to improve on the food options. The main restaurant they have is a bit expensive with not so many choices. The less formal café has food that is very average and borderline not tasty at all. You can grab a pastry at the little coffee place and that may be your best bet. Like the option to bring my own food during the consents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freemaee
50,Blown away!,"I flew down to LA just to see the Larry Sultan exhibit (photography). I didn't know much about LACMA other than the old-style latern grouping piece which is must photographed (it's beautiful at night) and appears in TV/movies. LACMA is huge!! Many different buildings on a large piece of land. It's a fantastic layout and there are some amazing views, gardens, fountains and even the La Brea Tar Pits. I can't wait to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/829kellyp
50,Don't forget the free concert!,"First make sure you plan your day. Some days free admission - come early and check out the outside art - across the street ""THE BERLIN WALL"" We did a guided tour with explanation of the French paintings. All the things you don't see in a painting if you don't know where to find ""WALDO"" or for example the lady in the RED dress... If you decide the stay for the free concert get in line early (45 min prior) very limited seating. P.S. find ""THE RED"" elevator...Highly recommended MeuterMedia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeuterMedia
50,Fantastic!,"So much to see! A day is not nearly long enough to see the exhibits in any sort of contemplative way. It is a destination in and of itself. Buy a multiple day pass and spend several days here. There are also some interactive events at certain times so check their calendar. Evening concerts are given in on or more of their concert halls and some are free. Also, they have some very good (although sort of expensive) food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellen0417
50,An awesome museum,This is must see place if you happen to be in LA. This is our third visit. Lots of interesting works and exhibits. We had the opportunity to see the Samurai exhibition and it was really cool. However my toddlers were a little frightened by the intimidating samurai masks and battle horses. We did make it up by stopping by the Metropolis II exhibit and it cheered them up. I wished we could see more artwork. Overall a very good experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Artemi0S
50,An awesome place,"If you are in Los Angeles and love science, art, and history...come by this place. It has many museums including the California Science Center which is home to the Space Shuttle Endeavour. It has a beautiful rose garden where you can enjoy Southern California's gorgeous weather. It is a great place to visit while in Los Angeles. It is also right next door to the Coliseum and USC.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cotjos213
30,A nice few hours,"This is a large grouping of buildings. There is an extra cost for special exhibitions, which I'm not used to seeing in Boston and New York. Their collection seems stronger in modern and contemporary art, and is not encyclopedic. I did have a very nice meal at their outdoor restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flipper775
30,Such a mixed experience,"We spent the whole day being, at times, impressed with collections and displays, such as East Asia, and ,at other times wondering about choices which negatively impacted exhibits. The collection of Samurai armor was impressive and we revelled for hours, but the layout invited no directionality or even allowed for easy self tracking as to what had already been seen. This also complicated finding someone if you got separated in that space.It was also not clear why there couldn't have been two iPads, one at each entrance, to register for the Turrell. Seemed unnecessarily complicated, particularly for those unfamiliar with the museum to make their way to the only iPad. The TURRELL was fabulous.The Japanese building is beautifully laid out with some remarkable pieces. Would that it had gone on an on......We had made reservations at Rays for lunch. Perhaps the grey and rainy day made the design of the restaurant less appealing than it might otherwise have been; however by our time of arrival at 2pm enough food had collected on the solid grey carpet throughout the restaurant as to have made us question our choice. So, despite the surround, we found the food delicious,particularly the farro dish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThrutheSky
50,Best Visit at Night,"Went there twice, night and day. i prefer the night better because the light was lit. try to come as late as possible. too many people something make ur photos too crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mscynthiaoei
40,Overbearing staff spoil this experience.,"Yes this is a great museum that we have visited a few times. Our daughter takes her young children (6 and 3), regularly as they have membership. This day we took the children ourselves and were told off FOUR times for doing nothing! We know how to behave in museums and so do the children yet we were told, not to stand too close to paintings ( 3 feet away, no marks no rope), to be careful not to touch sculptures (which we wouldn't do anyway), not to take the stroller into the shop (child was asleep and there was not notice stating this), and not to touch the plinth of an exhibit even though there a screen showing a film right there.When we returned home we mentioned this to our daughter who said she'd had the same experience. We are going to complain as it's getting too much. We suspect that it is the security staff they hire, not the museum staff,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodie16
50,Leave lots of time,"This is a multiple building complex so you have to allow time to see all 4 buildings. Each has its unique flavor from having old German silent movies playing to unique pieces of furniture to a photographic essay of a local prominent family. There is also an outdoor sculpture garden We spent hours exploring and when our feet couldn't take anymore and we were approaching sensory overload, we hastened to the café where hot drinks and good food was had for reasonable pricing. This is adjacent to the La Brea Tar Pits which you can walk through but the Tar Pits museum is an additional price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pineaway
50,Fabulous,Truly a world-class museum. Great permanent collection and the temporary shows always open up new understanding of artists I know and/or introduce artists I haven't experienced before. Can't do it justice to it in one day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaFrancophile
50,LACMA at Night,Enchanting when the art is lighted at night. There are evening events at LACMA and the parking is free at the Pritzzer lot after 7 pm. Enjoy Ray Stark's cocktails and give yourself some time to enjoy LACMA before driving (the drinks are not watered down).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMcClureDVM
50,Lovely Museum,"The museum is great. Many exhibits in various buildings, all well curated and displayed. There is an exhibit for everyone and the outside of the museum is often used for exhibits, now hosting a lamplight arrangementParking is easy, behind the museum and La Brea Tar pits are nearby so one can also visit that or relax n Hancock park, right beside the LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jboed
40,All Walking Tour of Costumes...Great Variety...Wheelchairs Available,"Very enjoyable with a great variety of costumes. No photography allowed. Single line viewing through dark rooms was a bit challenging if some stopped to talk along they way causing a backup. Was a bit tight in some spots. Free wheelchairs available. Costumes that the young and old will recognize (Jennifer Lawrence in Hunger Games thru John Travolta's white suit). LOVED the Queen Elizabeth exhibit with 10 costumes over the decades. This is what Hollywood is -- stories, movies, costumes, characters and this exhibit had it all! Recommend 2-3 hours.Park across street in public lot ($20 flat rate). Recommend paying as soon as you park, otherwise you'll be standing in line waiting for everyone to purchase a ""paid ticket"". No attendants on site.Cafe was nice, but slow and overpriced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SayCheese
40,Lots of reasons to go,"While not the Louvre, British Museum or the Met, LACMA has a great collection and is well worth the visit. In addition to the permanent collection and the great exhibits, in the summer, come for the music on Friday and Saturday nights and wander through the Urban Light sculpture and walk under the Levitated Mass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whetherperson
50,A must see!!,LACMA is absolutely fantastic and definitely worth a visit if in LA. There are a number of buildings with various exhibitions in each- all were great when we visited. The architecture of the museum is also impressive while being quite low key. The Archibald Motley exhibition was our favourite- wonderful portraits as well as Jazz inspired pieces. I'd recommend a visit here- well worth it and a wonderful surprise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clpgreen
40,Better than Expected!,Really glad we decided to go to LACMA - we expected to spend a couple of hours and ended up spending most of the day. Parking was easy (charge). The main collection was very good and we saw an excellent touring exhibition. The outside of the buildings and grounds were impressive and the outside modern art installations were most impressive (I particularly liked the Lamp Post Installation and the Granite Block Installation!). The main café was good for lunch with outside eating area. Top Tip - leave your stuff in your car as the one downside is the fact that there are no lockers to leave bags. You can leave a bag at the ticket office but this was not a convenient experience hence only 4 stars. Highly Recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruth44421
40,One of Los Angeles' 3 Best Museums,The LA County Museum of Art is a surprisingly good museum. Check to see if what is being exhibited is of interest to you and if so definitely go. You'll be pleasantly surprised.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donaldgraham
50,LACMA ~ An eclectic museum,"Just visited LACMA to see the Samurai armor exhibit. I am a member and I brought my 7 year old nephew along to experience the art visit. As always, I was not disappointed. I had no interest in the Samurai armor exhibit, but thought my nephew would sincerely enjoy it. Well, we both did. As we explored the entire museum in a day. Whew. He is a 7 year old boy, and has that sorta energy. I highly recommend this museum for all ages, all levels of art enthusiasts. I was again reminded of the wow factor of this museum. It is not stuffy, it is hands on, up close, a fabulous eclectic fresh experience and a fresh way to experience art, all art. I like the mix up that is LACMA. Keep up the good work LACMA, do not let the detractors sway you into ever being main stream. LA is not main stream, we are the trendsetters. Why would LACMA be anything but trendsetting? Go. See. Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAR411
50,A wonderful museum!,"I haven't been here for many years, but this visit surpassed our high expectations.Such lovely airy spaces and varied exhibitions with sensitively curated shows that enhance the artworks for the viewer on both visual and literary levels.Highlights were the fascinating Motley and Sultan shows; both artists with whom we were unfamiliar. There was a terrific exhibition of German expressionist films from the 1920s; ancient mesoamerican art that is truly mesmerising and then the other stunningEuropean, Pacific, Japanese and American works from their permanent collection. Plus there is more we didn't see.What a LA treat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/16R25D
50,So Much Fun!,I love art museum and going to this one made me realize how much more I appreciate art. I cant wait to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/625charmainem
50,A local who loves LACMA,"I have visited LACMA for both the Stanley Kubrick exhibit (~2011) and for the Samurai armor exhibit (2014) (both terrific!). Along with the specific exhibits for which I visited, there was so much to see I would have to plan where to go next, while keeping my eye on my watch. There are so many galleries and pieces, and so much to read and become absorbed in that a late morning arrival may keep you feeling as if you will not have enough time to view all you want....that is if your legs do not give out on you first!A trip to LACMA is a lovely way to spend a day. If you are comfortable being a loner, it is a great place to spend a solo day while feeling a bit more accomplished, educated and enlightened at the end of it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LincolnOsiris
30,Good Museum but Overpriced,"We enjoyed our most recent visit to LACMA but I continue to be surprised at the extra costs. After paying $20 to enter (plus parking), we were asked for an additional $20 to see the Samurai Art exhibit. We decided it was not worth the extra $100 as there were 5 of us and we did not get to see this exhibit. They was an additional charge for at least 2 more exhibits which we did not see. I recommend the Getty which is free except for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffn146
50,Do NOT miss this!,"A nearly perfectly mounted exhibition. Informative, inspiring, exciting. Glorifying the role of costume design in the overall story telling/moviemaking process via exhibits and video, and it is simply breathtaking. This gives visitors an idea of just one of the aspects that go into the intricacies of filmmaking. The technical design of the exhibit is flawless, with conversations between video screens (Meryl Streep alone, and fascinating), perfect lighting, etc. Tarantino and Scorcese video screen to video screen chatting and their designers (Sharen Davis and Sandy Powell) against the backdrop of iconic, historic and modern costumes. I guess I'm raving at this point, but this is worth it. Titanic √, Gigham dress and Ruby Slippers√ The ENTIRE Indiana Jones story and costumes√ Satine from Moulin RougeT√ A magnificent Marie Antoineete-Queen Elizabeth exhibit√....The Little Tramp√......Darth Vader√ Tipi's The Birds√ Carole Lombard√ you get the drift. Encyclopedic, technically engaging, beautifully mounted and actually extensive. It's not free -- its around $20 --but this is a rare opportunity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristineLA
50,Brilliant Costume Exhibit,"A lack of time ion LA (thank you Amtrak!) meant we had only limited options to visit attractions. LACMA itself will have to wait until next time but we had a great time visiting the Hollywood Costume Exhibition. I believe that this exhibit may have toured the World but it has been updated to include new films such as The Great Gatsby, American Hustle and Django Unchained. the walk and watch nature of the exhibit makes it special and the current holiday deal which includes two tickets, a book, poster and a t-shirt (as well as parking for those who drove) is a no-brainer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trevor797
40,Spend some time here,"What a great day we had here. It's been awhile since I last set foot on these grounds but that won't happen again. Between the great lunch we had , the exhibits were impressive and just people watching , the day moved and did not see all everything I wanted to view. Special mention: the Samurai exhibit, the Hudson Valley collection and the massive,phonetic model car escapade. Bring your family, friends or come yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankG379
40,Classic Hitchcock At LACMA,"We saw a screening of Notorious at LACMA. Enjoyed the intro and love the movie. I look forward to returning so I can view the art. Parking is just across the street, but map it out before you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PB99power
50,Great Experience!,"This museum is always on our must visit list when we are in LA. Many different buildings but are easily accessible. The art is always great and one can learn new things. We like the Broad Contemporary Museum because we are introduced to great artists we don't know, as well as the more traditional art in the museum's permanent collection. We usually dine at the restaurant or museum cafe. However, when we visited this time we saw many food trucks outside the museum and tried one of those. This museum is so diverse you can find something that interests everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5071MDbb
50,Great place to see art!,"The permanent collection is impressive, the new Renzo buildings are fun housing the modern collection and it's a lovely museum to wander and find the type of art that appeals to you. The new additions of the lampposts and the floating rock have been very popular for exterior shots in this social media age but they are also lovely works in their own right. I would say if you are first time visitor to LA go to this museum the Getty and MOCA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CelticGirlLA
50,Very Impressive Exhibit,"I had thought this was just a Hollywood museum with a few costumes, but it turned out to be a very nice exhibition assembled by the Victoria & Albert museum of London.It had costumes from a wide variety of old and recent movies, most of which were known to us, and will be to most people.In addition to the costumes, they have videos and information describing why the costumes were chosen, or how they were designed with specific needs in mind. There's often far more involved than just finding clothes from the movie's period.Well worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/streich
40,Beautiful,We mostly went to the lamps at LACMA. Gorgeous! We went late at night and it was very nice!Now to guess at when I hit 50 characters... I HATE THIS Requirement.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidwZ8047WC

50,One of LA's Best,"Went here today for my pre-birthday and even though it was raining a little bit and it was cold, this museum never seems to disappoint! The main highlight was Delacroix's famous Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi on temporary exhibit from Bordeaux. Larger than I expected and no picture of it does this painting justice! It's part of general admission so you don't have to worry about paying extra to see it.The museum itself wasn't really crowded. We waited in line maybe 20 minutes and a lot of the rooms had little to no people, except for maybe the modern art rooms near the entrance to the Ahmanson Building. The American art building had nice art too, but was a little disappointed that Rivera's Dia de Flores wasn't available to view. Otherwise, it was a great day! Didn't have time to see any of the exhibits that you have to pay extra for, but highly recommend them if you have time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChichesterRoyalty
40,Cool museum,"It's a nice museum if you like art. Interesting and educational, I would gladly be back here with my friends so that they learn a few things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Palomared
50,One of the best art museums on the West Coast,"Definitely, visit LACMA if you are ever in Los Angeles. Great exhibits there, as well as permanent collections. Permanent art collections include works by Diego Rivera, Pablo Picasso, Rembrandt, and others. I attended the Art of Samurai exhibition which was excellent. Featured Samurai armor, and Japanese Art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuslanKozaev
50,"AMAZING DISPLAY OF COSTUMES, FILM CLIPS AND MORE","This exhibit is actually next door to the LACMA. Fantastic and beautiful costumes dating back to the 1920s and up to the present day, including detailed explanations on the choosing of the particular designs and how they work within the scene or the movie. Lots of additional information - computerized ""books"" , actual film clips showing the costumes and how the costumes were made to blend in with the character. Great exhibition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaWanderer2013
40,Pretty fine museum,There are several museum buildings. Some topics were not so interesting to me but some others were pretty cool to see. The lights at the entrance are beautiful when it's getting dark. Me and my friend took several nice shots there after we finished our visit to the museums.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DennyHsu
40,Costumes of Hollywood films,"Currently showing in the building that housed the Latin American art, is an exhibition of costumes used in many films with videos explaining the complexity and importance of being a designer in the Industry. This exhibition runs through January and is diffenitly worth seeing if you like to go to the ""movies"". It is in the eastern most building of the art museum which is spread over eight buildings. On the corner of Wilshire and Fairfax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351priscillag
50,Very Nice Museum,I was born and raised in the Los Angeles area (Santa Monica) and went to this museum quite often with my school class. It is a very nice place to take children and it's good for adults too. Los Angeles has a varied history and it's all here to see. You can spend quite a few hours walking around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TucsonGrammy
50,Hollywood Costume Exhibit...fabulous!,"This exhibit runs through March 2, 2015 and includes some of the most notable and recognizable costumes in movie making. From Dorothy's ruby slippers and gingham dress to the red gown worn by Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. There were the original Superman, Batman and Darth Vader costumes. One hundred costumes that made the artists' performances all the more memorable. I totally enjoyed myself and the senior ticket rate of $15 made it even sweeter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcbens08
50,Hollywood Costume Exhibit is Amazing,"The Hollywood Costume exhibit at one of the side buildings of the LA County Museum of Art Museum is incredible. With items from the Vicotria and Albert collection and from the Academy of MOtion Picture Arts, it has so many iconic costumes, from Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp outfit, Dorothy's dress and slippers, through Mildred Pearce's waitress uniform to Indiana Jones, Batman, Darth Vader and even Avatar. The connections between a director's vision and a costumer's creations, between character and costume, between technology and costume are all explored in clear and interesting ways. It is not expensive ($15) and left me at least feeling ""gobsmacked"" by how much and what was there. If you are a movie fan or have an interest in the technical side of film - go see this one. It is on through March 2, 2015.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GigiRoss2014
30,Very confusing museum,"Don't go there if you're not an avid map reader. Seriously! The museum consists of 7 buildings and is very hard to navigate. There was a cool exhibition of Archibald Motley which we didn't intend to see but ended up being the best part of our trip, other than that it wasn't particularly interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eminenoyan
50,Unbelievable,I spent 4 hours there. I did not complete 2 floors of one building. There is so much to see and it is all incredibly good quality. I have visited museums all over the world and none astonished me more than this one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P4738UBmaryf
50,"Great collection, beautiful buildings","If you come to LA, do not miss it. The buildings are beautiful and the collection is amazing.

50,World Class Museum with Helpful Staff,"This world class museum has an extensive art collection across many forms and origins. Don't miss the unique Metropolis II by Chris Burden (see my YouTube under Jan Ligon). Their modern art collection is most impressive. Seniors can enter for $10, so very reasonable. Numerous free tours and lectures daily. Very helpful and friendly staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jan_from_Atlanta

40,An Outstanding Art Museum,"We recently visited LACMA for the first time. We were just blown away by the sheer size of the campus and the variety of exhibits there. We were there for perhaps 3 hours, and we barely covered about a third of what was available to see. I highly recommend making a visit to this outstanding art museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N_and_R

50,LACMA,"SO much fun! My family and I had such a great time. Our boys, ages 4 and 6 had an amazing time. All I can say is that its worth it. Currently they have free admissions for children up to age 18, its called the ""LACMA NextGen"". My boys got in free and so did my husband and I, because its one free admissions adult ticket per child. My cousin who also joined us, had an entry fee of 15 dollars. We did not purchase any ""special"" admission tickets to certain exhibits, only because it was our first trip and wanted to experience the ""norm"". Would defiantly recommend this place and we cant wait to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rociov249

40,High art in LA,"A great choice for anyone interested in art, LACMA has a solid permanent collection with Asian and Latin American exhibits that rival the Met in NYC. It's European collections are less impressive, but they make up for that with several interesting special exhibits throughout the year. This museum also offers a lovely campus with several large installations accessible to the public for free and live outdoor music on weekend evenings. Overall, it's a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CityPigeon

40,Yet another great L.A. museum,"LACMA should be a compulsory stop for art lovers who visit L.A. There's always a great exhibition on and the permanent exhibits are always topnotch, including perhaps the largest collection of Islamic Art anywhere. The huge boulder from Riverside (can't remember the title of the art installation just now) is on display towards the back. There are also occasional jazz concerts. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottLB
40,Don't skip the upstairs!,"There is parking underground! Admission includes 3 buildings: The Broad Museum was showing modern installations, which have been forgettable, except the ""Mechanical"" City which is mesmerizing! The main building has a striking, if ominous sculpture dominating the entry. The lower level displays modern work in a dark environment--left a depressing aftertaste, and we were ready to leave. But we went upstairs where the collection includes many more periods and is better lit, and we ran out of time! Enjoyed some generic jazz on the plaza.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nonamesforme
50,A beautiful outdoor space,"There aren't many places in LA (aside from the beach) where a person can just ""hang out"" and enjoy the scenery. Without a car, in fact, LA is hard to navigate. But if you're looking for a place to walk around for a few hours, LACMA is definitely it. There are good restaurants and you can see two of the country's most viewed works of art without even going inside the museum. Spend some time at LACMA when you're in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmconnors
40,"An hour or a day, plenty to see.","Quite large and overwhelming at first but you'll eventually become comfortable with the layout. My immediate impression was Wow!, what a beautiful and interesting building! Some galleries were fantastic. They were nicely laid-out, completely labeled, with much diversity of display. Other rooms were sparse, and at least one exhibit was not yet labeled. I found the elevators confusing! I joined a group being led by a delightfully knowledgeable docent in the discussion of color in four pieces. Very nice touch! The cafe (indoor/outdoor) serves excellent coffee! As a tourist I thoroughly enjoyed my visit; I would visit frequently if I lived nearby! It was nice to leave the building and go across the street to see the Berlin Wall Project (on the sidewalk) and then easily return to the museum. One can do the same with the La Brea Tar Pits immediately next to the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gartenkerl

50,Larger than it looks,"LACMA, located between 6th and Wiltshire, is huge, with several buildings each having several floors. There is more to see than time to see it, so we were selective in where we spent our time. We particularly enjoyed the Japanese exhibits of samurai swords and formal kimonos, and the Southeast Asia exhibits of various religious artifacts. There were at least 2 special exhibits that were available to view for an additional price, but we stuck with the basics and were kept engaged looking at only a portion of the displays. Parking is available adjacent to the museum, and there is a museum cafe with a selection of food. Plan on at least 1/2 day several times to avoid ""art burnout"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LBlank-SalinasCA
50,WOW,Great exhibits. We loved the German Expressionists. Excellent written descriptions. Admission was pricey!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/957vicl
50,An incredible experience,"I am a member of the Art Institute in Chicago. They have reciprocity with LACMA.What a treat this museum is for both those of us who have a deep interest in art as well as those who are somewhat reluctant observers (like my husband). The exhibits are varied enough to provide interesting opportunities for those who are enthusiasts as well as those who are no so inclined.Although I have been to this museum previously and found that there are many wonderful permanent exhibits, they have special exhibits currently on view that are especially interesting. The Samuri and Pierre Huyghe exhibits are both interesting but I enjoyed the James Turrell (breathing light) especially wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fro2
50,Fabulous museum..,"The word ""museum"" conjures up stuffy rooms with stuffy art. Not so here. I have come here several times over the years, and the exhibits are always entertaining, or educational, or surprising--and sometimes all 3. The restaurant Ray's and Stark is an extremely civilized place to have lunch. Parking is easy. Go to this museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCtraveler1948
50,GREAT place for Art and Fun,"I used to live around the corner from LACMA, and would visit often. The exhibits are always interesting and well thought out, and the layout is perfectly easy to navigate. This year, I went to the Costume Ball which was one of the MOST FUN things I've ever done. You dress up like a work of art and it was clear people really put a lot of attention and care into getting ready; this wasn't your usual Halloween costume party...this was far more sophisticated, fun and interesting. LACMA is great for a family visit, a solo visit, a place to send friends, but there are often events going on there which are REALLY worth trying out. I highly recommend keeping abreast of the activities going on there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBWillsy
50,So Fun!,What a great museum! I went with my whole family and enjoyed it so much. There was a Japanese exhibit that was very interesting. I really enjoyed seeing all the older art work especially since I'm not a huge fan of contemporary art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderingCouple77

50,Superior Art Museum,"The museum encompassing several buildings with permanent and changing exhibitions is impressive. Beautiful grounds surround the several buildings and the walk through the grounds is beautiful and relaxing. With the collection of art, exhibits and location, I was surprised to see so few reviews. The name ""Los Angeles County Art Museum"" implies a governmental impact and therefore a less fluid, free-flowing, artist experience. Just the opposite, the LACMA is expansive, creative and offers unique museum collections. Actually, I questioned the name and discovered the museum far exceeds the ""county"" museum its name describes. This wonderful artist experience stimulates the mind and senses. We will return again to enjoy this museum and its many collections.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA
40,Based on a quick 2-hour buzz-through...,"A solid museum with needlessly hornery guards.I visited LACMA right after seeing the superior Hollywood Costume Exhibit in the adjacent building.LACMA's website said they'd be closing at 3 that day for a celebrity shindig, so around noon, I tried walking into one of the buildings. An ancient creature stirred from his roost.""We closed.""""I thought you closed at 3?""""Nope. We closed.""Hm.So I walked into another LACMA building and guess what - they open.I enjoyed walking around and scoping the artwork, especially a painting from Robert Motherwell and one from Picasso's blue period.On the way out, I took a detour through the giant trench of Levitated Mass. While I was in there, a guard ran down to shoo me away because it was 2:55. Look, lady. I'm already outside. I'm a stone's throw from the exit. Can I just take my picture and mosey out? No? I need to sprint for the exit? Cool. Way to be a dick.I'd like to go back when I wouldn't get so much static from the guards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BowmanInc
50,So much to see.,"We chose this as a destination not because we happened into the one free day of the month, but because there's some really good art work and the grounds are fascinating. This is a multi-building museum that takes care to help you find what you want. There are guards everywhere that actually answer questions and are helpful. They're proud of their museum. So go, relax on the vast grounds and see some art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacksondc
50,So much to see!,We really needed a whole day to see this museum. We were distressed that we were unable to view a small art show that was exclusive only to donors. Seems strange for a tax-run museum that should be available to the public.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmlvngstn
50,"As usual, too little time!","This is, after all, an LA County attraction, so I was not sure what to expect. I can completely recommend this as a first-rate experience.The holdings are spread out among the various buildings in the complex, so you need to know what you are interested in, and where the collections are that will meet those interests. Since we had limited time, we started in the Ahmanson Building, with the German impressionists on the second floor. We worked our way up the floors to the classical holdings, and then moved into the connected Hammer Building, where the magnificent Assyrian bas reliefs of Ashurnasirpal II's palace are displayed. Wow! Also, lots of Egyptian stuff!!I ran over just before closing time to see Metropolis II in the Broad Contemporary Art Museum, while my wife stepped into the gift shop and snack bar. The Metropolis II installation was not operating, so I can't wait to see it running sometime, but it is impressive - even stock-silent-still!Some of the collections are limited (presumably by the source of the acquisitions/gifts). In other cases, there is a large assemblage of related artifacts on display.Another time we'll apportion our time better, but we saw a lot for a first-time visit. I can really recommend this public museum as one of the best around!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LarryM708

50,Hollywood Costume Exhibit,This was fantastic. What a great job. Taking a trip down movie memory lane. It was awesome to see just how much costume design not only impacts us the viewers but also the actors ability to get into character. This was a very visional but lots of dialog as well. We had a blast. Spending time in the surrounding are was fun as well.John & LynNita Ellis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnEllis3
40,Love this place,I went there this past Sunday and enjoyed about four hours of it. I went to the Latin America art exhibition. It was good!

My day was great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X3168JOmarial

50,Lots to see !,"Wonderful exhibits and many types of art. We saw the Van Gogh to Kandinsky exhibit, as well as the contemporary exhibits available that day.

50,Enjoyable day of art and culture,"You may not be coming to LA for art and culture but for something different I would recommend LACMA. It has a variety of modern art, sculpture, antiquities, landscape paintings and many more. You can easily spend a whole day taking in each of the sections as there is a lot to see. If you go on a Tuesday it is free and you are just asked if you would like to give a donation or not. Also, make sure you go up the escalator outside building 7 to the 3rd floor viewing area as you get a view of the Hollywood sign from afar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovechocolate

Otherwise $15 for adults, $10 for students, seniors with ID.Great venue for outdoor summer concerts. Very well attended -- all the seats were taken.The majority of the other audience spilled over to every inch of the lawn with picnics, with their families, friends and even dogs..The music was only so-so though.. tired tunes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells
40,Film Academy Costume Show,"After looking forward to the inaugural event at the Academy’s work-in-progress at Wilshire and Fairfax, I was pleased that a valiant effort was made to present the collection of various historic costumes in a respectful, but somewhat casual manner due to the fact that the old May Co. building is not ready for its closeup. It was really nice to see these iconic costumes along with various forms of descriptions and explanations complementing the items.There are a few areas in need of improvement though. First, it was too dark, way too dark. My ankle hit the corners of the displays several times, one light was out so an usher was standing by with a flashlight to guide us. It was difficult to see the details on exhibits not within arm’s length. Second, the incidental music was too loud. Third, some, not all, displays had a photo of the related star that moved in a creepy fashion. Also, some of the text displays had an annoying scrolling going on where the words got bigger as you tried to read them. Finally, it seemed as though Meryl Streep must have been the chairperson of the selection committee as she had an entire island devoted to only her costumes. She is a super talent but why the special treatment? The exit could be improved as well. I felt I was dumped out into a back alley.Even so, I will return with another guest interested in costumes as I enjoyed the presentation overall and I look forward to the creation of a museum we have needed for many years..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollywoodBandB
10,All about security,"Our experience of LACMA left a little to be desired. There is a HEAVY security presence which makes enjoying the art difficult. The guards are pretty unfriendly and didn't seem to know anything much about the art on display...problematic given there is scant information on the labels.Also, It's weird to have a great work such as the Chris Burdon only work on intermittently on weekends, what about weekday visitors? Sure, the work needs to be carefully managed to preserve it, but if it were to operate a little less but over the whole week we might all be able to see it working.The children's painting room was great and run by a couple of incredibly personable young people. But on the whole this was a cold, impersonable experience - in complete contrast to the Getty and the Hammer which were lovely experiences.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CampbellMcC
40,James Turrell installation worth the price of admission.,"The LACMA is a beautiful facility with some outstanding art but the Turrell room sized installation art exhibit is terrific. It is a study of light and how the changing light affects our perception of our surroundings. If you register at the ticket desk when you arrive you'll be notified by text when you can view the installation. It is due to stay at LACMA until May, 2015. TIPS: The docent tours are informative and you can check the daily schedule ahead of time on line to plan your visit. If you want to break up your visit to the art museum you can visit the Là Brea tar pits next to the museum. The tar pits provided the largest collection of Ice Age fossils in the world. There is also an accompanying museum. You can visit the food trucks across the street and then re enter the art museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5VIC9
50,Outside & inside fascination,Architectural beauty of this museum starts outside. The collection is a nice overview of contemporary art. Its just enough for a two hour visit to be completed with a perfect lunch in the museum restaurant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronaldb416
50,Hollywood Costume Exhibit - Wow!,"Run, don't walk to this special outstanding exhibit at LACMA! I kinda dragged hubby to it and he loved it as much as I did, Part of the hugely successful Victoria and Albert Museum (in London) special exhibit, we are so lucky to have this for a while. I've seen costumes from films many, many times, but this one is different because of wonderful film footage beside the iconic costumes, actors' feelings about the costumes in specific roles, holograms, musical scores, video interviews by actors, directors, and even the great designer Edith Head (you'll see her nine Oscars). There's something for everyone and if you love film, I cannot imagine that you won't enjoy this. It brings back so many memories. The costumes run from the 1920's to the present day. Favorites of ours were the tramp suit Charlie Chaplin wore, Mary Poppins' suit and umbrella, Marilyn Monroe's white subway dress, Judy Garland's blue and white gingham dress from Oz plus her Ruby red slippers, the exquisite Queen Elizabeth I and Marie Antoinette costumes, several of Meryl Streep's costumes from various films, Julia Robert's red dress from Pretty Women, and many costumes worn by male actors from Bond to Terminator to Batman to Darth Vader to Indiana Jones to Superman and Spiderman, etc. There are 150 costumes to see, so you certainly get your money's worth ($20 for adults amd $15 for seniors). We purchased our tickets online and chose a specific date and time. On the Monday right after they opened, no crowds at all which was wonderful. We could take our time and even backtrack as we wished. Be sure to read the cards beside each costume. Some are really, really interesting. The staff are ever so friendly and helpful. We parked in the big garage on 6th for $12 (look for the red steel and glass elevator near the entrance on each level). Street parking also, if you're lucky. No photos allowed inside except for Head's Oscars amd there's a photo op near the door outside, where you can stand by a giant gold Oscar while a ticket taker takes your photo. There's a kiosk with water, cokes, coffee, pastries and outside tables. Pricey - $3 for a can of coke. Cafe near the elevators. Nice bathrooms at the entrance/exit. Go as soon as possible; I have a feeling this will get very busy (the V&A) ended up with over 250,000 visitors in a 12 week period.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793LindaC
30,Huge Disappointment,"I visit the LACMA in 1989. For the Japanese pavilion built to display the Joe Price japanese screens collection. A gift of over than 350 fabulous screens. Supposed to be on display on a basis of a regular rotation. And, for the Ardebil carpet, offered by J.-P. Getty himself. One of a pair, the most beautiful carpets in the world. The other one is at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. When I visit last August the japanese pavilion there were a temporary exibition of Kimono(!). A the place of the carpet there is actually a contemporary black color monstrous sculpture oversized for the available space. No information desk, no one guard remind the screens or the carpet. They don't know if one day they will be again on display.They have been given by very generous people with the condition to make them accessible to the public. They are not. Written on the walls of the building, the LACMA collected 346 millions USDollars. Beautiful buildings have been built. Large spaces are for the (very expensive) and (very) contemporary art. It sounds ""look at around! Millions and Billions are looking to you"" . Very ""nouveau riche"" museum. There is a beautiful and exceptional organisation for children. There is an excellent expresso at the bar. But, at the Library, there is no book about the Joe Price japanese screens collection. No book mentioning the Ardebil carpet. LACMA does not desserve generous donors. Shame on you LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Delanuit11

If you are looking for a place that wastes entire huge rooms on a single piece of non-sense that someone has labeled as ""Art"", then this is your place. This is the same museum that wasted millions of dollars moving a giant boulder through multiple towns, to place it on top of a trench and call it art.

50,Top Class,LACMA is a high quality art museum with an extensive collection that covers many periods. It flows into several connected buildings and I had a lot of fun just wandering from one to the other. Their collection of German expressionist art is second to none and was worth the price of admission alone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/509waynem
50,Lamps & exhibitions!,"Even if you go there late at night when LACMA is closed, you still see people hanging around to take the typical lamp posts photos. Beautiful place and always tons to see. You can spend all day there and sit at the park near by! Good for inspiration or family trips.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/665michellek
50,My favorite local museum,"I've hit up most of the museums in LA and I have to say LACMA is hands down my favorite. They have an excellent collection of German Expressionist, more Picassos than you can count, Giacometti, and any other modern artist you can think of. They also have a wonderful exhibit with the art of the Pacific, European art from all the ages on the third floor, and on the top art from the near and far East. It's an enormous museum but most people stick to the first and second floors. I have been here countless times and I'm always discovering something new.Admission is free after 3 for anyone who lives in LA county!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TyArroz
50,Good mix of classic & modern,"We almost didn't spend the money to go in but it was great. They have a lot of outdoor & large exhibits that are fun, but the great art is inside the Ahmanson building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anxiousmom315
50,Expansive collection of Art,"We came here with my kids last July. They have a lot of exhibits and you would need 1 to 2 days to be able to visit the expansive collection of contemporary and ancient art. The kids enrolled in theNexGen program, a free youth membership for anyone 17 years and younger. WE got free tickets for them and one free ticket for me as there parent. They had a few minutes of Art time at the Boone Children's gallery. Then we visited the different parts of the museum. I loved taking pictures at the famous Urban Light exhibit. There are three places to grab food there. Be prepared for a day full of history... Will definitely go back soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tameia
30,Too big and not enough guidance,"I went to this museum as I had ready they had some sort of activity kit for children. I asked reception and they told me no.I also wanted to see Diego Riviera work, so they directed me towards the latin american floors. So I saw a few paintings there - but I missed some that were in other parts of the museum. (I know because I saw the postcards in the shop).We enjoyed the Japanese pavillion and the kimono exhibit. I also like the Corea exhibit while my daughters were crafting in the children activity center.We went up on another building to see the Hollywood sign. and then walked into a building where we were rudely told that it was for members only before it opened to the public. That's ok, but make a sign on the door, or be courteous about it.As I tried to get some information on what to see at the museum; or on exhibits (not extra from regular paid entrance); or on directions, the ticket counter or the Friends counter were not helpful at all. They had a mission : sell membership or sell the summer exhibit. They must be paid on commission to be so bad at serving clients. Normally, museum employees are nice and helpful.Oh yeah, the bar was cool, and if it had been 5 PM, I would have had a drink. But 11 AM opening time was too early ;-) .So overall, me that loves museum, can see the appeal of this museum, but staff should be better trained towards client service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zaz936
50,One of my favorite museums ever!,I've seen the most iconic work here.The two artists I died to see... Warhol and Frida Kahlo were both shown here... My life felt complete.I come here for inspiration and for fun. Great art! A must see for all art lovers and anyone living in Los Angeles.A lot of amazing picture opportunities and exhibits !A perfect essence of Los Angeles. Meet great people.Extremely clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562margaritas
50,All I can say is I need more time to see everything.,I enjoyed my day looking at all the art. Some was interesting while others were breathtaking. Looking forward to visiting again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shueshine
50,Expressionism - - ahhhhh!,"Went to see the exhibit Van Gogh to Kandinsky - - such an amazing array of paintings. The museum is organized and easy to navigate. The rich blue walls set off the paintings beautifully. I love the Expressionists, and this did not disappoint.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Artzgal
40,Interesting collections at LACMA,"Known as LACMA, this museum is quite big and I was not able o see everything, since we had just half day. The museum has many buildings in the same area. So it´s necessary more time in order to well see the collection or, like we did, choose some buildings.There are 2 installations at open air that are iconic in LA. One is a series of light poles that changes the art work depending on the position you are, giving interesting different perspectives. This installation has been used for some films in LA. The second installation seems like a big box made out of a curtain of yellowish thin ropes (looks like spaghetti). The kids love to play with this installation, going through the ropes.When I visited there was 2 temporary exhibitions, one about soccer and another one with the works from Agnes Varda. This one specially was great, showing among other things, an installation which was a small house all made by film strips from her films.We visited also buildings with paintings from old masters and another with African tribes´s art work.The museum has a shop not exactly special. There is also a cafe in the courtyard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuPereira
40,Worth a visit,A lot of unusual exhibits. Art work - decent. Loved the Japanese Building with the Netsuke exhibit - incredibly interesting. Love that there are several buildings each with a different focus and places to stop and grab a quick bite or a cup of coffee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sylloves2travel
40,"Beautifully curated, excellent space","Very much enjoyed yet another visit to this fabulous museum. Los Angelenos are very fortunate to have such an institution. The Van Gogh to Kandinsky exhibition is well put together (though i do think that members should at least be allowed to bring guests to special exhibits at a discounted price or for free as other US museums do).As there is so much to see, I always find it best (to stop my head from exploding) if I limit visits to about 90 minutes.It was a friday visit and the jazz outside on such a lovely day sounded particularly inviting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/131paulinek
30,"Too much space, not enough quality art or information","This museum seems to take up way more space than the quality of its collection justifies. They seem to obsess about new buildings they wish to construct; meanwhile the collection itself is large but underwhelming. Probably great if you really are just looking for a venue to have an outing with somebody centered on talking to that person, with the museum being the backdrop for your running conversation. But not so great if you are looking to have art presented in an organized and informative fashion. Go to the European art floor and look for any semblance of a logical layout or much information about the art; what you'll find is a bunch of things kept in rooms with items from the same period, with no sense of how the rooms link to each other or any information about the artworks. If you want to appreciate high-quality art, the nearby Getty and slightly more distant Norton Simon and Huntington are far superior. If you just want an outing to catch up with a friend, this is the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doug274
50,Superb and amazing,The scale of the place is overwhelming. Particularly knocked out by the Van Gogh to Kandinsky exhibition currently on when we visited but also a couple of amazing permanent exhibits - A huge Richard Serra and the amazing Metropolis II by Chris Burden. James Turrell's Breathing Light is quite something too... and this barely scratches the surface.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jon_mort
30,Modern Art,I liked the nighttime visit. They had a late night opening for some reason and it was very fun for me. I'm not into modern art really but overall I found lots to look at that held my interest for several hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanghusF
40,Interesting Art Museum,LACMA is an interesting destination for first-time travelers to Los Angeles. It has many cool art displays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChiefGrandMaster
50,Really enjoyed,I forgot how good museums can be!Make sure you go to the light display (reservations required) and obviously fun playing in the spaghetti.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bott23
40,very unique experience,"Unfortunately, I didn't have lots of time to explore but the museum has a great collection of art. It has something for everyone. A must see the urban lights and la brea tar pits right next to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaindy86
40,Even better than expected,This is a sprawling museum space with a lean toward modern and contemporary art. Each building has its own vibe and collection and the space is just lovely. You walk outdoors from building to building which is perfect considering the weather (though a bit toasty on a hot day). We hung out here for a few hours and had a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kugali
50,Good selection of art work,Several hours required to enjoy a very good selection of art workand a very interesting exhibition of fossils found in Tar pits in thearea-!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/burns71
40,LACMA makes LA proud,LACMA is a great museum with a very good collection. The shows it curates are some of the best in the world. It is small enough that you can spend the day & relax your way many works of art. It also is great on a Friday night with music & good food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jadeig
40,Good grounded collection,"LACMA is always a great visit - have been going since field trips as a child and the rotating display always excites. Top notch collections and knowledgeable staff, not to mention you are in the thick of things so great places to go/see/do/eat after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorib403
50,Not the place for a quick visit,"My daughter and I spent 4-5 hours here. We took in the special exhibit expressionism and impressionism, the Modern Art building and part of Ancient America exhibit. We also had lunch, which was excellent. We only planned to stay a couple of hours. The buildings are beautiful and the exhibits attractively arranged. Be aware that if you buy a ticket to the special exhibit you may have to stand in line a few minutes after your specified time. We will return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carol765
50,"Jazz, Latin Jazz, art and people!","The wonderful thing about summer in Los Angeles is the amazing transformation some of our favorite places make when it gets warm. Friday night Jazz at LACMA or Saturday night Latin Jazz i a historical place that broadens their horizons by including an outdoor venue to gather people from all walks of life! Sitting on the lawn.. watching the diverse group gathered with a common goal.. the enjoyment of wonderful music and the love of it! Single, families, date night.. The Summer music series is one to bring out of town guests to and show off LA style.PS. It goes without saying that the Museum itself is a treasure to be shared.. and visited over and over!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sefaspicks
40,Local Surprise,"Recently, my husband, daughter, and I spent a long weekend in Los Angeles. We visited most of the major attractions, but we realized we had never taken our daughter to the LA County Art Museum. We spent a very enjoyable morning touring the Expressionism exhibition and then toured the permanent collections. We have taken our daughter to major museums around the country but not to a great art museum less than 2 hours from home, This museum is often overlooked but well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommytoamy
30,Major art museum,"This is a collection of buildings. The main building has marvelous paintings, etc. Some walking is required to visit all the buildings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OphSeattle
50,A great place for history!,It's a nice historical place and you can spend whole day visiting the museum. I wish I had more time to spend there and visited all of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/590alir
50,Variety of art and good special exhibits,"LACMA has an eclectic collection of art items in all mediums. Located on Wilshire Blvd next to the La Brea Tar Pits, the museum is easy to visit. Street parking is free on Sundays (!). Recently saw a great special exhibit on Expressionist art; this is closing 14 Sept 2014 so be sure to visit if you have an interest in this particular era of art (additional admission to this exhibit). Also check out Metropolis II, an incredible piece of art in motion that is a scaled down version of a bustling metropolis. The Japanese Pavilion is a beautiful piece of architecture with some interesting art; just strolling the ramps from top to bottom is relaxing and very cooling on a hot day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerjon
30,Horrible layout,"After seeing museums all over the world, this has to be one of the worst. Horribly laid out, no rooms connect so you waste most of your time trying to get to what you want to see. The employees are rude and do not help you get around. The exhibits are so sparse, don't waste your time unless you can snag it on a free day, and it's raining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennred_2
50,Great!,"Interesting museum with a great selection of artists, my husband and I loved the Impressionists and lightening installation. Prices much over the European average, 25$ if you want to see all the collections. Also the prices at the shop were exaggerates, they haven't the normal stamps every museum have, only really expensive paintings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliejam_86
40,Van Gogh to Kandinsky exhibit,"This show displays a substantial number of canvases by masters such as Van Gogh Matisse Gaugin and Cezanne.Many German expressionists are also well represented such as Kirchner Nolde and others.Hard to figure out the overall scope and goal of the show as prominent artists such as Klee are somewhat ignored.Yet seeing many of the works is a joy.Using artificial light only ,over dark walls and often with glass panes over the canvasses does not offer optimum viewing conditions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MILOUW
50,Art in Europe before WW1,This museum always has interesting exhibits. I love the good food you can find their cafeteria. The Japanese pavilion is worth a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/242ellenk
30,"German Expressionism, Great collection, but difficult to navigate","Visited for the special admission Van Gogh to Kandinsky exhibit and was disappointed there wasn't more information or context about the art available. I downloaded the mobile guide, expecting some narration, but it was mostly just brief textual descriptions, and even that was only available on very limited specially marked items in the exhibit. Most of the items exhibited had zero description, explanation or detail provided. There were several brief overview informational postings on the wall in each room, but that was very broad and general. I am not an art student or an expert, so I was hoping to learn something from my visit. The only guide or catalog available is a $75 hardcover book that is 295 pages and is more text book than exhibition detail. It does have plates of some of the items, and a listing of all the pieces, but no pictures, not even thumbnails of several of my favorites. I was at least hoping to purchase a postcard or small print of my favorites, but again... nothing available. Only one or two items of the art in the exhibit were even included at the gift store. I guess I should have snapped more pictures while walking through. Several of the best pieces were noted no photography, so I thought they would at least offer some other memento item for sale, but no luck. There were many brilliant pieces exhibited, I LOVED the art, but I was disappointed in the limited options for saving and sharing memories of my trip other than filing past it once in a long line.Although the special exhibit was very busy, the rest of the museum was spaciously displayed and not crowded at all... again... lots of art, very little context or depth.I ate at the LACMA cafe, somewhat small and at 230 in the afternoon, many of the tables were unoccupied and still dirty. Parking was readily available and convenient in the underground garage, which was well-lit. Worth the trip, but I wasn't especially impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethG656
50,Don't let 'county' fool you!,"This is a brilliant museum. We went for the current Van Gogh to Kandinsky exhibition but saw much more as well. Be prepared for a half day or more if you have the time- we rushed due to our schedule and would love to return. If possible, go on Sunday when Metropolis II is running! Serra's Wave (I think it's called that) is stunning, and the Japanese Art building alone is beautiful as were the kimonos and more. A varied, spacious museum. Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zvic2018
50,"Great Art, Great Architecture","A fantastic collection, beautifully displayed with helpful guides. Try to get there in time for one of the Guiders tours. And when you are hungry cross the road and choose from one of the many Food Trucks that park opposite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wardieeee
40,LACMA,"Great museum, not too huge, but a really nice collection and across the street is food truck row! Plenty of nearby parking and it's next to the La Brea Tar pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dbeckz01
30,A bit overpriced...,"We came for a couple of hours and paid extra to see the Van Gogh to Kandinsky exhibition - it felt quite pricey and we weren't blown away, especially in comparison to some of the London museums - but perhaps we just aren't 'arty' enough meh!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ImiKof
40,"Disappointing policies and collection of Islamic art, but very good East Asian","The museum is grand - 9 buildings. They do have some awesome collections, especially in East Asian art and artifacts. However, they also famously have the second biggest carpet in the world, from Ardabil, Sefevid Empire (an Azerbaijani Turkic empire that encompassed all of Iran and many of the neighboring lands). Unfortunately, the carpet was not on display, and neither one of the attendants knew when would it be or when was it last on display. They did not even know the name of the curator, or any contact information. Also, the interpretations of many of the artifacts are somewhat unequal, with clear favoritism of one culture over the others. Thus, on one hand we do have an excellent and extensive collections, yet on the other there are many small problems due to poor curation and clueless staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Historian20
30,Love the LACMA lights,"Great photo op, the real test is trying to get a photo without the dozens of other camera toting tourists in the background!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicab248
50,A Fun Filled Day,Be prepared to spend a lot of time at LACMA which is well worth it. I could almost spend an entire day and appreciate art they have displayed. The architecture is very attractive which sets it apart from other museums. The art collection is very fast so you can easily spend half a day. Stay till the evening if you can when all the lamps in front of the building light up. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nass673
50,Its freeky to stand under that boulder,"If you don't know what I am talking about, Google it and go. Art takes us on all kinds of emotional journeys. The sensations from ""levitated Mass"" were not ones I associated with art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IbrahimA265
50,Energy and vitality,"We renewed our annual 2-person membership ($110) to LACMA after a lapse of several years and were so impressed with the new buildings, the number of excellent tours, activities and concerts available. The collection has always been remarkable but there is a new energy at the museum, and our experience was very stimulating and enriching. We followed 2 docent led tours, which were both fantastic. It was great to see so many families enjoying our LA treasure, and there are many great activities for kids. Bravo LACMA -- can't wait to return! It was easy to take the whole day there and easy to bring one's own meal with all the places on the grounds to picnic. The website and free LACMA wifi has a section called TOUR, which takes the place of a traditional audio tour -- so bring your pad or smart phone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Triptots
50,Day of Art,"LACMA is one of the best places to spend a day in Los Angeles. There is always so much to see, but right now I have to recommend the Turrell installation ""Breathing LIght."" You must sign up for a time at the box office and there is an iPad set up to do that. Really, don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christianne526
30,"If you look hard, you'll find the ""masterpieces""","But if you just want an extensive wander through some darn good Western art, art of the ancient Americas and a pavilion for Japanese art, LACMA (Los Angeles County Museum) can fill the bill. The complex is made up of nine buildings with an outdoor cafe if you need refreshment. I caught an interesting special exhibit on the progression of expressionism in the beginning of the 1900s. All the big names and set in context of expressionism. What I didn't do is check out the view of the Hollywood sign, or the 202 vintage street lamps collected by artist Chris Burden. Overall lots to do and see. And yes you'll see Picasso and Diego Rivera and a few more masterpieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaybirdHyderabad
50,Great even if you don't like art,"It's worth going just to see the building and surrounding area. If you like the Steve Martin movie ""LA Story,"" they filmed some scenes here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Celebrity_Concierge

30,LACMA,"The special exhibit was ""interesting."" The rest of the museum complex is sprawling and you need VERY good walking shoes. The permanent collections looked a little tired. If you're used to art in NYC or Paris - forget it unless there's an exhibit you'd love to see.The best part about it is the lamp-post installation in the entry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Justbetweenyouandme
50,A day or more of fun and culture,"Adults and families alike can spend an entire day exploring the LACMA Museum Complex. Onsite parking is reasonable and plentiful and you are close to other museums in downtown L.A. including the Petersen Automotive Museum, the Hollywood Costume Museum, the La Brea Tar Pits, and more. The onsite dining is excellent and there are also usually a bunch of food trucks parked right outside on the street. The permanent exhibits are excellent and there are always a couple of interesting special exhibits as well. Don't miss ""Metropolis II,"" an amazing installation that's like a cross between a giant slot-car track, a model train set, and a miniature city built of really interesting materials.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stefaniya
50,Great museum,"Just great overall. Highly recommend if you are into art museums. Really liked everything about it. It has a fine permanent collection, and we have seen a number of special exhibits, such as the current one on modern art from Van Gogh to Kandinsky, that we really liked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kwh
50,A excellent Place to experience Art,"Great place filled with fun things to do, and also many picture perfect opportunities.Interesting exhibits, frequent outdoor musical entertainment, fantastic architecture.The museum also always has great exhibits going on which is worth the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/777Amanda786
50,Lots of good art to see in a multi-building city campus,"LACMA is the place to go for the majority of touring exhibits that happen to stop in Los Angeles. The ticketed exhibitions are always first-rate and worth a visit. You may have to make reservations, but there are off-peak times when you could arrive and be issued a ticket for entrance within an hour. Members would fare much better in this regard.The permanent collection is very good and fairly diverse. My favorite part is the Indian art which resides on the top floor of the Ahmanson Building. The other floors contain really nice painting and sculpture. I usually spend most of my time in the Ahmanson unless there is a special exhibit in the Resnick Pavilion. Definitely check out the Broad Contemporary Art Museum even if it is just to marvel at the size of the elevator (I prefer going up and down the stairs on the outside of the building). Whatever your take is on contemporary art, the building offers a cool space in which to roam around.The Pavilion for Japanese Art is very good. If you like big screen painting or netsuke, this building is a must-see. Give yourself a good 45 minutes in this building if you want to really admire all the art without hurrying.Overall, the campus vibe is very good, and there will likely be many people having a bite to eat outdoors, chatting among friends, taking photos of the architecture, etc. If you want to see everything--and you don't suffer from ""museum burn-out""--I'd recommend setting aside at least three hours; more if you want to grab a bite to eat too.“Levitated Mass,” the 340-ton boulder that sits above a concrete trench, is something you should see just to satisfy curiosity about something that created a major fuss back in 2012. Note that the support shelves affixed to the trench walls kill the illusion of levitation. Oh well …Further notes:(1) If you are from out of town, visit the website and make note of the current and future special exhibits. Some are really worth it, and may not be going to many other museums.(2) If you’re driving on the I-10 Freeway to get to LACMA, I’d recommend exiting on La Brea instead of Fairfax. The former intersects Wilshire farther to the east of the museum, but the drive between the freeway and Wilshire is usually much faster. Fairfax has fewer lanes, which produces slower traffic.(3) The parking garage is convenient and actually pretty nice, but if you go on a Sunday and arrive early there’s a good chance you’ll be able to find free parking (meters not active) on local streets on the south side of Wilshire within two blocks of the museum. $12 savings … not too far of a walk.(4) The LACMA café is pricey but there’s a decent selection of food and you can pick it up fast. I eat there during most visits and usually get a salad. Ray’s is supposed to be really good (dig the décor) but I have yet to dine there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimL239
40,A spacious place to experience art in many forms,The grounds are expansive for the middle of the city. At no time did we feel crowded. The parking was good and immediately accessible.

50,A Multi-Building Art Museum with Something for Everyone,"This is a rambling museum that contains new delights around each corner. Much of it is broken into styles or genres by building or areas of each building. Get a map, as there are places you'll never find otherwise; the map is also helpful to find restrooms or the cafe. Most of it is under shelter, so it's a great place for a rainy day. It is located near the La Brea Tar Pits, so we combined the two for most of one day's touring. There is a fee, so allow yourself at least three or more hours. Don't rush - there is so much to view, but you will not see it all anyway, so pick what areas you want to see. What interested us was the great blend of modern and classical art. When you get tired, get a coffee and relax outside in the cafe area. We also discovered a dozen or so ""food trucks"" nearby on Wilshire Blvd where we enjoyed a casual lunch before entering the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/117carla
50,Awesome Exhibits,"I have loved this museum since I was a little girl. What a treat to be able to take my grand daughters here and watch them oh and ah over the exhibits. We visited the restaurant on site, and the amount of food they serve is amazing. We thought it was going to be a typical tourist trap serving of food for a high price. We had to ask for boxes to take the food with us. When we went into the museum, the young lady at the window offered to hold on to the bag for us while we went inside. They have customer service down, and little kids do not phase them. Kudos for a great staff and thanks for a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynC777

30,A fair collection in eight separate buildings,"LACMA is a relatively new museum in the world of museums, built in 1965, and the collection shows it. The collection of Meso American artifacts is quite good, however the collection of European art is quite skimpy. Since the paintings have been relatively recently acquired there is no consistent acquisition to reflect all periods. I like the Impressionist collection because it seem to reflect a serenity of the paintings acquired.We like the restaurant which was reasonably priced, but elegant plates. The cheese board could have been served successfully in France as the cheeses were appropriately aged and had not emerged from a fridge in the back. It is also a delightful place for people watching, some elegant and some not. Fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/570RobertW570
50,Wonderful time,"I went here on a whim with friends to view a Tim Burton exhibit (2011) and we all were pleasantly surprised at not only that display, but the other exhibits on the site... so much so that my friends (who live in LA) bought a membership.

50,"James Turrell, Artist with Light","Wonderful installation which must be experienced. It's free with admission and perspective-altering. The Pacific Island Exhibition is good too, revealing connection among all primitive cultures. Finally, Futbol in the Broad wing is right on trend and very entertaining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Colson1010
50,Van Gogh to Kandinsky and more,"WOW, I was actually on my way to the La Brea Tar Pits and stumbled into LACMA by accident. What a brilliant exhibition and I truly loved just meandering at my leisure to see everything. Who would have thought this unexpected find would allow me to see so many beautiful works of art. Every favourite Post Impressionist, Cubist and Fauve artist you can think of is in this blockbuster exhibition.I also loved the Egyptian antiquities (found in the Hammer Building) and Japanese Art (Pavillion of Japanese Art) as well. Sculptures abound, inside and out.Had the best soy flat white in the cafe outside the Hammer Building (finding a decent coffee venue in the USA proved to be quite difficult so all in all my day was an abundance of bonus'). I even saw artwork by three of my favourite artists - Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Pablo Picasso. I was in art and culture heaven! This place is definately worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TvlBug67
30,Disappointing destination,"We found the museum to be overstuffed and the employees less than friendly. The signage needs to be improved to make navigation easier. We had hoped for more displays, however, we did enjoy our lunch in the open air cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolanddavid_12
50,"Current Exhibit ""Van Gogh to Kandinsky""",A beautiful collection of pieces from well-known painters as well as those less well-known. Enjoyed every piece! It's a real treat to see many of these paintings!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiredmotherof3
50,"Art for all, well done LACMA!","Truly a big city art collection, worth several visits to explore and enjoy. Something for everyone to see, enjoy and learn. Highlight of our recent visit was the special exhibit - From Van Gogh to Kandinsky, Expressionism in Germany and France. Beautifully curated exhibit with just the right level of commentary. It takes a thoughtful journey from late impressionist through to the more abstract. I had not seen those linkages so well laid out before. Gained a new appreciation for the influence of Cezanne and Gauguin, this thoughtful exhibit made it all fall together and gave this art lover a way into cubism she never had before. Feasted my eyes on old loves and new favorites.On another note, the Calder exhibit was engaging as well. I really enjoyed the very accessible collection. The shadows were a special feature that I. Had not really been conscious of before. Well done, LACMA.And don't miss a chance to try out the red egg chairs at Ray Starks, the pizza was spicy and tasty too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoCaribe
40,interesting Arcitecture,"Day and night, this might be an attraction to your family. At first I thought there is no bid deal, however, there is no shortage of people who comes to take a lot of shots.Please note, it is FREE, so this post is incorrect for a FEE. However, Parking at the location is not free before 7pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SekBoy
50,Don't leave LA without a visit to LACMA,"This museum has a wonderful permanent collection, fabulous rotating exhibitions, beautiful setting on LA's famous Miracle Mile.

50,World Class Museum in Los Angeles,"LACMA is definitely a must stop in LA. Probably a top 2 with The Getty. A great and diverse collection along with a variety of temporary exhibits that are worth every penny. The curation is world-class, BUT the lighting on many of the artworks is terrible. It was a shame especially on the Van Gogh to Kandinsky Exhibit. Also the lack of rental guides is a shame. You can download a tour for free on your phone, but you need to REMEMBER TO BRING HEADPHONES!!!! (which I did not!) The tour is also very limited. First thing you do GO REGISTER FOR A APPOINTMENT TO SEE THE James Turrell piece - you will not regret it. Its surreal!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JetSet1959

40,Jazz @ LACMA: Free Summer Concert Series,"I'm always looking for FREE attractions in the Los Angeles area (believe it or not, there are quite a few free events around town) and this is one not to be missed. Various styles of jazz are highlighted during the season and the prestigious artists that are featured are very impressive. We're not talking just the outstanding musicians found locally; we're talking world-renowned talent. And it's FREE! Do get there early (most shows begin at 6:00 with two sets during the evening) because seating is limited. Food and drink (alcohol, too) are available around the museum courtyard. Public parking lots are available within a reasonable distance. If you park on the street, be sure to pay attention to the parking signs.The series usually begins in late Spring - check their website for details: http://www.lacma.org/programs/music/jazz-at-lacma",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaO22
40,Dont go for the soccer exhibit,"Nice museum w/ nice and eclectic permanent collections but dont go for the soccer exhibit. Its small and in the opinion of 3 fans, of poor quality. For a World Cup year, they could have done much much better. That exhibit drew us there but luckily the rest was worth seeing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sccrref
40,Cool museum,"The LACMA is a very well-maintained and large museum.The exhibits are great, and there are also a variety of special visiting artists/exhibitions.You can either park at the LACMA or find street parking, which in my opinion isn't that difficult.Students (with a student ID) get a discount, and the yearly membership is a great deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tunaidi

50,Serene and ambitious.,"Serene, feels isolated, lovely – even though busy busy Rt. 1 is right below and there were hordes of shrieking school kids when I was there. This reconstructed Roman villa is a model of grace and beauty, a true oasis.An exhibit on Byzantine life was GREAT. How often do you get insight into how people lived 2000 years ago?I’m only sorry it took me so many years to finally visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nealf630

40,Worth A Look,LACMA as it is known is a quality museum with well mounted exhibits and some interesting displays. If you they are showing a specific exhibit you would like to see or even if you have an afternoon you feel like sone culture you can find it here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyNYLA
40,Great museum for summer nights,"While LACMA might not rival museums like the Tate in London, Prado in Madrid, or Louvre in Paris, it is still a great place to visit. It is really three museums. The main museum, the Broad and Resnick for contemporary art, and the Japanese Pavilion for Japanese art. All summer long there is free music on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. The food and drinks at Ray's and the Stark Bar are great, but the real treat is across Wilshire Blvd where you will find LA's best food trucks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lanny_Zie
50,Great Art Museum-wonderful for kids!,"Make sure you stop in to the children's area. Our boys, 8 & 4 years old at the time, received LACMA badges and free admission. With their admission they were able to bring in one adult each, so our trip here was free of charge. There was an area for them to paint and explore art materials with us. Very family friendly. They enjoyed some of the outside installation art pieces with dad while I explored the fantastic modern art collection inside. This was a favorite part of our LA trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donnamite
50,"Free jazz on summer Friday nights, Latin music on Saturdays",It is delightful to see how many people turn out for the free jazz and Latin music nights in the summer. Groups make plans to gather for a picnic; families bring kids and dogs. You can easily buy food and drinks if organizing the picnic didn't happen. Can combine with museum visit on Friday nights as museum is open til 8. Or make those reservations for dinner at Ray's and Starks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebD615
30,We expected more...,"Maybe our expectations were too high after all the Ballyhoo. I would say at least 40% of the museum was either closed for reconstruction, accessible for members only, or reserved for special exhibitions. The rest was crowded by school groups who had their own approach to art. We thought it would take us all day but after 3 hours we were done. Overall, we found it ok but were not overly impressed.Hints regarding parking:The LACMA parking garage is underneith the LACMA and the access is from the rear (W 6th Str). Set your GPS to the intersection of W 6th Str and S Fairfax Ave and you will find it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosC172
40,One of the Secrets of LA,LACMA is one the many museum that LA has but its a must even for people that don't like museums. You have plenty of reasons to go to this place.Only the set of light poles that are outside are a reason to go and enjoy the multiple photo opportunities. The displays inside are even more interesting with several fascinating exhibits and unique works of arts that can only be display in a place like LA.I would come again any time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RMartinSDXB
30,LACMA EXPANDED,"I came to LACMA to see a special Chinese Painting exhibition. It was an outstanding exhibit. It has been many years since my last visit. Several new buildings have been added to the complex. My interest is Asian Art and those were the galleries that I visited. The Japanese Art is minimal to see other than the screens. The screens are displayed such that it is difficult to see close-up and look at the finer details. Korean collection was closed in preparation for an upcoming exhibition. The Chinese collection was not on view because of the special Chinese Painting exhibition. The SEA and Islamic Art collections were open; and there were many magnificent objects to see. A separate building housed contemporary art exhibits which were interesting. There is an underground parking garage.Food in the regular cafe was mediocre. My hamburger was dry and overcooked. My friend's black forest ham pannini was not cooked thoroughly and cold to eat. The salad bar had a meager selection of items to make a salad. In another area was another restaurant, Ray's, that is very good. Their pizzas and salads were delicious. There are a few other outdoor cafes for coffee and snacks.LACMA is a sprawling place. It is daunting to see everything in one visit. Besides the art collection, LACMA also offers many other activities for members and visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoldenFeet
50,History Keeper,This Place is awesome... Recommended for those who are art lovers.... The Best Art is stored here. its a must visit place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesmW6530VB
40,"A Little Bit of Everything, Worth a Visit!",We enjoyed our Saturday afternoon visit here and were quite surprised to learn just how extensive the collections are at LACMA. They even have some Egyptian and Assyrian artifacts and reliefs.The Japanese art was exceptionally beautiful and well presented! It took us approximately 3 1/2 to 4 hours to stroll through and look at most everything. We'll return!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parisienfoodisgood
50,Something for everyone; even if you think you don't like art museums you will love this museum!,"A surprise around every corner with some cutting edge architecture, creative and playful outdoor installations, and the classic paintings you would expect. Don't miss the Japanese pavilion at the edge of the museum campus, adjacent to the tar pits. Food options are excellent with cafe, restaurant and coffee bar provided by Patina, one of LA's top restaurants. Underground parking is plentiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaL540
40,"Eclectic Collection, Interesting Complex","Locally known as LACMA, this is a good art museum that is housed in a collection of four different buildings. Friday's in the summer there are free jazz performances in an outdoor courtyard that are fun.

50,More than Art,A trip to LACMA is not just for art lovers. One will find interactive sculptures that will make you feel like a child again and question your size/place in this world. There are two cafes. live music events (sometimes) and a world class gift shop. Several buildings and and a variety of art themes for all genres. Don't miss the Calder and Judd pieces in the lower water garden or a trip around the La Brea tar pits. I'm so proud to have this museum in Los Angeles!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seehoustonlosAngeles
50,Amazing,"For a city collection this museum is astounding. There are several buildings, and the collection of modern and 20th century art is wonderful. There are lots of things for children to do, and often lots of activities going on. It's almost attached at the hip with the La Brea Tar Pits museum and grounds, so plan to spend at least a day on the whole block. Do not miss the Japanese netsuke collection in a separate building!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OranVa
50,Art lovers will drool...,"There is literally something for everyone here. They have movies, live concerts, and every kind and style of art you can imagine. Just on one floor, the value of the art there had to be in the double digit millions. Lots of parking on the back side",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xdavec
50,So Much To See,"PLEASE, Get a membership because you will definitely want to RETURN to see more and more. This is a first class art museum. Summer JAZZ nights at Hancock Park with the museum are fun. The exhibits are great. With so much to see, you'll spend three hours and not have gotten to it all. If you love art - you will adore LACMA. Parking is $10, cash only or you can prepay at the ticket booth with credit card before you leave. The staff working the rooms are really nice, informative, helpful. The metro II exhibit is lots of fun, great way to introduce children to the art world. There is an outdoor restaurant and bar. Many restrooms, all well maintained. Just loved LACMA from the first time and will always enjoy a visit every month or so. Great Great Great place. Afterwards, there are so many fantastic restaurants in the area - that you can relax and enjoy and discuss your day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whocareswhoiam
40,Large complex to tour,"Visiting friends in Los Angeles, my friend and I spent an interesting afternoon at LACMA. There is underground parking and an elevator up to the complex level. With several buildings (each with several floors to choose from) there is plenty of art to experience here. Each building serves a particular genre/group of art. We toured the American wing and saw photographs in another building for a special exhibit.I enjoyed the visit. The galleries are large enough that one can view the art without bumping shoulders or feeling rushed to see things. I particularly enjoyed the craftsman furniture and pottery.We took a break and enjoyed coffee in an onsite café, though there was seating outside in the pavilion between the collection buildings.Later on Friday night, we returned with blankets and a picnic for the jazz evening. I think it's a worthy stop on a tour to Los Angeles.Special note: LACMA is adjacent to the La Brea Tar Pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nittie
30,"excellent collection, unfortunate display","This museum has a superb collection, but the display of the pieces and the limited amount of information provided explaining the pieces made this a disappointing visit, especially after visiting The Getty and Norton Simon.Unless you have something specific in visiting here, or lots of time to fill, I would not recommend this. It's always tough on the feet spending time at a museum, and my feet insisted after an hour that I leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anthony-Susan
50,Several Separate Big Parts Make a Whole...,"Nothing to dislike, except maybe that it is too big to see in one day.You can select one part and see an exhibit in depth, or get quick impressions of several buildings in one visit. There are interesting temporary exhibits and permanent collections. There are places to rest and eat & drink something, when exhaustion sets in. There are lots of things to see outside, too. Parking is best across the street (for a fee).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loreb828
50,Something for everyone!,"There is a Calder exhibition that is fascinating going on now. It spans his whole career from his early mobiles to his most intricate designs and stabiles.There are photo exhibits, modern paintings and a strong impressionist collection to name a few of the many offerings. The various buildings and grounds are spacious and well laid out.The cafe is a plus when you have had enough walking and can't absorb another example of great art.Underground parking is $10 and worth every penny on a bright, hot California day. The museum opens at 10:30 or 11.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dryFlyfisher
50,The Grounds around the museum are fabulous!,"If you have some time to kill before catching your plane at LAX, I would recommend walking around this area. We had less than an hour and instead of sitting at the airport we walked around the museums. The tar pits were interesting. The sculpture gardens outside the LAMCA were interesting. They offered us photo opportunities and exercise. The coffee shop upstairs between the buildings at LAMCA had great coffee and yummy sweet and savory treats for reasonable prices. I have to get the recipe for the BTO, better than Oreo, cookie!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gmanbumpy
50,Lovely museum,"I'll preface this to say I live in NYC so I can be a bit of a snob where art and/or LA are concerned. I loved LACMA. I happened to go on free second Tuesday, so that was certainly nice. $10 to park across the street was more than reasonable. The grounds are very nice, the map is helpful to know which building you want to go to, and there are numerous places to sit and have a drink. I'm mostly a European art guy, and found the collection very nice indeed. It's not huge but there are some great pieces. I especially liked the many Picassos, and the areas dedicated to German art, but there are quite a few Impressionists and Surrealists and Abstract Expressionist, etc. A nice survey, if you will. The top floor of that building has Asian art, some nice Buddhas and Shivas, etc. I also liked the mesoamerican art and don't miss the Japanese Pavillion. The architecture itself is enough to enjoy that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LMarlowe
50,LACMA,"Greetings, Mr Easy724 here,Believe or not, one of my favorite places in Los Angeles is the LA County Museum of Art. I realize that may sound kind of funny, but this place has just about everything, it is indeed a world class museum with an incredible collection of art to suit just about every taste from the classic to the modern, it has a veritable myriad of programs offered to the public, there are film programs, art programs, music programs etc., etc., etc. One of my favorite events at the museum is ""Jazz at LACMA"", if you're visiting Los Angeles for the first time, this would be a great cool down moment after a long day of touring our fair city, some of the best jazz musicians in the country have played there and it's absolutely ""free"". I haven't been there so far this year but you can bet before the summer's over I will be there. There are quite a few restaurants in the area, there is actually one on the campus and ""the Grove & Farmer's Market"" are not too far away with shops, movies and more restaurants, so check this place out I'm sure you'll love it, the music starts at 6 pm so get there early to get a seat. Oh yes, jazz is every Friday night and I believe there is Latin jazz on Saturdays, don't quote me",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrEasy724
40,Take your time and stroll,"The grounds are large and there is the awesome Stark Bar for pit stops. The art on display is impressive, even if some of the walkways are a little shabby. It kind of adds to the LA feel. Like going into a Bob's Big Boy, it belongs in another age. There are cool Picassos and I was happy to find a few Magritte paintings. Overall a great way to kill a few hours. Don't miss the La Brea Tar Pits right next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DBuksh
50,Too big for one day!,"If you love art, you have to see the LACMA museum complex while in LA. The only problem, however, is the sheer size of the complex. LACMA covers several acres utilizing several multi-story buildings to exhibit art from several cultures around the world. The La Brea Tar pits are also in the museum complex.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
50,If you Live in Los Angeles You Need to Visit Here!,"Whether you like modern art, the Renaissance, Asian culture or the Masters, you'll love this wonderful gem by the La Brea tarpits. This is a two-for-one day where you pay to see the Museum (plan on spending from opening to closing with a quick lunch at the LACOMA cafe and then walk next door to view the tar pits (it doesn't take long). Parking across the street is only $10 and they give group, student, senior and military discounts. If you live close enough, you might even want to get an annual membership and support the local arts at the same time. The outside art is featured in a ton of movies and TV shows and you'll recognize it. All in all, this is a fabulous, culturally wonderful day. Pay attention to the traveling exhibits and try to see them before they leave. I saw the King Tut display years ago and my adult children still remember seeing it when they were kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllieRKay
40,A wonderful museum with a diverse collection,"I spent an afternoon at LACMA while on a business trip to LA, and found it delightful. There are other museums with larger collections, but this one has plenty to keep you busy, even if you like long days at museums. I focuses on the Latin American and Japanese collections, and was especially interested in the remarkable pre-Columbian American pieces, the colonial Latin American art, and the Japanese netsuke. The netsuke (miniature Japanese sculptures used as counterweights to traditional ""wallets"") were particularly interesting in both variety and quality Some of my friends spent time with the European collection and were equally impressed. The museum is also interesting architecturally, with plenty of (shaded) open space among the various buildings, and a cafe in the center. Definitely worth a visit while in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/profe1967

I did not know it existed.It has an excellent collection of European painting from medieval to modern.The collection of netsuke is the best outside of Japan and very special.Really very good indeed.Have not checked out the contemporary anf American art which I presume will br even better.I woulg go here before the Getty if art is the goal.2 days required.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wdtaylor1066
30,Confusing Museum with a great Calder Special Exhibit,"If it had not been for the outstanding special exhibit staged by Gheary Associates with extraordinary examples of Alexander Calder's mobiles and stabiles from the Calder Foundation, we would have been very disappointed in LACMA. It is a series of buildings with vastly different architectural styles that we found jarring and difficult to navigate. The Calder exhibit was in the Piano building which was OK but a bit sterile. The other buildings were merely confusing with a so-so collection that didn't seem to go anywhere or leave you with a distinct impression. Besides the Calder exhibit we liked the Japanese art in a Tea House-type building. We finally found the original Calder that had been commissioned by LACMA at its inception in 1965(?) but none of the guards/guides we asked about it could tell us where it was! It's at the (east?) end of the building adjacent to the Tar Pits and well worth the search!The brochure, received at the admission stand, was not at all helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billie88
50,Fun filled day,"General adult $15Student with ID $10Parking $10The LACMA was on my list of go-to places for awhile. Glad I finally got to visit.The place is huge! You can spend an entire day here if you wanted. Time goes by so fast.There's an easy to find parking lot directly across the street for $10 flat rate. As other reviews stated, there may be meter parking but I always avoid that useless endeavor.Pick a building and start sucking in all that art essence. There's something here for everyone no matter what your taste in art is. They have it all. Paintings, creepy sculptures, ancient artifacts, modern furniture, and crap...ehhhm..excuse me...artwork that just makes you say ""What the hell is that!"" True, not everything was my cup tea but ,nonetheless, I was fascinated and wanted to see more.Ahh, a section of Picasso paintings. Now there we go! Security guard tells me no pictures allowed before I get a chance to point and shoot!??!That aint gonna happen.…I snapped a few later on when he wasn't looking.I was parched after a few hours so we headed to The Stark Bar. Had some fried oysters and drinks outside. Great place to sit and relax.Other outdoor things to see are the Levitated Mass, sculpture garden and definitely Urban Light.The street lamps are amazing and fun to be in.Outside the Ahmanson building is the Golden Showers exhibit. Very popular.The La Brea Tar Pits are a short walk next door as well.Fun day, lot and lots to see, glad I had the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephb405

50,Fantastic Compilment to The Getty Center,"After you've done The Getty, make sure you visit the LACMA. It is completely different experience, but equally worth it in my opinion. The museum has constantly changing touring exhibitions. We saw the amazing Kubrick exhibition which was was unlikely to come to Australia.There seems to a view from abroad that LA is a cultural desert, but I find it one the most diverse and extensive art communities in the world. Don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTravellerReview

They have great permanent collections, but have featured some of the best traveling shows in Southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/labonnevie

40,A World Class Museum,"First of all, I have been a member of the museum for many years. Now that I am retired I go there very often. They are open every day except for Wednesday. Often, I go just to take a docent tour of one of the galleries. There are so many wonderful exhibits to see as well as their permanent art collection. We also go to Ray's often for dinner and enjoy the Friday evening jazz concerts as well. I can't say enough about this wonderful museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Giudita
10,"While some of the modern art is great, the collection us uneven","Have visited LACMA for more than 35 years: I think it's gone downhill a lot: The strange collections of buildings of disparate architectural styles makes one think that there has been poor leadership and bad decision making over the years. This strangeness (expept for the modern collections for the most part) carries over to the exhibits.Plus, one is not made to feel welcome here: Nasty unhelpful guard & personnel, lack of a decent restaurant do not add up to a pleasant afternoon.You can do better at The Getty Center, Getty Villa, & MOCA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WoofWoof39

40,Great Experience,"It is roomy and displays are in great location. The buildings in themselves are wonderful, and the lighting and general ambiance are inspired. So spacious and beautiful. It has such a great modern art collection and it isn't serious and stuffy and serious like the museums in New York. I fell in love with David Hockney's works in this museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carroza
40,Overwhelming!,"A beautiful collection of all kinds of artwork, but this complex of 7 buildings is overwhelming! Although each piece of art has a placard identifying it, only a few have descriptions about its artist or explaining the work. Plain black coffee, iced tea and a cookie from the cafe was $11, but most museum's cafes are pricey. There were many groups of elementary school kids on field trips -- not quite so annoying if you can listen in on the talk from one of their guides. If you're looking for a great museum experience in the LA area, check out the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena. It's smaller and more manageable with just as impressive a collection of art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmj-g
40,Good experiences,"I enjoyed my visit to LACMA. Plenty to see and a wide variety of exhibits. Spend a couple of hours here, plenty for kids to see and do.

50,One of the best experiences to visit Los Angeles County Museum of Art,"The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is an art museum located on Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle Mile vicinity of Los Angeles. LACMA is on Museum Row, and is adjacent to the George C. Page Museum and La Brea Tar Pits. LACMA is the largest art museum in the western United States. It attracts nearly a million visitors annually. Its holdings of more than 120,000 works span the history of art from ancient times to the present. In addition to art exhibits, the museum features film and concert series.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/585cristinab
40,Futbol and Diane Von Furstenburg,"I'm only reviewing these two exhibits because they are the only two I went to today. The Futbol exhibit was good, not great. I'm a huge soccer fan and had much higher expectations. It was a little avant garde for me, especially the bizarre film showing Zidane's last club game where he did nothing. I know that was the point, but it was not very interesting. Loved the first exhibit with the Incredible Hulks vs Spider Men in a stadium full of a variety of fans surrounded by Jesus statues. We thought there could have been more. The DVF exhibit was phenomenal. We loved it, and we love wrap dresses. Her portraits as she is aging were brave and beautiful. We had a great time with this whole exhibit. I was with my 22 year old daughter which is not a choice below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KayM506
50,Lots to see- don't rush it,"I made the mistake of only spending a couple of hours at LACMA, and really it wasn't enough time to see everything at the museum. I looked around the American Arts building which was incredible and beautifully set out, with everything from glass work to fine art painting and jewellery from pre-hispanic mexico. I also looked around the Broad Contemporary Art Museum building which had some great temporary and permanent modern art exhibitions and a view of the Hollywood sign. 'Metropolis' which is a huge model city made out of model buildings, train tracks and match box cars is definitely something to see; they switch it on every hour or so and all the cars and trains whizz around the little city, great for children and adults alike! The outdoor sculptures and gardens are also great, I just wish I'd spent more time there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzannat2013
50,"Amazing, well thought out displays","Went to see the Calder display and took in a few more buildings. Calder was so well displayed and documented. Great location, easy parking, easy movement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NelsonP338
40,A bit of everything,"We enjoyed our visit largely because of the diversity of the offerings. Andy Warhol on one side, Picasso on another, and Islamic art two floors away from Pacific primitives. The pre-Spanish Meso-America exhibit was amazing, possibly the best in the US. The basic entry fee was definitely a Good Deal for the quality and breadth of the collections.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldpo
50,Outstanding collections.,"As a college art professor my visit was entirely up to expectations. Beautifully appointed, excellent staff and facilities. The collections were breathtaking. I shall certainly return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/539_Keith_P
40,comfortable layout for a museum,"Very open, great programs, diverse, enough places to eat at,enough parking, close to other places to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fir0uzeh
50,One of the best museums for an eclectic and engaging collection,"Sculpture, painting, modern, American, European, there was no end to this place. The coffee shop and café area was great. The volunteers, who were mostly senior citizens, were knowledgeable and helpful. Everyone, even non-art lovers, will find something here to enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twoteacherswhotravel
30,Wide array of Collections,LACMA delivers on its promise to show you the world and the past but it is a bit unorganized. Items from 1000s of miles apart and 1000s of years apart are presented in the same room without explanation. They have the great masters and they have some junk. Their attempts at video exhibits fail. Special exhibits cost excessively more. The one shining exhibit is the Japanese collection which is worth a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loren778899
50,A not-to-miss museum,"LACMA is a museum that you can't see in only one visit because of its size and big collection. If you have only one day to visit it, decide which collection to see first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/90Carla
50,A Wealth of Enjoyment,This Museum is a must see; the collections are fabulous and quite diverse. Legendary in the breadth of artwork that is on display' something for everyone. LACMA is a great facility in every respect. Don't miss it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/677carld
50,Best Art Museum in Los Angeles,"The permanent art collections are unbelievable. You can find art from many different time periods and all over the world. They are worth coming back to time and time again.Many of the exhibitions that come through are remarkable, truly some of the best in the world.The La Brea Tar Pits are next door. Between them and the museum, you can contentedly whittle away an entire day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickshaned
50,one of the great museums in the U.S.,So much to see and do here. It has become a world class museum and make certain to include a visit to the Page Museum which is on the same property. It is unique with over a million fossils and bones which have been dug out on-site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolelynns
50,Fabulous Top Notch Museum,Saw an awsome Alexander Cauler Exhibit. Beautiful Museum grounds and so many exhibits it takes days to go through it.Top Notch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathyS181
50,Two good exhibits,Went to see the James Turrell exhibit and was delighted to see it paired with a wonderful Alexander Calder exhibit. Both were terrific. The museum is easy to navigate and well arranged. A lovely coffee shop has delicious sandwiches and very good coffee/tea. Parking easy.This museum is well worth the trip. Try to see Turrell before it leaves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudithS710
40,Art for all,"As someone who is not that into art, it is an amazing place to visit. No mater what your taste in art is, you will find something you will enjoy. It offers so many different genres of art. Make sure you plan to spend a lot of time here because there are numerous, large buildings. I wish I could have seen more, but I enjoyed the time I spent there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/370ryano
50,Could easily spend a few days here,"So many beautiful pieces, lots of different themes to work through...amazing old original pieces. I stopped to listen to one of the talks on the sculptures...fascinating!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzravencan
50,A wonderful collection of museums,"My college student daughter and I love spending the day at great museums. We have seen museums in New York, San Francisco and Seattle among other places. We found LACMA to be excellent; one day was not enough time to see everything. We plan to return soon. Very nice location with parking at the nearby La Brea Tar Pits and Page Museum which we still need to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnusa123
40,Huge Place; Tons to See.,"I wish I had more time to spend here. I didn't account for how big this place is. I would say you could spend an entire day here. It was a little confusing trying to navigate because we came in from the tar pits, so it wasn't the main entrance. Great place for kids but also a great place for adults too. Spending the extra money is worth it too because you can see more exhibits. Fun experience overall, can't wait to go back and see what I missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/981alexandraf
30,Great Children's Arts&Crafts Room to Discover,"Like most other reviews, there is a lot to see, and if you don't enter in through the right building, your route will be destroyed. Again, Parking sucks (like everywhere in LA), and make sure to read the signs or you will be towed. They have a great Norooz Celebration for Persian New Year, which is really fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Guapastravel
50,A Terrific Way to Spend the Day!,"I am always surprised, amazed and thrilled by what a gem LACMA is! At the intersection of Wilshire and Fairfax next to the LaBrea Tar Pits, LACMA offers a great cultural anchor to the shopping obsessed neighborhood. I attended the DVF 40th Anniversary show which was free and fabulous. The exhibit was interesting, mixing fashion, photography and of course Warhol with the history of the wrap dress that made Diane von Furstenberg famous and changed the way women in America dressed!In addition to the DVF show there was a paid entry Calder show and all of the other treasures of LACMA....ran out of time to take it all in....will go back!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJM1225
40,Huge - but not easy to navigate,"There is a LOT of art to se e here and you do get a map of the various buildings in the complex when you buy your ticket ... but once you are inside some of the buildings it can be difficult to find everything. I completely missed the European and Near Eastern art on my first walkthrough but fortunately found it on my pass back through. There are options for kids and plenty of places to grab food or something to drink while you are there. In many respects this is an Art Museum done right, but I do wish that navigation were somehow easier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/897todds
40,This is a gem,Definitely worth half a day if you're in the area. Pretty good collection. Street parking can often be found. Get a map of the buildings so you don't accidentally leave the best til last and have to rush through a the end.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_Jones2014
40,A must-see for art lovers in LA,"I grew to love art when I lived in NYC. This museum is different from those in New York City in that it is housed in a number of different buildings (five or six?), with each having a different art focus, such as modern art, Oriental art, etc. The museum has quite a collection of art and often has special exhibits which are always great. I also enjoy the frequent and often free concerts of Jazz, Latin, or Classical music. There is a pay parking lot ($5) but there are meters behind the museum which are cheaper. Check out the website for the special exhibits and concerts on the weekend. LACMA is a nice half-day visit; you can have lunch there too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OCfoodie92648
50,Great Complex!,"This place is huge and wonderful—make sure you allow plenty of time to explore. We made a special trip to see the James Turrell exhibit, which was a lot of fun (exploration of light and color through 3-dimensional art) and were delighted to find an incredible Calder exhibit on display. The collection of art of the Ancient Americas was very impressive—the artifacts on display were spectacular, and the way they were displayed was very unique. The only area we found lacking was in the contemporary art of Latin America—there just wasn’t much to the collection. We really appreciated the complex staying open through evening hours (8 pm Friday and 7 pm Saturday and Sunday) so that we didn’t feel rushed A special thanks goes to all of the security guards—every single guard we encountered was warm, friendly, and incredibly knowledgeable about the art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthwestLivingTV
40,This museum is huge,"I went with an intention to stay for 2 hours but accidentally the parking meter took the money for 4 hours which is the maximum amount. And good they did because I spent the 4 hours entirely in the museum. I am mostly interested in modern art and there is an entire floor with it - some Picassos, Klees etc. I am not much into installations or classic art so if you like that as well plan well more than 4 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/popkutt
50,A jewel in the heart of the city,"I went here one Saturday morning with my teen son,and I was impressed with the art collections that they had.There were lots to see.It showcased all the works of the famous artists that I was expecting to find.I would definitely come back few months from now and will do at night when the lamps are on!The food trucks in front of the museum was a treat!Parking was just across the street for $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/19871991
50,"Fantastic museum, great collections","The museum is small compared to other art museums I know, but the collections, both archaeological and historical are fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/775blancam
40,Easy to spend a lot of time here,We visited on a Sunday and were impressed by the wealth of things for people bringing children that was on offer. We spent lots of time in several of the exhibition areas and could have spent more but had no more time to do so. Coming from Edinburgh where we also have a lot of exceedingly good art galleries probably makes us score it lower in comparison,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FionaRB
40,Broad collection of limited depth,LACMA has an incredible variety and offers a lot to the curious mind. It doesn't have an incredible depth: 1-2 pieces per major artist at best. But it does have a few major pieces and is a great day out for anyone interested.I am unsure about the value for money if you compare to say the Met in NYC or obviously the Getty but it sti does make for a great day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_Chuck_2011
50,"If you love Calder, DO NOT MISS this show","Calder and Abstraction: From Avant-Garde to Iconic is at LACMA till July 27, 2014. If you love Calder, or have never seen his work, this is an exceptional opportunity to get a full view of this important artist. Our family has always loved his mobiles. But this show, with samples of both his mobiles and stabiles, spanning his entire career, and an exceptional docent-tour, we really learned about this man, his life, and the full scope of his work. Also amazing is that the show venue interior design was done by the Frank Gehry Architecture studio. The presentation this layout provides is an exceptional compliment to the work being shown. Our docent just mentioned this in passing, but it should be better highlighted.Leave plenty of time, like a full day or 2 half days, if you really want to do this museum justice. With 7 or 8 different buildings, there is too much to take in in just a few hours. Or go for only the Caulder-- you'll always remember this experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethN234
50,"So much variety, so little time","This is a great museum. The art and artifacts cover a broad range and a broad time span. There is everything from ancient pottery and metal ware from Asia, to monstrous sized modern sculpture. The impressionists to Mexican artists of the revolutionary era. Nearly every part of the world is represented. There are many outdoor areas to give you a fresh view as you wander from building to building. This is a museum you will want to take in 3-5 hour chunks, and even then you will need to come back several times to see all that there is to offer here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkrissel
40,Big Museum,"This is a sprawling facility, with some really wonderful elements. I particularly enjoyed the Latin American art exhibit. Many of the staff who work there, however, clearly view their visitors as an annoyance. A few were quite nice, but most responded to questions with sullen and abbreviated responses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rbrogan
40,Lots to see,"LACMA, located just west of La Brea and Wilshire and the famous Tar Pits, is a sprawling collection of museums from ancient (a few Greek and Roman pieces) to ultra modern. Ticketing is a puzzle, with a number of different options and many ""up charges"" for specific exhibitions. I wish they had a one price policy. The new parking garage is easy to use. The outdoor spaces are wonderful. But its probably more money than its worth to go inside the galleries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peter515
50,Excellent Museum,A solid collection of the world's great artists. I especially enjoyed seeing those of Rivera and Kahlo exhibits. Several buildings and gorgeous landscaping take you through a diverse collection of art. Would definitely recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CBWorldWalker
50,World class museo.,"Modern but comfortable. Changing exhibits, some are fabulous: van Gogh for example. Unusual building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ethanski
30,An expensive visit,"As a Fine Arts major in college, I always try to get in a little culture anywhere I travel but this museum is not one of my favorites. In addition to the $10 admission, there is an additional $10 fee to see any of the special exhibitions. When I visited, that amounted to a $30 entrance fee in addition to the cost of parking to see a very small Calder exhibit as well as some of the other eclectic but tiny exhibitions. Be sure to wear your walking shoes as the museum is spread out among 5 expansive pavillions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodLandi
50,Urban Light,"Although I didn't have time to check out the actual museum, I ran around the outside seeing the massive rock display and Urban Light. I've seen photos of Urban Light recently and while in LA I made a special trip to see it! The display is pretty cool however there's not much to do but read the information area about it and take a photo or two with the lights or of the lights. We took advantage of the food trucks that were right across the street - I highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katew83
40,A stunning surprise,"We had an afternoon to wait in LA before returning home in the late evening.I had read about LACMA and we thought it sounded interesting.It turned out to be marvellous.We only had about 4 hours so we only saw two floors of the Ahmanson building, mainly modern art and European art.There are lots and lots of treasures to enjoy, Magritte, Rodin, Picasso and the impressionists as well as some fantastic sculptures and paintings by artists previously unknown to me.I am keen to return to LACMA to have a more detailed look around.Finding the car park was not easy but the parking itself was great, the lifts from the subterranean car park are works of art in themselves.When you go, check the web site first, that gives good directions for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349JohnP
50,diverse museum,"lacma is a great museum to get in a little bit of everything. they have great contemporary shows, but also have rooms of antiquities. and everything in between. easy to spend an hour or a day... we always go with our kids on their nexgen cards(kids must be present) and get in for free which is a huge perk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danap675
50,Magnificent shows,"This is a beautiful museum with exciting exhibits. We stop by whenever we are in town from Washington, DC. This time with saw the Alexander Calder show and the James Tarrell show. Spectacular. I particularly enjoyed the Calder show, being able to see each piece from so many angles. Gave me a renewed respect and insight into his work. Unfortunately we rarely see their permanent collection because their special shows are so good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveL143
50,Very cool museum,"this Museum was very nice. The outdoor café is a nice area to seat outdoor, enjoy the weather and take a nice break. The outdoor sculpture were very interesting. The exhibitions in the museum are super nice. Overall a nice place to visit. Parking is across the street. You can find free parking on the street behind the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diachel
50,Terrific afternoon.,"Parking was easy. Just across the street. We loved the permanent exhibits, the gift shop, the outdoor café but our favorite was the outdoor sculpture garden. Lovely to stroll around and then on up to the tar pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viajerarosa
50,Fabulous museum,"I've been to this museum several times now, I always find time when I'm there. It has an open easy feel to it, there is often music in the courtyards in the evening which become very busy on warm evenings. There is something for everyone from ancient to modern. The art work comes from all over the world and is beautifully curated. Whenever I've been there there has been at least one special exhibition that has been well worth seeing. There are lots of places to eat and drink too. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyLS48
50,Beautiful museum that you can spend hours exploring,My wife and I spent about 4 hours exploring the Los Angeles Museum of Art and really enjoyed all of the exhibits. Before you even enter the museum you can have fun walking around the tar pits just outside the museum. Visit the Page museum too if you have time. The museum of art will have exhibits that will interest a wide spectrum of ages and you will enjoy the casual stroll around the beautiful building. This is a must see for anyone visiting Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lumerian
40,Turrell at LACMA is fantastic,"A must see show at LACMA, the James Turrell exhibit is outstanding. His work transcends the usual art parameters and makes 'regular' art seem trivial and banal.On at the same time was a Calder review. This was remarkably similar to the Calder show at Chicago MCA a few years back and really looked like a filler.The venue overall is pleasant enough, offering ample parking and a decent cafe - Ray's. Best to arrive early in the morning if possible as it tends to get busy on weekends and on holidays. Staff are a bit abrupt and overly preoccupied with policing visitors, although some like to offer their own ongoing commentary on the exhibits (this could be funny or annoying depending on your current mood state).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sydneysider3
50,Best Modern Museum,"I've been to a lot of modern museums around the world and this one really stands out to me. SFMOMA is great, but smaller. LACMA is enormous and in the center of the city. You are close to the Farmers Market/Grove if you want to make a day of it. They have a HUGE Jeff Koons exhibit there along with some very unique art/performance art installations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/166ToddS
50,Amazing collection--the depth and breadth is world class,"We loved everything about LACMA, from its locatiopn next to the famed La Brea tarpits, to the various buildings, and public terraces and spaces, to the amazing permanent exhibit and the temporary exhibits as well. Finally, the Coffee and Milk bar was lovely and inviting, and the museum store had beautiful things that we could not pass up./while there we saw: art of the Americas, from pre-Colombian objects to Diego Rivera, we saw Imopressionist, post-Impressionist, Fauvist, and Expressionist art, as well as Pop Art and Op Art. We also saw some religious art. We especialy enjoyed the exhibit on David Hockney and his seven representations of Yorkshire--a unique exhibit. Whatever buildings or exhibits you pick, make sure to set aside at least 4-6 hours for this museum--just to do a cursory walk-through. You will be glad you did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reginalampert
50,Art,I love this place. They always have some new attractions to keep things interesting. It's a pretty big place also so there is plenty of see. Lots of fun things to look at and plenty of places close by to eat at. Make a day of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaniB793
50,Calder is magic,LACMA is a must see for visitors to the LA area. Its substantial collection of art will enrich any viewer.The Alexander Calder show is magic and should not be missed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ctsv157
40,Something for everyone!,"I'll admit that I'm not super interested in classical art but I LOVED the contemporary exhibits. If I were an art buff, there is no doubt I could have spent the entire day here but chose to pass by some of the buildings (i.e. Japanese art). There were several recognizable/famous pieces that I picked out - Monet, Matisse, Warhol, Lichenstein. That's always exciting! I also liked wandering through the outdoor sculpture garden and an afternoon coffee break at their cafe. I wasn't impressed with the hours (closed at 5pm) but was there on a holiday. Small crowds and plenty of areas to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindsayB35
40,Worth a visit,Extensive rang of art. I think the best range of art I have seen of Picasso covering most of his career. I also liked the range of Kandinski paintings following is evolution to abstraction. Best collection of Giacometti sculptures I have seen and lots of lovely Rodin's.The only down side was that the collection is spread over a number of buildings and not always easy to find your way around but the staff were very helpful.Recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/highst25
50,Love it here,"First things first. Parking on the lot is $7 & street parking is $1 per hour from 8am-8pm and free Sundays. Admission is regularly $15, but they have free days (after 5pm for S. Cal. residents, 2nd Tuesdays of the month, etc)There is so much to see and do at LACMA. They have visuals from years and years ago to the present.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisssmee
50,Fabulous James Turrell exhibit,"We were given tickets to an exhibit by an artist I've never heard of and we went without any expectations, though people were raving about the show. They were all right! The show is compelling, slightly disorienting, and leaves one wondering about one's perception of light and space. Terrell's work continues at a sight in the southwest where he is creating an entire campus to harness his vision of light in space and nature. More to learn!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/notcotuit
50,Yes!!,"One of the best stops at LA. I really enjoyed the museum, specially the Gabriel Figueroa (mexican cinematographer), exhibition. Under the Mexican Sky. LACMA is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RicardoRom
50,A great day out - lovely atmosphere and for those who enjoy art then allow 6 hours.,People watching - fascinating when sitting in the outside cafe. Easy access and roomy. Go early and get brunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julieh193
30,Don't take your kids - they are not welcome,"I was in two minds about this review and thought about this for some time....but the bad impression has lingered.LACMA has a great collection housed on a very large site encompassing gardens, multiple buildings and the tar pits and associated museum. You could easily spend days here. We visited only two buildings in a whole afternoon.There is a good restaurant and I would recommend a cocktail at the bar beside the restaurant mid afternoon.Down side is that that don't want you bringing children. The place is crawling with staff. Ot seems there are staff observing staff (not uncommon to see 3-4 in a single room). We were stalked by 2 or 3 at a time because we had kids with us. It was made very plain that family groups with young children are not wanted - art snobs only it seems. Due to the police state library experience we cut our visit short. It was simply too stressful.I have visited previously in a group of three adults and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. So don't take the kids!Bonus - there is a great food van location directly opposite with 5 or 6 vans. Good option for lunch.Beware - the parking outside expires one hour before the museum closes and is a tow-away zone. Apparently this is a common trap for tourists and will cost you around $400.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djfowler
50,great art + La Brea tarpits,"First visit to downtown L.A. I thought my friends were joking when they said the LaBrea tarpits were adjacent to the museum. But it's true. LACMA is world-class. Didn't have time to see it all, but really enjoyed the Japanese art building and the European art. Courtyards were restful and cool on a hot day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerseyjazz
50,It has become the place to be!,"Now with Ray's and Stark's, eating and drinking at the museum has become the place to be and with so many great exhibitions, it is just so fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanandalbert
50,"If you like museums, LACMA is not to be missed...","While it does not have the reputation of the great European museums, LACMA is the best L.A. has to offer. It stretches over seven buildings and covers the gamut, from ancient to modern and everything in-between, while its Latin American and Asian collections are outstanding. You can spend just a few hours or an entire day here, going from one gallery to another, from Indian and Himalayan art to pre-Colombian and Greek and the Impressionists, there is a place where kids could do their own water painting and there is lights exhibit in the evenings - a little bit of everything … There are some lovely outdoor areas for a break, a nice café, a good restaurant, a well stoked and a bit pricey gift shop and live chamber music on Sunday evenings (Jazz and Latin live music also used to be regularly performed – check the website). The La Brea Tar Pits next door are worth a quick visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldnomad_01
40,Interesting and extensive collection.,This museum is more spacious than you might realize. The range of art work is amazing. You really have to consult the map and try to cover everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgalambos
50,the only game in town,"For a town the size of LA, it's a bit surprising that there are only one or two robust art museums, and if I had to pick one, this is the only one there is.Temporary exhibitions are thoughtful and well curated, usually designed to focus on aspects of our community or society that aren't limited to people with resources or media focus. So in that way, as a publicly-funded kinda thing, LACMA is living up to its mandate.Admission fees are a little high for a venue that is tax dollar-subsidized and is tasked to engage with people of all socioeconomic strata; currently parking is $10 and regular admission is $20, plus another $25 or more for temporary exhibitions, although they keep raising the prices all the time.The park surrounding LACMA is public and does not charge a fee to enter it; it's an interesting place to walk around as it has the La Brea Tar Pits on view.You can get coffee and basic lunch-type food on-site, but for real food, if you're on foot, the only real options are east on Wilshire Boulevard (left as you walk out LACMA's front door). The stretch of Wilshire to the west is a retail dead zone, as is Fairfax Avenue in either direction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dagmaragogo
40,A good museum to visit in L.A.,"The museum doesn't have the extraordinary reputation of Le Louvre but considering what Los Angeles can offer in this field, it is a reasonable place to go, specially if the LACMA is having one of the many foreign itinerant exhibitions or a special night time activity. If you are a visitor from another State, you can skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarthaB37
50,Love it so much...I joined.,Yeah its great. Even if you just stand outside on a warm evening and look. Its a great museum. Go an a Friday night and enjoy free jazz on the plaza!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerMargaret
30,dated but give it a go,"something to see if you are an art lover, but this museum has seen better days and currators. The tar pits are an added bonus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annel692
50,Gets Better With Each Visit,"LACMA just keeps on improving. The permanent collection is great, the curated exhibits show imagination and creativity and the grounds keep getting more and more welcoming. Add to that on-site good restaurants and you've got an attractive venue where you can easily spend a full day without a moment of boredom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/321georgem
40,Better than expected!,"I wasn't very excited to visit the museum until I realized how many movie scenes were filmed there, some of my favorite painters with paintings there. It's definitely an amazing place to visit. If you need to visit one or two museums, this is one of them (the Getty Villa is the other). If you don't like art that much, it's okay, they have tons of interesting things even for people who don't like spending a whole day inside a museum. You won't regret it.Also, you can actually bump into famous people there. ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/strangemanners
50,Great Meso American Exhibit,This is a large museum with an expansive and diverse art collection. I especially enjoyed the artifacts and art in their Meso American collection. While waiting for the museum to open I was also able to visit the La Brea Tar Pits which are right next door. That was a happy surprise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GwensGramma
50,Go! It's Fantastic,"I love the open concept of going into different buildings to see varying genres of art. You could only pull that off in the warm climate of California. The only downside is the gift shop which is very expensive. There was a replica of one of the hanging lamps which was crazy expensive, over $15K. I found a pretty close copy in Ikea for $20.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SingletonFamily
50,Something for everyone,"LACMA offers something for everyone. The museum's seven-building complex is located on twenty acres in the center of L.A,. It's collection encompasses virtually the entire spectrum of art. Among the museum’s special strengths are its holdings of Asian and Latin American art, ranging from pre-Columbian to modern featuring the works of Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, and José Clemente Orozco. You can easily spend the entire day as the museum has ammenities like a cafe, a fine store, and outdoor seating areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I4903UTalang
50,Good museum,"I went there on the free admission Tuesday so I had more money to spend in the excellent museum store. I loved buildings with American and modern art. There's something to see for everyone, even native or Asian art (but I'm not a fan).Had something to eat also, quiet cheap and very tasty.Btw try and make an original pic in front of the lamp posts next to the street :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyP247
30,Not bad.,"What can I say, coming from New York, unless in Paris or Rome, the museum scene in LA leaves a little to be desired. But, LACMA did surprise me. Well laid out, some classic and some modern. Worth a trip if spending more than a week in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rufusNY
40,Nice way to spend a few hours with the teens!,"This museum has several buildings to it. The artwork varies from ancient to modern so it's a great place to go to get a diverse look at what we call art. I took my teenagers and everyone was able to find something that stood out to them. In one of the buildings they have a hands on exhibit where kids can do water paints. I think the kids enjoyed this most. Overall, we spent about 2.5 hours here as there is plenty to see. There is also a cafe on the grounds but we did not try it. The one thing not to miss is the Lights exhibit. Try to see it in early evening when the lights are on. It's heavily photographed so bring your camera too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,Remarkable Collection,"Enjoyed the collection. The Turrell exhibit (not sure how long this one will be running) was fascinating. Stood under the 340-ton boulder. Interesting architecture. Japanese netsuke exhibit was amazing. The restaurant was fancy and the food and wine was tasty, if a little pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EclecticChooser
50,Great Islamic display,I visited the museum as part of a research project but must say I was impressed by their displays and the had constant visitors passing through.The inclusion of modern works was a refreshing change. Recommend a visit as a change from Hollywood only attraction!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouRob11
50,A wonderful way to spend a day,The museum complex is quite large allowing you to choose which art you would like to view and enjoy.Lunch was very good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albertm
50,Great art,"If you like art, and you're in Los Angeles, you should really check this place out. There are some really good pieces in their collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wegoplaces4589
50,Best Museum in the city!,"It's big enough that there's always something to see. It's gardens, and outdoor areas are varied and lovely. The Tar Pits are on the grounds and it's bang in the middle of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unprocessed_cook
30,Disappointing,"After the Getty, this was a big let down. The main buildings lack natural light, so the paintings are not shown at their best. The collection covers a wide range of time and styles, but isn't strong in any area (and is especially weak in the Impressionists, our favorite). We would save our time for the Getty and the Norton Simon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jazzbeau1130
40,Modern Art and More,"LACMA does art with an LA edge. On a first visit the permanent exhibits are extensive and worthwhile, but the special exhibits are usually top notch. I visit LA on business a few times each year and always try to check out their special exhibits. For example, on a visit earlier in the year the Stanley Kubrick exhibit was a comprehensive look at his career, but also a fascinating people watching opportunity. At that show, the museum goers were an interesting blend of young Los Angeles sub-culture art and film types. A few tips. If driving use valet parking. It is worth the convenience. Also, the special exhibits usually require a ticket to meter the flow of people. If on a short schedule, try to leave enough time to avoid disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MickeyS844
40,Interesting,"This was our third visit to this museum, and we are still overwhelmed by its sheer size, scope and complexity. The fact that seven (?) buildings are necessary to contain it all is mind-boggling. The landmark light display in front of the main entrance is simply awesome, and the special exhibitions we've seen were indeed special. A visit to LA is not complete without spending a few hours here.However, perhaps because we're so familiar with the much more organized layout of art museums in the Northeast (Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Metropolitan), this one seems haphazard by comparison. The art itself seems to be arranged by the collections of donors, rather than period or artist. The lack of appropriate signage or detailed maps adds to the confusion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizajane47
50,Love this place,"My teenage girls love this place. We sign up the girls for the free passes and that gets parents in free. They want to promote children seeing art etc so if they parents are bringing in children you all get in free. Nice cafe outside they place live music sometimes, there is parking across the street. About 5-10 dollars to park I think. Lots of cool things to look at not just paintings etc, cool modern art and abstract stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/migotz
50,"If you find Turrell's work interesting, do NOT miss this exhibit","I have always found the work of James Turrell fascinating as he uses art to make us consider how we see, how our eyesight can fool us, etc. LACMCA has done 'one better' than the Guggenheim with their current show about the works of this artist. You should call ahead, as you must reserve a time slot because all of the several exhibits can only handle a few people at one time. You should plan to take some time off between the main show and the final portion, which is located in a separate building. I took my architect brother there as well as his wife-artist. We all came away impressed and wanting to see more. If you were able to see The Guggenheim show which ended last September, allow yourself the time and privilege of attending this as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GayT285
40,LACMA by night,come here and night to enjoy the gorgeous night view of the lamps as seen in the No Strings attached movie... perfect for night photo ops with friends plus you can just park at the side for a while without having someone to wait in the car for you. i think the view of the lamps at night were way better compared to day time. a must come in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmy91
50,LACMA,"fabulous exhibits and there is also a cafe for taking a break and grabbing a bite to eat, plus a coffee shop. You'll love the museum, early findings from the Incas and updated art also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/njcrocker
40,A very good art museum,"We visited the LACMA for the James Turrell exhibition. The museum is large and has some really nice pieces. Levitated Mass is utside, which was cool to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nobadkarma
50,the Louvre of Modern Art,I love art. I love Modern Art as well as Contemporary Art (& happily know the difference.) The museum is a beautiful collection of buildings AND collections. Unfortunately the Contemporary is now (Oct 2013) limited to one floor of 4 or 5 very large constructions and each one a GEM. I am only sorry that I only had 2 half days to spend. ($15 a day plus extra for exhibitions is expensive.),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/friedkin
50,Excellent attraction!,There is so much here to see. A must see attraction in Los Angeles!!!!. You need at least a full day or more to take advantage of all the things to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jandan13
50,LACMA love,"I have nothing but love for LACMA. They get the best exhibits there. I've planned two whole trips to the West Coast around two of their exhibits (the Tim Burton exhibit and In Wonderland). There is nothing I don't love about this place. They have so many programs for the community and for kids. Just go. In fact, if you live close, go ahead and become a member.ALSO, Urban Light (the lamps at the entrance of the museum) are perfect for photos!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/begutierrez
50,A Day Well-Spent,A fabulous collection covering the history of art. Very fine collection of 17-18th century French and Netherlandish painting.Use the museum parking. Several very good places to eat or pick up a snack or coffee. We used the cafe and sat outisde near the Calder sculpture. Really pleasing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moroccantravel
50,Brilliant Art Gallery(ies),"We could have easily spent another full day here - we didn't see many of the galleries during our full day visit. A highlight was the free tour hosted by a volunteer, who was clearly an amateur expert in her field and spoke very interestingly. The architectural space occupied by the museum complex is very visitor friendly, spacious and pleasing. The café serves good food and coffee at reasonable prices (not a given for places like this worldwide)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damaca
50,Need to go back!,There is such a variety that it would be easy to take a very diverse group of family or friends and divide up. This is not something that can be covered in one day. Went for a special exhibit and spent hours at it.. so only got to breeze through some of the other things. This is a place to visit over and over again. What a gem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PAOnTheRoadAgain
50,Look for the free Tuesdays,"Great place to visit, lovely art and best of all, the 2nd Tuesday of every month has free admittance. Off some convenient bus lines. Great place to take the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trinigal67
50,we visit frequently!,"We visit whenever LACMA launches new exhibits. My recent favorite was the Tim Burton show last year. The man is a genius! His work is so creative, witty and funny too! Fans and enthusiasts wait in long lines to view his exhibits. (I regret loosing those photos when our camera was subsequently stolen.)Anyways, check out the photos from our various visits. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells
50,Los Angeles County Museum of Art,"Great art, wonderful hands on experiences for children, some incredibly unusual sculptures, like the antique light standards (wander through them and try to discover the sculptors patterns), the very big rock and the model train (not like anything you've ever seen before. Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindza
40,"Hit and Miss, but when it hits it's great","Couldn't get into the hot special exhibit, but had a great time looking at the permanent collection. Some of it is forgettable, but with enough startling pieces to make it worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trip_Monkey_1326
50,Informative and Interesting,Such a beautiful museum encompassing both indoor and outdoor artworks. You could spend the entire afternoon here entertained. A must visit for anyone!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessie1031
50,More Than A Museum,"We went to the museum as a family. My wife, our daughter, my wife's mother, My wife's son and his young daughter. So it was a true Family outing. There was so much more to see and do than just the Art Museum. We spent a beautiful day while there. Delicious food of several varieties. So many sights to see, oh so many. I truly felt this was a trip of a lifetime and an experience I shall never forget. What was wonderful is several places you did not have to pay to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/202michaela
50,Museum,"This is a very organized museum, with lots of nice collections. It is one of the best museum I have been to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wgaggassi34
50,Great Museum and Tar Pit.,Great museum with the big players on display. Especially liked the tar pits. Great for families and on the hop on hop off route.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Solutionj
40,fun afternoon at the museum,"The museum was free on my Tuesday visit - bonus! The free ticket didn't work for the Broad Gallery, but otherwise, it gave access to the rest of LACMA. The docent tour was really good. Given the wide array of art in the Museum there is something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/915jessies
50,the works of art in a work of art,"LACMA is very famous for many important works but it is a very nice work of art itself. My best building is the Pavilion for Japanese Art by B. Goff, a strange spiral, which urges the spiritual recollection, in a sort of inner lift, supported by quotes and sayings and soft lighting.Beautiful is the work of Burden, Urban Light, a forest of street lights as candles.In the American and Latin American art section you can admire the wonderful work of Diego Rivera. Very interesting is the section completely dedicated to Giacometti. Many are the works by Picasso, beautiful is ""Man and Woman"". There is the famous pipe of Magritte. There are works by Moore. Willem de Kooning, Joan Miró, Arp, Matthew Barney, and Jeff Koons. Many are the works by Rodin.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GdN80100
50,Be prepared to spend an entire day here,"I found the LACMA to be a wonderful place to spend a day; there weren't too many people there, and I loved that they had a few cafes to choose from for lunch. There are also a couple bookstores with some good deals (if you look for them). I loved turning the corner in some of the rooms to run almost headfirst into Warhol's soup can paintings or a famous Mondrian or Rothko. The sculpture garden is small and about 95% Rodin (not complaining, I love Rodin), but fantastic in good weather. I also attended a brief lecture on one of the Dutch paintings upstairs (chairs provided, knowledgeable guide), which was a nice touch. The only problem here is parking! I couldn't stay as long as I wanted to because I couldn't find parking for the whole day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlyA2Z
40,Bring a Date,"This is a great place to bring a date or a friend. It's more of an intimate experience, rather than going with a large group, although you could do that too, if you find parking. I've seen some world class exhibits here, and it's my second most favorite modern art museum I've been to. It's more of a local trendy thing to do, rather than a touristy thing to do, if you are from out of town, I think you'll find better and more interesting places to go, than to come here. I always eat Ethiopian first, then, relax in front of exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MitsoukoRussie
20,Disappointing Collection.,"Maybe it's just me, but I found the nearby La Brea Tar Pits far more stimulating. I've been to LACMA a number of times over the years and have always been disappointed with their collection. If they've miraculously upgraded their collection in this past year, it might be worth a peak, but I doubt it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harolde367
40,Waiting for a redo,"The LACMA is on the eve of a redo of its installations and it will be good to return in a few years. Some areas were excellent, some poor. The Latin American art section which has its own space has good pieces and then some not so, but is anything but comprehensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MjM247
30,A few wonderful works,"Full disclosure: I'm from New York and travel extensively in Europe and Asia. Although LACMA is a great resource for people who live in LA, it simply cannot (nor can any of the other current art museums) compete with those that started their collections much earlier. And when certain spaces, such as much of the Broad Contemporary Art wing, are closed for functions or special exhibits as it was when I visited, some of the more interesting contemporary work can't be viewed, so it may be worth calling in advance if you're planning to see particular pieces or areas. That being said, there are some wonderful pieces - in particular a fabulous Richard Serra - Band, and currently a special exhibition of Luba sculpture from the Republic of the Congo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricaM940
40,Great museum,Probably the best museum of Los Angeles. Really cool place to go and have some easy day. Love the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pitytata
50,Loved Lunch at the Food Trucks across the street,"Nice architecture and enjoyed the visit. Very close to La Brea Tar Pitt museum, so we walked over there after. some of the advertised pieces are out on loan (3 that were shown in the brochure). The statute garden is great - no need to go to Paris!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babygame
50,LACMA is a local gem,"Okay, so it's not MOMA... but it is LACMA. And, it's pretty good. Take the time to check out the exhibit calendars prior to going. Things get interesting.There are free outdoor concerts certain parts of the year, and those are fun. Wine, music, art and the trendy set (anyone that loves any of the above)... a good vibe, to be sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/276amandaa
50,Impressive Museum,We loved the LA County Museum or Art and the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum next door. The surrounding grounds are gorgeous very peaceful. A great way to spend a few hours on a hot LA day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerindaT
50,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"This museum has really evolved and is now my favorite museum in Los Angeles. They have wonderful exhibitions and really fun events. For example, they have jazz on weekend summer nights. I also love the restaurant. If you eat at the restaurant they validate. My childhood memories of the La Brea tar pits which are located on the same property are fond. Great place to visit for locals and out of towners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingworkingmom
40,quite a scene,"I saw online there was a jazz band performing at the museum on a Friday night that we would be in town so we stopped by. I didn't realize it would be quite a scene. The band was great. All kinds of people were in chairs, getting drinks from the outdoor bar, having picnics on the grass with their kids and dogs. I had seen online that the museum was open late that night so we bought tickets. However, we didn't realize there was only one building open and we were only allowed entry to one floor which had 3 large modern art installations. That's it. Kind of disappointing. In retrospect, we should have walked through the museum in the afternoon, then stayed later for the band. We'll know better next time. See review in restaurant section for Rays & Stark Bar located at the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CapricornSister
40,"interesting, eclectic museum","lots to see there. lots of opportunity to wander about. if you're getting bored with one exhibit, you can move to another. great view of the Hollywood sign for photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mari0nP
50,I love to come and visit my favorite paintings.,"Located in a large open park and next to the Page Museum, LACMA has a variety of exhibits. The Japanese Pavilion is not to be missed, if for the building alone. Then, my favorite, the contemporary painters with Miro, Picasso, Kandinski, Rothko, and more. And some very interesting outdoor installations that do not require admission. During Summers, there are free jazz concerts, and free classical too (I forget if that is also in other seasons). A nice cafeteria and a slightly fancier place to eat are also fun. Special exhibits are always Wonderful and too numerous to mention. Can picnic in grassy area and there are other nice restaurants a few blocks away.If you are from Chicago or New York, and have many opportunites to see really good art and are only here for a short time; you might want to visit the sites that are more uniquely Southern California. Now, me, i'd go to an art museum ANYWHERE. PS Norton Simon in Pasadena is excellent too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/970christ
50,Art and Nightlife,"The LACMA Museum is a great way to spend an afternoon and evening in Los Angeles. Learn about all different artist, see amazing paintings and sculptures and also have a cup of coffee outside with street performers. Is located near The Chinnese Theater and UCLA. You can get the red metro line and see the Union Station at night which is so beautiful. You dont need to spend lots of money to have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gustavog248
50,Just gets better,Stopped in during the Wilshire Ciclavia event. The lamppost installation is a real crowd- pleaser. Lots of people taking pictures. The restaurant (not the expensive one deeper inside the complex) had very good fare. I was pleasantly surprised. A few weeks ago I attended a screening of 'M' - the Joseph Losey version- in the Bing Theater. Very pleased LACMA retained the film events. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickdaHammer
40,A good Sunday activity,"This is an excellent art museum. It is a lot to take in for one visit but we tried to do everything because it was all interesting. I was impressed with how thorough it is, as well as the secondary things like the layout. The art is one thing, but sometimes the room it was in was equally impressive. One thing: When we bought our tickets, the cashier handed us the tour program from the day before. We didn't notice until we tried to catch the tour that had taken place 24 hours earlier. We ended up learning about a piece of art we would not have otherwise been interested in, but still, take a look at the date just to make sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/autumnpoem
50,"If you like art, you'll love this museum!","LACMA - never heard of it before my daughter suggested it, they had a Latin band playing on the lawn at 5 PM and she thought it would make a great outing - which it did. The museum itself is spread out over many buildings and they have a convenient parking garage. All the rooms are very large, so you are not competing to look at an art piece or a painting. They had a special Matisse exhibit here, which was cool to see the piece of artwork you have only seen in books. Lots of modern art from right after WWI and onward. We did not see all the galleries, it would take several hours to do that. Combing this with listening to the Latin band on the lawn outside was just right. Many people brought blankets, chairs, and extensive picnics to enjoy, and that part was free. Great museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILuvEngland
40,An enjoyable museum,There is a lot to see and they display it in enough space to isolate each piece so you can clearly see it. From sculptures to photogrphic art there is something for everyones taste. From one to two hours you can see enough to make it a pleasant visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naiswaku
50,Yes there is culture in Los Angeles,"Fantastic collection of art in Los Angeles. I particularly love the contemporary wing. A visit to Miracle mile with a stroll by the Tar Pits, LACMA and dinner in Little Ethiopia would make a great day out for anyone travelling with kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyLiza
50,A wonderful place to go again and again.,"We visit LACMA about once a year and always wonder why we don't go more often. The exhibits are always excellent and the variety is amazing. Most recently, we went with another couple on a double date. We strolled through three galleries: the Matisse exhibit, the American Art Gallery and the Latin American Art Gallery. All three were unique and impressive. After touring, we made our way to the front entrance, where a free Jazz concert was scheduled from 6 to 8:00 p.m. We also had reservations at Ray's restaurant and dined al fresco in a busy bar atmosphere, surrounded by a diversity of people enjoying the beautiful summer night. It was a delightful outing and one of the reasons we, residents, love L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tbmegowan
50,Outstanding art gallery,"We accidentally went to LACMA on a day when they had free entry (usual admission price $15) which made our trip even better. This is an outstanding art gallery - in my view better than the Getty and on a par with some of the best art institutions in the US. They have a huge collection of different genres and eras and you could easily spend the whole day here. The outstanding sections for us were the Art of the Americas and the European art. As we were here on a free day they had a free tour of the first section and we had an insightful tour of early Mayan sculpture, 20th century Mexican painters and US art. There was also a lovely collection of modern Mexican silver jewellery. The European art section had a special exhibition about Matisse's La Gerbe - a ceramic piece based on his paper cut outs commissioned by a wealthy LA couple in the early 1950s to adorn their new home. The piece itself is on display along with a fascinating account of its commissioning by the wife of the couple. Her account of visiting Matisse in the south of France to try and pin him down on a price and delivery date was a real culture clash between the artistic temperament and the business-like Americans. LACMA also has an outstanding collection of 20th century art - Picasso, Giacometti, all the abstract expressionists, even a David Hockney (oddly filed under American art). We didn't have time for the other collections (Korean, Islamic, South East Asian) but they looked good too. All this art and three cafes - we had an outstanding day here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susan8552
50,Local is addicted to this place it's so good,"If you want real LA, you go to LACMA. Ive visited many times over the years and they always showcase only the best. Inspiring lovely atmosphere. Within the walls of artistic explosion you should bring some supplies and sit our in the grass and express--- one of the best places to be and be a part of in Los Angeles. They even have free times to go, and the amazing ones I have paid for are great and worth every dime",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Everythinginit
50,"Excellent, excellent art museum","Don't get me wrong - I LOVE the Getty Museum. But the collections at the LACMA are so large! There are even items there on loan from the Getty. I love post 1700's art more than the rest and they have great selections of the most well-know artists ever, but visit the area with 1700's and pre- (less visited so quieter there) and you'll walk into breaktaking rooms with gilded, gold beautiful oil paintings, scupltures, etc. displayed in the most magnificent ways. Go to another area and you'll see tons of art and artifacts from way into the BC period. See a real mummy. I can't say enough, if I could I could spend days upon days here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovelyjamilew
50,So interesting,We were very lucky to be in this museum on a sunny sunday at noon time. We almost had only the gards who are all very friendly and even explain to you where you can find the explanations for a particular object. The rooms are very big so you do not crawl on people to see some beautiful Rembrandt. You may also have a free and wonderful course on french impressionists by a very enthusiastic docent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nine52
50,James Turrell....,"...if you like modern and wonderful, this IS the retrospective to see! LACMA has always been the place to visit if you have the time. So much great art to see. Treat yourself. You will be greatly rewarded. Parking is very easy and reasonable with many good food choices on site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancyqc

50,Excellent Museum,"We were visiting friends in West Hollywood and had some time to visit LACMA for the first time and we were really impressed. Unfortunately the Turrell exhibit was sold out, but we still really enjoyed their classical and modern art during our short visit. We'll definitely have to make plans to return - highly recommend LACMA as it has something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelinman6060

40,Worth a visit,Large gallery with something for everyone. We saw mainly the modern art section but plenty of spaces that we missed due to time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haroldluntz
50,This Museum is consistently outstanding!,"The James Turrell retrospective blew my mind! It was possibly the most inspiring and thought provoking temporary exhibit that I have ever visited. Allow several hours for the Turrell exhibit alone.The rest of the museum offers some great pieces as well: Metropolis II is a model city surrounded by electric trains and cars and can captivate even the youngest eyes.The giant rock outside is very impressive, and nearby are the La Brea tar pits!I have been to museums in many large cities in the USA and LACMA is one of my favorites - I visited 3 times and finally bought a membership.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeremy044

30,It was ok,"After The Getty Museum it's a bit disappointing, not fair to the LACMA as it does have some great exhibitions, just The Getty standard is so high.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharneW_12
50,A beautiful museum and architectural complex.,"It's a great destination to visit. There are a lot of pavilions and they are all very different and very beautifully designed, there is a restaurant and a bar and they are outside, also the Rodin sculpture garden is priceless and the Japanese pavilion is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeannaL400
50,Dont miss LACMA,"LACMA is a wonderful museum. It is quite large and has even bigger plans for the future.l It always has really interesting exhibits both indoors and out and is conveniently located on Wilshire near the Hollywood Farmers Market, which is great to visit after LACMA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lqgueradg35
50,Best museum in LA,My favorite museum in LA - the art is always the best. Not to mention the atmosphere and the food/drinks. Also terrific location - you have all the activities on Fairfax and La Brea right near by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieH52
40,Getting Better and Better,"Improvements to LACMA are continuing apace and are a welcome change to a tired and old institution. Be sure to see Metropolis II when it is running, a dynamic sculpture of Matchbox cars on a cityscape. The new café is an improvement over the old cafeteria, but I still miss Pentimento restaurant. The Japanese pavilion is still terrific. The new bar and lounge Ray's and Stark Bar is a great place to hang out, and street lamp forest sculpture on Wilshire Bl. is a lot of fun for kids and adults to walk through. There are often free movies and concerts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RabbiWendy
50,from art to boulders and much more,"There is such a diversity of art, great lectures, evening programs, and way too much to see in one visit. Focus on one maybe two areas and explore. A museum store that will consume lots of time and money, if you want. Dining at LACMA is okay, but the neighborhood is rich with better opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhcLACA
50,One of my Favorites,"I love LACMA and museum row in general. Have only been a few times, but have really enjoyed it each and every time. A great cultural oasis in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbertC728
40,LACMA has become an evening attraction too,"LACMA tends to succumb to the blockbuster show disease; the James Turrell show is a case in point, where the work does not break new ground compared to previous smaller and more focused shows of his art, but it is great that LACMA has become such a venue for evening activities. Look out for music events and film screenings, most of which are free with parking, and the galleries are open late with no charge for entry some evenings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickR798
50,SoCal's Best Modern Art Museum,"The changing exhibits and wide range of options will suit everyone's' taste. The grounds are beautiful and it is easy to spend a whole afternoon absorbing the surroundings - although it is better to attend n the mornings when it is not as busy. It is a little pricy, so plan ahead by bringing snacks or eating elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielaA279
50,Terrific Art Museum for Kids,"We have been a few times with our kids. Entrance can be free if you subscribe to the ""NextGen"" program through the box-office (Parents go free with a Child!).In particular, dont miss, Metropolis II is a gigantic model of a ""city"", with 18 different car tracks containing 100000 cars circulating around it. It doesnt run all the time, so check ahead.Right next to it is the Richard Serra Scupture, which is amazing to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fxsam

40,A Little Hard to Navigate,"The museum was beautiful, granted, with large buildings separated by courtyards, but it was hard to figure out what art was where even with a map. I had a 13 year old with me, and she wanted to see the Imoressionists, but we were not impressed by the small collection. Still it was overall a very interesting and well kept museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/metoread2
50,Always a treat,"We never miss a chance to visit LACMA. It's much more dynamic than most museums and the exhibits are always brain candy -- not always art I relate to, but always compelling. I feel like this place is continually in motion doing something interesting. Good food, great kid's art room with terrific staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kate320
50,park on the street behind the Museum,I'm a fan of Hockney's painting and one of his largest ones is part of the collection--spectacular. The entire 20th c. collection is good.The cafeteria has good food and there is a pleasant outdoor terrace attached. LACMA is right next to the LaBrea Tar Pits which once trapped mastodons. It's worth a half hour detour to check out the existing pits and the exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorothyB97
40,Always fun: entertaining and informative,"AFter several trips to LACMA over many years, I remain pleasantly surprised at the range and depth of exhibits and experiences they make available. LACMA manages to find and display fun, interesting, significant art and artists including the Masters, new artists and interesting and diverse exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cldkRidgecrest_CA
50,"Great, But With Multiple Provisos","I visited the Los Angeles County Museum of Art a week ago, and it’s taken me a week to collect my thoughts about it. The contents of the museum certainly rate an “excellent” rating, but beyond that there are serious shortcomings. It’s certainly worth a visit, but understand that there are also some limitations.Let’s start with the most important thing – the art. It’s wonderful. This is a large campus with multiple buildings and the collectors have obviously labored to have representative pieces from every genre, aspect, and period. If you like 20th century art, for example, you will find representative works from every “name” artist and several others. I noted works by Arp, Braque, Cezanne, Degas, Giacometti, Hepworth, Klee, Lichtenstein, Malevich, Monet, Naguchi, Pollack, Warhol, etc. They had special exhibits relating to Matisse and Picasso, both of which were well-presented and very interesting. If you are interested in other eras, they are there as well. I particularly liked several of their Rembrandt paintings, one of which is strategically located so that the subject glowers at you as you come up the steps.LACMA’s web site is also excellent. Just about everything can be seen or investigated on line. While, like all great art, it is better experienced in person, they have done a very nice job on-line. I also liked the café and museum store and the general concept of an art campus.So what are the provisos? Well, there are many. The first is that the central buildings are not terribly well designed and somewhat dated. While this will likely be apparent to you on your arrival, and while they have tried some cosmetic fixes, there is actually a plan to raze just about everything and to start over. See:http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2013/06/130605-LACMA-Director-and-Peter-Zumthor-Make-the-Case-for-Museums-Redesign.aspThe planned expansion looks really interesting, but I have to review the museum as it currently stands. What stands is dated and in need of renovation.There are two related issues. First, in several places the lighting is awkward. On several floors they have black ceilings and white walls with spot lighting on the paintings. This is likely fine if you are a surgeon used to harsh, spot lighting, but while clinically exact it is not always ideal for displaying art at its best. Second, and more importantly, the display of art itself is not terribly . . . well . . . artful. As others have noted, in places you feel as if they are simply storing semi-related art in the same room. Adjacent rooms have almost glaringly incompatible artwork. I saw one room in which they seemed to have simply tacked up spare paintings from one period along a wall without any consideration of how each looked or how they worked with each other. In another, they had decorative arts along two walls, and oil paintings along two others, with no real connection between the two. One contemporary art building had only three large pieces of art on one floor, one of which was an electronic display that wasn’t even working. Throughout the museum, the elevators were glacially slow, and stairs (which I would have happily taken) were not well marked or easy to find. The end result: Really nice art not terribly well displayed.Any other provisos? Yes, a significant one. As others have noted on this site, they need to work on their staff. It’s likely dull being a museum guard, but it’s not dull to the patrons. I did get some positive reactions from some staff members (one was wonderfully enthusiastic on hearing I wanted to see the Richter exhibit), but another largely barked at me that they were “closed” as I entered a building. I practically had to cross examine him to find that what was “closed” was a single exhibit and that the building’s remaining 3 floors were open, including some crowd-pleasing works. The museum nicely gives you a guide listing the most notable works, but at least 2 were off display and the staff expressed no knowledge about their whereabouts – it struck me that they should either have removed the art from the listing or educated the staff as to where they were.On that note, the map they give you was pretty weak. It will help you find entire buildings, but didn’t do much to guide you to what may interest you most or to invite you to new areas to explore.So should you visit LACMA? Absolutely. You will see a lot of moving and memorable art. But know its limitations. It has a lot to learn from the newer Getty in terms of design and presentation, but the art itself is often magnificent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineAndGreg
40,LACMA hardly lacks anything,"Several days can be spent making sure no exhibit is left unseen, or no masterpiece left un-pondered and the museum is easy to navigate and has a much more free spirit than most museums as there is no one entrance as your ticket is scanned at the entrance to each building and guests are free to go about and see anything at their own pace and pleasure.Now depending on your tastes some pieces of art may not tickle your fancy and you may be unimpressed at the rock at the back of the museum that cost over $200 million to transport and install, but there is always something to appreciate for any artistic taste and soon the complex will host the Academy of Motion Pictures museum as well, so the LACMA will truly have everything under one roof.Try to go to the museum when they are having live musical performances in the different buildings, the Japanese Art building was a fantastic experience when coupled with musical performances.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Roaming_Raven
40,It was okay,"I know art is subjective but I though this museum was just okay. I guess after visiting the Getty Museum I wanted to see more. It is a very large musem, lots to offer inside and out. They have restaurants and places to purchase snacks. It was nice but",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimH374
50,so much to see,"I love this museum for so many reason. The first is because it has such a large variety of art styles. Anywhere from ancient Mayan Art to modern art. It's divided by continents so that the visitor is able to see what each continent has to offer my favorite section was the Japanese area because they have old samurai gear. The European section has a large area of Picasso. The best part is that it's free for high school students,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuzElenaR_13
50,So Many Ways to Visit for Free,"Read the website. Target sponsors free days. Bring a kid, and each child gets an adult in for free. They're open late on Friday nights, and some of those are free.So much of the museum is outside and around, families and young couples can spend hours here and not be out of pocket.Make sure families get the schedule for ""Metropolis"" and visit that exhibit when it's running.We're lucky we live in a city with such a fine museum at our disposal.If looking for a quick bite, try the food trucks that line Wilshire.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halobb
50,World-class collection,"This is possibly the best (Euro/Latin-focused) art museum in California. (It also features collections of Asian, Islamic and African art, but I know so little about those fields that I can't judge.) Overall, I think their collection beats the Getty's, though of course it depends on your personal preferences (they're both worth visiting). If LACMA has a famous artist's work, which they probably do, their piece tends to be a stunning example. And they cover a lot of areas, including ceramics, furniture, textiles, and film, in addition to paintings and sculpture. (Movies are screened several times a week.)Check out their extensive website for a preview of what they have (the costume collection is especially well-documented online, if you aren't lucky enough to see a real exhibit). The museum is located in a complex of buildings--in a pleasant park--and it can be easy to miss the area you're seeking without some guidance. Usually some parts are closed for reorganizing, but there's always something else to see.The entrance fee has gotten a bit high in recent years, but they do sometimes have free days. The cafe is also a bit pricey, but they offer a range of options, and you can also take a stroll down Wilshire to seek cheaper fare (sadly, the nearby restaurant on Fairfax I used to recommend is now closed). Parking is usually easy--there's a pay lot next door, and some reasonable street parking on 6th.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christine_U
50,Great Museum with Outdoor music program,"The changes being made here are fantastic -- loads of new exhibits and a great program of outdoor jazz concerts all summer, both Friday and Saturday night. The grounds are also beautiful, giving kiddies a chance to run. Great for families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/truebluesy
40,Los Angeles County Museum,"This museum was a short walk from our hotel, the Farmer's Daughter hotel. To someone like myself who enjoys museums but is not an expert, the various collections (e.g. contemporary art, European masters, Pacific Islands etc) were great. Not so extensive that I felt overwhelmed - but sufficient in number & scope to give me a good overview of pieces from those periods. I was able to see a variety of exhibits over a few hours. Very enjoyable & highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GnanasagrenP
50,Japanese Pavilion & European Collection,"The Japanese Pavilion is featuring works by Hokusai this month. What a grand surprise! Known for his woodblock print of the Great Wave of Kanagawa, you will be enthralled with his colors and details of Japanese life.We also gravitated to the European collection because of their display of Matisse, Picasso, and other favorites.The staff there is attentive and do their job well. Thank you, L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mochi2
50,Fine local museum,"I am an artist, art collector and dealer. The museum is expanding and improving their facilities on a regular basis in order to build a campus, rather than a single building. They now have incorporated the deco monument May Company building into their campus with two additional exhibition facilities now completed that give them space for more substantial contemporary art as well as ethnically diverse exhibitions. Their Rifkind Center is a peerless center for the study of German Expressionist Art unrivaled even in Germany. Increasingly they have had substantial exhibitions featuring the best of Los Angeles' artistic community - emerging as an independent and increasingly influential player on the international stage of contemporary art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HenryK525
50,Not to be missed,"If you like museums, this is a must-see on a trip to LA. It has been a few years since I was last here, and it's now an amazing complex of buildings connected by open, breezy public spaces that are just a joy to spend a few hours in. I spent most of my time in the modern art collection, especially enjoyed the German Expressionism collection and the good representation of California artists. We had a nice lunch in the LACMA cafe, which had something to please everyone in the family and was reasonable in cost. After the younger family members went off to the Page Museum I headed off to the Broad Contemporary Art museum which was fantastic, not only the collection but also the scary escalator ride to the top floor! I didn't get to see everything I wanted to, and I would have returned a second day if we weren't headed back home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gingembre
40,Such a gem in LA,"Nice quiet place to see some great art. We went on a Monday morning just as they opened and beat the crowd so we could enjoy most areas alone. The different buildings gave organization to the different areas to visit, but sometimes it seemed a little confusing because you didn't always know where the general admission areas were. It seemed that there were places and floors we couldn't go, but weren't marked very clearly that they were special exibits so we had to get told by an attendant that we weren't allowed. We also weren't sure where we could or couldn't take photos because we didn't see any signs. We didn't have our flash on, but were told there were areas that permitted no photographs at all. One of the coolest displays was the Metropolis because it was so detailed and huge. It was hard to fathom how everything worked. The cars incorporated as a moving part, weren't turned on while we were there because it's only powered on during weekends, but there was still enough to take in and enjoy. You could walk around the entire exhibit and even upstairs to a 2nd level and look down on it. The museum shop didn't have many souvenirs to our liking. They had a lot of books and some prints, but not many collectibles. I enjoyed the collection they had such as Matisse, quite a few Picassos and other pieces I'd seen in art history books too. Glad to go and be sure to check out the Tar Pits next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HanKelly
40,Awesome fun,"We went to the museum on a tues afternoon to watch the lady from shanghai. The lacma not only has a great collection of art, the Theatre also has tues afternoon matinees for $4. It's a movie theatre, the old fashioned way, red drawn back curtains and everything. And right in front of the museum, is a whole street of food trucks! What a fine place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhuprincess
50,Rich and varied collection,"LACMA was on the top of my list of things to visit in Los Angeles, and in most respects it lived up to my expectations. Their twentieth-century collection is particularly rich, with many noteworthy pieces by Matisse, Tanguy, Miró, and a very large representation of Picassos. I was disappointed with the Latin American collection, which was weighted heavily toward pre-Hispanic ceramics and too lightly on twentieth-century and contemporary works (no Botero?). It's a wonderful collection overall, and worth spending several hours enjoying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieOW
50,Fantastic grounds beautiful Art,The space allows crowds to move around easily. The exhibits are spectacular and the facilities great. I highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineM400
40,Lovely collections,"We visited primarily because of the Stanley Kubrick exhibition, which I immensely enjoyed, very well done. We then spent about two hours walking through the rest of the collections. I personally loved the Robert Mapplethorpe photography exhibit and some of the modern art rooms, but overall, the museum feels very chaotic. I didn't get a sense of why the different collections are located where they are, there was no chronologic order to it and it felt all over the place, which is why I'm detracting a star.Park at the Page Museum around the corner and save 3$, it's a nice 5-10 minutes walk though a park to the LACMA from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TanyaR697
50,LACMA is worth visiting.,"My friends and I decided to spend a few hours at LACMA this past Sunday, and it is definitly worth visiting. We mainly went for the Stanley Kubrick exhibit, but also enjoyed most of the rest of what LACMA has to offer. Disclaimer: We are not art afficionados! But we do like to look at pretty pictures.Stanley Kubrick exhibit: Awesome! Sadly, yesterday was the last day for this exhibit. We had a great time checking out all of the movie paraphernalia from Kubrick's films. It was pretty crowded, but we were patient enough to look at everything we wanted to see. I would go on about the specifics, but you wouldn't be able to check it out for yourself so...Ahmanson Building: The bottom floor has the Art of the Pacific gallery, which was pretty cool. It's interesting to see what people were able to make so long ago. Mostly naked figures. The second floor has modern art, but we aren't really into modern art, so we kind of rushed through. However, they have many Picasso's, which was cool. The third floor made us really excited because it has Art of the Ancient World and European Art; basically, old pretty stuff. Many detailed paintings, beautiful hand-painted china, a mummy(!) and other ancient Egyptian items, statues, mirrors, blah blah blah. Good stuff. We didn't see it all because we became hungry.Broad Contemporary Art Museum: There was a mini, multi-level city structure called ""Metropolis II"" that you can view from above and watch all of the Hotwheels zoom around. It was fun. The other fun thing thing in this building was the elevator because it's enormous. Everything else was contemporary art and just not our cup of tea.Resnick Pavilion: We walked quickly through this. It was the end of the day, so we were getting tired, but we did see some interesting pieces. Let me warn you about the middle display. Do not touch the tables! Do not even breathe on them. The employees were very fond of yelling at visitors for this. There are no signs saying you may not touch the tables to get a better look at the displays (which are under plastic covers), so I'm telling you now.Bonus! The La Brea Tar Pits. You can check them out for free and take a nice stroll around Hancock Park. If you've ever wondered what the underside of a two-story granite boulder looks like, you can walk under LACMA's ""Levitated Mass"". Also, make sure to get a picture in ""Urban Light"", the group of streetlamps at the entrance. Everybody's doing it.If you're in a rush, don't eat at LACMA's Stark Bar. Service is slow. The drinks and pizza were good though.We didn't get to see everything, so we will definitely visit LACMA again. We would like to check out the James Turrell: A Retrospective exhibit going on now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaG453
50,"James Turrell exhibit is fabulous using light, dimension, and space!","We went to James Turrell's new exhibit at LACMA during the Memorial weekend. It was our 2nd visit to LACMA, as we are new members. Our first visit was for the Stanley Kubrick exhibit (which was also fascinating and educational). So instead of purchasing 2 tickets for $40, we opted for the annual membership instead.Without knowing anything about James Turrell, we had made an appointment for the previewing of the exhibit. I was delightfully impressed with his biography and artistic vision, as he appreciates light and space as an essential at form.LACMA also showcases Picasso & Van Gogh paintings in one of their many buildings, Japanese art, ancient wood sculptures, museum gift shop, coffee shop, and a great gourmet upscale Ray restaurant with delicious pizzas. There is much to view, sit, relax, and enjoy!I am glad we became recent members! Ticket prices for exhibits are inclusive with membership, so it can be worthwhile to join. Structure parking is $10, but you can also find meter or free street parking next to Park LaBrea complex. Look at posted signs carefully.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveSchnauzers

30,Modern Art,"The Art Museum has some wonderful modern art, very exciting. The Children's Centerwas just for kids to do arts and crafts, disappointing. They need more signs to direct.We came up from the lower level garage and had no idea where the front entrancewas, had to ask. Odd that you have to go thru one building to get to another. Lots ofstairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SHE414
50,Well worth a visit,"We spent most of our time with the Kubrik exhibit, which unfortunately was extremely crowded on a Sunday afternoon. It was a fabulous exhibit, though. Beautiful grounds and an extensive collection. Lovely and relaxing outdoor space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ann06
40,See Los Angeles from a different view,"The newly expanded LACMA is worth a visit both for the permanent and seasonal exhibits. It's cheap to get in, or even free if you go on every 2nd tuesday of the month. If you plan to visit the museum more than twice a year, becoming a member is worth it since you get two free tickets to exhibitions as well as all year free entrance to the permanent collections.We both strongly recommend buying food at LACMA, and NOT go across the street to the food trucks located on Wilshire Blvd. They are sub-par and expensive. The food is much better at LACMA, plus you'll support the museum.The only reason we didn't give it top rating was the unseemly display of the rich donators and their pictures prominently displayed along with their bio. Seems like the plaques with donators are based on ego, not for the love of the arts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Radius360la
40,Nice,"I visited the museum briefly to see the Stanley Kubrick exhibition currently showing and also saw the Islamic art exhibition. Both were very good. Museum nicely presented and very helpful staff. The Egyptian section was closed when I visited in mid June. If you are interested in this area, just check the museum to clarify when it's re-opened. Buildings were pleasant and layout of the museum was good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bilby2009
40,A Microcosm of LA,"LACMA has it all, or at least a taste of it. Just like the City that surrounds it, this museumgrabs and holds juicy bits of many cultures and genres. If the Smithsonian is the nation'sattic, LACMA is LA's front porch. We spent a Saturday viewing the many buildings ofAsian, abstract, Precolumbian, 20th century expressionist art, and more. LACMA has everythingfrom Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass, a tremendous boulder transported from the foothilseast of the City and suspended above a walking path, to a special exhibition on Stanley Kubrick. In my estimation, the Museum's focus on LA's place in movie history is itsbest path to follow in building a unique reputation for itself. It was fun to stand on the plazaand see the Hollywood sign in the distance as we entered the Kubrick show.Parking is easy if one arrives early and uses the $10 lot across Wilshire Blvd. Thedrive up to Wilshire on Fairfax Blvd, after exiting the 10 Freeway, was a nightmare, however,due to heavy two-lane traffic. We drove in from Orange County, and the last 2 mileson surface streets took as long as the 35 mile trip up the 405 and 10 Freeways.The LACMA Cafe serves great sandwiches and salads, part of the Tangata Restaurant group.Excellent lunch for two cost about $20,with patio seating.There is so much in this museum that it merits repeat visits, expecially for the specialexhibitions. LA is not no longer a cultural wasteland because it can buy all the art it wants,or a generous patron donates an outstanding collection. It has gathered together something for everybody, and is adding more all the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaF310
50,Great for anyone,This museum has the best rotating and permanent exhibits! Always something really cool for kids and adults. Great restaurant and bars ON-SITE which is an added bonus. And great quality too. Saw the Kubrick retrospect which was amazing. It sprawls over several buildings but this is a must see when in LA> Better than a touristy studio tour; this is amazing curation of Art always.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fpk932
40,James Turrell exhibit is great but sad I couldn't see part of it...,I went to the LACMA recently during a visit with a cousin who lives in the area. She took me there primarily to see the James Turrell exhibit. I was not familiar with his work before my visit but can tell that LACMA is a terrific venue to show it in. My only disappointment was that there was some sort of electrical problem at the museum that day and a couple of the pieces in the exhibit were not working as his work is all about light. Next time I visit I would love to go back though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ABB1976

50,...VAN GOGH SUNFLOWERS beach towels SOLD OUT!!!!,"ah.......the legendary LOS ANGELES COUNTY MUSEUM......the VAN GOGH exhibit was so breathtakingly beautiful that KLEENEX should have had a booth around each corner!!!! Vincent sold one painting his entire life (to his brother Theo) and when Mrs. Van Gogh (theo's wife) had the collection appraised she was told ""we're sorry mrs. Van Gogh but this collection is worthless!"" so i chuckled when i saw the sign in the gift shop....VAN GOGH SUNFLOWERS beach towels SOLD OUT............",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevepriceCBSnews
50,lacma AND all that Jazz.,"I love the Friday night after work jazz scene. It is the most relaxing and cultural experience in Los Angeles by far. Great music, great food in and around the museum. Bring the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RUQAYYAHC
50,Art it is !!!!,"The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is an art museum located on Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle Mile vicinity of Los Angeles. LACMA is on Museum Row, and is adjacent to the George C. Page Museum and La Brea Tar Pits",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinacheS
40,Metropolis II mad it all worthwhile,Great selection of art for all tastes. We started at the levitated rock which is quite impressive but what took the artist 10 years to find that rock (or what is so special about that rock!). Metropolis II was the absolute highlight. Unfortunately we didn't get to see it running but if you can I would time your visit to coincide with it running. Rest was a very good selection of all types of art - some you could look at for ages and others just left you asking why!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jakkster67
50,A must-see for anyone visiting or living in Los Angeles,"LACMA is our jewel in the center of the city. Along the Miracle Mile on Wilshire Boulevard, there are many museums, but LACMA is the star. First-rate traveling exhibitions and a world-class permanent collection, along with film and live music series, make it one of the premiere museums in the world. LACMA has everything from modern art, including Warhol, Basquiat, Koons, and Sherman, to Impressionists and post-Impressionists, to the art of ancient civilizations, Euope, and Asia. Conveniently located next to the La Brea tar pits and the Page Museum, LACMA has it all. Enjoy the restaurants, picnic in the surrounding park, bring the kids and the grandparents - there is truly something for everyone at LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeatletteFrankie
50,Great art indoors & out...,"I love LACMA - with all their ""interactive outside art exhibits"", but lots of great art inside also...Plus - they have free concerts sunday evenings... If you live in SoCal, and you want to go more than 2 times a year, it's worth getting a membership...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjalvarez
40,Should be part of your stay in LA,"I got to see an Stanley Kubrick exhibition so it was great... the regular exhibitions were also very large and you can spend 4 hours there just looking around... the museum store is pretty nice, there is one downstairs also, besides the principal store, with an interesting collections of books... a must see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarylinB
40,Nice Location,"Great art museum, good gift shop, easy parking and access. Great exhibits each year. If you can only afford one cultural outing membership, this is a great choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlendaleGirl1
40,"Fascinating installations and collections, with the Kubrick exhibition a real highlight...","While the museum is a really very good collection of art from all over the world, it was their temporary exhibitions that provided the most interesting moments of our visit. The Stanley Kubrick exhibition was especially fascinating, and well worth catching if you're in the area. It is worth the extra $5 fee any day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/772PCM
50,Kubrick exhibit was excellent,"It was great to see what he envisioned through his creativity and the length he went, without technology, to create. He likely had a great deal to do with what we are accustomed to now. He sketched a laptop in 1968!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KampolandEugeniaB
50,One of the best museums ever,"The Stanley Kubrick exhibition is really amazing and movie buffs gets plenty here. The other exhibitions are top notch too, enjoyed the Fritz Lang metropolis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielSk72
50,A true Treat,"I'm always fascinated about the diversity of exhibitions, the quality how they are curated and presented and how you can come back here over and over again and always find something interesting and new. For somebody who enjoys art it's simply uplifting and the summer outdoor music program, offered in the park, is not only free, but also good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RGerman
40,Don't miss Kubrick,"The Stanley Kubrick exhibit was excellent and informative, wish we had more time to spend looking over the remainder of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tds57
40,Really enjoyed the Kubrick exhibit,"Its an extra $5 on top of the regular admission, but well worth it. Food service in the museum was expensive and somewhat unfriendly (unwilling to customize anything even in the made to order grill, for example) but who goes to a museum for the food?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrdub
50,Always something new,"Had a very enjoyable visit here 2 months ago. We viewed both the Caravaggio exhibit and a fantastic historical collection of Stanley Kubrick artifacts, film props and scripts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikew938
40,worth a visit,"It's not NY's Met or DC's National Gallery but its got a good collection well presented. It's open on Monday ... a plus for museum goers who frequently find there is no culture on Monday. We went on Tuesday and had a pleasant surprise in that the Bing theatre shows classic movies Tuesday afternoons. A good way to rest your feet and see movie you might not otherwise see. We've seen very interesting temporary exhibits in the contemporary spaces so I recommend checking out what's on offer. And, for a change of pace there is a very interesting automobile museum across the street.... and the La Brea tarpits a bit to the east on Wilshire. between them you can make a full day of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vandal72
50,What an wonderful museum!,"I visited LACMA last Sunday. I got there around 9:45 when there were still many street parking available around the museum. The first thing I saw was the famous “Urban Lights” where they stand proudly in front of the museum. It’s such a grand sight. The museum has extensive collection of many famous paintings and sculptures. I particularly enjoy the European art collection. The Japanese pavilion is unique and lovely. The Ray restaurant is hip and trendy. If you consider eating there for late lunch or dinner, reservation is recommended. The place can get really busy. The cuisine is innovative and very good, just a little pricy. I didn’t have time to see everything and definitely go back. Be sure to check their website for special event prior to visiting the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellibra
50,Spectacular,"I love all forms of art and/or museums. It is definitely a treat to get to see the Museum of Art . Should you be in the area I would visit, you will not regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rejuvinateyrslf
50,Lots to see,This is a huge museum with a lot of things to see. Make sure you have enough time. I went there just because of the Mapplethorpe exhibition but ended up spending over six hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiiFinland
40,Different,Nice to look at but not that easy to get to. Would love to have gone to a concert there but time did not allow.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/George-T-Hull
50,LACMA with a 10-year-old boy - No problem,"We recently went to LA and while there I wanted to visit LACMA where I have been several times before. I was wondering how to make sure that my 10-year-old son did not object. Last year, I used Jeff Koons (Michael Jackson and Bubbles) to motivate him - it wasn't there tho. Anyway, we did go again this year and spent a great 4 hours there. A child can relate to some of the contemporary art as it is very ""concrete"" so that was good and we got a lot of laughs out of some of the pieces. The rest of the museum was also great. He knows Picasso and some of the other art which was nice and also some of the Egyptian or African art was interesting to him. He also liked the Japanese section and even enjoyed going past the Kline and Motherwell which is one of my favorite parts. He thoroughly enjoyed it and I should have no trouble getting him to go again in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/419KenL
50,Spectacular Museum Day,"The museum area is comprised of many buildings. I spent around six hours wandering through all of them. Since I am from a small town in North Carolina, which doesn't have any museums, I was in awe. I saw Picassos, Rodin's, a Matisse, and many more famous artists. I even saw Andy Warhol's Tomato Soup can painting. The most interesting thing to me was the Japanese exhibit of kimono accessories. I enjoyed the Stanley Kubrick exhibit of his famous movies. I would recommend this to anyone visiting the area. Very educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sealife1960
40,Fun day and lots to see,"Great art and good atmosphere. Too much to see in one day. Area residents, seniors, and students get a break on the cost but it was reasonably priced for the area and the exhibits. Not all exhibits included in general admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjgardeski
50,SURPRISINGLY GOOD,"Wow! I'd previously visited the Getty Centre but drawn by the Kubrick exhibit, I spent the better part of a day wandering around LACMA on a recent trip, and am I ever glad I did.I've been to several world renowned museums and galleries, and LACMA holds its own on an international level. Bravo, curators. The collection is impressive; I was surprised at the breadth and depth of the pieces and the refreshingly easy going vibe of the place. The casual feel was really unprecedented as far as most museum experiences go. The modern art exhibits are particularly outstanding.The views of Hollywood from the rooftops are fabulous. The grounds are well kept and a nice juxtaposition to the interior spaces. I would DEFINITELY recommend at least four hours for wandering the permanent exhibits and feature exhibits. The wood fired pizza at the Stark Lounge is reasonably priced and they have a good selection of beers, or there are a variety of food trucks across the street in front of the Variety offices for economical dining options during your visit.The gift shop had several interesting offerings and parking right across the street was easy, if these things matter to you. The statue garden is a quiet if not under represented place with several ubiquitous Rodin's (whom I love).GO.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dreataylor
40,Lots to see and experience,"This museum always has new and interesting things to see. While the permanent collection has some nice items, it's the temporary exhibits that make this museum interesting. In 2005, they presented the world famous King Tut artifacts. And their Magritte Exhibit a few years back was fantastic (I especially loved that they painted the freeway system on the ceiling and the carpet was sky with clouds- Magritte would have loved that!). A few weeks back I was able to visit the Stanley Kubrick exhibit and it again was well done. School groups get free tickets to the permanent collections. There is an extra - well worth it- fee for the world-class temporary exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SterlingGuy
50,Fine art indeed!,An awesome gallery - a fabulous permanent collection (make sure to see the Modern collection which has a wonderful selection of the very best of the 20th century's painters) is always enhanced by superb special exhibitions - there's something for everyone though avoid the cafeteria - it was overpriced and the food was dreadful. There's a lovely sculpture garden too with works by Rodin and excellent holdings of ancient Roman and Greek art too and I was delighted with the Pre-Columbian works on display!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffreyC289
50,Bruce Goff's Architecture & Edo Period Art,"So much to see in this museum but if you can't do it all, consider focusing in the Shinenkan Collection. You can't find anything like it outside of Japan. You'll enjoy not only the beautiful art but you'll also experience the unique architecture of Bruce Goff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Triaero
50,Eclectic collection of art from around the world,"I absolutely love LACMA! The museum contains a wide selection of art from various times and places-- German Expressionism, Latin American contemporary, historical artifacts from the Americas, contemporary works, Korean art, etc, etc. There's also the children's exhibit, which allows for hands-on opportunities and is actually advertised to children ""of all ages.""About every six months or so LACMA also brings in wonderful temporary exhibits (usually an additional fee for these); this week I went to see the Stanley Kubrick exhibit, which was fascinating.LACMA is a must see while visiting LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AAH46
50,NexGen program rocked,"The museum was running a promotional program that allowed my kids (under 17) to become free members, and bring me in as their guest. That was fantastic! And the museum is huge, and glorious, and has many features that we loved. It's easy to visit, well organized and there are lots of staff who can direct you. Parked at a meter, they seemed plentiful, too. We had a short and and very enjoyable visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margies99
50,Great installations,"The light installation is always at the top of my to do list while visiting LA. There are lots of great things to entertain little and big kids. The race car piece and huge kitchen utensils are pretty awesome to see and great photo opportunities. However, bring hydration with you, other you may end up spending ridiculous amounts of money on water or a diet coke.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christiembailey
40,A Visual Feast,"All the reason I'd avoided the museum for years (no parking, huge crowds, cramped cafe) have changed and I've upgraded my opinion from ""Good"". I went to see the Kubrick exhibit (excellent), wandered the museum store (well-organized but cramped), visited the cafe (a bit more space), and wandered through the newer parts of the campus as well as the collections. Perhaps it was that I went on a Friday, the crowd was small and it was very pleasant to wander and peruse without bumping into people or navigating around bored/unruly children. There is no way to know ahead of time what the crowd will be like, but generally it's smart to avoid the first few weeks of a new exhibit.This is not a cheap day out. Entrance to the exhibits is $20 (no discount for seniors or teachers which is offensive--other museums in Los Angeles do give discounts or free entry), parking $10, items in the museum store that held my interest were pricey (books...just use the app SnapTell or or Addall online to give you cheapest prices on the same editions), and for a sandwich, bottled sparkling water and chips I paid $14.89. If one can afford a membership, it's probably a wise decision if you're planning on many visits in a year.Signage could be much improved, but then most museums opt for a map than mess with their architecture. Bathrooms are clean and easy to get to (near elevators).The museum's collections of art (Page Museum, Japanese Art Museum, and contemporary space) are worth seeing. While not the Met in New York City, it has a wide range of art from antiquities to the modern.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BritFrenchPol
50,Kubrick fans.... it is a can't miss,"Only scratched the surface of this place, as the sole purpose of our visit was to see the Stanley Kubrick exhibit. It was terrific and a must see if you are a fan of the director.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1531FFtomd
40,Art and Tar within walking distance,"LACMA has a good collection of art and sculpture. What most people do not do is explore the entire museum grounds. The Asian collection in the back of the museum contains some very pieces of screen art, silk painting and carved stone/wood. Be sure to get something to eat at Ray & Stark which has an excellent menu. Afterwards you can walk over to the Tar Pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lagiant
40,A challenge!,"LACMA is a bit of a challenge to navigate. They give you a guide to the layout of the buildings, but I found it very difficult to orient myself and therefore I had some trouble figuring out where to go. I've had friends say that it takes several trips to the museum before you figure out the lay of the land, and I would agree with that. Also, the signage is not adequate. I understand that they don't want to ruin their aesthetic, but it can be frustrating to figure out what floor of what building you need to go to see a particular exhibit.That being said, their exhibits are frequently wonderful and surprising. The recent Kubrick exhibit was amazing not just for the artifacts, but the way they were presented - so inventive! It gave me the shivers.I was disappointed by the Levitated Mass piece, however. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I just did not experience any feeling of the illusion that was supposed to take place. I really, really wanted to feel the levitation effect, or some reference to it at least, but I think that boulder emperor has no clothes; it's just a big rock on a shelf.I would discourage people from making a quick trip to LACMA. You really need several hours to see even a small portion of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VikkiTiki
50,A great accident,"we we to visit the Brea Tar Pits, next door and a great attraction in itself, and were looking for somewhere to get out of the sun when we spotted this tall building and before we knew it were inside a very impressive art gallery. We knew the Getty Museum was very good but were completely unaware Los Angeles had a second major Art Museum. We did not have the time to do the place complete justice but it is a very good Art Museum much on the standard of the Getty",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pala49
30,"As far as art museums go, there's tons of better ones","I visited the museum about a week ago and though it has some amazing collections, I feel like the museum hasn't utilised the space it has available.Working in the heritage/arts sector, I think there are many other art museums who utilise space better and also engage with the visitors more. This is a very 'flat' museum and doesn't really provoke huge amounts of inspiration. However, the galleries on South Asian and Islamic art were particularly interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahI487
50,Spend a Day - Enjoy Life Through the Ages,"I like to go to museums. I like to check them out in every city I go. The LACMA doesn't disappoint. There are enough treasures here for everyone to find something they enjoy. (Word of Caution: there is a lot of walking once you are inside the building). There were magnificent dishes from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. I found that amazing because with all the wars that have happened in Europe, beautiful things survived. There are fine paintings from several centuries. There was a film exhibit of the work of Stanley Kubrick (director of A Clockwork Orange and other films). There's a great outdoor cafe and just a wonderful place to go to get away from the traffic of Los Angeles. Make LACMA a don't miss stop on your visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrag791
50,Kubrick exhibit is great,"LACMA is another great LA destination, and currently the Stanley Kubrick exhibit is a must-see even for lukewarm film buffs. They have a great collection of his cameras and lets you get a feel of how difficult it was to film much of his work, and see the technology unfolding as he continued to create movies. The museum itself is great too and worth a stroll around the grounds on a nice day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasons827
40,Wow!,"Great place to visit. Eclectic collection of art of all genres, well presented. We paid extra for the Stanley Krubick exhibit and it was worth the price of admission. Also walked through the La Brea Tar Pits which is next door and a good park for kids to let off a little energy before or after the restraint of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110AlR
50,Never been here before! It is cool!,"Friends and I thought we would do something we never have done! We went here!It was really neat! We left the beach for the day!We had a really neat time & enjoyed being here! Art & more!Just a really neat place!I'm not sure what all to say because I am not usually into art & all!BUT, I had a good time! We all did!So....go, learn, enjoy, like!We did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hbsurfer1
50,Special place in downtown LA,"Not only did LACMA have fantastic art but a special (extra charge) retrospective exhibition on Stanley Kubrick that was amazing, short clips of most of his films, original scripts & handwritten notes, costumes from films etc etc Truly an excellent exhibit, ongoing til June 30, a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelingnurse055
50,kubrick exhibit was comprehensive,"the stanley kubrick collection was amazing and is a must. detailed artifacts from every movie, including his unfinished Napoleon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KyleC164
50,Interesting museum,"I liked the ancient collections, but dislike very much modern collection of the museum. And not because I do not like modern art. I like it if it's done with the talent and not just pretend to be talented. But almost all collection of modern art in this museum was represented artist without any sign of talent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NadejdaR_13
50,A museum worth visiting,"Many museums are stuffy, extended encless isles with boring art. This is not the case for the LA County Musuem of Art! Due to an totally involved staff and curator the isles are alive with information, presentations and creativity explaining the variety of paintings, sculptures and items. The interaction between viewer and the art is the key, and well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gladbags
50,LACMA,Fabulous display of art work. Try and arrive on the 2nd Tuesday of the month - its free!! Excellent collection of modern and American art,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/924DavidL924
50,Los Angeles County Museum of Art worth seeing,We arrived at the museum just in time to join a tour in the European section. The docent who conducted the tour showed us pieces of art that contained themes of mythology and gave an short explaination for each painting . We then went to the special exhibit for Stanley Kubrick’s . It was very well done and very interesting. We had a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssl56
40,Nice Museum,My son wanted us to go to LACMA. Now we have been to all the NYC art museums so this one is about the same as those. They did have a special Stanley Kubrick exhibition going on and we paid extra to get into that. If you are a film buff that was worth it.It was a nice way to spend the day and it's right next door to the La Brea tar pits so we got to see those.For lunch go outside and cross the street there are about 20 food trucks thatl ine the street. with all different kinds of foods.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CruisingChick
50,Don't miss the Kubrick exhibit!,"The exhibit of Stanley Kubrick's films is fantastic! If you happen to like film in general, Kubrick in particular, and ingenious exhibits, this one is for you. Clips of Kubrick's films, from the well-known ones such as A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket to early ones I'd never seen or even heard of, are on display along with interesting narratives and cool objects, including a chess set, cameras, sets, and costumes. It's given me much to think about!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamM575
40,Kubrick Exhibition,"This is a must for any film fans, it is well set out and gives a real insight into the man and his research into his many movies. Interesting to photographers as he began as a photographer. Photos of the exhibition are allowed without flash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaBamford
50,A great city museum,"LACMA is a great city museum. It has wonderful collections and outstanding special exhibits. They also have good activities for children. Situated right next to the LaBrea Tar Pits and the Page Museum which is full of great fossils, it offers two attractions in one location. The food carts across the street are a great place to purchase a local, picnic lunch to eat in the park, or the gardens surrounding the museums. There is also a museum cafeteria on the premises.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllegraS_12
50,Outstanding,"LACMA, as it is called has a fantastic permanent collection and great travelling shows as well Check open days like all museums in the city they vary.

50,Always an unforgettable experience,"This museum is by far the best in LA. I have been a member off and on for ten years and recently rejoined.The renovation opens up their world of art to all.I especially love the colossal rock exhibit, it is undeniably an adjective of LA and what LA is! You have to be there to understand what I mean. Just the way it was brought to LACMA and the LA moments it inspired, street parties, etc. No doubt. I am an LA gal at heart.Nance",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nbellef

50,Great museum to spend an afternoon,"Even if you don't explore the interior of the buildings, just walking around in an afternoon is such a pleasant and happy time. Roaming around the lamp posts is fun and also enjoying kids zigzagging among them. We even saw a dog having fun running between the lamp posts. Have your photo taken by the suspended rock looks like you are holding it up - great for all ages. There are food trucks across the street with lots of options if you get hungry. There is something for everyone at this museum. Have lots of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mollydaisy
50,"Spend At Least A Day, Something For All Tastes And Ages","So many wonderful exhibits! Kids (and adults) will love the tar pits and the Page - just one of the museums on the LACMA campus. The Japanese Pavilion is a work of art in itself and filled with wonderful things. The Broad is modern art. There are always wonderful exhibits coming and going. If you love art, you will not want to miss LACMA. For refreshments while at the Museums, you might want to read my review of Ray's and Stark Bar. There are so many incredible museums in the Los Angeles area, but if I could only see a few, I would definitely include LACMA,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephanieM101
50,LACMA is a must see!,We are here with grandchildren. Today was a special day for NEXGEN....next generation...so the children got permanent memberships and are entitled to each bring in a guest. there were nice art workshop tables set up outside which they participated in. We also took the 3:00 American art tour with a excellent and knowledgable docent. LACMA is worth spending time at. It is conveniently located next to the LeBrea tarpits......another most see in downtown LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingrm

40,Go for the special exhibits,"I don't attend the museum regularly, as once you have toured the permanent collection you have seen what there is (and they have plenty, just not items in my particular interests) But their special exhibits are always first rate. I still think fondly of a costume timeline exhibit they put up in January of 2011 that was so spectacular that I have even dreamed about it. The little wine bar/coffee shop is worth a stop, comfortable and great people watching. Parking is easy as well, in LA that is more or less a miracle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynthiacZ4570GI
50,Enjoy the tar pits and fine art,"Enjoy the tar pits and fine art. Still a great place, even though it has become over shadowed by the Getty. It is fun to simply wander and enjoy the art. Very nice collection of Asian art. Canters is only about one mile up Fairfax from LACMA. It is a great place for cheesecake after the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad

40,Tim Burton Exhibit,"The LACMA is always a treat. The parking is convenient & located across the street. It is best to go during the weekdays to avoid the rush or when Im there, I prefer less people, thx. The Tim Burton Exhibit was quite the sight to see. Taking us back to the early inspirations of his life & even the side projects that few people or knew about until this exhibit.Exploring the rest of the museum is sweet too. Allowing your self a few hours to get the full experience is worth it. We must appreciate & support the arts before they fall before us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZachR899
50,Wow! Loved the Expressionist art,"Went on a Target sponsored free admission day, so was able to just spend about an hour wandering through the German and Expressionist art, the Cubists and part of the pop art exhibit without feeling guilty about not seeing the whole museum. It was a wonderful way to experience this museum, which has an incredible collection of art that really interests me. Can't wait to go back to see the rest of the museum! However, I'm sure it would be possible to be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of art on display. LACMA appeared to be very family friendly and not pretentious...making art accessible and exciting to a new generation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barnhok

50,L.A.'s big museum,"The Getty museums get the big press, but this is the place in LA for all kinds of art--not just European-American. Great collection of S.E.

50,Pleasant Surprise,"I went to LACMA for their Mapplethorpe exhibit, not knowing much about the museum. The Mapplethorpe exhibit was very small and hence somewhat disappointing, but the rest of the museum turned out to be an unexpected surprise. There's an amazing amount of art on display, comparable to some of the top museums in the world. There's a low key factor about the whole museum making it a delight to visit.I ended up spending hours in the museum and will sure return to see the rest on a next visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDSV
50,A Must for Happiness!,"I always enjoy world class museums and am elated as a parent to have one of the best to which I can take my kids all the time, for free, and one they truly enjoy. With the new added parking, we love combining the museum with a new family tradition, Marie Calender's on Wilshire.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NKradjian
50,What a collection!,"The LACMA collection is comparable to any I have seen in London, Amsterdam or Italy. One room contains 3 Rembrandts. and the variety of art is vast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Microblue4
40,LA County Museum of Art,"With the various changing exhibits and music events, you won't like all of it...but probably will like some of it. Permanent collection has some nice items and you can have fun walking about. Getty is classier but you get to see just a bit there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisF95
50,Best museum in town,There is just something about this museum that has something for everyone. My favorite is the permanent collection. I could go everyday and still feel it was an incredible experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thechameleone
50,Great to visit once,"I am not an art person, however our company really encouraged us all to visit LACMA, and gave us free passes so that I did! It's a beautiful location, not only to visit but also if you are looking to take engagement pictures here, it's a gorgeous choice. I know a couple that did so and the pictures turned out fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sspanther
50,Must-Do Experience!,LACMA is an awesome museum! We loved the Caravagio exhibit! As well as the Stanley Kubrick exhibit! We loved everything we saw there! Absolutely everything! It was sooo inspiring! I highly suggest going to dance through the lampposts as the sun sets! Your visit to LA might not be complete without it! :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isoulshines
30,"Large Museum, but not as good as other local museums","For my money, LACMA is a large museum but with an average collection in an average setting. Granted, I'm an amateur when it comes to knowing about art, but for my money the Getty Center in Brentwood is far more impressive in terms of its views and its architecture, and its European art is about on par with LACMA - plus the Getty is free ($15 to park, however) whereas LACMA is not. The Norton Simon in Pasadena is also smaller, but its grounds are a bit nicer and its art is on par with LACMA (European) and exceeds it in others (Asian). On my last visit to LACMA I was especially let down by its collection of Asian art - especially in terms of Indian art the Norton Simon has LACMA solidly beat. The Japanese Pavilion at LACMA is a great building but I found the art in it to be mostly pretty dull. The ""suspended mass"" exhibit is hard to get in to, for me at least - I don't find there to be much artistic value in placing a large boulder over a man-made concrete trench, but that's just me. Another small complaint is that LACMA has a general admission for one fee, but special exhibits are usually extra money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MachThree
50,LACMA--must see,"This time I visited the Latin American/pre-Columbian ceramics wing. It was extensive and extraordinary. Many areas represented from Panama to Mexico.And the Kubrik show is great. Rooms are divided up by film: one room is 2001, one is the Shining, the other Barry Lyndon. Storyboards, scripts, film clips. Lots of back story about the making of the films and the research that went into each one. Check it out.Their shows are beautifully curated. And their contemporary art collection is awe-inspiring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosed538
40,Fantastic Stanley Kubrick retrospective,"Went to LACMA on a whim to see the Stanley Kubrick retrospective while in LA for 4 days and was blown away by it: extensive, informative, well laid out, room to move and to contemplate: an outstanding exhibition. The typewriter from the Shining, a droog costume from Clockwork Orange, letters from Kirk Douglas signed Spartacus, furniture from 2001. Unmissable for cinefiles! The museum is a well laid out campus arrangement of old and new galleries and pavilions. Easy to find, easy to park, easy to enjoy. Plus, a few Caravagios!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/POPs13
50,So much here!,"I planned my trip to Los Angeles to board a ship around the Caravaggio exhibit at LACMA. The exhibit was great but there is SOO Much More there! Great decorative arts, an entire Japanese art building with hundreds of 18th century netsuke s out of various materials. Furniture, photographs, a Japanese Garden and so much more. Plan to spend a day and do eat at Rays! Their innovative pizzas and salads, plus such new sides as caramalized sun homes made our day a perfect adventure!Very helpful guides there tooM",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreddieF340
20,what happened to caravaggio?,"LACMA brings in a mixed bag of exhibits, and the current high-ticket offering, ""Bodies and Shadows: Caravaggio and His Legacy"" (the academic title should be warning enough), unfortunately turns out to be more marketing ploy than substance. Where, pray tell, are the actual Caravaggios? -- fewer than a dozen are on display, and those are far from his best work. The exhibition mainly features uninteresting work by second-rate painters (with the occasional exception of a De la Tour) whose connections to the master both biographically and...er...artistically are tenuous at best. The whole thing smacks of a marketing ploy disguised as a collection of paintings, the better part of which might have been left in the basement. Note to those increasing number of visitors who choose -- nay, are forced -- to rely on the audio tour: if a work of art doesn't speak to your heart and your gut, no pointy-headed intellectual diatribe is going to help. And hey, LACMA: what's the deal with the lack of signage on the various galleries? I can appreciate minimalism as much as the next guy, but, come on. The day we visited there was a helpful docent with a plummy English accent directing people to the exhibit. Good thing, too, otherwise we might never have found it. If you want to spring the extra bucks, see the Kubrick exhibit instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirkE266
50,Caravaggio and his greatness,"This exhibit going on right now at the LACMA is really amazing. Caravaggio really was an amazing painter and his light and darks are surreal to see in person. There were about 8 of his works and then the rest of the gallery held paintings by artists that were inspired by Caravaggio. Georges de La Tour's The Magdalen with the Smoking Flame is there and is one of my favorites and some paintings by Simon Vouet and many other artists. The exhibit ends on Feb. 10, 2013, so get there soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CassieP262
50,Always a favourite,This is a great museum any time you visit. The permanent galleries cover such a wide and interesting field and if you are lucky the special exhibition will really please you. Spend 2 hours or a day. and food there is very reasonable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigvicSydney
50,Excellent Collection of Diverse Art,"This is my favorite museum in California. To explain why would take too much time and space to review properly. So let me just say that the campus hosts a number of smaller/sub museums - Japanese, Asian, Antiquities, Jewelry, abstract, classics, top notch traveling exhibits and a permanent collections of photography, sculptures, paintings, etc. If you love art and are in LA, remember to set aside a day to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alexander_Designs
30,Encyclopedic with mediocre exhibits,Permanent exhibitions (other than contemporary) are tired and uninspiring. Caravaggio-based exhibit was my main reason to visit and it was not worth the price of admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCS-310
50,What a wonderful place!,I attended the pre-opening of an art gallery with a private organization. The reception was very nice and the docent was very informative. It's a fantastic museum and people should take the time to visit this wonderful place...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smcrawford38
50,Caravaggio and Kubrick,We parked at museum and since we were early walked over to the LaBrea Tar Pit in adjacent park. Didn't have time for museum there. Good Caravaggio exhibit at LACMA but was really impressed by the Stanley Kubrick exhibit. A must see for movie buffs. Museum also has good selection of German expressionists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nanl_13
50,Kubrick a must!,"If you are around, go see the Stanley Kubrick exhibition. You have to spare around half a day since there are too many things to explore, read, view. Nearly all materials he used to shot his films are there in front of you. Original storyboards, scripts, his hand written notes, letters...you name it. Ends June 30, 2013. There are also apps for this event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HPM900
50,Go see KUBRICK!,The guy was crazy but what a genius. His films make you think out of your comfort zone. This exhibit was comprehensive & quite interesting. Now I need a couple tubs of popcorn & a free weekend to revisit all his films. A very well done exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mauram525
50,WOOOOW! SO NICE!,We spend ALL DAY at LACMA! It was a lot of fun! The Caravaggio gallery is absolutely incredible. I totally suggest getting the recorded tour because his story is super interesting! WOW! I love art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelsK21
40,A Destination for the Culture Enthusiast and Lover of Arts,"The Los Angeles County Museum of Arts is a new addition to the ""Must See"" in the West Coast. Located in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, the museum is a landmark on its own with many lamppost lights that automatically lights itself at sundown. It is the subject of many photographers for it is a unique background with uniform vertical lines and the play of lights accentuate the faces of the subjects. The tour goes through a two storey structure with rooms devoted to various art pieces......classical painters to modern photography...sculptures, black and white charcoal renderings. There are also books on tables if one would want to read on the painters, sculptors or the photographers of those in the exhibit. It normally takes two to three hours to go through the different halls. Should your feet feel tired, you can even take a breather in the chairs or benches available in some halls. The elevator we took from the ground floor to the basement was much bigger in size, probably used to transport the art items that are huge and enormous. After the culturally enriching educational tour, our party of 13 enjoyed a picture perfect moment in the many lights of the front promenade of the museum. As tourists, the Los Angeles County of Museum of Arts presents a very enriching experience for the students and the adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KIMI4812
50,A Must-See Every Visit !,"LACMA does not disappoint! We spend a day here every time we visit our son. Not only is there always something in the permanent collection that is a draw, the special exhibits are always great, too. This last time, we finally saw ""Urban Light"" at night ... WOW! LACMA is a treasure Los Angelenos are lucky to have at home and affordable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visuality
50,classic art,"If you like classic realism this is the place to go. They have many many great work of great masters in classic art. They also have a small section for modern art.

50,Excellent,"Clean, well organized. Very nice staff. Cost was very reasonable.Exhibits were well done. Great for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnE633
50,Rainy Day Programming,"LACMA as it is locally known offers many exhibits depending on the time of year and the availability of special programming or exhibition tickets. We were able to buy our tickets online, the day before and although we could not buy the special exhibition tickets online, the staff at will call was kind enough to allow us to upgrade for the special exhibits. We were treated to a wide variety of media forms from Stanley Kubrick's life in film toCaravaggio's 16 /17th century masterpieces. We only had a few hours but walked through some of the permanent exhibits as well. The crowds are well managed and we were there during high tourist season around the winter break. The grounds architecturally are really fantastic. Worth price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lgoldman
50,Much More Than the Name Suggests,"Any museum having the word ""county"" in its title conjures up visions of a small collection of regional art in some out-of-the-way place. Nothing could be further from the truth of LACMA. It is a fine museum with impressive permanent collections. I went recently to see the Caravaggio exhibit, which was very well displayed and curated. This exhibit was one of several temporary shows, all of which seemed well-attended, yet the museum was not uncomfortably crowded. There are parking lots and garages nearby, as well as street parking. We had lunch at Ray's, one of the museum's restaurants, and had a lovely meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tarquinvi

50,Fantastic museum with something for everyone,This is one of LA's proudest. It continues to grow with more interesting exhibits all the time. The installation in the Front is beautiful and cleaver and they now have a new restaurant and bar.There are free concerts during the summer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Disarma

50,Inspiring even for me!,"My teenage son wanted to see the Kubrik exihibit since he is into film. An amazing event and it included admission to the Caravaggio exhibit as well as the rest of the museum. One can spend all day here. Though the Kubrik exhibit has timed entries, we were able to walk up to line and buy a ticket. Make sure to check their website for more info on prices and other events. Under 18 was free. The most challenging part was part was parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerrylovesTuscany
50,Great International Exhibits,"My wife and I took in the Stanley Kubrick and the Carravagio exhibits and they were each fantastic. The museum is quite large with plenty of room to spend an entire day looking at works from many time periods. LACMA is definitely world class, we are members of the De Young & Legion of Honor Museums in San Francisco and find LACMA to be a great museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/570garyb570
40,Kubrick and beyond,"I visited the Kubrick exhibition to fill in some time,it was great, well put together and very informative. LACMA clearly has a lot to offer and I would research a visit more thoroughly via their web site next time to get a full understanding on what's on offer. There are a number of pavilions and items on show and they have an app to help as well. I think you could easily spend the best part of day here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jungledrums
50,If You Like Art Plan On Staying All Day,"Just as the City of Los Angeles is gigantic, so is the main art museum serving it. The wide variety of art on display will please any taste. Art from the antiquities through modern is on view. We arrived at 10AM and did not leave until we were worn out. There are a number of building featuring different kinds of art, so before you start touring, look first at the map at the admissions desk to make sure you see what you are most interested in! We did not have time to visit the special exhibits, which do cost extra above the $18 per person entry ($15 for seniors). The museum opens at 10AM most days.The Art Museum is located next to the Page Science Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits. We looked at the Tar Pits but did not have time for the Science Museum. To see it all, you may want to allow two separate days. Otherwise, you will need to move fast to see it all in one day!There are two restaurants on site. We have never tried either. If you don't like the menu of either, you might want to leave the museum (in and out privileges all day) and walk one block east on Wilshire to Callendar's restaurant for lunch.Parking is fairly easy. There is a lot on site at about $6 for the day. On Sunday, there is free street parking, available within a block if you arrive before 11AM. The Wilshire Avenue bus runs often if you take public transportation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Modestotrekkerl
50,Ah...,"Yet another museum with so many works that really moved me that I burned out pretty quickly. I was glad to see ""Ceci n'est pas une pipe"" again. Kandinsky, Klee, and wonderful Rothko, oh! oh! and a Morris Louis! I love Morris Louis. And more more more.But don't touch the sculpture! Shame on me- I moved the Isamu Noguchi sculpture ""Chronos"" and was scolded by a guard, who asked me, aghast, if I had touched it. I admitted that I had. But look at it! It moves only if touched and makes a wonderful sound. Some things are meant to be touched. But I get it, ok, don't touch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jebsldn

40,Great exhibitions,"I did not have time to go around the whole museum, however I loved the exhibition on the surrealistic drawings. I love Dalí so it was amazing to see this. I also appreciated the section on the modern art and surrealism. The only thing that would make this place better would be if better guides were given to the visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mirusias
40,Great collection,"This gallery has a fantastic collection of art from ancient Syria right through to 21st century, and from a range of cultures including Japan, China, south America, Egypt and Europe. My only complaint is that it was a little confusing to navigate and I couldn't find a map. I also saw audio guide numbers on pictures, but couldn't find where they gave out audio guides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CityGirlAimee
40,Don't miss LACMA if you're in LA,"The collections are great and interesting. Van Gogh to Nauman, Dürer to Rodin. African art, Chinese art, Egyptian art...Currently exhibited is Stanley Kubrick, which I think is incredibly interesting.Michael Heizer's ""Levitated Mass"" is in the back of the museum. It's easily found if entering from 6th Street. Whether or not it moves you is one thing, but the reactions I noticed while visiting on a busy Sunday were positive. Children, parents...it's a highlight of the grounds, which is saying a lot considering the pull of the tar pits where prehistoric fossils were captured.If you're into ""Game of Thrones"", don't miss the Page Museum's Dire Wolf display of skulls.Great place to bring a sophisticated date or a family. The kids love to run around and play on the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outofdodge_10
50,Outstanding,"We visited LACMA on our recent Thanksgiving trip to L.A., intentionally to see the Stanley Kubrick exhibit--and it was excellent. Extensive displays, organized by movie title, including photos. In particular I appreciated the explanations of Kubrick's attitudes and philosophies that were printed on the walls within the exhibits. Some video presentations included. With the ticket to this exhibit, we also were admitted to the Caravaggio exhibit, although it was in a completely different building. All the museum buildings are very attractive as are the grounds. Was a little bit surprised to see an actual tar pit. I don't think of that as ""art,"" but since it seems to be a natural part of the grounds, it lends itself to some lessons on that subject.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaylorSheila

50,Lots to see and experience,"With nine buildings, you need to plan more than one visit to see everything. Start by seeing just a few things that really interest you, or just go to see the highlights (they provide a list of the top five attractions), so you don't get burned out. Along the way get a sense of the layout of the place, and find more to visit next time.The Caravaggio show had a small number of his original works, and several works by contemporaries and later artists influenced by his style - altogether a very good, first-class show.With the L.A emphasis on film and entertainment, the Kubrick show was a natural; who knew that an exhibition about a film-maker could be so engaging and interesting? You will spend more time here than you think.Tip: The higher-profile, higher-priced dining near the main entrance for those who want to see and be seen (and ' be discovered'? <grin>). Regular folks go to the Plaza Cafe on the east end of the complex (Bing Center); but the bathrooms near there are tricky to find (down the stairs, around the corner)Tip #2: the Museum's main collection (not the special shows) is free on Tuesday; the complex is closed on Wednesdays.Tip #3: park underground at LACMA for $10; after visiting the museum, walk a few blocks north to The Grove and the Farmer's Market and spend a few hours there before returning to fetch your vehicle.Tip #4: very curiously, the stairs are closed in ""Art of the Americas"" building; you can only use an elevator to access the upper floors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccvvbb

50,The LACOMA experience,"Terrific location, ample parking,with easy to find eating sites for the weary traveler. Plan ahead to know what exhibits are showing for your time frame. Google is most helpful. We found that the LaBrae Tar Pits are on the same city property. This is a gold mine of sights and features for a great day in this area. You will need only one parking fee for the day. LACOMA has changing exhibits in most of their buildings. Went for the Women in Art in June finding Freda Khalo's work in this exhibit. Fabulous finds that I had never seen. Really like the folk art of her peiod. Each building in this complex houses a different peiod of art. Spent the entire day at this location. Came away so impressed with the collections seen at the various buildings at LACOMS. Photos are allowed without flash. So I took advantage of this opportunity. Give a senior price. Get going to this fine museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/564barbaraw564

Awesome date place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoffreyS81
50,Stanley Kubrick Retrospective,"I really enjoy the retrospectives that LACMA sponsors. The ongoing Stanley Kubrick event has all kinds of information about his most important films and his career as photojournalist. The props, call sheets, research books and more from 2001 Space Odyssey, Dr Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, Spartacus, etc really provided great insight into these trendsetting movies. I'll have a new perspective when I watch them again.We also saw ""Band"" by Richard Serra, which is an amazing steel sculpture that looks like a piece of ribbon. Each time I see it I wonder how someone could turn 1-inch thick steel plates that are more than 10 feet tall into a twisting, turning object that draws you in and seems welcoming.We did finally visit the Levitating Mass. What a let down. It's a large rock. Where is the art in that?LACMA has a large variety of art, furniture, sculpture and various rotating shows. We always enjoy ourselves. The only bad thing is that food is very expensive onsite. It is best to walk a few blocks away to the various restaurants in the area. Parking is easy. For $10 you can park all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MethosAdventures

50,One of the largest and most impressive Museums in LA,"The County museum has something for everyone. You can focus on the permanent collections to see old world artists like Picaso, Monet, all of the big impressionist painters, and also take a look at contemporary artists from LA, Mexico, South America and other continents. The installations like the Street Lights, just outside the entrance, are fun for the kids to run around in, and if Metropolis is still going, its a mst see. My son spent 30 minutes just watching what has to be the world's largest Match Box car track/city. The trains and cars go around the largest track I've ever seen. And outside, all around the Museum are the Le Brea Tar Pits. You don't have to pay to see those--a must see if your a visitor to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariachurchill
50,Now THAT's Modern Art!,I love this quaint and impressive Museum. Always updated with new artists and it's a romantic place to go see art and have a nice lunch date as there is a cafe next to it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maralora
50,Wow MOCA,A great museum always worth a visit. Was able to park on the street and pay the meter $4.00 instead of $10.00 in the lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joe1Lee
40,Beautiful,"Gorgeous structure, nice architecture and beautiful artwork. I could easily spend a an afternoon and want to return again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KerenB928
50,Great,If you're an art lover you have to go here. There is such a diverse collection of art that there is something for everyone. Even my boyfriend who does not like art at all enjoyed visiting here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaraR464
50,Must see!!!,"The exhibits change like any museum, but there was some fantastic ones on my last visit. I absolutely loved it! Especially the hot wheels Metropolis II sculpture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleygB1916RD
50,Always interesting activities and events,"Beautiful museum. Popular tourist attraction, with the rows and rows of lamp posts outside. Great photo opportunity. The exhibits that make their way here are wonderful. I still think about the Tim Burton exhibit from last year. Very clean and well maintained museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2Connelly
50,This is a good museum.,"Like most museums, it has its strengths and weaknesses, largely reflective of the donations it has received. Some major artists have very few works on display, while others are well represented.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeInBKK
40,Classy,This facility is well kept and informative. You'll learn something and feel cultured when you leave.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kst00Visit
50,this place is massive,"I had some free time in the afternoon and was told by the hotel staff that this might be an interesting place to go to. Boy they were right.The LACMA is spread out over several buildings, each covering a different topic. There are some temporary exhibits and some permanent collections from Benefactors.What interested me most was the main building with the vast permanent collection of european art. It was great to see some of the pieces on display finally close up as I had only seen them in books or on cards.You will need to take out a day to give this museum your full attention and take in all it has to see. Or why not make it a museum day as it is situated right next to the La Brea Tar pits museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hulltog
40,Great week day escape,"Visited on the 2nd Tuesday of the month--its free admission. Very quiet only a few student groups. Lots to see in several different buildings. Parking $10. Enjoyed the modern art, lots of Picassos. See the Levitating Mass-- a huge boulder elevated so you can walk beneath it. Nice sculpture garden with some Rodins and a wonderful Calder in a large fountain setting. Several places to eat although I did not try them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfd
50,beautiful,Such a great place for the whole family. I take my niece there whenever there is an event. We love going for Ethiopian food beforehand as well. Yum in the city!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Renej721
50,Music concerts are fabulous!,"Friday and saturday evenings there are music concerts in the garden. You can bring your own food and even alcoholic drinks and just chill in the grass while listening to different musicians, for free! It's a great experience, perfect for some quality time with family, friends or even a date.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camisl
40,HUGE place- only saw a tiny bit of it!,"LACMA was great to visit. It had heaps of cool things to see in it, I only saw a tiny fraction of it before I got too tired from walking around. I mostly looked at the European art and wasn't disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Olivia312
40,"Great visit, as always, but too many areas were under construction.","LACMA is a mandatory visit for everyone visiting the area. The variety to exhibits, the quality of art, and the ambiance converts everyone into an art lover. We found the Japanese and Chinese exhibits outstanding as usual an d enjoy the fact that the permanent collection is being rotateted on a regular basis; it feels fresh and new on each visit.Our only complaints are concerning the monstrocity of a very large rock in the back garden that someone try to pass on as art. It cost a lot of money and it is dissappointing. One would expect better from the curators.Our second problem concerns the large number of galleries that were closed for installing new exhibits. While change is necessary, the renewal should be spread so most of the galleries should be open. We travelled from a long way, Texas, and were dissappointed at the number of closed areas.However, as I said above, LACMA is still a mandatory visit for everyone to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterke73
40,"Great to go, especially when they have free days!","I went on Memorial Day, as Target was sponsoring the admission. A lot of cool things to see, especially the Metropolis exhibit. Fans of pop culture won't be disappointed either. If you want to see this place, go on a day when it is free (some evenings are free as well, just have to get around the traffic though).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/got-rice
50,VAN GOGH EXHIBIT.......,".........Vincent Van Gogh sold one painting his entire life!!!! so when i saw the placard in the County Museum of Art ""VAN GOGH SUNFLOWERS BEACH TOWELS"" sold out!!!!!!!!!! i had to pause to reflect on how we as a society treat out greatest artists!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the exhibit took my breath away at least 73 times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! then head over to the Farmers Market for some yummy JAMBALAYA at the Cajun place.........Jennifer Anniston was eating next to me one day!!!!!!!! and the friday night KARAOKE is the world's greatest since all the wanna be stars hang out there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevepriceCBSnews
50,A must see on Miracle Mile,"We spent a lovely few hours here on the Carmageddon weekend - where they offered half price entry for people who had travelled by public transport.The exhibitions were brilliant and we spent most of our time in this part of the gallery, with the largest elevator I have ever seen! I have to come back and finish the rest of it another day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moogharrison
50,Great sculpture garden,"Contains a large Calder that moves with water fountain (and wind), one of the nicest you'll ever see. The museum is very large and sprawling. The contemporary exhibits were outstanding. The elevator in the contemporary building is a work of art in itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uri123
40,Well-rounded museum,"There's all genres of art here. We went on a museum free day and kids to seniors all found something to enjoy. It's a bit overwhelming with all the buildings -what to see first? I enjoyed the Van Goghs, the Munchs, the Monets, as well as the art deco furnishings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/horsin
40,Very good but could be better,"I love museums and I wanted to love this one but I found it ""very good"" rather thanexcellent as I would imagine worthy of a city of this size. Many noted artists are representedbut the collections of each artist are limited. As someone else noted, this museum is inneed of a better reception and brochure to guide museum visitors. I believe in the importanceof museums so I joined anyway and I hope that as I get to know the museum better, I will enjoy it more. I stopped by the informal cafeteria-style cafe and found a variety of entrees that looked good. The cafe staff were friendly. Seating was both indoors and on the patio. There was a more expensive restaurant which I did not visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckystars
50,Get lost for a few hours,"This is a great, big museum with excellent exhibits that you can get lost in for a while. I really like the selection of abstract expressionism. The Pacific Art selection is a little sparse, but it has some interesting pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freejinn
50,A wonderful museum visit,"Always offers something different and special! Love the decor, architecture, and ambiance. I enjoy the multiple building experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davemabe
50,Like a college campus full of art,"Plan to spend a day at this delightful collection of seven buildings. Spread out on 20 acres in the heart of LA, there's something for everyone. The Pavilion for Japanese Art is my favorite - it's like being inside of a huge chrysanthemum. The Ahmanson Building contains the greatest variety of work, from ancient to modern, and with a fine collection of Pacific, Islamic, and Southeast Asian art. The Hammer Building has a wonderful gallery for children. If the weather is nice, enjoy lunch on one of the patios. This is a must-visit part of an LA itinerary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcello
40,LACMA didn't disappoint,"The entrance fee was a very reasonable $15. Much of the art was wonderful. They need a better guide to the collections, though. I felt lost much of the time and felt like I stumbled onto famous works of art rather than being directed to them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J20009
40,Spent a pleasant afternoon there,We were surprised at the extent of the museum. Didn't expect so many buildings and exhibits. We particularly liked the Picasso paintings. Also liked that it was right next to the La Brea tar pits. It was an interesting way to spend an afternoon in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roamers99
50,Always something new,They have fantastic exhibits from around the world that are hand picked and found by their curators. The permanent exhibits are also excellent. One of the best museums that I have been to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/losharoth
50,Rotating collections means you check frequently,"I always check the LACMOA website to see what new collections are on display. The permanent collection is good, but they have had fantastic limited engagements the past few years which means I return again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lud2006
50,A must see,"Loved the Chris Burden's Urban Light art and 'The Rock'. The grounds are only a short walk to the Labrea tar pits, another must see (and smell).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcbens08
50,Love LACMA,I have loved LACMA for more than 20 years and there is always something to see. Do not miss it! The film series is always amazing and the sculpture collections are divine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriM810
50,Lots of Art,"LACMA opened in the mid-sixties and parts haven't changed, but parts are quite modern. In recent years, several new building have opened and the complex has about doubled in size from it's birth almost a half century ago. The eight or so buildings feature art from almost every part of the world and time period. Los Angeles has hundreds of museums, but if you want a cross-section of world art, LACMA has the most variety and is the largest. The museum is on Wilshire Boulevard along ""Museum Row"" within walking distance of several other museums and the famed La Brea Tar Pits.Renaissance, Contemporary, Japanese, Hindu, American, European, fine art, abstract, paintings, photography, sculpture, mixed media, it's all at LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828

40,Good museum,Expansive grounds with many buildings housing diverse collections. You need a lot of time to see it all! I recommend making a plan and sticking to it so you don't get overwhelmed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wmnookin
50,One of the best museums in the U.S.,"LACMA is one of my personal favorite museums. The curators are not afraid to be bold with their contemporary exhibits (having devoted a whole building to them, they have the room for unusually monumental works), but they maintain significant collections of older art, and the Japanese pavilion is a wonderful space. The overall experience doesn't compare to the Getty, but the art here is much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbertS436
50,Good variety of art,Really enjoyed their July contemporary show. Some good conceptual art. They also have a nice selection of Chagalls and Picassos. Short on Monet. Lovely patio.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Calabacitas
50,Too Big for One Quick Day -- WoW!,"Lots 'n lots to see. The cafe is good, the contents of the art work makes one wish there was a motel next door so to appreciate with more than one day visit..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anaheim_Marilyn

50,above par,The museum had so many Picasso. I was impressed with their Islamic section with a very fun exhibit of a comic book based on their mythology. Alos their is a great patio bar that is fun to sit at after several hours walking round the museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmhumphries
50,Fantastic musem,I love the rotating exhibits. Definitely go for the Jazz performances. The big name exhibits sell out so be sure to buy your tickets early and expect long lines.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LincolnInnVT
50,Gigantic complex of art,there are a lot of buildings in this complex with different collections. My 4 year old and I only went to a couple buildings and ate at the cafeteria in the 3 hours we had... Daughter's favorite installation (and apparently most of the kids' favorite) is the outside piece where there are hundreds of yellow rubbery plastic tubes hanging from the steel frame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maychang
50,The highlight of our LA trip,"We had no agenda for anything to see here but absolutely loved the 3 of 6 museums we saw here. The architecture is just fantastic and the paintings from Picasso, Braque and others were nothing but spectacular. Tar pits are in the same area and were a huge hit with my son who could actually watch the tar still bubble up while imagining what it must have been like in prehistoric times. Can't believe this museum doesn't rank higher in things to do. The day we went we lucked out and it was free, check out the schedule as it was surprisingly not that crowded for a free day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrankyPantz
50,I LOVE IT!,I've been here about 5x now and every time I love it here! It's so pretty and many things to see. Even though I've seen it a gazillion times! A great place to take many pictures and memories. :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nlee1220
50,Better content please...,"I didn't got this time, the current major show wasn't appealing enough. But on my first visit top LA my wife and I went to see the Donald Judd exhibition. It was jaw dropping. We were indoors, so could have been anywhere, in any city, but there was a subtle atmosphere that gave the Judd show an extra lift. It felt like this show was at home, like it had arrived. I don't think Judd, the person, had much to do with LA, but the minimalism leant itself perfectly with LA. So, as for the Museum, like all museums - execpt Tate Modern and the Getty - they're only as good as the content. It's a nice space, the obligatory shop, good facilities etc etc. More shows like the judd show please.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/major_rawls
50,Perfect Ending For My Trip,"Have to go there at night as during the morning, you cannot sense the serenity of this art piece. We went there shortly after dinner and stayed there for 30 minutes. There was a bar next to it and filled with people. The area is a bit off at night, safe though and not difficult to catch a cab. Strongly recommend to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hoivic

50,Great walk-around even when they are closed,"Walk under the big rock, admire the streetlights (hopefully at night) if you are just passing through and don't have time for the full museum experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hankkacz
30,Just Walk Around,"My husband and I went for the Tim Burton exhibit, which was crowded but fantastic.The painting collection is extensive and VERY good and well worth a visit to connoisseur as well as casual viewer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannel160

40,Very Handleable Taste of Art Near To Hollywood,"We've been to this museum many times for all kinds of exhibits and find it a very easy place to visit because it's not large, not overwhelmed with artworks and well laid out - a pleasant respite from the hectic life of the city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thewindatourfeet
50,lovely evening,This is an amazing museum. I went for a jazz concert on the plaza. The band was positioned in front of the vintage lamposts. The view was spectacular and the sound delightful.The exhibits are many and varied. It would take at least a day to see it all. Restaurant and gift shop are located off the entrance.Next to La Brea Tar Pits. I traveled on the bus which stops right in front.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clearspace
50,A Great Spot,Right next door to the La Brea Tar Pit!! Great art to be seen. Right down the street from some really wonderful lunch spots.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darryl61
50,Getting better all the time!,"The LACMA is growing and expanding like never before and offers so many new options and experiences it is amazing! Any time I visit there is something happening. Always a must visit... I like to stop through on random odd hours since there is too much to take in. I recommend blowing through one gallery one day for one hour or less, then do it again another day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorBuckles
50,Must see to everyone who likes art!,Many world masterpieces can be seen in this museum. The restaurant is also very good. Don't miss the Japanese and the European shows!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YatyrG
50,So much to see!,what a magnificent place. So much on offer and a good variety too. One needs several trips to take it all in. One travel guide said entry fee was expensive but compared to Europe I think it was good value for money. My favourite 'sculpture' was the big rock poised over the walkway!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arlene945
50,One of the best art museums I have visited,"This is a wonderful museum with a wide variety of art, including contemporary art. You can spend a whole day at LACMA and still not see even half of the collections. My daughter and I particularly enjoyed the Japanese section. And right next door to the museum, you can walk through the La Brea tar pits for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QBzzz
50,In the words of Randy Newman . . .,"WE LOVE L.A. and especially this museum. It is very mid-century and proud of it. It has a half a dozen galleries/exhibition spaces so it's as if you had gone to several museums rather than just one. Good location, parking available, and just minutes from the Farmers Market at Third and Fairfax. Adjacent to La Brea Tarpits and its Page Museum so worth a day's outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanbeach11
50,A wonderful icon in LA,"I like to take advantage of the free or reduced admission times. So much to look at any time you go. Don't try to rush through, but take your time and you can always go back (If you live locally!!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/athas17
40,Jazz @ LACMA,"A group of us ladies met up there on a warm and wonderful Friday evening with our picnic baskets and wine. We enjoyed the jazz background music, eating, laughing, wine tasting and the beautiful orange lavender sunset behind a row of California palm trees! We are California girls for life! We stayed until way after the sun set and would have started our very own ""occupy LACMA"" but the sprinklers were about to go on!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happytrails31283
50,Great Art~Worth A Trip!,"Nice variety of art and plenty to do in the area. Tip~ Try the new six inch Tom Tom which has real-time traffic updates, if you opt-in to be part of the link. It saved me 45-minutes of rush hour hell by routing me down a side street. It zoomed me out of downtown LA back to Long Beach! This area has horrible traffic at rush hour. So have a traffic update Tom Tom or expect to be sitting for at least an hour during rush traffic. Way better than my Garmin or Magellan, both 2012 returned to Costco!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/airebornranger
50,Even an East Coast art lover can find happiness here.,"When visiting LA or its environs, we always make time for LACMA. The temporary exhibits vary in quality, but those on display this summer are terrific. The permanent exhibits are first rate, and would make a visit worthwhile. The ""California Design"" exhibit was well-curated and informative, and the Richard Sera sculptures are displayed very effectively here, since there is adequate space for their huge dimensions. Plan on spending most of the day - and do not miss the restaurant, which is one of the very best in the city.The museum is quite user-friendly, with associated parking, escalators and elevators.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunvalley6
50,A Must-See,"After a brief visit to the Le Brea Tar Pits next door we made our way (via the Plaza cafe - awesome lunch) to LACMA. Our main reason for going was the ""California Design 1930-1965"" exhibit which was on at the time. It didn't disappoint, but neither did the other exhibits which we briefly surveyed on our way through the myriad of buildings in the campus. There is certainly lots to see, and the children are well catered for as well. If you love art and architecture, you'll love LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerjen99
50,"Metropolis, alone, is worth the visit to this great museum","My wife and I visited the LACMA on Sunday, July 15. To begin, it is architecturally a beautiful campus with a fine collection.We spent the most time at Metropolis II, http://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/metropolis-ii. At first, glance it appears as a gigantic electric train and toy car display. But as I looked at it, I saw in minature the impact of the automobile on our perception of the city in a way I had never fully recognized before.The metroplis is not the buildings, and not even the roads. It is the movement of automobiles and trucks, and very frew trains, with their cacphony of sound.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeAnnArbor

40,WHAT'S WITH THE STUPID ROCK?,"It's Emperor's New Clothes.....Mr. Govan. BUT, Ray's and the Stark Bar are very cool for drinks or lunch/dinner. The installation of the streetlights is always intriguing. Gives good lawn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lurkinc
40,Great Museum,"The museum has a large modern art section (my partner's favorite) and an extensive Renaissance art collection (my favorite). The staff was pleasant and the building was wonderfully air-conditioned, a serious benefit for a summer visit. The downside was that several of the exhibits (including the photography exhibit) were closed. We could see into the exhibits, but they were roped off from visitors, which was a bummer. Also, the cool mini-city with moving parts (Metropolis II) only runs until 5:30PM most days, so if you want to catch that exhibit in motion, don't save it until the end of your visit. If you enjoy modern art or Renaissance art, their permanent collections are wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/40addyb
50,One of the best collections on the West Coast,"Fabulous musuem, one of my favorites! Great exhibits, beautiful spaces, INCREDIBLE outdoor free jazz series Friday nights in the summer - get there early and get a seat UP CLOSE - one of my favorite things to do in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joang82
50,Great Exhibits and a perfect location.,I love coming to LACMA and have a membership to take advantage of all the great deals. The gift shop is wonderful and has freat sales too!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laguera411
40,Easy way to spend the afternoon,"The time you spend here will depend on the special exhibits as the core collection covers only a couple of the four or five galleries, but still allow at least a couple of hours. The Richard Serra sculptures are absolutely amazing and in a space that allows the light to play wonderfully off the surfaces. There is a great cafe/ restaurant on the site, that catches the afternoon sun and it's a great place to while away an afternoon. I'll definitely be checking out the programme on future visits as the special exhibition that I saw of Mexican art was excellent. The museum is easy to reach and has a taxi rank out the front. If the rank is empty the staff will call a cab for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenisC_11

50,Simple Name for a Sophisticated Complex,"LACMA has morphed over recent years to become a cutting edge contemporary art site. It also houses one of the best restuarants in LA. We have visited each time we have come to LA and there is always something fresh and novel as well as some older favorites, especially of American art and sculpture.We visited the day before the new suspended boulder sculpture was opened for public viewing. Hope to see it next visit.It's worth setting decent time to visit the several buildings which comprise the complex. Even the escalators and lifts are works of modern art, functional but visually exciting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X8450VJdavidb

50,Great place to spend an afternoon,"I traveled to LA several years ago. At the time admission to this museum was $6, and it was the biggest bargain in the city, I thought. The coelacanth alone is worth the price of admission!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SRHays

40,Eye Candy!,"I really had to push my schedule just to make way for this museum and it didn't disappoint me. I had my car valet and right in front of the center of LACMA was a music night where people gather drinking, having fun, dancing to the music and living the life. I fell in line with the cashier and paid an entrance fee. I was in a rush to make my way inside for I have only 2 hours left til the musuem closes. When I finally got in, I was surprised to see painting, sculptures made my artists that I have researched and studied way back in college. I was in awe by the boldness and extravagance of the silverwares which dates back early 17th century. The papyrus from egypt, costumes from different countries which are of great, great value now.Overall LACMA is indeed a nice place to visit if you have ample time left to appreciate the art and surrounding. The different buildings which houses the Japanese and ethnic sculptures might be a little too old and needs an upgrade but interestingly, the art covers it up to a certain level that you tend to forget because your imagination is flown away by the vast collection of avant garde and amazing art pieces!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieConti

40,well worth a visit,"the museum and cafe offer a great place to see wonderful art and spend your day. we've been twice in the last 2 yrs and wonder why we didn't go sooner. the cafe impressed us both times.if i had to choose though, i'd prefer a day at the getty museum or huntington library over the lacma...probably because they offer a wider variety of exhibits that appeal to me, and lovely outdoor gardens as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcinca
30,Check opening times,Very disappointed that didn't open until 12 noon - in effect wasted a morning because of that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikezw
50,Don't miss it.,"It's not the National Gallery or the Louvre, but it's a large, broad collection with numerous special exhibitions. The ambience is excellent. It's a great place for any art lover to pass a full day, or make it a half day and check out the Getty, the Norton Simon or the Huntington.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fringe_Gatherer
30,If Only....,"LACMAhas the potential to become a great museum. But it has a ways to go. Unexplicably, the signage inside and outside is uniformly bad. They have extensive parking but no sign on Wilshire Blvd. to point to the parking. Once on the lot, there are no signs to direct you. Once you find the ticket booths, you will get a map of the various galleries which is not specific enough to be of much help. LACMA has expanded its campus as well as its collections. However, because of the extensive facilities it would take a person who wanted to see all the art in all the buildings and on all the floors between 4 to 6 hours minimum. Most of us have neither the time nor the stamina to do so. Virtually every visitor will have to choose what to see and what to defer. The brochure should be much more helpful in making this choice. It should mention the most important treasures of the museum and in which exact rooms they are located. If I went to the Louvre, I would not want to miss the Mona Lisa. Beware if you are a physically challenged citizen. Bring a helper, do not relie on the (outsourced) guards to assist. Unless you run into SADIE, a positive, welcoming, warm guard who should be training the others, you'll be out of luck when confronted with the super-heavy entrance doors, the elusive and badly maintained elevators, and the lack of signage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Giselle1106
50,My Regular Place For a Walk,"I work nearby, so I often stroll through here. Sometimes I can't find parking at work, so I pay a little extra to park here as well. I've never paid more than $10, but I think the maximum is $20 if you don't have a museum receipt. I hate difficult parking situations, so the fact that there is ample, easy parking and a short walk from the parking garage to the museum is a huge plus for me. (Even though I will walk all day in the museum, I hate having a long walk from my parking space to my destination.)The staff throughout the museum, including the parking, have always been cheerful and welcoming. This has become one of my go-to places for a peaceful walk. It's a very calming experience; and I would never have guessed I could have such a pleasant experience right on Wilshire Blvd. I can walk through here feeling like I escaped the city and leave with a clear mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeaJenniTravel
50,LACMA is wonderful,"Amazing, 8 or nine buildings and such a variety of art to see. It is an eye opener. Especially loved the Japanese gallery and the display of mexican art and artifacts.

50,resurgence of LA's encyclopedia museum,"I'm a volunteer docent at LACMA and the new director has breathed new life into the museum not only as an art space but as a social gathering place. Excellent temporary exhibits enhance the very varied permanent collections. Ray's on the plaza is a wonderful place to share lunch, listen to a concert or meet friends for a glass of beer or wine after work. So proud to be part of it's new life",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janieB1123
50,The museum has gotten better!,"We saw the exhibition of the first major study of California midcentury modern design. With more than 300 objects—furniture, ceramics, metalwork, fashion and textiles, and industrial and graphic design—the exhibition excellently examined the state’s role in shaping the material culture of the entire country. Organized into four thematic areas, the exhibition aims to elucidate the 1951 quote from émigré Greta Magnusson Grossman that is incorporated into the exhibition’s title: California design “is not a superimposed style, but an answer to present conditions…It has developed out of our own preferences for living in a modern way.""Check out Roys for lunch. Excellent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel4Leisure_2

40,Fantastic gallery,"We visited the final days of the California design exhibition, tracing the mid-century design trends in CA. A great exhibition in itself but topped off with a visit to just one of the permanent displays of late C. 19th and C.20th European and mid C.20th American art. This was a compete knockout, with 20 Picassos on display along with several Kandinskys, Warhols etc. Just wonderfull. Watch out for the lovely Raoul Dufy and the Degas ballet dancers in particular. You'll find parking for £5 at the rear of the museum. Do try to avoid the hideous shopping strip down the street on Wilshire - the only potential blackspot of our entire ten day visit, but I managed to keep driving...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liege-Bastogne-Liege
50,A great afternoon in LA,The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) holds a variety of exhibits in a number of buildings. Buildings are dedicated to certain styles/eras and cover the globe.

50,One of the Best Museums I've visited,"The property is enormous! I suggest comfortable shoes! Tip: Dress to impress and eat lunch at Ray's in the courtyard.Then change your shoes and explore the museum. There is a coat/bag check at the museum ticket counter. Everything from the buildings to the landscaping is pure art. It is a full art experience. The collections and installations are some of the best I've seen.Take advantage of the discount or free admission the musem offers:NexGenChildren and teens enrolled in LACMA’s free membership level for anyone under 18 receive unlimited free general admission to the permanent galleries and exhibitions.

50,"Love LACMA, can't wait to go back!","I made my first trip to LACMA over Memorial Day weekend and enjoyed the experience. This review can't really express how cool this place is. You can see everything from Andy Warhol's famous Campbell's Soup poster to Rodin sculptures to Monet paintings. Circa 450 BC gold coins? Yes! On and on it goes, the Broad Contemporary Museum has a truly wonderful piece called Metropolis II that will make even the most jaded guy smile as the little kid inside them lights up watching it. The Resnick Pavilion had 2 special exhibitions that made it worth the price of admission by themselves. And let's not forget the Ahmanson building that we filled up a memory card taking so many pictures in there. There is so much to see, so many styles and types of art that there's truly something for everyone here.5 Stars? How on earth could anyone give it anything else! Love, love, LOVE LACMA!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamieMK

50,"If you haven't been in years, go. Become a member.","My wife and I went over a year ago to see the Olmec exhibit and ended up becoming members. With the new buildings and new bar area open, I fell in love with the place. I had come many times before to see certain exhibits (King Tut, Pompeii, Dali, etc.) but had never been wowed by the place. The new additions are wow. Become a member and go for free whenever you like because it's too big to see in one visit. And, as members, we often get two free tickets to the exhibits that cost extra. They have great free music and show great films too. I only wish I lived closer so I could go to more events. LACMA is way better, in my opinion, than the Getty Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nakaboots
40,Art Museum Worthy of LA,"While LACMA's collection isn't particularly focused on local artists, it does cover works from a wide range of eras and cultures and wil take a half day to peruse. This museum is not as Europe-centered as others and even has an entire building devoted to Japanese arts. The campus itself is a hodge-podge of architectural styles and is no Bilbao, but what's inside more than compensates. As a local, I visit here about four times a year, catching most of the temporary shows that come by. Unlike other attractions in LA this one is easily reached via public transport by taking the frequent bus 720 from downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UnclePaulie

50,Very cool.,"Like I said, LA is the art city of the US. LACMA is just another cog in the wheel of wonders. Great architectural design, perfect layout of the different exhibits - a place to explore. My 11-year old son, who was very skeptical about going to yet another museum, totally loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raf1860
50,A must see place in LA,This place is one of the best destination to visit for both locals and tourists!. It offers a great collections of arts ranging from ancient times to the present. They usually offer free admission on certain days of the month and weeknights for locals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinharly

30,A museum with no art,Talk about a disappointment. Maybe I visited at the wrong time but I was not overcome with the amount of art on display. We walked into one huge building and it had 5 things in it. It took longer to walk to the building than to walk thru it because their was so little to see.I paid 48.99 with discounts to get in for 2 adults and 4 students. It would have cost another 17.00 per person to see the special exhibit. This place is way overpriced for what is on display.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/istanbulrocks
50,One of the best art museums on the west coast,"LACMA is a great destination for the family with a wide range of exhibitions, constantly changing, sure to please. In addition to a strong collection of Asian, Latin American, European and American art you will find a great collection of contemporary art. Check for free admission days, free tours, catch a film or just spent a little time watching the wide range of visitors at this central LA location. Right next door is the La Brea Tar Pits.

30,Start at the Tar Pits,"LACMA is close to the La Brea Tar Pits and a good day can be had by starting there, checking out the art and ending with a picnic on the grounds.Night events include ""artsy"" concerts that are nice. They often have art activities for children. I enjoy the ancient sculptures and the occasional special exhibits.LACMA offers free days and free passes (laments mailed after you apply) for children that include one adult free per child.BEWARE of driving in the far right lane in either direction on Wilshire Blvd. - Potholes 8 inches deep is not an exaggeration. You will wreck your car if not careful, or maybe lose your life if on a motorcycle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat

50,LACMA Art,"Checked out this place after Angelina Jolie checked it out on the second week of April 2012. I was curious.Nothing to see at the Japanese and chinese museum except if you have kids or toddlers they have space for that.Enjoyed the Mid Century art that feels like I am in Washington DC museum with big large paintings. The Pacific museum right below it is ok, not much to look at as well. For the price of $20 you can be there for at least 2 hours. Take a camera and extra battery.Make sure you flash your tickets at the entrance of each building you enter.I like the elevator for contemporary art museum and the big plates. That's it nothing else to check out.Check it out. It's worth it as everyone else in the hood has been there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rivers25

50,Really impressed with all the improvements,"I hadn't been to LACMA for a number of years so I hadn't seen the Broad and Resnick buildings - they were quite impressive and perfect for the art they displayed. It's a bit pricey between admission, parking and food so you better make a day of it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanFranciscoKaycey

I then went to see the California Modern exhibit and one or two of their permanent collections. Although their art isn't my exact forte (mostly modern art), it was really interesting. Certainly a must see for those interested in that type of art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b89905
50,"Great selection of art from all centuries, great restaurants, and in a fun area","I love this museum, the new additions for exhibitions are well done, the place feels like it is run by artists first, and corporate money-makers second. Two great places to eat, and you can sit around the courtyard and hear great live music. There are great paintings from every era to see, especially the Japanese gallery. It is worth visiting for that alone. Two paintings that are highlights for me that I visit every time I go are Georges de La Tour’s ""Magdalen with the Smoking Flame"" and Édouard Vuillard's ""Walking in the Vineyard""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Finnagain57
50,"Good exhibitions, music!","The new Resnick Pavillion has many excellent exhibitions. The Japanese Pavillion's permanent collection of painting and netsukes is wonderful. Good Asian art collection. Free Friday evening Jazz concert, Sunday evening classical, and Sat Latin music is a big treat! I also like The Ray's restaurant and Stark Bar",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lv2goplaces
50,Not to be missed,"I visited LACMA on a Monday and had a blast viewing LACMA's collections. The place is absolutely HUGE and the complex has multiple buildings, such as the Resnick Pavillion, Broad Museum of Modern Art, Ahmanson Building, Hammer Building, etc. It will take most of the day to truly appreciate the collections. LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH, they are really serious about that at LACMA. And big brother was watching...the one time during my visit when I couldn't resist touching, I was the only one in the room. Seconds later, a museum attendant came from the other room and politely asked me not to touch, meaning big brother was indeed watching and relaying my movements to the attendant via ear-piece. Most of the attendants were very, very polite. But the one guarding the ""special ticket exhibition"" and was all to happy with himself for turning me away from a ""special exhibition"" that my general ticket didn't cover. LOL! Also, if you show your student I.D. you get in for $10. Park at the 4hr meters on 6th street to save a few bucks, but make sure you move by the right time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GarrettH537

But there is much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kozad

The exhibit was powerful and the atmosphere was mesmerizing. I wish the main gift shop had been open. We didn't have time to see the rest of the museum but I would definitely go back based on what we saw this time around. Parking was $10 in their lot. Both kids' admission was free (ages 16 and 17) and my ticket was $20 so it was a reasonably priced visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redpatch7
50,Come often for the exhibits and the jazz bands,"My favorite is the Korean art exhibit and the Japanese museum, two floors and a garden of all oriental art and gardens. There is a jazz band that plays on the patio (check times) and the museum is free on Holiday Mondays, such as MLK day and Columbus day. There is also a very comprehensive exhibit of Dutch masters, and an Egyptian exhibit as well. Plan to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnastaciaM7

As we like photographic essays, a LACMA curator recommended this to us. The photos were subtle, nostalgic and evocative and we were not disappointed.TIP: Parking--we suggest street parking which can be found within 2 blocks off of Wilshire Blvd. Parking here helps lessen the impact of the museum's $15 adult admission fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrMonkey2001
50,"STUNNING, A REAL SURPRISE TO US, ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL MUSEUM","LACMA was a real surprise to us. More artwork in this museum than all the venues we saw in LA combined. There were at least 50 Picassos and over a 100 Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. The antiquities and other art was also stunning.LACMA is situated on 20 acres and spread throughout 7 buildings. It is the largest museum of any kind west of the Miss. River. We wondered where the art came from. Turns out that Willam Randolph Hearst and many others donated 100's of pieces to the museum. Another surprise was that the La Brea Tar Pits, a famous ice age fossil site, which is located right behind LACMA. It is part of the Page Museum but if you walk out the back of LACMA you can walk around this bubbling lake of natural tar that captured many animals thousands of years ago.We originally budgeted a couple of hours at LACMA but ended up spending 5-6 hours there. The physical plant itself is nothing to write home about. Don't worry, once you see the collection you are not worrying about the physical plant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VAChuck

50,Great museum and architecture,"Great museum and architecture!!! I visited the LACMA during the Tim Burton's event in august, that was great! The place is just amazing. Great architecture of renzo Piano, great colors (white and red immortals!), great museum! I truly suggest a visit! I also raccomend the latin american wing, in the old part of the structure. The bar at the entrance it's perfetc for a smart aperitif...

50,If you only do one thing in LA- come here- by the 720 bus!,"I had a couple hours, no car, what to do? I won the lottery by choosing this museum. You can get here by the 720 bus from downtown. Its a terrific collection- or rather series of collections. I spent an hour in the ""In Wonderland"" show, and was awed. But the regular collections- American, German Expressionists, California- all were great also. My biggest regret is that I missed some of the buildings- ran out of time and energy. I will definitely return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSSnowshoer

50,Love it! Free Music,"The exhibits are always interesting, but my favorite thing about LACMA are the free concerts when the warm weather sets in. It's a great free date night, bring a little cooler with fruit and cheese and with the music it's a wonderful time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelSecrets78
50,These surrealists are surreal!,"This is a beautifully arranged exhibit of women surrealists working in the US and Mexico. I wanted to go because of the Frida Kahlo pieces which were extraordinary. I didn't realize that the painting ""Two Fridas"" was so monumental in size. The museum dedicated nearly an entire wall to this work. Amazing! The other works in this area were also self-portraits, allowing visitors to compare techniques. A charming grouping! I fell in love with the delicate work of Spanish painter Remedios Varo. My head is still full of images from her pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethLongBeachCA

40,Open Friday night,"Went here after another museum closed; parking after 7pm was free, easy to get to. Entrance after 5 pm Friday is free for some. I wanted to see the Egyptian exhibits. It was small but well presented. I spent more time with the adjacent exhibit -- an excellent Mesopotamian exhibit. They had multiple small items I hadn't seen elsewhere in the US.I didn't have enough time to do this museum justice, scanned a few rooms of paintings. I will return next time I'm in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poma77

50,Great museum with a range of exhibitions,"I visited twice while in town for a few days, because I did not have enough time to see everything the first time. Open air courtyards and walkways between the gallery spaces are refreshing, and I was awed by the gigantic indoor Richard Serra piece. A great place to visit for art lovers!The restaurant/cafe is tasty with incredible customer service but pretty expensive. Also, watch out for the wine prices, I assumed that with a number of prices for each wine, the smallest one was for a glass.... wrong. It was for a half-glass 3 oz. tasting. Hence, twice as much as I had expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sone-a-rone
50,Incredible Experience,"attended an incredible reception for the College Art Association there. The artwork was amazing. I saw a Women in Surrealism exhibit that blew me away.

50,My secret pleasure,Went by myself for four hours to see the design exhibit and Wonderland (American women surrealists artists). I really enjoyed both and the regular exhibits. It was target Monday so entrance was free. I left my car with the valet and had a great time. The Metropolis exhibit with toy cars on tracks through a city was fun too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCR_12
40,Saw King Tut traveling exhibit,"Went for a limited engagement, special event, so can't really comment on museum as a whole. If I had to pick between this and the Getty, Getty wins. That is unless a special exhibit comes to town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beckyjake123

50,Make a day of it,"This is a great museum to spend a day and see all forms of art, always check to see what special exhibits are going on in case the cost is extra. A few years ago we saw the King Tut exhibit here but it was like a cattle call. I prefer to go when it's not such a high profile exhibit and you can really enjoy the museum. I like to walk next door to the La Brea Tar Pits too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RumRunner01
50,Absolutely a Must-see whether you live in L. A. or are visiting,"I have grown up with LACMA. It has given me my appreciate the arts, culture and history. They have several exhibits at once. If you want to see paintings by old masters, sculpture, graphic arts, film, jazz, they have it all. If you are hungry, they have a cafeteria as well as a rolling cart with coffee and snacks as well as a restaurant. The area also is adjacent to other smaller museums as well as the famous La Brea Tar Pits. It is great for the single visitor or for a family with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tamale624

I would go back every day. It's close to farmers market and the grove, not far from so many other interesting places in LA. Anyone I spoke to was very friendly and knowledgeable. A great experience.

30,Think it's a little overpriced!,"The museum has a lot of space and it didn't feel like it had all that much art in it. A lot of it is modern art and keeps one thinking ""really?"" I think it's a fun place to visit if you haven't been but would recommend the Getty Museum over it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
30,Impressive collection but uncomfortable setting,"The painting collection is extensive and VERY good and well worth a visit to connoisseur as well as casual viewer. Unfortunately, there are many drawbacks to enjoying the collection, the most obvious of which is that there are really very few of the paintings on view at any one time. The signage - telling you where and how to get there - was absolutely terrible when I was there. I understand that it has been improved since then. There are almost no benches or sitting areas. For people who cannot stand for hours at a time, this is tremendous problem. Finally, the staff/guards are woefully uninformed. For full enjoyment of the paintings, you really need to do some homework before going — or rent the audio guides which may or may not discuss most of the works on view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cal_traveller_9
50,It's huge!,"Waw. This is like the biggest museum i've ever been to. It's a pity that the modern art collection was so small. I don't care too much for African and Pacific art. My favorite painting there is Camille Pissaro's 'Éragny' because it reminds me of my childhood in France. The only thing this museum was lacking is a nice spot to have a drink. There are 2 or 3 boring bars / stalls, nothing special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoisonedIvy

Wow!Some of the original spaces are now under renovation and closed, but the new spaces are worth checking out.There was a great exhibit on California mid century in a separate building, too. If you don't want to park on the street (metered parking), there is a pay garage on the parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chicago90Phoenix

50,Something for everyone,"I always like to visit the museum when I'm in LA. This time I was accompanied by a toddler and parents. Seeing the museum from the point of view of the little guy was fun. Just let them run around with you among the streetlamps, paint in the kid's room, or just look at massive modern works of art. The campus itself is a work of art that will encourage a lifetime interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saralpo

20,Always disappointed.,We travel a lot and have been to a lot of museums. This one and even most of their special exhibits are a disappointment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbyLA
50,Sensational!!,"LACMA hosts a free classical recital every Sunday eve @ 6 pm sharp at their ""Bing"" building. The recitals are usually courtesy of emerging performers who will certainly bring joy to the classical music connoisseurs of all ages. We have a 6, and a 3 year old young impressionists who are starting to discover the world of color and sound so we decided to bring them along in hopes of planting the artistic seed. Our kids are behaved, but people with young ones are advised to sit in the back rows allowing for a quick incognito exit just in case! The recital lasts an hour, so its not too demanding of the young and restless! The hall @ Bing is large and there's ample room and the sound quality is great even in the very back.What a joyous evening this was; reminded me of my own recital days many moons ago.. This was also a chance for the kids to identify with the etiquettes of such cultural events.. A thing they don't teach in schools.We used the underground parking ($20) or $10 with validation, but I'm sure there are alternatives we've yet to explore.Botton line: Just do it, you won't regret ;)LACMA's recorded info [--]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rixj

50,Can't be beat.,"As a former Angeleno, I'm all too aware of the fact that LA boasts many, many amazing cultural institutions. The Museums here rival any in the US. The LACMA, though, will always hold a special place in my heart. The collections are amazing-- it's ridiculously easy to get lost here, particularly after the 2006 expansion. There's so much too see and it is all of a stunning quality. My advice to visitors-- if you are able to make return visits, do so. You'll be more receptive to enjoying the smaller marvels of the collection. For example, if you're looking for one of the most peaceful and calming places in LA, try the oft-overlooked Japanese Pavilion. It's quiet and isn't overrun with visitors. Amazing.Do return, too, for the dining and jazz concerts-- an inexpensive and classy way to do up an evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thetravelingjen

The fabulous furniture, artwork, artifacts were a real treat, they even had an Avanti and an Airstream set up in the mix! The rest of the exhibits are interesting and fun, but the nostalgic southern CA show was the delight of the tour! I would highly recommend a visit here with some fun friends for a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DennisM356

Many fossils of bear, camels and horses were found there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/passionate-gardener

40,The county Museum of Art,Great colection of art. Once in a while they have other things(such as music or special exhibits).

50,A Hip Contemporary Version of a Big City Art Museum,"LACMA is a gem located in the heart of Los Angeles. Under the leadership of Director Mike Govan, the museum has expanded with several new buildings designed by Renzo Piano. Even if you've been to LACMA before, it's worth a visit to check out these grand new spaces. The museum has begun to create programs that reflect the cultural diversity of the region: on any given week you will find artwork from the Pacific Islands, South Asia, China, Japan, India, Latin America and Mexico in addition to a rich collection of Western classics. The museum has a good selection of modern artwork, too. And the Eli Broad collection of contemporary artwork is absolutely first rate: Basquiat, Warhol, Ruscha, Baldessari and many more. Don't miss the amazing steel structures on the ground floor of the new museum. A great place for a visit, a walk, and lunch at the outdoor cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superplex
10,Will not attempt to go again,"Encountered more than one person at the museum who gave attitude instead of directions, attitude instead of help, and unless you come in from the parking structure I imagine you won't get any direction or maps. I will continue to use them online, but I will go to the other museum on the block who truly cared that I was there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ablackram
50,A must see!,"I spent an entire day at the LACMA. It was definitely worth it. The collection is fantastic. I would go so far as to say its more impressive than the Getty. German Expressionist master works, a whole room of Picasso's, Magritte, a fabulous Japanese art collection, a wonderful pre-columbian collection, great pieces of Mexican artists like Tamayo, Rivera and Khalo, and fabulous pieces of American arts and crafts furniture. The contemporary building is worth it just to see the giant elevator. Even the cafe had great homemade, tasty food. An art lover should really make the time to see the LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/metrochica
40,Very LA,"Lots of displays, some better than others, but even the building is a work of art. (and there is a nice view of the Hollywood sign).If you know the Met in NY, the Prado in Spain or the Louvre in Paris, this is very different. Is it the next step in museum design or just the LA point of view? I don't know, but the LACMA complex definitely brings a fresh point of view to the museum design discussion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DesignCat
40,LACMA,"Even though the idea was to just find a hotel near LA that was reasonable and near the sight seeing things, we ended up within walking distance to the LACMA and the Tar Pits. This is not only a great area to stay in, but the museum complex is huge. Its free to the public to just walk the complex and see things outside (tar pits included), but you need to pay the fee to go inside the different exhibit buildings (there are a lot of them).There is also parking you can pay for at both the LACMA and the tar pits, but we did find parking on Sunday on the street for free.The buildings are big and spacious and exhibits are very interesting. The personnel and security were friendly and helpful.We were very glad we took the time to go here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rpstory

50,"Not even a big art fan, but have been a member for years","I am in no way an art expert. I know what I like when I see it..... I first went to the LACMA many years ago, when a coworker mentioned a Renoir exhibit, I recall. Have been a member ever since, and have seen so much amazing art, that people would travel the world to see, that I feel it is a true privilege to be able to go to this museum. While my favorite of all time was the King Tut exhibition, I also loved the Heast Castle and Pompeii exhibitions, and so many others. There is always something good. The Tim Burton exhibit was fun - that one is the most recent special exhibition. The Edward Kienholz: Five Car Stud 1969–1972, Revisited, which is still there, really gave me pause. It was haunting for me. You can read about it on the LACMA website. I am proud to have become a LACMA member and broadened my horizons. Whether you visit once, or forty times like I have, you won't be disappointed. If you love jazz, they have great jazz in the summer. I personally like going for a few hours on Friday night. Really fun night out, and of course, a Pinks dog is available in Hollywood if you choose to stop on the way home! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere
30,"Great museum, needs more art","My husband and I went for the Tim Burton exhibit, which was crowded but fantastic. We chose to visit the rest of the museum afterwards. While they have some great art, there is a lot of space and not much art to fill it with. What they do have seems to have been leftover art collections that they could scrap together from what hadn't already been collected by big European museums.I would share that the food was great in the restaurants, but the service was slow, and it was way overpriced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lfcox
40,An interesting California design exhibition is on at the moment.,The design and architecture which makes California unique is on display at the LACMA.

40,Monet/Lichtenstein: Rouen Cathedrals,"If you love Impressionist paintings, don't miss this exhibit.

Took picture of “Urban Light” by Chris Burden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fitnesswla
40,"Interesting, if a bit overwhelming","The LACMA is definitely a must-see if you are visiting the LA area and are an art lover. The biggest drawback is the size. It is huge complex with a layout of several different buildings, so one must read the map closely to determine how best to get from one to another. The signage for visitors is not particularly helpful or evident. Ditto for the guide staff. The edgy exhibits are unusual (at least those we saw) and quite different from any other art museums we've visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizajane47
50,An excellent collection,We wandered over to LACMA as it was close to our hotel and we had some time to kill. We didn't really know much about the collections before visiting and we were very impressed with what we found.Not only were we impressed with the collections but we also thought it was fantastic that the museum caters for children by providing free entry and a space for them to create their own paintings and drawings.LACMA is definitely worth a visit for all art lovers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelfromOz

We were also fortunate enough to listen to a free jazz concert at the LACMA.Entry costs $15 (or $20 for entry + Tim Burton exhibit).It's also an easy walk up Fairfax to the Original Farmer's Market and The Grove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aggie_Z
50,Worth multiple visits!,"This is most definitely one of my favorite places in Los Angeles. It's a great place to meet up with friends for a day of enrichment or meeting new and interesting people at one of their many night events. Their permanent collection is absolutely awesome! One of the things I saw were the Greek vases which took me back on a trip to memory lane because when I was in World History back in high school, I also remembered seeing those same vases in the textbook. I also like the whole set up of the museum. It has a contemporary feel to it. The Japanese exhibit is also a must see. I'd come back here over and over again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/213MarkB
50,Exhibits galore,This huge museum encompasses several buildings and holds many interesting items from art to silver and gems to travelling exhibits. Located right next to the La Brea Tar Pits you can take in both with one stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lih
40,"Went for the Tim Burton exhibit, saw a few other things.","Definitely a nice museum with some cool exhibits if you're in to art and the like. Very nice grounds and the Tim Burton exhibit was excellent! Would have liked to explore more, but didn't have the time. For the price, there's a lot here to check out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alstensby
50,A must see,"The main purpose of my visit was the California Design exhibit, but ended up spending all afternoon touring the permanent exhibits and really enjoyed it. The museum is in several different buildings that front onto an open air plaza. Mostly contemporary art along with some earlier pieces, furniture, glassware etc. Edward Keinholz's ""Five Car Stud"" is on until mid January 2012 and its an incredible installation that hasn't been displayed since the mid 1970's http://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/edward-kienholz-five-car-stud Free wi-fi through most of the campus and a great app for the iPhone that you can download through itunes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveller_yyz
50,I LOVE LACMA,"Must visit LACMA, whether you're from LA or not. It's such a large museum and it really has art for all kinds of art lovers!The really fun thing about this museum is their Friday Jazz nights and Saturday Latin Jazz evenings in the summer time. It's free to show up and listen to the music, great musicians and fairly pried drinks and tacos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wholisa85
50,Always a Treat,"We need to support the traditional arts in LA and there is no better place to do this than Los Angles County Museum of Art. The exhibits here are always excellent, very cultural and diverse. Great way to have a date with your hubby and then hit the town for a nice dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChelseaEd73
40,Great place to look at art and have a night of music and drinks,"It isn't The Getty, but in some ways it's more interesting. Not the same architecturally, but the art and atmosphere is arguably more enjoyable. It really depends on what you're looking for. The Getty has a view and LACMA has a more ""I live in LA"" feeling for me. It's especially nice on the nights where they have live music and drinks outdoors. It's worth seeing if you are in the LA area and want to see some great artwork.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outofdodge_10
50,Beautiful!,"Wow. What a collection. The Japanese section is so sublime you could sepnd the whole day there. My favourite aprt from the German expressionism was the Persian and Babylonian art and artifacts. Oh yes and the Fanatic, Brilliant!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hotelhelga
40,A Good Solid Art Museum,"The Los Angles County Museum of Art, known as LACMA, sometimes plays second fiddle to the flashier Getty Museum on top of the hill. That's too bad because although the Getty has the more spectacular setting and building and setting, LACMA has the better permanent collection and generally hosts the blockbuster shows when them come to town. Since it is near the LaBrea Tar Pits, it's a great stop for a longish afternoon if you are visiting the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nils62
50,Great exibits,This is such a great way to spend the day. I love the diversity of the exibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nolaqueen
50,"Must see. If you have any interest in art, make this a priority.","This museum has an extremely impressive collection. With the space to showcase it, you can spend an entire day here learning. Try to plan for that. Also, we went on a week day, and there were tons of food trucks across the street, which made for an awesome lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mariemarblehead
40,"Quite fascinating, make sure to allot several hours for this","I recently visited this vast collection of art when the Tim Burton exhibit was on display - it was easily the most intriguing of relatable part of the museum. If you will be visiting while it is still there, pop for the extra fee to see that exhibit - you won't be disappointed. The rest of the museum was also very interesting if you take the time to appreciate it. Note that it will take a lot of time to see everything here. I was there for 3 hours and didn't see half of it. I would recommend it for any art lover or appreciator.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenjaminOdom
40,If you have time,"If you have the time, you should go visit the LACMA ! It will be better if it is included in a pass so you can skip the lines !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxWeterings
50,Delightful!,"Living in the shadow of the Getty, it might be easy to overlook LACMA, but don't! I spent a delightful two hours at a couple of the special exhibits -- one of Tim Burton and another of 15th Century French sculpture. It would be hard to think of two more different exhibits and both were exceptional. I'll be back to explore the permanent collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebrainDenver
30,"Great Art, but...","Seeing all the great art here was a treat. However, the confusing signage for parking/tickets/etc. was not a treat. On the elevators from the parking lot, it says ""Please pay for parking prior to departing at the Welcome Center"". Well, there is NO building, no sign that says ""Welcome Center"" so we finally asked at the Ticket booth. The unfriendly ticket agent said, ""You can pay that HERE!"" Oh well, we had no idea.Their map could be better labeled too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TavNST
50,Wide Array of Excellent Art,"This museum is really a complex of buildings. I only had a few hours, but I could have easily spent an entire day here. Art from around the world is represented. The contemporary collection is strong.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rlaneberg
50,Don't miss this gem!!!,we were on our honeymoon in los angeles and being a museum lover i had to visit. it is just fantastic. the buildings are fantastic for the displays and the exhibitions that we saw were worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markroy53
50,The 17th and 18th century costumes in the Resnick building are amazing.,"The show was so great, it was impossible to take it all in in one viewing of the costume exhibit. There were dresses from the Marie Antonette era, British fox hunting clothes, a Queen's court dress with 8 foot train, and lots of print to read about each costume. It costs seniors $10 to get into the Resnick building, which has three wonderful shows. It is $10 to park underground. The show of Mexican volcanic carved figures had a lady docent who had wonderful stories to tell about that exhibit. Olmec, I think was the name of the exhibit. There also was a separate exhibit of nudes, marble statues, paintings of nudes, and they were all perfect, exquisite, and lovely. The gift shop had interesting hand made scavers for $39. Each one seemed to be different. There were special gift books to be had on each exhibit, but I didn't want to lug a heavy coffee table book home in my suitcase.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaT_10
40,Art space keeps getting better,"The new Resnick Pavillion is a nice modern addition to the LACMA campus. The big Mexican head exhibit was OK, but the costume exhibit was fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micchio

40,"Huge impressive collection, bad staff","You can easily spend all day here if you like art. The Japanese exhibit is amazing, and I went to several art museums in LA and it was the best-presented. The building is so organic and such a nice change from the rest of the city that the architecture alone was worth a visit. They also offer student discounts, but still it was one of the more expensive museums I visited.That said, the rest of the museum was okay... bad lighting on paintings made them hard to see, many of the sculptures were dusty, and the staff was RUDE. Not every single person there I am sure, but the ones I spoke to were snappish, and they follow you around like you are going to steal something. The featured exhibits in the Reznick building were okay, but crowded. The rest of the place you will probably have to yourself. Don't plan on pictures, no photography allowed here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COtoAK
50,LOVE this museum!,"A couple months ago I visited LACMA and loved it! The main exhibits were the Renoir collection and American Classics. Throughout the year they have different exhibits so you get a different experience every time you visit. My friend and I went on a Sunday. We did get there kind of late because we got lost on our way there. We arrived about 3pm and were there til it closed. We only got to do the two exhibits and a couple of floors on the main building. With all honesty you can spend a whole day there and probrably you still wont go through all the exhibits.The American Classics was my favorite exhibit from the two main ones. I loved paintings from Singleton, Paxton, and Spencer. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes because you will do alot of walking. Your not permitted to take pictures of the art work but there are some gift shops were you can buy books and copies of the art displayed. Highly recommend the little cafe by the main building. My friend and I had a cheese platter, chocolate croissant bread pudding( too die for) and lattes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/euphoriagirl
50,Fabulous museum,"LA County does not have the architecture and scenery of the Getty, but its collection is world class and the best in the region. LACMA is adjacent to La Brea Tar Pits, the Page Museum and across the street from the Peterson museum. A great place to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foothill
50,A Splendid All Around Art Museum,"This art museum has an outstanding collection of paintings and sculpture. It has a fine collection of Italian Renaissance paintings(Luca Di Tomme,Giovanni Di Paolo,Fra Bartolomeo),Mannerist paintings(Jose de Ribera,Mattia Preti,Simon Vouet),Dutch Master paintings(Rembrandt,Emanuel De Witte,Frans Hals),French Baroque paintings(Chardin,Laurent De La Hyre),French Realistic paintings(Corot,Courbet) and French Impressionism(Monet,Renoir,Bazille,Sisley).My paintings were Monet's ""Waterlilies"" and Emanuel De Witte's church interiors.I spent two full days at this excellent museum. I didn't see their collection of twentieth century paintings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margatemensch2016
10,"Tut, Tut","Exceptionally surly staff. Poor layout. Disorganized and badly curated exhibits. Are you sure you want to visit LACMA?If you are an art geek, you will probably find yourself at LACMA during a visit to Los Angeles. Or perhaps you will be lured over by the huge King Tut banners hanging up and down Wilshire Avenue. Either way, this museum will lure you in with the promise of great art in a world class insitution.Alas, like many things in Hollywood, it is all smoke and mirrors. The permanent collection is very poorly displayed and organized. There are pieces of art that don't seem to be in any sort of logical order. Random objects that should really be in separate galleries are all flung in together. You want a map? Ha. It's a shame because the art is really, really good.The King Tut exhibit is another example of LACMA's failing. Instead of viewing priceless treasures in a peaceful setting, the visitor is flung into Union Station at rush hour. The intro movie is like a commerical. The exhibit cases are located on both sides of the hall, so you have to shuffle laterally through the throng to see anything. Oh, and there's absolutely no crowd control. It's every man for himself. For $25, they couldn't look at what OTHER busy museums do, and find a way to make this exhibit orderly? It's really simple. Put up some ropes. Put all the cases on one side of the room. Make everyone move through a line. Easy, eh, and I don't even have a degree in museum studies.Don't even get me started on the nasty museum staff, either. Every single person I encountered at LACMA had an attitude the size of California. There seems to be no sense of customer service whatsoever.What's that you say? You want to see art? Please, please, go to the wonderful, amazing Getty Center instead. If you must subject yourself to LACMA, go after 5pm when it is free and you won't have to deal with the snippy ticket agents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anonymousreviewer10
20,Poor King Tut exhibition,"They are selling a lot more they you'll be able to see. The artefacts as shown on website are not there, at least some of them. I took that audio tour and was able to get little more info than non-audio visitor. I have been to Museum of Egyptology in San Jose, CA, and I must say that their exhibition is a lot better than at LACMA. I understand the LACMA's exhibition is more about King Tut, however you will see other relatives too and will see more about them (e.g. sargophagus which belonged to a different person then King TUT etc) I spent $75 on 2 tickets and would not be ashamed to call it RIP OFF.David, Monterey, CA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coastal27511
50,This is an amazing art adventure for children and adults,Quick Culture is an amazing art adventure for children and adults. It is given by two talented art docents at the Los Angeles County Art Musuem. You will never look at art the same way again. They make the art experience exciting and hands on. Children will delight in being part of art! Forget Disneyland -- take a tour with quick culture art tours. It was a memorable experience for both of our grandkids age 6 and 9.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scenic16234
40,Great King Tut exhibit,"The king tut exhibit was great here. We got the audio tour and it made it really interesting.Too many people though, but great places to eat all around LA.
