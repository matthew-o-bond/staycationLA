40,A Surprising Scare,"Really cool stuff! If you're an artsy individual who enjoys the Halloween festivities, then Zombie Joe's is the place for you. Without ruining the experience, ZJU was a pleasant surprise that was both scary and unique.We didn't really have any idea what we're getting ourselves into at the time. But this show was such a cool event to do with a group of friends that doesn't destroy your wallet. The workers were amazingly fun and helpful, and the production was smartly put together!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aadiputra89
50,COOLEST THEATRE EVER! TOTALLY MIND BLOWING,"I recently came across this theatre and I can't be more excited by this find! They produce crazy and exciting original shows year round. I saw one of their original horror shows called URBAN DEATH. I have never seen a live show like it, in my life. This beautiful blend of the macabre and a sort of living poetry in motion. Incredibly atmospheric and creepy and scary and sometimes absolutely hilarious. A true masterpiece. I have been telling everyone I know that they have to catch a show at this theatre. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place to anyone traveling to the area and looking for an interesting local attraction to check out. You wont be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DKazSE
40,Very pleasant surprise!,"Cute Christmas show. Could have done with shorter intro singing but the play itself was excellent, well acted and staged. All the seats are good and the atmosphere is conducive to a good friendly time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chlovis
50,Small Underground Theater with Quality Production,"Wouldn't have found this great theater if not for the helpful reviews of others. Saw their 'Urban Death' Halloween production right after a visit to Delusion. (Which is a highly rated interactive haunted play)I was very delighted with the quality of the show. Without giving out too much spoiler. I would just say the first part of the 'show' is a classic Halloween haunt, simple but nicely executed. The second part is the real show. The experience is immersive, surreal and highly imaginative. Anyone who love Allan Poe's classic tales would enjoy this clever showcase of mind twisting array of displays. There were a lot of parts that I enjoyed and not one single dull moment.The tickets to the show is really a steal at this price. Highly recommend this theater. It is no doubt one of the top Halloween experience I had. I look forward to seeing more of their shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Verlisia
