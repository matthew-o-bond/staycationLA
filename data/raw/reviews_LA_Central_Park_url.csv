50,Sometimes a statue is not just a statue,"You'll see flowers and groups of people in front of this statue almost every day. It's statue that--so the Korean story goes--honors the ""comfort women"" forced into Japanese military brothels during the period 1930-1945. It's a story that--so the Japanese story goes, is an insult and a lie. It's located in Glendale California, which is the city with the second largest Armenian population in the world. Yerevan, the capitol of Armenia is the first.While Glendale (44% Armenian) has a much smaller Korean population, it's not the largest center of Korean Americans in Los Angeles. So I'm a little puzzled as to whythis particular statue wound up being situated in Glendale. While I was puzzled, the Japanese American community---and the Japanese government were ""outraged"". Lawsuits were filed seeking to remove the statue--the lawsuits were unsuccessful.The statue remains in the park, and is sort of a pilgrimage site for Korean families. They come and bring flowers to the statue. It is a piece of political art, and it is very well done. The plaque beside the statue explains the significance of each piece of the sculpture--it's a group of two chairs--one empty, one with a small woman on the other. There's a bird on her shoulder, her hands are held just so, and her feet are bare. The symbolism is explicit--and explained. Living in Glendale, I drive by the park and the statue two or three times a week. There are always fresh flowers there. It is as powerful emotional symbol about a wrong done many many years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikemU6730TR
30,An untold story displayed in a simple way,This is a very small park and an appropriately simple statement in art speaks volumes about a past that few people even know about let alone talk about. Worth a few minutes of reflection about how depraved humanity can behave under leadership that brings out the worst elements of human nature.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler

50,statue of Korean woman who was made a sex slave of the Japanese army in World War 2,"This statue is in Central Park in Glendale. It pays tribute to Korean, Vietnamese and Chinese woman who were forced to be sex slaves of the Japanese Imperial Army in World War 2. Placed in the Park in 2013 to honor the young women who suffered at the hands of the Japanese Army from 1939 to 1945",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichS894
40,"Small, beautifully and meticulously gardened.","This is a lovely small park that is great to feel real grass under your feet.Always super clean and next to the Glendale Library, the Senior Recreation Center, Neon Park and the great Americana shopping area.Great for a picnic or to walk your dogs.Recently there was a parrot owner who brought his pet to be on a tree to get some fresh air.Strongly recommended for short visits as this place is maybe only 2-3 acres (less than a city block).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C6764KPtomr
30,"""Comfort Women"" Statue","Glendale, CA's Central Park merits a visit, if only to view for oneself the controversy generating ""Comfort Women"" statue, installed by the city in July 2013. The statue attracts many visitors, including some who leave flowers, clothing, and other souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrademarkTraveler
50,A very interesting statue and piece of political art,"The Central Park referred to here actually fronts on Colorado Boulevard near its intersection with brand. The Korean American community commissioned a statue to honor the ""comfort women"" who were forced in Japanese military brothels in WW II. The statue has detailed plaques identifying the symbolism in each part of the statue. As a piece of political art, it's very well done. The issue of ""comfort women"" has been very contentious with the Korean government demanding that the Japanese government apologize for what it did to thes women. Japanese American groups filed a lawsuit demanding that the statue be removed--but lost. I frequently see groups of Koreans leaving flowers and standing silently at the statue. In December 2015 or so the Japanese and Korean governments reached some sort of agreement--or at least the newspaper announced that they had. Regardless of where you stand on the issue(s) it's worth a trip to study the statue and understand the symbolism in its design.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikemU6730TR

40,Peace Monument in a public park,"This spacious but otherwise ordinary city park has a moving Peace Monument.Iâ€™d read about it, and went out of curiosity. The statue seems tiny in the wide open spaces of the park, but when you get close to it, you find that the figure is actually life-size.I was very moved by the statue and the comments that are part of the monument.If you are in the neighborhood, or if you have feelings about the issue, be sure to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ms_Yokohama2014
