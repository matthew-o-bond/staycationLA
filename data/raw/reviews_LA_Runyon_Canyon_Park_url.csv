50,Wonderful views over the city.,"A unique place on the planet that will surprise you to disconnect 100% from the rest of the world, connect with nature with incredible views!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilianasmith
50,Perhaps not for the faint-hearted,"I really enjoyed this hike, I was able to get some good exercise while on holiday, and it also offers fabulous views over the whole city of Los Angeles.I exercise regularly including the gym, so while some of the dirt trail did make me puff, there were plenty of places to stop to catch my breath and keep going. However my hiking companion found it tough going and gave up halfway.The fire path is easy underfoot, and a good option for those who don't like coming down hills on a dirt track.Keep an eye on the ground to watch out for snakes near the top - I almost stepped on a little one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caraj00
30,decent walk,it can be crowded. but a nice place to socialize and take pictures. Theres different routes to take which is nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BellaFella82
50,A great place to hike in the heart of Los Angeles!,"Runyon Canyon is convenient to get to and offers great views of the city. It is quite popular, so you will not be alone on this hike.You can start at the top of the canyon off of Mulholland Drive, but I like to start from the bottom at the Vista Gate, because there is a steep hill up to the gate before you even enter the park. I also like to do the Hero's Trail, which is the most difficult and steep of the hikes available in the park. If you enter through the Vista Gate, as you go up the road past the water fountain, take the first left after the interior gate and you will be on the Hero's Trail.You can also just follow the road up and back to stay on pavement the whole time.If you go on a day after it rains, you can see beautiful views of Catalina Island and the Pacific Ocean, as well as of the whole city.It is a beautiful spot and a place to get some great exercise hiking some steep hills.(photos taken on various hikes over the years)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeccatorImpius
50,Gorgeous views!,"We did this hike twice during our 4 day stay in the city, we loved it so so much! I love this hike because you can choose a different route each time and see the city and surrounding areas from tons of different vantage points. It can be a short easy hike or an intense workout if you like. It's really up to you how you choose to do Runyon Canyon and I think that's part fo the beauty. It was a bit cloudy the afternoon we went but it still made for a beautiful time. Also be aware there isn’t a restroom at the parking lot. The closet one is 7 minutes down the hill from parking so plan accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thesarahbella
50,Best views of the city and Hollywood sign,"I am in my fifties and in pretty good shape. My husband and I started at the bottom of the canyon and walked to the top. We had to stop a few times to catch our breath – it is a strenuous hike continually uphill! My suggestion, stretch first and stay on the middle (paved) path. Also, there is no parking so be sure to Uber to the start of the hike on N Fuller Drive. We got an Uber back to our hotel once we got to the top of the hill on Mulholland Drive. The park is open from dawn to dusk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJsunrise
50,See the Ocean to the Hollywood sign and everything in-between,"Park at Runyon Canyon North Entrance - you may need to wait in line for a parking spot. Enjoy the trails, both paved and dirt. Be sure to take water and your camera/phone! You'll see the Santa Monica bay, LAX, Palos Verdes, Long Beach, downtown L.A., and the Hollywood Hills!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lee-Tarbet
50,Great for morning run,"Absolutely super views for a morning run. Or semi-run, as partly the hills are really steep and it is slow hiking. Great anyways. Just make sure you don't do this more than 30mins before sunrise, otherwise you'll miss big part of the views and it is quite difficult to see where to step. Heard from a friend ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeroLohja
50,Challenging hike in rustic Runyon Canyon in the middle of the Hollywood Hills,"Runyon Canyon is a not too hidden treasure in the Hollywood Hills of L.A. It is 130 acres of undeveloped hillside and canyon stretching from the foot of the Hollywood Hills just north of Hollywood Boulevard up to the top of the hills at Mulholland Drive. On a weekend, the park can be quite crowded. Parking at the south entrance on Fuller Avenue can be difficult as only street parking is available. You may have to park blocks away in the neighborhood nearby. From the south entrance, there are basically three hiking loops you can take. These loops range from 1.9, 2.65, and 3.3 miles long. A shorter 0.85 mile loop can be done at the north end (from Mulholland). I did the 1.9 mile loop and you do get to see some magnificent views of Los Angeles from Inspiration Point and Cloud's Rest on these loops. The east trail can be quite challenging as it can be very steep and some parts are very sandy, so footing can be difficult. Hiking shoes are highly recommended; having athletic shoes won't provide the traction you need to keep a firm footing on some of these steep sandy places. The hike is quiet rewarding in getting great exercise and spectacular scenery of both the natural canyon and the surrounding neighborhoods with expensive homes. Bring lots of water and snacks, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,Superb. Free. Gruelling.,We parked one street away and the walk from there to the front gate was taxing. The trail itself offers numerous ways of scaling the mountain. All of which are challenging and require a serious degree of fitness and stamina. the rewards however are panoramic and spectacular views of LA for as far as the eye can see. Its great for working up an appetite for a quality brunch or meal when you get back down. Bring water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WMJAB
50,Great city hike---challenging but not too long,"Great views! Love the options of paved (which we did on return trip to parking lot) and unpaved (which we started with to get to the top for the best views). We enjoyed the view from the West Trail. Take shoes with good grip if you choose to enjoy the unpaved portion. We slid a little on sandy soil with our tennis shoes. Parking can be an issue. We had to wait a few minutes in line to get a spot. Superb views of the ""Hollywood"" sign, Griffith Park, Hollywood bowl, and downtown LA Skyline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1092CPstevenp
40,"Good Workout & City Views, Can Get Crowded","Runyon is very central, basically in the middle of Hollywood, and definitely the busiest of park hikes. Choose from 3 paths to the top - middle paved route is the easier but still good fitness, left (looking up) is the busiest and has a bit of a challenging/potentially slippery section, right is a bit hard to find the entry, but just follow people, it's also the longest, most challenging and the path least followed:) The prize of walking to the top of Runyon is not only fitness, but also fantastic city views. No matter which path up, most people will choose the right (or the left, if you're looking down) to descend, so it can get a bit busy.Parking is a nightmare....so walk or take other transport to the park if you can.You can also start from the top, where there's a small parking lot, and you can also just enjoy the city views by taking the drive up on Mulholland Drive. From the top parking lot to the very top of the park (most people don't walk to the tip top from the bottom, though it's quite easy once you get to the main crest where the 3 paths meet) and city views is a pleasant stroll in itself - that's where you'd take your parents, kinda place, though slowly in one sandy small section.There are also other much quieter parks in the Hollywood/Santa Monica Hills, though without the skyline views. Try TreePeople for a comparable fitness experience, perhaps more as it's a longer hike, and it has good parking at both the top and bottom; and also the only hike location where I've seen A List celebs, though just a small handful; part of the walk, if you take that route, is also through a wealthy residential area. Alternatively try Franklin Canyon Park, which is a much easier and quiet/peaceful walk; no problem parking. Both are also accessible from Mulholland Drive.If you go further towards the coast on Sunset Boulevard you get to a treasure trove of other parks/hikes in the Pacific Palisades area with great city and ocean views as well; Will Rogers Park is a very pleasant walk, pretty easy, with wonderful nature/city/ocean views (take the turnoff path to get to the tip top; it's a great place for a picnic); Temescal Canyon is the most fitness challenging of all, but worth it for the accomplishment and views; free parking on the streets approaching both parks, though they both also have pay parking lots. There's other great hikes in that area, but you'd need exact details to find them...buy a guide:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leigh732LosAngeles
50,Beautiful views,"Even though I was having a rough morning from our night out in West Hollywood, after a fulfilling breakfast, I was in need of some fresh air and to sweat out the toxins. Runyon Canyon park has street parking in the surrounding streets near the entrance. It wasn't too difficult to find free on street parking fairly close by. We walked about two blocks from our parking spot and entered Runyon Canyon and started on the trail over to the right. It turned out to be the more difficult and steeper dirt part of the trail but ultimately led us to the awesome views of the city as well as excellent views of the Hollywood sign. We also walked right up past the chain link fence with all the locks on it. At the top of the trail there were water refill stations. Once at the top and with water bottles replenished, we had the easier walk back down the other side. As difficult as the walk was since I was out of shape, I really enjoyed it and appreciated the views. It was totally worth it in the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858sharlae
20,Dangerous,I never thought that the routes here would be so dangerous and slippery. There is a lot of sand over the rocks and that makes the already dangerous tracks even more so. I would only recommend the East Ridge for the views and skip the West Ridge altogether. Go to Griffith Park for much more enjoyable hiking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPAT75
50,The hiking place of the stars.,We wanted to hike where we had seen people hike for exercise on shows like Episodes. Great hiking spot!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K6146LOdavidw

50,Excellent hike with LA views,"This is what I would consider a relatively easy hike - of course comfortable and sturdy shoes are a must. I recommended taking roughly a 2 hour hike around the hills, i.e. the longer route. This will provide 360 angle views for the whole LA area. It is a popular hike but in December not too crowded at all. We used the south entrance and were lucky to find a parking spot next to the entrance. Going early certainly pays off with parking too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachStone2C
50,Burn off those extra holiday calories while taking in gorgeous LA city views!,"We came to the park around 2 in the afternoon on a slightly cloudy day but that cleared up quickly as we hiked our way along the trails. There are several trails to walk/run, with differing ranges of difficulty. We spent a good 2 hrs there. Could have easily spent longer, but just couldn't hang with the cool kids (by cool kids I mean super fit lol) any longer. It really is a beautiful park and the views from the drive up along the iconic Mulholland Dr did not disappoint. Miss it already:(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niavm2017
50,Beautiful views. Some challenging parts,I think we did more than one trail as we walked over five miles. Views were beautiful! There were many parts with ruff tires in no did not pack the correct shoes and probably looked like a total tourist. Which I was. I would do this hike again and again. Enough of a challenge to motivate you to try and get better. The weather in November was perfect for this hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bodz4321
50,Spectacular views,"Easy access to this great park. There are three different hikes. One is on a marked paved path and the others are off the paved path on sand. You can walk it as a loop or one way if you arrive with Uber.The scenery is Hollywood sign, downtown and the mountains.Not that hard walk. There are many water fountains on the way.It was heavily trafficked on a Saturday.Recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anat4om
50,"A must do, simple activity with great views.","Great park. A must do on a warm and clear day. Weather is important here.I was initially going to skip the park all together. However, we decided to go. We went on a hot day during peak sun hours. It was 32 degrees so we were really hot but took our time when hiking. You need about three hours to go at a slow pace whilst taking plenty of stops on the way up and taking pictures of the great views of the city and Hollywood sign. Make sure you wear running/walking shoes. Park has clear trails and is very popular so its not secluded as I first assumed. Park has no toilet facilities so make sure you pee before you head out. People of all ages were there, old, young, fit unfit, children and plenty of dogs.I really enjoyed this activity and views were phenomenal.Not as luxurious as other tours; just a simple activity. I would defo do this again on next visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/affbee
50,Exhilarating hike,"Entering at Fuller through the impressive gates we saw the expanse of baked earth dotted with palm trees. It made for a commanding sight.We enjoyed a couple of hours on the trails, making our way to some of the high points. On Fuller a brand of water was on promotion and we were gifted with a few bottles. Very welcome during this outing.Great vistas of the city were rewarding, enhanced by the clarity of the morning. The panoramas brought home what a low-rise city LA is, punctuated with select areas of skyscrapers, as in Downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia

50,Stunning views of LA,Were determined to hike in Runyon canyon so headed for N Fuller Ave - it was a Tuesday so parking on one side of the street was prohibited due to street cleaning but after a short wait we were lucky enough to park on other side.

Went through 3 litres of water between us both (and a poor thirsty dog lol) so take plenty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdD836
50,ignore the naysayers,"not sure what is up with all the whiners on here so I recommend you ignore them. The wife and I hiked the West Ridge trail from the top down and had a great time. Excellent views. More challenging than expected but that was part of the fun and charm. Burned a few calories for sure. The people we ran across along the trail were all nice and friendly. We hiked on a late morning on a Friday and it didn't seem crowded at all. Yes, there were other people but not even close to being overrun by people or dogs. If you're out in LA and want some fun exercise, I would recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfeur66
30,"Over run with dogs and their waste.. Over run with people, not relaxing or peaceful in the least","Just as the title of the review states: Over run with dogs and their waste.. Over run with people and their trash. It is not relaxing or peaceful in the least. Good exercise. But in the hot, sweltering days of summer, dog waste attracts tons of flies, and the smell up there can get pretty ripe. Why isn't the city managing the relatively SMALL inner city park better? Central Park in New York City is very well managed, it's HUGE comparatively, and they don't have these issues. Come on Los Angeles, get your act together!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremiahChris

10,Parking trap,"Coming from Lake Tahoe we were excited to find a hike in the city where the dogs could be off leash. However, there is no parking at trail head, a well thought out design by city leaders. We drove around trying to find legal street parking and right when we were about to give up we found a space. Unfortunately, we didn’t see the parking sign and found a $68 dollar parking ticket on windshield. Most of the cars on the block had tickets. Seems like a trap for the city to take money from unsuspecting tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4472MMgeorgep
40,Enjoy the ‘fresh air’,Great place to get some exercise and suck in some pollution.We ubered to the top entry and walked from there .A bit of signage would be useful for directions but we figured it out.Plenty of doggos around which was nice.The pollution over LA is just terrifying.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gibbo1969

The hotel recommended it, and we (adults and kids ages 8-15) started every day of our trip with a hike here. Easy trails, great views, lots of dogs to say hi too. Thursday and Friday were the best days for us. The Saturday hike was a lot more crowded. Would not recommend bringing strollers. Brings lots of sunscreen and water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjtex2016
50,Several paths- our LA friend took us up the straight up hill one apparently,"Runyan Canyon- it’s an easy hike he said. It will be fun he said. So mom loads up the backpack with water and off we go- all up hill- all out of shape… it hasn’t rained so it’s very dusty and a little slippery in gym shoes. We go a back way that is harder than the paved way. It is a dog friendly park so our friend’s dog could be off leash. It’s amazing how well behaved every dog we met on trail was. About ¾ of the way up my athletic 14 year old daughter is way ahead of us. My husband’s knee is bothering him. My 12 year old is in gym shoes with little traction and I’m so out of shape I can hardly breathe… Friend takes the backpack and we get to the top and it is super rewarding. We hang out a while so I can catch my breath. On the way back down apparently was the first earthquake and we didn’t feel a thing… my exercise is so rare it causes the earth to shake apparently. But people were talking about it when we got to the bottom. There were a lot of people out because it was Fourth of July. It is a great hike, you can see some of the big and crazy Hollywood Hills Homes in a way you never would otherwise and you can see the Hollywood sign, but it’s pretty far off in the distance. I’m glad we did the hike so I could eat all the food the rest of the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carrie9678

30,Runyon Used To Be The Greatest Hiking Spot Now More Of A Tour Bus Attraction - Doesn't Stop Real Hikers,"I filmed high bench with my characters seated dangling their feet over, feeling like Tom Hank's character did in ""Big"". ""Shorty & Morty"" has a sister short with that scene called, ""Shorty & Morty: Hollywood @ Steak - it's a comedic take on the homeless, puppet addicts and misfits in Krazytown. As I was writing future episodes based on the original award winning short - I put high bench in as a landmark and within two years the parks ripped it out and replaced it with two city park benches with of course names of people on it.Then the stairwell came privatiding a whole area near a mansion that has been there forever - which makes the trek to the crest more dangerous if it rained - and even when dry, your footing can slip off one step and there you go tumbling down. Dogs could roam freely and most were friendly, there were so many regulars but as time passed a few celebs walked the hike and word got out falsely so that the stars strutted their stuff here. So, for the past 10 years the tour buses slowly added it to their Mulholland Drive tour exaggerating about who really hikes the canyon that has made it more overcrowded with fans, not hikers.We hikers love our trails and respect the land, we tote our things out and even have a full moon hike for over 20+ years that's still not public and hopefully never will be. It's about the only time friends can have access, hike up and then have fun together.The canyon itself has so many ways to climb it but in rattlesnake season beware of going on off-trail jaunts - you can easily be bitten and many have. We even lost a regular to a heart attack hiking in the heat of the day - a sad day in Runyon.Sometimes they film legit projects and but it's a place for guerilla style more and the rangers are really nice. One has a house up there that is pretty incredible for being a park ranger but it's LA - aka Krazytown - and there are some other canyons that have housing that is way above a person's pay grade in comparison to other rangers in the same position. Seeing that house is worth the walk out, in itself and it's an easy distance from the front gate.I've hiked that Canyon rain or shine for many years and in recent ones with the overcrowding of people yapping on their phone with no respect for the quiet and solitude the canyon provides coupled with less parking, it makes it less desirable but it's a hotspot for many still - just less of the regulars and the few stars that walked have moved and rarely hike the canyon. I've seen people of all walks in all the canyons here and many stars but very few stay at the same place because their privacy would be lost.LA has been trying to turn into NYC and with Hollywood Central Park having become a reality in the making - that few still know about (google it) - it's going to be even more changes. We're lucky in this town to have parks large enough to hike, Fryman, Franklin Canyon and get away from feeling like we're in the city.I taught my son how to hike on Runyon Canyon and he sat on his butt scooting downhill and then his knees while going uphill until I said, ""Stand up and sit your weight into your feet and butt onto the mountain like an Indian. Within weeks that boy flew down the canyon faster than most dogs could run it! Remarkable what encouragement does.Runyon is made for memories and hopefully they'll stop trying to overgroom it any more than they have. I miss the wilderness and we need a little more of the real wild here. Deer used to romp by, coyotes are more prominent due to housing and ripping our hills apart. Give Runyon a try at least once if visiting and get off the tour bus or come with a bunch of friends and leave your phones off so you can enjoy catching up with one another. It's a mild to very strenuous hike. It's truly what you want it to be on any given day.So, make it your day and your hiking choice. Learn the canyon and you'll fall in love if you go off-hours. I'm not saying what they are because the internet has ruined the hikes in this town faster than a speeding bullet. Be safe and never hike alone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMFredric

One caveat - there are unfortunately NO BATHROOMS in the park - don't drink too much water. Just before you enter the park, there are light snacks for sale on the ""honor system"".

You can also get a good view of the Hollywood sign. The hiking is not too intense so easy to do with kids. There seems to be several locals that go & walk their dogs. There are several trail options though with different distances so figure out your route before you go. There is a paved road in the middle that goes up to one side & there's a couple of trail hikes on either side of the park so check out the sign when you get there to determine what you want, but overall the whole experience shouldn't take more than a couple of hours at the most depending how much time you wanted to spend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derekr308

50,L.A.'s best panorama,"For decades few people in Los Angeles knew about this spot. It was a nondescript fire road up off a dirt pull-over on Mulholland Drive between Laurel Canyon and Cahuenga. Now it can be accessed from the improved parking lot and hiking trail there, or from the bottom of the hill in Hollywood at the north end of Fuller. In my 60 years experience here this is the one place I've discovered where you can see the whole basin and the whole San Fernando Valley in one shot. On a clear day one can see a hundred miles North, South East and West out to sea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z3521QIwilliams
50,Amazing!!,A great hike with amazing views! I recommend going in the morning before it gets too warm. Only a few blocks from Hollywood Blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JKgirl
50,Great break from hustle and bustle.,"My daughter and I wanted to do something other than shop, so we decided to hike Runyon Canyon Park. Great choice! We're occasional hikers, nothing too serious. RCP was challenging enough. We did East trl first then looped over to West tel. If we had to do it again, we would reverse it and do West trl 1st then East. Live and learn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NAV160
30,Beautiful walk up - easy for all ages,Any age group should be able to do this. Very fun and beautiful views. Go to trailhead at 2000 N Fuller Ave to have a nice paved walk up (for majority).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurentaylor802
50,Quite A Hike...Worth it for the Views,"Breathtaking views throughout the park. It is quite a hike if you walk all the way up. Hike and the altitude could bother some. Even if you can't make it all the way,you will see great vistas along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dennancy
50,Love this place,"A great park for an early morning, afternoon or evening hike. Be prepared for a good workout whichever trail you choose! The reward is some wonderful views of the LA skyline!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARTraveler950
40,Great place to go for a quick hike,"My friend and came here for a quick hike since it is so close to her apartment. It was easy to get to, though there is no parking lot so you have to hunt for some street parking. There are several different trails you can take, we did one of the smaller ones because we weren't in the best clothing for hiking. The trails are pretty wide, which is nice given the amount of people we saw there. Runyon is popular, so you won't have that ""one with nature"" experience given all the people there, but it doesn't detract from the experience at all really. There are lots of trails, so you can stay a while to try all of them. Definitely a nice place to check out if you have the time and aren't able to leave LA to hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmill42894
50,Loved it!,"Not exactly sure how this park can have anything less than a 5-star rating, but oh well. I've seen Runyon Canyon park on instagram so many times that my LA visit would have not been complete without going by there. My friend and I went there on our last day in LA so we were somewhat pressed for time, but we were still able to spend a good 2 hours there.Runyon Canyon park offers gorgeous views of the LA skyline, as well as the Hollywood sign and hills with greenery and beautiful homes. The further/ higher you go on your hike, the better the views. There are several trails with different degrees of difficulty. I believe we did the intermediate one and it wasn't bad at all.Things to keep in mind when visiting:- the park doesn't offer any parking, so you have to deal with limited street parking which may require a short walk to the park- the park does not have bathrooms, so use one before going to the park- bring lots of water and wear proper clothing as there's barely any shade and it can get pretty hot on a sunny day- there are plenty of dogs NOT on a leash but they're pretty friendlyDefinitely worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UnapologeticTraveler
40,Great hiking and views!,Wonderful place to hike in the middle of the city. Get there early for parking! If you take the trail that is unpaved there are some challenging parts to hike. There is a paved option that goes around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbouquot
40,Locals and Visitors Alike Enjoy this Canyon,"There are 4,000 acres of hiking land in Los Angeles. So no place should be crowded. There's more than enough space for all of us! That being said, as a local who lives at one of the Runyon Canyon gates - it can get very crowded after work and on the weekends. We locals love our hiking and those are the peak times for us to be out on the trails. If you're visiting Los Angeles and you want to hike Runyon Canyon's 160-acres, please follow these tips: Take a Lyft or Uber to get dropped off at the Canyon entrance so you don't take away parking from the locals who don't always have parking spots in a building. There is only street parking for Runyon Canyon when accessed from the Hollywood side. And be considerate. If you don't want it to be crowded, visit during the week during work hours. Otherwise, understand you will have to share the trails with lots of other people and that's just the way it is. The best seasons to visit are Winter and spring when the sky is clearer, and there's more greenery. It can get very hot and cause hazy skies in summer and fall where you might struggle to manage the trails since there is very little shade in the park. Almost all trails are in bright sun for much of the day especially during the longer days (less so in the winter when the main paved trail is in the shade for longer because of its position on one of the higher peaks in the Canyon. Come prepared with adequate hiking shoes or boots (though those would be overkill for most of the Canyon, a hat, sunscreen and plenty of water. There are no shops or places to buy things in the Canyon. It's strictly rural land with paved and unpaved paths.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstenAlana
50,Nice hike to see Los Angeles city view,"Nice hike to see Los Angeles city view...Should aim to hike the West trail, which is higher and offers better view of LA city",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bennyvectra
50,So cool,Parking isn't great but that's ok. The hike is pretty good and the views are absolutely amazing. What a way to clear your mind.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franco3x
50,Hidden Gem,"We discovered this place as we had volunteered to take some rescue dogs for a walk in the Canyon. Our American family had never been here and loved it. Taking the dogs was an added gorgeous experience and their location choice made for a very memorable morning.Go and even better go with the rescue dogs. You will have a fab walk whilst taking some four legged friends out too and see views that, even if you live in California you may never have found.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanneTait
30,Views nice. Hike was OK. Careful where you park.,"Parking was not easy even on a Monday. Be aware of the tow away zones as there were cars being towed that day.Nice views, but not as good a Griffith Park. The spring rains left everything green. It was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoalTorrent
50,Great hikes and views,"I have hiked Runyon Canyon many, many times. The views are wonderful, of the city, hills and even of the Hollywood sign. It is ideal for walking a dog (for older dogs, the steeper trails could be a challenge). Also, I always run into someone I know, and have often seen celebrities (if that is the kind of thing that interests you). There are multiple trails, with some taking just 15-20 minutes and others taking hours, linking to Griffith Park-adjacent parkland. The only drawback, for women who prefer nice bathrooms, is that there is a lack of such facilities (although at the park entrance there may be restrooms).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/477kenr
40,quick scenic hike,"my boyfriend and I wanted to check this area out while in L.A. I was not dressed for a hike but it was relatively quick and the view well worth it. I did this in flip flops! The view, especially if you're from a small town in Canada is amazing.Cons: the parking is a nightmare! Cars are lined up for miles down the road and most areas say no parking so you park at your own risk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kickinitwithkyla
50,A TRIP TO THE NEXUS-ROCK & ROLL BABY,"Are you experienced? Do you want to be experienced? Well this is the place...Your trip to Runyon Canyon will Change your life? A beautiful Gem nestled in the Heart of Hollywood. Whether you are Exercising or Stargazing or Nature Watching..everything here is glorious. This place used to be an Original Hollywood Community, home to Many Classic Hollywood Stars. During Dusk or Dawn you can feel the way its used to be before Humans walked the Earth. Los Angeles is health conscious and Beautiful, Runyon has the best of both Worlds. If you would like to have a 100% LA Experience than this is the Place to Start.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gruvmusic
50,My favorite LA hike,"I love Runyon Canyon. I try and hike it everyday and every time I'm in the area. It never gets boring. There are different trails to take and all of them offer the most spectacular views of the city. You can also catch beautiful sunrises, sunsets, and views of the Hollywood sign. Its a great workout. Theres and entrance at both the bottom and top of the canyon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessiAnn85
50,Hike in the Park!,This place is absolutely amazing!! The views of The Hollywood Sign and Griffith Observatory. Not to mention Downtown. The trials are somewhat easy. With a rock garden. Must go see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712JMLeb

50,You forget you're in a city,I had heard so much about this place that I had to check it out.It was easy to find and walked most of the trails. You need to make sure you are wearing good shoes and are prepared to do some climbing on some of the trails.Make sure that you take a water bottle with you and there were water fountains available to fill up.When you get to the top there are some fantastic views of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizhar76
50,Potty first and fill up your water bottles,"We had an amazing walk here for hours and really enjoyed this. Our feet were tired after touring around LA for a week and we consider skipping this. We are so glad we went. We saw many dogs, walked with many people, but never felt crowded. There are probably not enough places to sit and take a break especially in high heat but other people were jogging and not everyone had water bottles. Maybe we're just wildly out of shape? We enjoyed this very much and would definitely go back if we visited LA again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrnMtnGirl79
50,Highlight of a visit to LA,"Park on Hollywood, march up a couple of very steep streets, and then take the west trail for an hour or so of challenging walking/hiking up to the peak of what I think is the highest point in LA. You'll have a 360-degree view from the valleys to the ocean, and will have had a great workout and photo opportunity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsirin
50,Early morning fitness hike with Bikes and Hikes,"We booked this trip via Expedia and read reviews online saying you can go there for free. However you don’t experience the information Laura provides about the celeb houses along the route or the amazing views.We found this trek challenging with a 13 and 10 year old (and an unfit 36 yr old, me!) but it was well worth the taste of my breakfast a second time round. Definitely recommend this hike and with bikes and hikes who are brilliant!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsvikki23
50,Excellent Place for a Walk,"We caught an Uber up to the Hollywood Hills, part of this being on Mullholland drive to one of the entries to Runyon Canyon Park. We then walked for approx. 40 mins and finished within walking distance of Hollywood Walk of Fame.Runyon Canyon has amazing views with ocean on one side and snow on the mountains on the other. The walk was scenic and enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddtrippas
50,A fun hike in the middle of the city,"For an urban hike, this was really good. Some other reviewers complain about the crowds. Yeah, well, you're in the middle of the city. You're not going to be alone with nature very much. For us, hiking on a Sunday afternoon, There were plenty of people, but it wasn't too bad. We even struck up a conversation with some other hikers on our way back down.I suppose at this point, I should note that even though you're in a city park, the hike can include some challenging segments. If you stick to the main trail that winds around the park, you'll gain several hundred feet of altitude and when you get to the top, you'll see a nice panoramic view of the city including the iconic Hollywood sign a few miles in the distance. On our way back down, we struck off a more rustic trail to the west ridge. In a few places, we had to scramble to keep our balance, and we were rewarded with an even higher vista view.Some reviewers have commented about celebrity sightings in the park. Well, if any of the sweaty but beautiful people who we saw were famous, we didn't recognize them.One final caveat, there are no restrooms in the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KriksPicks
50,Great walk with awesome views,"Not much else to say, if you’re even a little bit active you need to take a walk at Runyon. It’s also dog friendly and has some of the best views of LA for when you’ve made it to the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HowellyBear
40,For both the casual and serious hiker,"Runyon Canyon Park offers easy-to-navigate paved trails as well as much steeper pathways if you want to get more rigorous. The views are great. There are also lots of dogs, so be wary if you're not canine adaptable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenp530

50,Great Workout,"We were staying at the Magic Castle hotel in Hollywood and wanted somewhere close by where we could get some exercise. After consulting Google Maps we decided to walk to this park, which was about a ten minute walk away.We then proceeded to hike up a steep grade (the East trail) for a solid 20+ minutes. We had no idea it would be that steep, but we were rewarded with fantastic views that extended all the way to the ocean.After reaching the top we continued on and were able to complete a 40-45 minute loop back to where we first entered.Wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/388stephenf
50,Went as a tourist attraction,"We were in Vegas for a my daughter wanted to drive to LA for the day. This was on her to do list. It was a beautiful day, we hiked straight up the hill and got a somewhat decent picture of the “Hollywood” sign. We were there about an hour but it would be easy to spend half a day walking trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mizzpriss02

50,Must do if you like physical activity,"Surprised this place doesn't have more reviews. I spent an extended weekend for my first time in LA and hiking Runyon Canyon was one of the main things I wanted to do because I heard a lot about it from all types of people who live in LA. It lived up to expectations.It's very close to the city and most of it is quite easy.Hike Griffith Park If you want something more difficult, bigger and has a lot more nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sd7319
50,Great view of LA,I visited during midday and it was boiling. Great weather (as usual) and there's opportunity to view whole of LA and surrounds plus also vantage point for LA on the north side. There's a marathon track for 'casuals' and a steeper rockier climb for the better vantage points. some sections of the climb are quite precarious for 'casuals' like me without much experience or hiking sticks!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlesjN6431HQ
50,Favorite place in LA,"Runyon is such a special place, holds a piece of my heart. Nature, fun people and domesticated animals Runyon Canyon is a gathering place of visitors and locals alike. Outshines any other LA attraction, this is the real deal and sure to up your serenity. View is amazing, can't imagine visiting without touching base with Runyon. Much respect to those who keep the gates open is the one place that seems to stay the same, like an old friend you pick right up with no matter the time between visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeBiggerThanAZipCode
40,Nice hike and views,Managed to find parking without much hassle. Nice hike with great views while getting some exercise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kurt63mh
30,A bit overrun and run down,"This hike is crowded and a bit overrun/run down compared to some of the other canyons in Malibu and Santa Monica. But, its a hike, great views, close up of the Hollywood sign and a nice oasis in the middle of a gritty part of town.I brought someone here not from LA who did appreciate the views.Do not pay for the tours of this hike. There is no reason. In fact, head out to the Santa Monica mountains or Malibu for a more interesting view and a closer look at nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsNinaG
50,Beautiful and worth the hike.,It’s a gem and it’s free! Skip the tour bus. You don’t have to have fancy hiking gear... just a good pair of sneakers and take your time coming down (especially with kids). Spectacular views of LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaechoe
30,Beware irresponsible dog-walkers,"In particular, beware the female Australian dog-walker who has 10 dogs, most of them off leash even in the mandatory on-leash areas. I saw her coming with her unruly pack, and pulled my dog, who was on a leash, off the path and made him sit. Her dogs came running at him and off course all started growling and lunging at each other. She did not have control of them and could have cared less. Luckily, there were no injuries. Also, good to remember that there's no oversight at Runyon Canyon, so you're on your own if something happens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MB102938
50,Beautiful secenary and must see!,This place is absolutely stunning. Be prepared for steep incline. Much needed walk. Take water. Good for walking dogs. Have your face ready for beautiful photos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9013345
40,The views! Get your camera ready.,"Not hard to find, but parking was! Ended up getting lucky and found a close spot. The walk up alone is steep. There were bottles of water set out for a dollar. Once in there was a map. We took many pictures. Seems a lot of people take their dogs which was cute. Just get over for the runners. Sun was a bit much so we didn't get too crazy with how far we walked. The views though...on a nice day you can see the city. A must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959tashaf

We saw some wildlife which was a nice treat too. Definitely recommend Runyon Canyon Park for locals and visitors alike. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Compass757800
50,Fabulous place to hike just minutes from Hollywood Boulevard,"Discovered this fabulous place which was 10 minutes walk from our hotel (Magic Castle) and when we climbed to the top there was fantastic views of Hollywood sign, Griffith Observatory and the city. Last bit was a challenge but worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karribubbles
50,beautiful city views!,"Runyon Canyon is one of my favorite hikes in LA. There are a few options from easy to strenuous. All of them are great choices and offer stunning views of the city. At the top of the canyon there is a parking lot but it fills quickly. The park can be very busy at times, its worth it though. My favorite time to hike the park is sunrise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessiAnn85
40,Great VIEWS! Must do if visiting the area,"Headed here to get a great view of the city, and did not disappoint! Parking was interesting, had to drive around for awhile to find something, but we had a great time and enjoyed the hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulsheppard8
50,Nice park to go on a hike,"I went there in the early morning and I would definitely advice that, because it can become really hot during the day. The view from the top is amazing. It is also not a difficult hike so anyone can do it. Make sure you bring enough water, a snack and good shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaW9864
30,"Great park for good views and a good, short hike","We took the trail up the West side (starting in Wattles park). This trail is much, much more difficult. It's really fun though. My 3 kids had a great time. They are all accomplished hikers though. The West side ""trail"" is difficult. There are some climbs and scrambles. The East side is much easier, steep, but wide open and some of it is even paved. Less than 30 minutes to the top and some great vantage points. A really nice space for a hike and a view right by Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jent890
50,Such a highlight!,"We knew we wanted to hike while in the LA area, but didn't want to go too far out of the city. Plus, the LA view is what we were looking for. Runyon Canyon was the PERFECT spot. The hike is easy (we did the short route) and the views were incredible. We did get a parking ticket while parked on the street, so make sure to watch signs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I3923UDbrittanys
50,Great Hiking,"This ""park"" is blocks from where the Academy Awards and Jimmy Kimmel are produced. It is leash-free, and hilly, but wide open with a very wide path for hiking. The b!g plus is getting to the top and seeing all of Los Angeles, to the ocean...a spectacular view!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdinfl
50,Great!,"One of the best parks in the Los Angeles area. Whether you enjoy walking, hiking or running this park is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briandQ3255VQ
40,Sweaty treat,A nice well trodden path with impressive views of LA and a distant Hollywood sign. Best done either early in the day or late afternoon as it can get quite hot with little or no shade. Also be carefully with your footing as its quite sandy in places although some of the sections are well asphalted. You will be sharing your experience with hundreds of others taking their selfies and admiring the lovely views. I guess its a must do.... so do it :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/912arkadiuszw
40,Fantastic Views / No Celebrities / Some Dog Poo,"The hike up to the top of Runyon Canyon is a steep one but the views from the top are simply magnificent, you can see all the way to downtown LA and out to the ocean on a clear day and also up into the Hollywood Hills with a view of the Hollywood sign. However if you want a photograph of yourself with the Hollywood sign this is not the place to do it as the sign will be about as small as the terms and conditions at the bottom of a car finance advert. Unfortunately despite this being a hotspot for celebrity joggers we didn't encounter any, unless they were incognito. Parking is free, but stick to the designated areas as park rangers / parking enforcement people are constantly patrolling and you don't want to get shot in the face for breaking the law, this is LA remember...'licence and registration please sir'...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Radventureland
40,Hike/Easy parking,"I found Runyon Canyon a pleasant location to go for a hike. I was able to find (legal) parking relatively easy, which was a plus. I went mid-morning & there was a good amount of other hikers in the area. Despite a crowd of both people & their dogs, I was able to easily navigate my way & have an enjoyable hike. The views were nice, I will visit again during my next trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KtGirl1
20,Overrated and overpopulated,I think most people are here for celebrity spotting. If they were hiking for their health they could as easily hike at an identical spot a couple miles down the road with easy parking and trails that have not been pounded into dusty wide tracks. It is almost bald here there are so many people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theresaslimbay
50,beautiful views and a good workout!,"We decided to walk rescue dogs in Runyon Canyon while visiting LA a few weeks ago, the walk was really enjoyable and the views of LA were superb we could even see the Hollywood sign from one point. The walk was uphill at 1st and then when on the opposite side of the Canyon it went downhill quite steeply and although they have put measures in place to stop you slipping (planks and steps) its still quite slippy on the sandy dusty trail, so be careful, but other then that the walk was really lovely and I would highly recommend a visit!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/381ciaram
50,A must see!!,Runyon Canyon Park is a very popular hike in LA. It gets a lot of airtime on the news for all the people that park illegally. But there are a lot of people that talk it up and they love it! We decided to go and check it out. It was a fantastic hike!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ace90266
10,"Bad parking, dog feces, and a view of a smog-filled basin- what are you waiting for??!","I've been here now 2x and hated it both times. First there is NO SHADE the entire trail, so, given that LA is sunny 99% of the time, this means you will be boiling in the sun, even well into October. Secondly, people take their dogs, so it smells like poop. Yes people should be picking up after their pet, but forget that in Hollywood, a bunch of entitled yuppies and probably celebrities can't bend over to pick up after their own animals. You really wont get a good view of Los Angeles unless its right after a rainstorm because its smoggy..so don't waste your time going here unless you plan it right after a rainstorm (which is about 1% of the days we have on any given year). In addition, parking is an absolutely nightmare and they have no restrooms anywhere near this place. There are much better hikes by Malibu where the smog isn't as present. If you want a view of Los Angeles go up into one of the tall buildings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850dd
50,Dogs,"This is a lovely little park, close to everything, yet seeming to be in another world. Perfect for walking a well-behaved dog, and great views when it's clear. It can get pretty cruisy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
50,Great Walk!,"Attended Lost Angeles in February and we did this famous park. What a beautiful park! The park has free parking off the Mulholland Highway at the 90 degree turn, and you walk from there. Get there early as people will be in line for parking.This trail offers all sorts of terrain and all angles.Bring water to drink!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFLeB325
50,Great Hiking Experience,"Runyan Canyon is definitely worth experiencing in LA! There’s an option of hikes to choose from...whether you prefer to take an easier route or more of a vigorous route, it’s such a great outdoor experience and the views are incredible! The infamous Hollywood sign, DTLA, mountains...it’s all so lush!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdevgun
50,Runyon canyon park is a hidden gem,"This is a hidden gem - great recreational trail, that is long, scenic and enjoyable. It is steep though, so when using it, if you want the easy trail (as opposed to the intermediate or difficult), be sure to start at the top, and hike dwn :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I4303EVpaulr
40,Just blocks from Hollywood Blvd you can take a hike in the mountains,"People who live in the LA/Hollywood area come here to be in fresh air, walk on dirt paths, experience views and leave behind the rush of the city. (Yes, LA is one sprawling suburb but it comes with city and traffic pressures.) So, if you're visiting Hollywood and the Walk of Fame is fun but you need a fix of quiet and reality, keep walking West, just a few blocks past LaBrea (where the Statue of the 4 Ladies is), then turn up Fuller Ave and in 2-3 blocks you'll be in Hollywood mountain nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebSoloTravel

50,Morning hiking with city views,Amazing morning hike overlooking LA. We hiked Runyon Canyon at 8am before it became too warm. There are many people on this trail and we met some gorgeous dogs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gf584
40,Crowded but fun,The hike to the top on the main path is pretty safe and can be accomplished by all lever of hikers. This is definitely a place for dog lovers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanas1
50,"Nice hike, convenient to Hollywood Blvd.","If you find yourself near Hollywood Blvd. and amid the hustle and bustle, you want to take a hike, Runyon Canyon is the place. The “hike” really can be up and down a paved path. Albeit steep, it is very simple and the views at the top are stunning. We walked from Hollywood Blvd and that was very doable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/macawleyb2018
30,Nice little hike.,"When I went, it wasn't too crowded and I had a nice little hike. I didn't go all the way to the top because I had left someone with a bad knee behind so I just went to see the Hollywood Sign and back down, but pretty decent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imrico
40,Nice hike inside the city,"It was great to be able to go for a hike and not have to leave the city. This park offers some challenging trail climbs for the active, but also easier paved road climbs for the less active. Great views of the city and Hollywood sign. Farther up near the top you can see homes that are inside the park grounds which is interesting.Bring water or a bottle and refill at the free fountains in the park. If its sunny and warm - you'll need it. Also there are no bathrooms here so take care of ""business"" before you head here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacyC554
50,The perfect place for a nature hike,This tplace was just 15 min from whre I lived. Perfect place to hike up on a sunny day with your dog or without. Great place to do some good people watching. Never know what celebretiy you might run into.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eurohandsofsteel
50,Awesome LA views,Great steep wee track close to Hollywood Blvd. Awesome iconic LA views. Came across a rattle snake on the way down the road.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claytoro
50,Amazing Views,We decided to start our Los Angeles trip with a Runyon Canyon hike. It was a pretty hot day but the hike is not overly strenuous if you are in decent shape. I would recommend wearing shoes with good traction as some of the trails have loose gravel/dirt and are kind of steep. Be sure and take water on hot days too. You can’t beat the views of LA though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2336BDamandac
50,"Exercise, sun and sightseeing!","Perfect place where you can hit 3 goals, tanning the skin with sunbath, delight your eyes with the landscape and sweat some carbs climbing up the hill! You will feel the energy around this place since a lot of people is going up and down the track giving their best effort!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drachenavarro
50,Relaxing and peaceful,Beautiful park overlooking LA. Amazing views and nature spotting. Bring your camera! Just be sure to bring water along with you for the hike if you are planning on traveling during the summer months.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatrickPomp
40,Go Early,"This is a really lively place to take a hike. Regardless of which path you take, it's all up hill so go early before the sun gets intense, especially if you are planning to bring along a dog. You will find lots of people walking their dogs off leash. It's a popular spot and parking is not exactly plentiful (especially on the weekends) so you may have to look for a spot a few blocks away from the entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabyonthegogo
50,Beautiful!!!!!,"I would highly recommend everyone to go and take a hike here. If you go early enough and park at the top near Mohullund drive, which is much easier. We got there early and watched the sunrise over Los Angeles...LOVE!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roberthF4750BY
50,A definite DONT MISS,"This hike was terrific. It is not for anyone incapable of walking in unsteady turf although there is also a paved path for strollers and buggies. Be aware that numerous dogs are off leash and running; don’t like dogs? Don’t go!The view from the top of LA and the Hollywood sign is amazing along with the twisted remnants of another land developers sign that most people just walk past.Very steep paths in some spots so I’d advise against very small children. There is yoga in the mornings at the park entrance with the schedule posted. Also, if you forget your water there is an honor system refreshments stand as you leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCKari
50,Mother & Daughter Fun Trip,"Great hike to see the awesome scenery and views and you may just see a celebrity or two while you are hiking! Wear a hat and bring water. Great exercise and well worth the hike - it takes a minute though. If you are afraid of heights, this trek is not for you. You can't beat what your eyes behold on this hike - absolutely breathtaking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwilderone
50,Fun hike,"My friend and I decided to hike Runyon Canyon on Memorial Day. Parking was tricky, but at least the street sweepers weren't an issue (as they were last time we went on a Monday). The views are stunning. Paths get busy, lots of dogs...it's all good though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wherelolawent
50,Take a picture of the map when you start,"This is a great trail, with hiking for all sorts of skills, but it is generally steep.  There is a fire road that is pretty well paved and wide.  There on the west side is an off road type hiking trail where some sort of boots are recommended.  The trails all intersect so I recommend taking a picture of the map when you start because you'll have no cell service and you don't want to be hiking in endless loops.  Plenty of people on the trail but parking is limited for sure and they do ticket",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregTrav28
50,best city hike,"So if your looking for a great view and an moderate to easy hike in the city, Runyon is a great choice. Beware you must like dogs! This in one of the few hike in LA that allows dogs to be off leash and all the local dog owners in the city are here at least once a week letting their furry loves get some run around time. the new pathed path is awesome and they have install a water fountain at the top so you and your 4 legged companion can quench your thirst on a hot LA day. No matter what time of day you choose to hike Runyon the view is always amazing.. Sunsets are lovely and the early morning misty day evaporate in to sunny morning as you descend back to your car. Neighborhood parking is challenging so read the signs!! They love to give out tickets around this popular hiking spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worthyreferral
50,Must do,Definitely worth doing if you want a locals experience of LA. The view is awesome and if you can’t be stuffed with the exercise aspect you can park near the top and take a much shorter route a lookout area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A5562YNmatthewb
30,An afternoon hike,I was surprised how big the park actually was. We were not prepared for a hike but glad we did. It has great views of all around once you make it up the hills. For locals I could see the attraction for a place like this for a good cardio or walk your dog. For visitors it has great views (and you can actually exerce a bit!). It’s worth the stop if you have a hat and water with you. If you have a car you can find free street parking near by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cxcartist
50,Experience LA,This is a great hike with an awesome view of the city on a clear day. It’s also an excellent place to see the people of LA who show up to hike in all their glory with their dogs. Go on a day that’s clear but not too hot!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaylindann
40,Beautiful Breathtaking views!,A trip through the park is a must do when in LA. The views over the city are amazing and it is great for a photo opportunity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaFxx
50,Great Place To Hike,This is truly a cool spot to hike. There are tougher trails and a paved road for those that cannot handle the rougherterrain. Plenty of people bring their dogs which makes the hike even better. There a several entrances to the park so chose the one that suits your needs. A must do!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coachee1313
20,Smells like dog poo,Smells like dog poo and its really dirty . Rubbish everywhere and the views are average wouldn’t recommend this walk on my worst enemy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joelp794
40,The thing to do is selfie...,"How great to have such a natural landmark in the middle of a bustling, if somewhat unnatural city. You feel like you leave all the hype behind when you choose either of the trails, even while being close to it seeing it in the views. Take in a morning hike if you're for real want to exercise... take an afternoon one if you want to selfie and people watch.Parking nearby is minimal, so best to car pool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cain9ine
50,Beautiful Trail,We parked on the North side of the trail and parked in the lot which was almost full at 9:45 am on a Friday. So the earlier the better for parking. This is a fairly easy trail to hike. The elevation is not severe and there are points on the trail to stop to take a rest. The trail we chose to hike was paved which was nice but there are also dirt trails if you prefer that. On the trail we hiked there is no shade at all so we were happy that it was an overcast day. A lot of people were walking with their dogs on the trail and they were all well behaved. You can tell the dogs were enjoying the hike as much as their owners.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Truthfulviews
50,Loved the hike!,"We came on a Thursday morning. It was hard to find parking but there were people directing traffic. This was fantastic! I have foot problems but was able to do the upper hike to the top. I wish we had pictures of how high we went. You could see the Valley, the Hollywood sign, the Hollywood Bowl, and downtown L.A. So glad we did this. My brother lives in L.A. and had never done this before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynnette27
50,Great scenic views and hikes!,Great scenic views and hikes! If you decide to take a trip to the Hollywood sign make sure you bring some water!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pnitake
30,The people that ruin ti for me,"Honestly the amount of people I see aprking in handicap spots or littering here depresses me and makes me realize why i seldom come anywhere near this area of LA. Have come here with friends, our dog beofre he passed and now our munchkin but only when we can aprk at a friends otherwise not my cup of tea due to the dregs of society(Just cause you drive a 100,000 car doesn't mean you re not scum for littering)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reverantone
50,Runyon Canyon Park,"This was a ""must do"" for my visit to L.A. and it did not disappoint. The views overlooking the city were amazing especially given the clear blue skies. The hike was worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenlI1440ZH
40,Great hike,"Runyon Canyon is a short walk from my brother's home in LA, so we decided to go for a hike at Runyon Canyon during a recent visit. My grandson, age 7, joined us and he handled it well (he hikes with me frequently, so he's used to hiking). The hike up was fairly steep, but the road was paved, so it was easy walking. The views from the top are spectacular and well worth the climb. It was a little crowded at the top.As others have said, this is a popular hiking spot in LA because it is easy to access. While there were a number of people there, it was not so crowded that it diminished our enjoyment. I gave it 4 stars simply because I prefer more natural, rustic areas when I hike that lend themselves to more solitude.I would definitely do this hike again. The steepness made it a little challenging, so definitely take some water with you, as well as a camera to capture the views! No hiking boots needed - tennis shoes are fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stewartjl2017
40,Nice little park with excellent views of the city and the Hollywood hills.,"This park is well worth a detour, especially if staying nearby in West Hollywood. It can be accessed easily from bus route 2 so could be squeezed in on the way to Hollywood from West Hollywood. There is a simple loop trail around the park from which are several outstanding views over the city.Couple of things to note, some parts of the trail are fairly steep - but can still be completed by anyone with average fitness. Also, lots of people take their dogs there so it is a good place for dog lovers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephensH3674DY
50,Great Hiking,"This well-traveled hiking trail was recently renovated and reopened to the public. The trip there is on a beautiful scenic road and the views from the trail are amazing. If you want to take a hike while in Los Angeles, this is one of the best trails. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WizardToby
40,Great view of LA,Great place to walk or run up the hill. Really great view from the top. Make sure to take water and comfortable shoes for the run or walk. Nice view of the Hollywood sign from the top. Parking is available but a bit tough. I Ubered it since my friend lived near by.Take a lot of pictures from the top. Really nice houses up there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddieperez21
50,Celebrity hang out,"I was taken here with my friend who lives in LA. We passed about 4 celebs during our jog. I had no idea who they were, but my friend sure did haha",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenchambers71
50,Great to blow away the cobwebs and celebrity spot.,I always have a walk when I come to LA. The park is huge. There are plenty of trails to suit all abilities.We always park at the North entrance so we don't have too many hills. We have a walk down to a particular point which has views over downtown LA. Also some beautiful homes around here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolep809
40,Beautiful Park,A lot of nice trails to hike below the shadow of the observatory. Lots of parking and shade from the heat. Large trees and foliage to hike through,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CodyB1124
50,Great hike,This place is great. It’s a decent workout going up but you can make it as strenuous as you want based on pace.Really good views including Hollywood sign.We went in the south entry. Parking is on street but wasn’t too hard to find. I did not see any bathrooms but they may have been there.Definitely a great way to get some great views of the city and enjoy the Southern California weather,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougn976
50,Breathtaking View of Hollywood,"While on vacation with family and friends I got a chance to visit Runyon Canyon Park. I was able to run the East trail and it took my breath away!The main trail is paved and very wide but a section of the east trail requires a bit of climbing. The trail is full of runners and walkers with dogs.Parking can be tricky, but its LA after all. I would recommend walking to the N Fuller Ave entrance.If you get a chance I strongly recommend making the stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SylviaMJ
40,Best LA views,If I lived in La I’d be here every week. There are ya nemesis possibilities of trails so you would never grow bored. We went Dow a rustic steep path actually crosses a ravine on a narrow foot path and walked up the paved path. Great work out. Better views of all LA to the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/706amyk
50,"Steep, beautiful and scenic","This is a free walk and a totally worth it one. Quite steep and slippery in parts but the views are fantastic. Don’t miss it, it’s short and sweet and won’t take heaps of your time. Would suggest early morning or the evening to avoid the heat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonjam758
40,"Good Hiking spot, can park below or near the top","This is a popular and safe hiking spot where Dogs are welcome, there is even a section where most Dogs are off their leashes. There is also a house that can be rented for weddings, video or film shoots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
50,Loved the hike,"Its a steep hike, good work out. i did the sunrise hike and it was beautiful. Lots of people work out here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovemylife2018
50,Great exercise and views!,Free and great challenge for your physical wellbeing! Also you’re in doggie heaven watching people walk their dogs on the path! Great for striking up a conversation and meet some interesting individuals! The views of LA are also amazing! Free street parking can be found on the side roads leading up to the entrance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliSeaAhh
30,Local Exercise Area and Dog Park,"I’ve been here a few times and if you live in Hollywood at the foot of Runyon it’s incredibly convenient having an outdoor space like this but it’s not the best place to hike in the city, there is only very limited street parking at the lower entrance on Fuller and a very, very small parking lot at the upper entrance on Mulholland. If you aren’t walking here, take an Uber or Lyft. Don’t park on the side of the road up on Mulholland or you will get towed.This is definitely a busy place filled with locals dolled up to exercise, kind of like 24 Hour Fitness was let loose in the hills. There are some nice views and it’s steep so you will get quite a workout. Personally I wouldn’t recommend this if visiting LA unless you are interested in the Hollywood hiking scene. Griffith Park is a better option where you can get close to the Hollywood Sign or atop Mt. Hollywood you experience a 360 view from the Valley to Downtown and across the LA basin overlooking the Pacific.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coaticook
50,Lovely Hike!,"A must do when visiting Los Angeles, lovely hike and unforgettable views along the way. Moderate level of intensity but worth the hard work when you see the view from the top! Will definitely do it again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicoleawise
50,Go for sunrise,"There are several options for where to park and begin your hike: North Fuller, Runyon Canon or Mullholland; we went for the Runyon Canon Road Entrance (from the intersection of Franklin Ave and North Vista Street head north on North Vista Street until you reach Runyon Canyon Road). A word of warning though - check the signs on the streets around, there are very strict and confusing times/days on them.This is a fantastic hike where it's clear that it attracts locals as well as tourists; we even saw an exercise classes being held there! What I loved about it though is that most people are friendly and will say good morning. There are several loops and trails to choose from and you'll see some of the same motivated faces, as they're on lap two even before you've finished your lap one!I'd say this is a relatively easy hike, take your time and enjoy the views. Good footwear is required here and they will get quite dusty! Also, bring water and then a camera for those stunning views of the skyline. My recommendation is to go for sunrise; it really is worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/969suziea
50,Worth the hike!,"What an incredible thing to experience with my teenage son. Was an incredible hike to the highest peak, and tough on occasions, but the reward of the incredible view at the top was worth it! Highly recommend to anyone visiting the Hollywood area. Unfortunately, no sign of any celebrities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myfwanys
40,Great way to burn off a lot of calories,"Came up here on a Sunday to get the day started with a hike workout. Finding parking is really your biggest hassle, as it is crowded all over on weekends. But we did finally. Watch those street signs or prepare for a ticket. Many people walking dogs up and down the trail. There is an easy route, and a difficult route. 1.5 miles to the top. Great views of L.A., rivaled by only the Griffith Observatory. Better to go up earlier in the morning, as less crowded. Also bring shoes you don't mind getting dusty, as well as sunglasses for your eyes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craig1086
50,May be the MOST popular hiking in all of LA,"So many trail options, beautiful views, dogs allowed, and a terrific work out. No water or toilets so plan ahead, and parking is difficult as trail begins in a crowded residential neighborhood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalClan
50,one of those things you should do while in LA,Hint : do NOT park on North Vista Street ( you will get $75 ticket fast ) . Park down on Franklin Avenue and walk up . Nice mile long walk to top for good views . LA folks love their dogs and you'll see them walking the most exotic breeds everywhere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryecapital
50,"Great walk, great views","Jetlagged and up in the early morning, we headed off to Runyon Canyon Park in our sports gear and hiked up the steepest hills - without realising! It cleared the cobwebs out and left one of the best impressions of the city. Helped by the weather, the views of the city skyline are stunning.The park was very busy with people out dog walking and exercising on the main trails (lots of friendly people saying 'Good morning!'). But off the beaten track it was nice, peaceful and chilled. We even bumped into a few celebrities like Kendrick Lamar and Hugh Dennis.Definite recommendation if you want to escape the hustle of Hollywood and have a few hours to burn (and a few burgers to burn off!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimFloyd75
40,"Solid workout, better views!","Been hiking here a few times. Great to go with a group of friends or by yourself. Can get crowded on the weekends but never a problem on the hike, only when looking for parking. Don't really have to plan way ahead because it never rains in Southern California. The hike can get dusty so don't wear those new shoes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChadS2038
50,"Stunning Views, Healthy Walk","A must if you are in the LA area. Get away from the city and head up to the canyon. Its a good solid hike. You need to be in good shape, but you don't have to be an athlete to hike this. You can stay on the main trail which is pretty good, but its very hilly so its still strenuous. We choose to go off the trail at certain points, and that is a little rough. The terrain is rocky and hilly so you need to have good shoes so you do not fall. Great Views from the top- on a clear day you can see the hole city out to the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurilie513
50,Great short hike,"Lots of people, but probably because it is so easy to get to and is so picturesque and you get great views of the city within 30 minutes of walking. Bring sunscreen as there is no shade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jp2writer
40,If not athletic start at the top short walk to great view of city,Park up on top of Runyon canyon and walk thru gates on paved road and not to long probably 1/4- 1/2 Miles great views of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alwaystravel999
50,Amazing!!,The views here are fantastic! I recommend starting at the Griffith Observatory and walking to the Hollywood Sign. Amazing views along the way. Definitely worth the visit. Is a very pleasant walk not to strenuous. One piece of advise.... bring plenty of water!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blue_Diamond21
50,Love runyon,The best hike that you can do alone and feel safe not worry about psychos. Lots of dogs here so that’s a bonus but i highly recommend it if you’re in the la area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Missellen1
50,Beautiful views and good exercise,Great place to see magnificent views of the city while getting in a workout. We did the moderate trail and it had some fairly steep parts. Most of the trails are paved. It is definitely dog friendly. Bring water with you and allow some time. You won't be disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aggies1999
50,This is La La Land,"A wonderful park with maybe the best view over Hollywood. I was lucky enough to go there on a fresh, sunny morning after a rainy night in January. I ran up from Sunset Boulevard via Laurel Canyon which is not a good idea as there is no walkway. It is a 5 k uphill distance. There is limited parking on the mountain. As soon as you enter the gate of the park and pass the gates with the rattlesnake warnings, you have the greatest 360 view you can imagine. It is all there: the Hollywood sign, Studio city, Los Angeles Downtown and the Pacific Sea. The trails are a bit rocky. Going down I went along the Park road which is very nice (no cars). There are many dog walkers and the atmosphere is very relaxed. Bring enough water in summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulSalz

50,"Excellent Escape, Nice Hiking Trail, Dogs...Sure!","While visiting my daughter we wanted a nice hike with the dog, Runyon canon seemed to be the best option.Runyon Canyon is paved most of the way (except the very top) and it's not too strenuous. It was what we both wanted, a little exercise for us and the dog.We started down the hill off Fuller Ave on a beautiful warm (cool in the shade) Sunday morning @ 11:00 AM. It was perfect, not too crowded but enough people and other dogs to make it interesting. We hike to the top. Brody the dog enjoyed the outing as we did too.One item to note, no restrooms on the hike which if you are drinking water can be an issue. When we finished I had to rush to a gas station to pee. Ther are a couple of drinking fountains as one climbs the hill - two so if you want wanter drink at each.I always enjoy Runyon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRAVELINGCWS

Everybody does.Loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jazzSt_Louis

Great people watching as well!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Islandflowyoga

50,Hiking with the Stars,"There are so many celebrities in Los Angeles; and there are so many hiking trails in the city of stars. If you are looking for a place to hike with best chance to run into the stars, look no further than the Runyon Canyon. You may just get some star gazing when you are sweating.There are three paths:1. far right is the medium difficulty, with steps. Since it is covered with slippery sandy rocks and dirt make the steps very dangerous if you don't have good gym shoes. I had a pair of old shoes with no proper traction ..., I fell on my butt, still have the lump 5 years later. Try not to come down on this path, better off go up from this path.2. Middle of the road, it is easy breezy, paved road, if you just want to stroll long and enjoy the view.3. Far left, most difficult path, some very dangerous hike, be sure go there with someone if you are not a serious hiker. This path will get you to the highest point.At the mid point, you can actually see the Hollywood sign, the view of Los Angeles is stunning.This is so LA, people do dress very cute to hike this path, even make ups, the LA pretty people... don't judge, just enjoy the view in all aspect. hahaHave fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheenaGao

30,Can see the the Hollywood sign,"I looked up the Mulholland Dr north entrance on Google Maps. I found street parking right by the gated entrance. It was good for walking, jogging, and casual hiking. Pretty good views everywhere and you can get a view of the trails so you can see where you need to go. There are paved trails too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HM543
40,A Nice Workout With Great Views,"This has just received an extensive renovation so it's much easier to hike now. The views are great, the hike is varied and if you're not too fit take it easy and make sure you are wearing sunscreen and carrying water. You will see a lot of wannabees on this hike and a lot of cute dogs. There are great places for photos. If you're knees are dodgy take your hiking poles which are great for a hike such as this one.If you descend using the railroad ties route be careful and look after your kids who will want to jump and try and descend too fast. Do it right and it's fun. Do it wrong and it's a twisted ankle. As you approach the park cross all body parts and visualize a parking spot. They are hard to come by for this hike but I've always been lucky. Have Fun, and enjoy the conversation with your loved ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB
50,"Great place for people & pets: all shapes, sizes, and fitness levels","What a great place for a walk, jog, climb - alone or with friends or pet. Great views of Los Angeles and of the Hollywood sign. Honour bar at entrance to park - take a snack, drink or fruit, and leave your payment behind. Really? In Los Angeles?? But seems to work! A real jewel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffreyl238
30,"Lots of Dirt and Cute Dogs, Not Very Picturesque","I used to hike at this park because I lived near it, and it was a good way to get exercise with friends. I never thought it was beautiful, and when I went back for a hike recently, I saw very clearly that it's relatively barren and not particularly scenic. If you have a dog, it may be a good choice because it's dog-friendly. If you live in Hollywood or West Hollywood, this may also be a good choice because of proximity. If you want to go on a beautiful hike with cleaner air, I highly recommend going to the Pacific Palisades or Malibu instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5193HZmelissad
40,Great workout with a view....,"If you're in L.A. and you're not a native to the area you HAVE TO visit this place. It's a great workout and the view is gorgeous (hopefully the smog isn't heavy lol). Go early because parking spaces are limited as others have mentioned. You can stroll around and enjoy the views or you can get a serious workout in. Either way go and enjoy yourself. Beware, the parking lot isn't paved (at least not the one I parked in) and due to that clay like sand you'll make a mess of your rugs/carpet in your car!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vinmarine1
50,I love this place,"Please go early cause it's limited parking. You can park either on the park grounds, but it's only like 12 parking spaces. If you're going to park on outside of the park---please park where the parking the sign says so. The police are always driving around & will give you a ticket. I advice you to wear dark color running shoes cause the orange dirt will change the color of your shoes. If your scared of heights---please don't do it lol. Be careful of the rattle snakes & always watch your step while you're walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mercedes909
40,Probably the most popular walking trail in Los Angeles...,"You can either take the high road and get a really vigorous work-out as you walk up a pretty steep grade around a mile to a mile and a half. Once at the top, you get a great view of the L.A. basin and can see all the way east to downtown and all the way west to Santa Monica and the Pacific.Or you can take the low road for a slightly less vigorous, slightly shorter walk with an almost as amazing view...your choice.If you go on a weekend, or sometimes mid-afternoon, don't be surprised to spot an up and coming starlit or movie mogul taking the hike.Parking can be a bit dodgy as you're in a residential neighborhood, so check the street signs carefully as you don't want a ticket!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tvvvv2016
50,A must see in Los Angeles,"This is not a quiet or low-key hike, as it has a lot of traffic on the trails, but that makes it kind of charming in its own way. Its a beautiful trail and the views of Los angeles definitely makes it worth while. If you're new to Los Angeles, this should be on your bucket list for sure. 2 entrances, dog-friendly, and water fountains scattered about. Lots of yoga pants and you may even catch glimpses of celebrities, or at least some upcoming young socialites who think they are important and have to be all made up while they hike. Haha.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felicityfeline
50,Beautiful Hike!,"My friends and I went hiking in this park. This park had the most beautiful views. You can see downtown, the Pacific Ocean, and the homes on the trail.

40,Good for Exercise,"This is a decent place to go if you want to get a good workout in or do some hill running.

50,Awesome Views,"We took uber up to top of fuller st. we hiked the entire park and all the peaks. it was about 4.5 miles. the last peak under the power lines was a bit technical getting up and down a 12 foot shoot but worth it. The views from all over the park are incredible. The hollywood sign is off to the right. there are dogs off leash everywhere which we loved. not sure what the vertical climb is but it's a decent workout. If you ran it, you'd be gassed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeputyDogCLT
30,great view but better places to hike in this city,If you want to watch people roam around with a selfie stick and pretend to be hiking.. this is the place to go to??? i wouldn't call this a legit hiking trail.. this is the instagram only place. Also the least favorite place to hike for most of my friends and I who live here. Also dog poop everywhere and the smell is pretty strong. Come here for your instagram addiction but definitely hit up any other surrounding hiking trail for a real hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LCexplorerTX
40,"Excellent Hike, Beautiful Views","I went for a hike with my daughter and her dog and it was my first time in Runyon Canon Park.We started at about 5 PM and the way we hiked provided enough shade throughout the hike. Her dog was in a leash part of the time and off the leash in areas where it's allowed.Lots of LA families walking dogs and hiking with their kids. There is a wide asphalt walkway all the way up and some dirt trails. We stayed on the asphalt areas.Pretty walk up and down, with the dog took a little over an hour. We stopped to talk and play with other dogs. I expect it would have been an hour If we just walked.Beautiful hike, views of the Hollywood sign and downtown LA.I will return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRAVELINGCWS
50,Runners delight!,"This is a gorgeous canyon. There is limited parking at both ends of the trails if I remember correctly, although I was able to walk here as I was staying in the Valley. You can, of course, walk the trails, but know that it is a decent climb not for those who do not reasonable fit. There are no facilities at the top and remember to bring water. There often are celebrity types running with their dogs here, but be forewarned that they are not interested in selfies etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizznyc

50,Wonderful run. Beautiful scenery in the midst of the city,"My daughters convinced me to get up at 6am to go for a walk up Runyon Canyon. I thought, oh brother.We arrived at the site to find a station with water and refreshments that operated on an honour system for payment. What a tribute to society that this could exist.The hike was refreshing and a great start to the day. The views of the city were simply unbeatable.

Awful ending to a nice nature walk, unfortunately. That is the only reason for 3 stars...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J0yaA
40,Trek to see Los Angeles from an elevated perspective,It's easy to drive your car to Griffith Observatory for panasomic views of LA but a great alternative is trekking up Runyon Canyon where you get as spectacular views of LA and a holiday workout all at the same time. You need to have a moderate level of fitness - but the effort is worth it with some great views of the city. I recommend getting up early and tackling the Canyon before breakfast - particularly in summer before it gets too hot. It is worth noting that the haze which constantly envelopes LA makes the views good but seldom great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamw267
50,In love with this place,"I always love to go for a morning hike here when I am in LA, there is a trail for every level of fit, I even managed to find a trail that suited me when I felt my legs were super exhausted following a demanding half marathon.Of course, you have to be in love with the views, they are simply amazing!I would advise going here in the morning, it seems to become a bit of a catwalk later during the day, but that can be fun, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Millivist
50,The place to hike in LA,"This countrified area attracts an eclectic crowd of writers, actors, directors, and locals who arrive early in the morning, many with dogs on leashes and scripts in hand, to hike the abundant trails. Well-paved paths meander for miles up and around the Hollywood Hills. On clear days you can see Catalina Island, Pacific Palisades, downtown LA and snow capped mountains from any of a number of hilltops.Take Sunset Boulevard east to Beverly Glen and up to Mulholland Drive. Make a sharp right (east) for about a half-mile.Parking is limited so obey no-parking signs or you will get towed and ticketed, no joke. Park opens at sun rise and closes at dusk. Bring water, wear sunscreen and a hat, and be ware of rattle snakes (although I hike there daily and have seen any). Also don not smoke or light a fire. The top of the hill has lots of good photo ops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattithedivaP
50,Once in a lifetime experience,"The hiking trail has every level of experience covered, and the views are indescribeable with 270 degree panoramics of the entire county from Santa Monica to Pasadena, you have to be here to believe it, must do if you are in the area. Best of all it is FREE !! Check out the shelter dog walking group on AirBnB with Ryan!! Great experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InspireMI
40,Good park to workout and take in the views,"Enter though the gate at the top of North Fuller Drive and you have the option to take one of three main paths up to the top of the canyon.The path out to the left (called the western track) is by far the toughest and requires at least a moderate level of fitness as the track is fairly steep in parts and has some loose fine gravel. We went at a moderate pace and took only a few quick stops for pictures and it took about 30 minutes to reach the summit.Across the undulations at the top of the canyon took about a further 20 minutes to pitch up the centre tarred path. We then returned down the eastern track that took about another 20 minutes but it's a much easier path than the western route.The centre path is paved and a reasonably simple route.Take some good quality runners is you are planning to take any of the paths other than the paved centre option.Take water and sunscreen as the heat does get fairly intense and there aren't any water stations other than at the top and bottom of the canyon.If it was quite windy I may give hiking a miss in the canyon as there is lots of loose dirt on the tracks and hiking in a dust storm wouldn't be pleasantGreat views over the LA landscape and into the valleys behind Runyon, although you would need a very clear day to see the ocean",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruceM599
50,great views on this easy hike,"This easy hike provides amazing views all around. Seeing the city from the top, or Hollywood hill and sign, or even the homes around the hike, is like being in the middle of everything yet far away. The trail is populated at all times - lots of very fit people, lots of serious exercisers, and even more casual exercisers around.Definitely a joy to see! Although parking is a story of itself. Try parking on the street anywhere you can, but I think the easiest time to find parking is before 9am.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bellaa07

Good fun and a litle bit tiring(!), but once you get to the top you'll see why it's so popular. It feels away from the city completely, while the view just goes on forever.

50,Pure Canyon Hike Trail Dog Tips Too,"I have started to hike around LA and I keep coming back to Runyon because of location and dog friendliness. Key things you need to know. Summer is hot. Remember tourists, it's a canyon and let me tell you the temperature will kick you and your dog. Take water bottles. You can fill them up at the base of the canyon but there is none at the top. I usually catch a ride there because parking can be killer. If you drive, start at the top. There's a nice lot, go early. At the base, they even have bottles for sale on good faith you will pay for them. There are dog treats and some fruit too. Take a couple of bucks you're good. There are two ways up the canyon either is fine. I prefer the left side up. I like the incline. Dogs can go without leashes once inside the canyon area. I have met many folks who are regulars and have given me insight on the Runyon dogs. There are definitely dogs that shouldn't be without a leash. They will be aggressive toward other dogs. (Let me be clear I've never seen nor heard of a dog biting anyone at the canyon). I have a pitbull. She's awesome. I take her and she is trained and on a security collar. Be aware of other dogs and keep your dog next to you when going near others. Most everyone is aclimated to dogs and is very tolerant until they aren't. Dog owners unite AND TAKE A POOP BAG. There usually is a dog waterbowel underneath the benches (right if you are facing the top) and nice views for a rest if too hot. On a beautiful day it's a spectacular view all around. Don't go if windy. The dust will be overwhelming. The canyon is dirt all the way on the trail. In most spots it's wide. One side (right if at base) is rocky and in some parts can be tricky to navigate if you are older or unstable on your feet. Never fails I hear of a celebrity in the canyon on the same day as me and yet never see anyone familiar. I will admit January is the best time to visit Runyon. Watch the weather and pick the perfect day, It will be cooler as you climb to the top so gently layer. I have never seen any wildlife but I'm really not complaining. I go to walk and see the views. It's a unique place. Canyons offer a vantage point to soak in the LA area. It's a great place to get a tast of LA. From runners to walkers, yoga classes at the base, trainers and lifters, everyone heads to Runyon. Sunset is spectacular. Highly recommend for those great outdoors folks and hikers. DEFINITELY NOT MEANT FOR LOWER LEVEL WALKERS",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spary09
50,Great adventure!,"If you like hiking or walking on a challenging road, you should definitely go there! It is an amazing workout and a good way to explore another face of Los Angeles. The view is gorgeous and it makes you feel deep in the nature with a desert climate, even though you're in one of the biggest city in the States. But make sure to bring a good amount of water and sunscreen, because it's VERY HOT!It was a very good adventure and I would recommend it :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miryam_deC

50,Fantastic Hike,"This is a great place to go as a local or even visitor to LA. I personally would put this on your things to do when visiting, as you get a great hike in the Hollywood part of town with awesome views of the hills and city. As a new local to Los Angeles, you can definitely talk to anybody and they will tell you this is the hike to make a priority and I can agree with that. It gets super hot here so make sure you have enough water. There are a lot of inclines and declines, of which you can decide which direction you want to head in since you can decide how hard you want to make this on yourself. It's not too long compared to some other hiking options in the area, but you can find yourself a great running path along the hike so keep that in mind if you are into jogging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clrinaldi43

50,Great Hike away from the hoopla,Excellent hike above Hollywood. Not too challenging but good with kids say 10 and up. Great views of LA at top.

40,Nice hike - don't underestimate it!,"We went to Runyon Canyon during a trip last fall and really enjoyed it. It's quite amazing how quickly you can get into nature in a city that is as sprawled and present as LA.

Warning to the unexperienced hiker: the east route is quite doable, the west route is a bit challenging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rupi3000

40,Your effort will be rewarded,"One of the hardest parts is finding a parking spot near the main entrance. Hire a car. There are a range of different trails so it's easy to find one to suit your fitness level, walks seem to be from 2 to 8 km return. For most trails the first part is a paved road and for a walker with moderate fitness is not to challenging. Plenty of spots to catch your breath or have a drink whilst checking out the view.

50,Go on the paved hike if you are scared of heights ;),"I was keen to do Runyon Canyon, but we naively took the east trail, the non paved legitimate hike, that goes up 40 stories/floors, in a short time... I was petrified, and more than once wanted to stop, it was quite steep in some spots... but Mark talked me through it... A good work out in the least!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corrie563
50,Awesome views!,"We went to hike during on our vacation as that's the way my husband likes to see cities that we visit. Needless to say this is a great workout. You can bring the furry friends too. I loved the view of the Hollywood sign. The views are amazing and weather was so perfect! I would not go after lunch it's just way too hot. We ventured out in the am and ended right before lunch so it was perfect. Carry sweatshirt or hoodie as it gets cold the higher you go.One thing to remember this park is a circle. So if you go too far the only way back is to turn back around or prepare yourself to do the full circle. We did the full, and let me tell you it was rough. Be prepared, we took water bottles but could have used two. Now keep in mind we are not fit people just the average person so for us it was a workout. Others that may be fit could possible run some of it and still get a good workout. I highly recommend to do this if in the area,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rochellenkevinv

50,Lot of hiking trails - nice views,nice (tough) hike up the hills - view is spectacular of Hollywood and also the Hollywood sign. Fun. Lot of people walking the trails this weekend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/906beckyv
30,Go to Griffiths park instead,Similar and not as good views as Griffiths park. Nightmare to park when we went on a Sat am and everyone exercising there. Enjoyed the drive to it up Mulholland drive but Runyan Canyon itself a little disappointing. Supposed to be good for celebrity spotting though but we didn't see any.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyandSarahG
50,Great view of LA,My son and I hiked Runyon Canyon at Sunset. It was absolutely amazing. It was a Saturday afternoon and there were lots of people and dogs running or walking the gorgeous area. What a lovely view from the top!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/659rachelj
50,Exhilarating Trek with Splendid Views,Easily accessible by public transport.Cool and invigorating 60- min stroll to the summit.Water fountains provided along the way .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scoobybeagle
50,Great Run!,I did my morning 5 mile run and workout on the trails. Amazing views of the whole LA county. It's crazy how far out you can see on these trails. Such a cool place to go on a run,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshw_travel
50,Great view,"I went on a tour that took me though this area of LA, so I didn't have a chance to walk around. The views were great and it was nice for someone else to be driving",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fancypantsdancer2009
50,Beautiful hike near bustling LA Hollywood area,"This is an amazing park to do hike to your heart's content. Steps away from downtown and Hollywood. You can choose how vigorously you want to hike. My husband and we did about one hour hike. We did not take the dirt road - so it was not a loop hike for us. But the hike has nice views, good inclination and paved path. We enjoyed it a lot. If it's a clear day, you will be able to see almost all of LA from the top or the vista points.One tip is - go as early as possible if you want a parking near the park entrance. If you reach there after 7:30am, you have to wait 15-30 min or find a street parking which is a bit challenging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssaha2015
50,Great hiking trails in middle of LA,This is a great place to get outdoors and away from the hustle and bustle of LA. Some of the trails are a bit challenging so have some water and good pair of shoes if you plan on doing those. If you want any easy walk I recommend sticking to the paved portion which can take you all the way to the top where the neighborhoods are and you still get some great views of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathleenw529
50,Awesome hike,Lots of fun. Great people whatching!Not too difficult if you need a quick dose of exercise. Go up the stairs and down the trail for the best workout!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moreyc2015
40,Great workout trail with a view,Not too hard to find but parking can be challenging. There were a lot of people hiking at 8am. Pet friendly- I've never seen so many pets in a hiking trail. Almost 2 mile hike up and the view from the top was magnificent. It is a great workout trail for sure. I will come back to check out the other hiking trails and summit. I definitely recommend this place when visiting LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herTRAVELstorey
50,Great hike,This is a great moderately challenging hike. It was pretty steep uphill the first half of the 3 mile hike. The views are magnificent. Can see the ocean on one side and a great view of DTLA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siouxsy
50,Awesome hike for locals or tourists,"I always recommend Runyon to folks. There are a few different routes you can take (some harder than others), and if you really just want to pop up for a 10 minute walk you can get to a great viewing area of LA. I live close to the entrance on Fuller so I always walk, but I've heard parking is a pain in the butt. But a great spot for a hike any time of day! (ps check out a sunrise here if you can!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsmetheresac
50,Amazing hikes and views!!,"A trip to WEHO is not complete without conquering the canyon trail. We visited on a Friday afternoon and the trial was quite busy, I can only imagine the crowds on a weekend!Dogs, joggers, tourists, families, and your hardcore hikers are all here but don't let that deter you. Wear a comfortable pair of shoes that you won't mind getting dusty and make your way here. There are water bottles, power bars, and snacks that you can purchase on an honour system in case you forget to bring your own.The entire trail loop is a bit challenging but other loops are available for those who may have limited physical abilities. The views get better with every incline, so have lots of memory on your devices.I managed to do the entire trail in less than 1.5 hours and it was well worth it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TorontoJourneyman
40,A great place for hikers.,"A few years ago we lived a few doors down from the entrance to Runyan Canyon. It is heavily trafficked, and there are a lot of dogs, which can be a down side or not, depending upon your view. A lot of young, fit people flow in and out, as well as all ages. It is a challenging hike but you can choose to avoid the steepest climbs if you wish. The view of the city from different stops on the climb are wonderful. When we were there, there was free yoga on the grass in one area, which was so nice. The parking is hard to find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gourmetornot11
50,The View....,"Great hike trails, has spots along the route with water bowls for your dog if you have one. I love that it's not just one long flat trail. you go up stairs, up hillside, flat and winding trails. Totally enjoyed my visit, will have to go more often. Had friends from out of town visiting, and they enjoyed very much as well. My niece is looking forward to going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/32irisa
50,"Good hike, great views","We were looking forward to playing in Runyon Canyon in hopes of seeing some celebrities. We didn't, but we're still really glad we hiked to the top. It was more of a hike than we anticipated, but it was a lot of fun and the views at the top were amazing. You could see from the Hollywood Sign all the way to the Pacific Ocean. I would definitely recommend doing this as a morning activity and then grabbing a smoothie after!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristentuell
50,Challenging Hike!,"You should be in shape for this one. Bring plenty of water, as there is almost no shade. I recommend this hike for fall-winter- early spring. The views are amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runningandmusing
40,Nice views of city - dog friendly,"On a business trip looking for something to do. Walked from the Loews Hotel (15 min) and completed the loop starting on the east ridge. Only had flip flops but would recommend sneakers or hiking boots. Most of the path is paved or groomed dirt. Some sections are steep and required good balance and endurance. People of all ages walking the trails. Open until dusk, felt safe with so many locals. Good people watching since it is LA city hiking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fishmister
50,Beautiful view,This is a great place to go to get a view of the city as well of the NBC Universal/Comcast building and the Sheraton universal building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethW1548
40,Very nice walk to see LA in all its splendor!,This is a good place to take a great hike. It has great views of all of L.A. The only downside are all the dogs roaming everywhere without leashes and it's a bit crowded for my liking. It's probably much nicer on a weekday. Make sure you take some sunscreen! Also be ready to park at a distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelaM7103IC
50,Worth the effort,My wife and I decided to take the trail up with our toddler and his stroller. Should have worn active wear but was to late.Parking is limited because the trail is a bit crowded. It's a hotspot for locals and tourists. After all you earn a nice view. There are some drinking water sprinklers and rest areas on the way up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeteDoe
50,Great hike,Hiked to the top of Runyon Canyon park with my daughter. ( she usually runs the trails) parts are pretty steep but it's worth the climb. Views are amazing from the top! Was very sunny and hot so take sunscreen and water. There are warnings of snakes along the trail so be careful .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mindyw318
50,Great hiking,I love to visit LA and hike this park - it has great views and good trails and isn't packed full like Griffith Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussellC273
50,Great place for an early morning run/walk,"Runyon Canyon Park is a fabulous place to go for an early morning hike, before the heat of the days hits the valleys. I went for a hike here one Sunday morning and it was nice and cool, but still hazy over LA. Great views of the Hollywood sign, Hollywood Bowl rear and fancy houses off Mulholland. Best to park on Mulholland close to the park gates, but get there early for a parking space.Take water as there are no shops or booths selling drinks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlw632
50,A serious hike for serious hikers,This was my first time there and wow was it a rough walk. The grade must be about 50% incline at some spots but as long as I took breaks at regular intervals I felt good throughout the ascent.I loved the diversity there! So many age groups and dog lovers and athletes and casual hikers. It was a great experience and I'll definitely do it as often as I can. Great workout and the reward of a beautiful view from the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c0achkj
50,LALA Land Fun Outdoor Experience,"A busy and safe hike in the heart of LA. Loads of hikers and their dogs to keep you company. Enjoy the people watching and the view for miles. It takes about 1 - 1.5 hrs depending on your speed. There are several areas that are semi-steep but only a few areas. You can choose the long hike upwards from the left or the short uphill to the right and the long downhill on the way back. Your choice for type of a work-out. There's not much shade, so wear a hat and sunglasses mid-day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tishtop
50,Sunday hike,"All I can say is awesome and tough!! There are many entrances , we took an uber up and down due to parking may be bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drflowerpower
50,Hiking in the heart of LA,"We had a great experience hiking Runyon Canyon. I must say, it was much more difficult of a hike than we expected. Was a great workout. There are numerous trails and routes, and chose a harder one. You have the option of staying on a paved path, or venturing off to the dirt paths. We did not stay on the pavement, as the best views required more of a hike. I like that if we were to go back we could choose a completely different path. The views of LA are breathtaking. The entrance is in walking distance of Hollywood Boulevard, if you are looking to hit multiple LA attractions in the same day. Definitely recommend this unique experience in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurenlivingroom
50,Great Views of the City and a good workout!,"Substantial walk/run to keep fit or just discover the incredible views at the top. Hollywood hills (Hollywood sign), skyline of LA, etc. Pet friendly...in fact, a practical dog parade! Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tosh_247
50,Beautiful View of the City,"Decided to hike here for the breathtaking views of LA. I heard a lot about this hike and was expecting a leisurely hike, but there were parts that were slightly difficult. Regardless of my fear of sliding uncontrollably down a slope that I quickly overcame, I enjoyed the hike here and was impressed by the views of the LA skyline and Hollywood sign.Another point of note was the large number of dogs here. I was surprised to see so many large and small dogs here and joked that this was actually a dog obstacle course. If you go, you'll understand this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/55kaylac
50,Great place to hike,This is a great place to hike. There are different trails to suit your level of intensity and length of hike. Wonderful views of LA and the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BiggerPassportPlease
50,trails,Excellent hiking with beautiful views and is free. We loved it and it is a great way to people watch and at the same time see breath taking views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattys332
50,Easy to Moderate Hike into the Hills,This is an invigorating walk up to fantastic views of surrounding LA. The road path is easiest to go up and back. A more vigorous hike involves steps up and then a walk back down on the paved road. Go earlier as the late morning sun can be hot. There are several water fountains on the way for pets and people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arr_1k
40,Views,"Great views at sunset and cooler, but aim to be back before dark! Not a difficult hike at all. Lots of dogs around!!Don't forget water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DnshPtl
40,Great Daytime Views and a light hike.,"There are three main trails and plenty of goat paths to wander off on if you are looking to get a little outdoor exercise while staying in the city. Get up early, get to the top and take it all in. Location was close to our hotel in BH so this was a lot better than being inside in a gym.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler9955
50,"Memorable hike, gorgeous views!","Runyon Canyon is on my list to visit each time I'm in LA! Friendly people, happy dogs, gorgeous views and hiking that is manageable on the paved path or a bit more challenging on the dirt path. My kids joined me this year, and said it was their favorite experience. Great views of the city and the Hollywood Sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385cathyd
50,Always a great view,"The hike is medium level to difficult depending what part you choose to travel up. The parking is sometimes a pain, but something always opens up eventually so worth waiting for it. Never disappointed by the great views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbarafix
40,Excellent quick hike,"If you're missing the mountains and if you're up for a quick hike while in LA, this hike will fit the bill.Take the train towards Hollywood and stop at Highland. Continue walking westward along Hollywood Blvd. Until you hit Fuller Ave. Turn right (uphill) and you should hit the gates.I took the rightmost trail (did not turn left).When you reach the ""top"" , there's another high point (power lines) for which you will walk along the road , past some houses , turn sharp left (uphill ). If you don't turn, you will come out to Mulholland drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CanadianAlpinist
10,I Hate Club Runyon,"If you want to meet stupid slutty superficial women, go to a rave or strip club. Runyon exploits the serenity of nature and pollutes the mind with sensory overload in a pornish way. When I go hiking, I am looking to connect with nature. Not someone who is more concerned with a selfie than being in the outdoors. I recommend this place to people with a fresh pair of valour pants that have PINK or JUICY written across the butt. I'm all for dog parks and hiking with dogs but there is too much poop on the trail as dogs are part of the popularity game at Runyon. Fryman on the North side of the mountain is much better. HAPPY HIKING!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/436stug
50,Beautiful hike!,"This was an excellent hike on a beautiful day! There are two paths; a moderate hike, and a more challenging one. We chose the more challenging one, however it was not too long, so it was by no means difficult. It took us about 2 hours to do the full loop. Beautiful sights of the city! Would highly recommend to all visitors!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901jenna
30,The Re-Do Needs to be Re-Done,"The 2016 upgrade to Runyon leaves L.A.'s most popular park sorely lacking in amenities. A total of 14 new little trees planted, 5 new benches to sit on, 4 new water fountain stations, and a few new fire hydrants for dogs to piss on and for use in fire emergencies. The city couldn't do more than that? The biggest snafu is the black asphalt that covers the main central hiking route. Who determined that was the best choice? Just because it was cheaper than cement? The main path was paved over for emergency fire access. Never mind that it destroyed what little semblance of nature was afforded by the old partially paved road. But asphalt? Doesn't last as long as concrete. Maybe the city wants the partially paved look back again, because that is what it's going to be come a dozen years or so. In the meantime, the 4-legged creatures get to have scorched paws in the hot times, as asphalt absorbs much more radiant heat than concrete. Seems like city planners weren't thinking about those things. What a mistake this was. I hope whoever made that decision is forced to walk barefoot next August September and October in Runyon so they can personally experience how smart their selection was. Park planning is supposed to revolve around the people (and in this case, the dogs) that utilize the park. It's not supposed to revolve around emergency vehicle accessibility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25kena
50,Great Hike!,"This is a fairly strenuous hike, but totally worth it! The views are incredible! The hike feels extremely safe since there are lots of other hikers/walkers at all times. The trails are well maintained and easy to follow. I would avoid the hottest part of the day since there is very little shade. We didn't see any celebrities but just the idea of star gazing motivated my teenagers to walk the entire loop (about 2 1/2 miles).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O554NMjuliew
50,phenomenal view from the mountain,Excellent cardio exercise and phenomenal view from the mountain. There is a path to go up and down and you meet lots of people during your hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joanne196550
40,Hiking but not for wimps,"We hiked the trail-and it's not for folks who are unable to walk long distances in the heat. It was hot the day we went up the trail. Take water with you as there is nothing for purchase. This is a highly trafficked trail so expect to be on the trail with a lot of people. Locals use the trail daily. It is hard to park, so plan ahead. Wear a hat if possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbozeman78
40,Uphill battle but great view,"If you need a little cardio or a nice view stroll to the top of Runyon canyon. Walkers and runners from all levels...and their dogs..call this place home. We are seniors but made our way to the top after several rest stops and some bottled water. Great pics at the top of LA, Hollywood, the Hollywood sign and a on a clear day (good luck there) the Pacific Ocean. It is definitely excercise so if you are more the couch potato type you might want to skip this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dspiderw

40,Fun pics with the iconic sign,"Hiking to the Hollywood sign is a lot work, but it is a great view when you get there. There are various trails you can take for all levels of hike lovers. Note all have some pretty good uphill climbs. We did one of the easier hike which was about 3 1/2 miles. This is to take Beechwood Street and we got parking at the very top by the sunset ranch, which was extremely lucky. Keep in mind, that on weekends, you are not allowed to park on the streets, so go during a week day if possible. (Otherwise parking tickets are $65.)The first couple parts of the trail are the steepest and then it gets flatter as you get higher up. You get in front of the sign on this trail. If you want to go behind the sign, this trail has a split that will take you behind the sign as well.Luckily it was a very cool day when we went, so it was a pleasant hike with a lot of picture spots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acb8694
40,Excellent place to hike in Hollywood,"I've loved it since my first time in L.A. Located in the heart of Hollywood, it's an ideal place to hike, keep your body moving, socializing and walk your dogs. In the AM Yoga groups for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxBartoli

LA from a vantage point ive never seen before - do make sure and time your visit as it gets very busy. there is no public car park so that can be tricky if you are driving. we got a LYFT from our hotel and then we were within walking distance of Hollywood boulevard after, for us the am was the time to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barrogers

50,Fantastic place away from the hustle and bustle!,"This is a fantastic outdoor area just a short walk from the main part of Hollywood, and was really a highlight of my trip to LA. I visited the park at around 830am on a warm sunny Wednesday in late February. It was quite busy with what looked to be mainly locals lots walking their dogs and getting some morning exercise before work, which was great to see. I followed the less travelled side trails, (off to the left after entering from Fuller) some of which were quite steep and challenging to get to the highest peaks, but the views are absolutely stunning. Getting to the top on such a clear day and taking in the panorama was amazing, and with plenty of stops for pics was easily able to fill in a couple of hours doing the whole park. If you like hiking in the outdoors and great vistas this place is a must to visit when you are in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mvwillo
50,Great view,Fun trails to walk around. You can try walking to the Hollywood sign. Best piece of advice is go on a weekday as it's easiest to park closest to the park. Weekends are really hard to find Parking close by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andymiami5

30,"I'm not a huge fan of this ""favorite"" hiking spot","These seems to be a place many in the area talk about going to take a hike. Apparently many people have ""star sightings"".

We hiked up the east path (Inspiration Point...also known as Star Trail??) and came down on the paved road and then hiked up the west path (West Ridge Hiking Trail..also known as Hero Trail??) and looped around on the ""bridge"" and stairs to come down the paved road a second time. The east was definately easier than the west. We were visiting LA without a car, so we had our Lyft drop us off at N Fuller Avenue and we went in that gate, but we came out the gate on Runyon Canyon Road. We timed it to catch the sunset from the top of the trail and it was fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VEE1225
30,Too Many Dogs Not On Leashes,"The park seemed like a great place to exercise with all the hills. Great views. However, there were too many dogs running around off leashes. Even though the sign says dogs must be on leashes people do not obey and the rules are not enforced. Everybody is not a ""dog person"" I left because of this and really didn't get to see what all the park had to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heidiaka

Park is open from sunrise to sunset.Whether you're running or hiking, prepare for a busting hill climb if you start at the bottom up to Mulholland at the top. Easy downhill back down with some extra offshoot trails if you need more. You'll find more hikers, walkers w/dogs, etc then runners but a great place for a nice uphill run.If you forgot your water, there is also an honors system cooler at the bottom with water and snacks. One of the best in LA for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChadS303

Right now it's like the 405 freeway! So crowded on the weekends, it's like walking a busy street in New York! Soooo many people, dogs, loud conversations. It became more of an out door gym. Not to take away from breathtaking views but as for communing with the nature, no thank you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAVict0ria

50,Great hiking and views,"Runyon Canyon is great for a good hike. Beautiful view of downtown LA. Parking is very difficult to find. We got lucky parking on main road. Very dog friendly, it seemed there were as many dogs as there were people. They even have water fountains for the dogs.Very steep, going down the canyon is easy but coming up was rough, no idea how some of the people can run it. There is paved road you can walk/run on, or you can climb up on the dirt paths to the very top of canyon (which my daughter opted out of). If I lived in LA though this would be great daily workout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q8647MAdawnl
50,"Must do in LA, celebrity spotting+a work out!","Every time I come to LA i do the circuit around Runyon Canyon.Get above the glitz, glam, filth and poverty of Hollywood and look out over LA from the hills to Downtown the views are amazing.Gives you just a taste of what it might be like too live in this area. Keep an eye out for celebrities that frequent the track!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toat235
20,Typical,If you're trying to get away from the tourist or locals. this is NOT the place. This spot is just filled with the typical LA crowd. There is so many more hiking areas with way more to offer. I think most people go here simply cause its close but can be really busy on weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnkO1168GV
50,Ready for a walk,During our break from the business meetings my husband and I decided to go to Runyon Canyon. Make sure you are physically ready for an uphill trek if you park near Fuller Ave. We took the east trail and it was a winner. Parking can be tricky and we went on a Wednesday. Make sure you use the bathroom before you go because there is nothing in the park. Don't forget the water and a towel to wipe off the sweat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FredaB82
50,fun 2 hour hick,me and kids did a fun 2 hours hick one day - it is not far from Beverly hills - about 30 min drive and it was nice to be out in the fresh air hiking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badbaruch57
50,Gorgeous views,"I had wanted to hike Runyon in October 2015 but my friend and I couldn't find time, so we made it a priority for my recent visit. Unfortunately a few things outside of our control got in the way of our hike so we didn't get all the way to the top.Note that on Mondays one side of the street has cleaning, so no parking 12-3pm and then the other side is Tuesdays same time...there is lots of on-street parking but those hours make it tricky. We went from the Fuller St entrance to Mulholland taking the harder trail up and the easier, paved one down. Views are stunning.Bring water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wherelolawent
50,A must do while in LA!,This was a fantastic outdoor activity to do while in LA. Before we started our hike we took an outdoor yoga class that we found on Facebook and it was fantastic and based on tips. You'll want to block at least three hours to hike both mountains but time to stop and take pictures and take in the views. There are no bathrooms so go easy on the water. Another helpful tip is there is a man selling cold drinks and fresh fruit at the entrance gate for cheap.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMarie525
50,Great hiking with great views!,"Hiked Runyon canyon yesterday while visiting friends. The trail we chose was very scenic, but did have some steep inclines. Will try it again once my legs recover!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davidromei
50,1 of top 10 things to do while visiting LA,"The view over looking LA is amazing!There are 2 trails an easy and a hard. It is super busy so safe to do alone, with partner or with friends.Parking around the area is tricky and parking inspectors are always around so be sure to check the signs or park on the other side of Sunset blvd and make your walk a little bit longer.Most importantly take it all in... you'll see the mansions in the Hollywood hills, the Hollywood sign, Downtown and out to the coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhoebeAlexander
50,Good hiking and beautiful views on a sunny day,"Took the intermediate-level trail to top of canyon, on recommendation of one of the servers at Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel restaurant. I had 70 degree temp and cloudless sky, so weather was definitely cooperating. Entrance to trail is short walk from hotel, then trail begins. If you don't want dirt and rock trail, you can take the paved trail, which I took on descent to get different view angles. Views along any of the trails are fantastic and truly breathtaking at summit. Entire hike up and back to hotel was about 2 hours, and I'm a slow-pokey walker. Highly recommend if it's a sunny day, but would skip if the sunlight is not cooperating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M974ZRrobertm
50,Hiking,The must do hike for tourists. Not too hard n star watching. Take the paved road for an easier experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coleg230
50,Beautiful Place to Hike,It's free and it offers breathtaking views of LA. What more could you ask for? It was a great workout and wonderful experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caseyleigh143
50,Challenging and Fantastic,Parking can be a little tricky but once you arrive at the trail it's beautiful. We went on a Saturday morning and it was busy but it was no problem. We stopped and thoroughly enjoyed the scenery along the way. The last part of the trail was very challenging as you literally had to use your hands to climb up the hill. I never dreamed I could make it all the way to the top but I did!! I was euphoric!! We would definitely do it again!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A7287WEmaryb
50,Get fit with a view!,This is a very popular spot for hiking. I would recommend getting out there no later than 10am. You'll want to be done with your hike before the heat of the day begins. Parking can be tough so that's another reason to get there early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/razfan2001
50,Amazing Scenary and Easy Access,The park is very easy to spot and directions are clear. There are many trails to choose from and all of them offer panoramic views of downtown LA and surrounding areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L116GDstephaniew
50,Gorgeouos Views with a Good Workout,We hiked this park as a family the day after Christmas. It was a beautiful southern California day. The terrain is easily managed by hikers of all ages. It was a tad crowded but not to the point of distraction. You get some really fun views of the greater Los Angles area including the downtown skyline with the glimmering Pacific in the background. A great way to burn some calories and have some fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/346billf
40,Cool walk with views,You have to go a bit outside the city to make it there and parking can be a bit of an issue especially on a busy day (like Christmas holidays) but the views are totally worth it. The hikes we took were pretty easy but the park is so big that you can find a great number of hikes from easy to difficult. Views range from the Hollywood sign on the back to the Pacific Ocean and the properties in the area are also worst while ur visit up there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElMa1983
40,"Awesome views, but be prepared for inclines","We had a great time hiking here. Be prepared for an actual hike, though, at times without a paved road (i.e., it’s not just a flat walking trail). The views are worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoSeeGlutenFree
50,Fun with a pup,"It's a lovely hike but if you don't have a dog with you I think the fun factor drops by about 50%. Parking is super difficult but once you manage that just enter from anyway you can and just walk. It's a hilly hike so not sure why few people said it's a cake walk. It's one of the few hikes that allow unleashed dog so it's super popular with dog owners with well behaved dogs. Our dog was in heaven being able to run around and come back to us as if 'this is crazy...I can go anywhere I want and I won't get lost?"" We had the best time watching our dog get confused and snuggle up to strangers only to find out it's not us. Everyone seems to love dogs on this hike so she was petting and hugged a lot. We managed to keep up with her with a lot of heavy breathing and cardio exercise up and down the hill.Views are spectacular but where are there not good view in LA? Every hike I've been on in LA has just the best views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anamika
50,Very surprising,"Difficult to find a parking spot close to the entrance of the park, but when finally in ... the climb starts!!! Whatever direction you take ... it goes up hill. The park is very popular to locals. Lots of dogs, accompanied by their bosses. We enjoyed the walk taking the road up hill. When finally at the top you may choose for other trails as well. We choose to stay on top and walk back from the hill top by the very steep stairs. The overview is great (including the HOLLYWOOD-sign). If the smog isn't to heavy you even can see the islands across.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hans750
20,Giant Pet Relief Area,"Not sure why its so popular. It felt like I was hiking a giant mound of construction dirt filled with dog poop every few steps. So many people take their dogs here on their hike but do not clean up after them. I spent more time looking out for dog poop rather than enjoying the view.Difficulty of the hike? None at all, and I'm not an avid hiker by all means.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bonztx
40,Excellent way to get away from the busy city and get amongst some nature,We came here straight off a long distance flight (14 hours from Australia) to help work through the jet lag. It's reasonably easy to find and easy to walk (i.e well marked) but a somewhat testing walk down and back up some reasonably steep slopes. You need to be reasonably fit and wear good shoes. But there are some great views of the city and the Hollywood houses nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Craig_Tapper
40,THE ULTIMATE WORK OUT,"This infamous trail is a must do and is a must do for locals and travelers alike. I find it best with a buddy and gossiping the whole way up. Bring a hat, water, even a snack. The view is obviously the cherry on top of a great workout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VermontAve90027
50,Easy place to see all the city!,Great workout with the rest of the city and their pups. Even celebrities can be seen!Views around each turn!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wandering_Soul1969
50,"Great views, great place to walk, hike or jog","If you are driving here and leaving your car I recommend the North entrance as there is a small parking lot here. It is located where Mulholland Drive and Pyramid Place intersect, it runs down alongside Desmond Estates Rd. It is often full (it only holds around 20 cars) but if you patiently wait at the entrance someone will probably arrive and drive away within a few minutes. There is quite a frequent turnover of cars here. There appear be some parking areas at the very top of Mulholland drive where Pyramid place starts but there is a sign saying no parking or you may be towed away so I wouldn't risk it, although you do see some cars parked here just off the side of the road! There are two entrances at the South side of the park on N. Fuller Ave and Runyon Canyon Rd but the parking here looks very restricted.There are many paths to take from the North entrance, either along the paved Runyon Canyon Rd or into the heart of the park itself along mostly dirt paths. There are certain areas where dogs have to be on a leash but most I saw were off leash, but well behaved - mostly! There are many vista points, some have benches where you can sit as people exercise on them and inbetween there are many paths through the canyon. Some are easy, some are harder and one of the peaks requires a bit of a scramble but it is worth it for the views up there. If you're lucky you might even see someone famous too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sge31
50,Views.,I love Runyon Canyon.It's a great place to walk or run. Its a great place to get away from the busy city. It's a gem within LA.It's a great place to unwind. And the views of the city are incredible.In the hot weather it's a great place to catch some rays too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophiej252
50,Great place to exercise,"Great place to walk by yourself or with friends, great views midway and at the top. Parking is always a little difficult though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler4052016
50,People are always smiling on the hike here,I took the dog loop. Just watch out because people have their dogs off the leash.Great view and a great spot to get away from Hollywood. Easy to find street parking if you are patient.It would be nice to see volunteer groups out everyday picking up trash. It is crazy people liter so much in LA. Growing up in S. Cali in the 70's that was a huge no no. Fines were actually given.Peaceful city hikes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S-Badventures
40,Jogging trails,We walked a bit on the jogging trails while on a Hollywood tour. Super close to all the stars' homes!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyB_Htown
50,Nice Hike,We stumbled across Runyon Canyon Park cos we hired an Airbnb on Franklin Ave. Neither of us are walking fanatics but we decided to take a hike. Really happy that we did because it is stunning! Well worth the trip.Take plenty of water!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/855kerryc
50,Adventure,"Had a blast hiking throughout Runyon. Clocked over 3 miles ascending and descending. Will definitely return, we don't have views like this in Houston.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toewing
40,Nice option,"Runyon is good alternative to have to do a quick hike. Nothing too extreme, although there are several options that you can take and you can take your dog, which is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiges88
50,Best Urban Hike in the USA,Kick butt - this hike is hard but worth every step! Lots of Hollywood types and the views are outrageous!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/555billt
50,Great retreat from the city,This is a great walk with nice views - I walked / sweated off a hangover up here. Take water as it's a bit of a climb! Good views of Hollywood Bowl and Hollywood sign / Mulholland- lots of people take dogs up there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carl0s_m_x
50,Amazing views,"Spent a few days in LA and our friend recommended to visit the park. We decided to take an Uber to Mulholland drive and walk up which literally takes 5 min to the top. We managed to catch the sunset and that was INCREDIBLE. Amazing views, like you have to see it to believe it. It was getting dark and we still thought it was a good idea to walk all the way down to Hollywood boulevard and I'm so glad we did it. The walk is very enjoyable and there are always heaps of people running and walking. I highly recommend to one watch the sunset and two walk all the way to Hollywood boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmalinayi
50,Little piece of calm in Hollywood,Walking up here you wouldn't know you were so close to the hustle of Hollywood Boulevard. Definitely worth the effort as the views are awesome.Note on the Hollywood sign...you can see it from here but its mostly through metal fencing. You get a better unobstructed view from the Mt Hollywood trail from griffith observatory car park (see my other review of the Hollywood sign),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatalieL357
50,An Inner City Escape,"This amazing taste of what the land looked like pre-Hollywood glam is something everyone has to do - more than once if you have the time! It's easy to navigate with most sections being paved and the well trodden gravel paths, while a bit slippery in parts on the way down, are wide enough and flat enough so you don't have to be a mountain hiking pro. No climbing sticks or ropes needed, this is a very family friendly walk. There are at least two routes (the most popular) which take you up onto ridges that from the bottom you think you'd only dream of getting up. The reward is not only personal achievement but the brilliant 360 degree views of Los Angeles.Grab your sneakers, your dog and some friends and go get 'em!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeronicaTheNomad
40,Great hike,I usually do the East Trail when I'm in LA. It's pretty steep & the steps part can be challenging but the views over the city make it worth it. They've fairly recently put in a road down which makes that part a lot easier (and a lot less hike-like if I'm honest) but the dirt climb up is still good fun. It's usually pretty popular so you do have to dodge a few but everyone is usually friendly and the majority won't cut you off or rush you. The people that run up and down it in full summer are incredible! The morning yoga classes are great too. Bring your water & your dog.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrancescaLW217
50,fit celeb spotting while you work out,"ok, i love Runyon. The worst thing about it is the parking. The scenery is gorgeous, the views amazing, as are the people that work out there. Great for a mellow hike or a good workout. go at your own speed. Lots of dogs which i love. make sure you look good as there are tons of hotties there. not good when its very hot. go early or late to avoid traffic and crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/834reggiec
50,Gorgeous hike,Wonderful hike and great views of the Hollywood hills.Not too strenuous and we set off early but be wary of rush hour traffic if you plan to leave before 7am and the drive up to Runyon canyon is steep,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikkistravelmap
50,"Great hike, great views",Not too difficult hike with great views! Would recommend :) If you're lucky you see some celebrities or Beverley Hills beauties walking their dogs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/961lanis
50,"Dog Heaven. Fantastic views. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!","This park is the largest dog park that I've ever encountered. Three trails climbed the canyon from base to peak. Each was a different difficulty; the easiest grade was wide and paved.Access to the park is available both at the base (off Franklin Ave.) and the top (off Mulholland Dr.). Dogs were allowed to roam free in most of the park. Fountains, serving people and dogs, were available at the base and top of the canyon. If you've brought your dog on a trip to L.A., you must visit this park.Visit even if you don't have a dog! This park was popular with the L.A. exercise crowd when I lived in L.A., and apparently still was when I visited town this time. If you'd like to hear ""L.A. conversations,"" it's easy to get that experience here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HughMcAloon
50,Lovely view of LA at sunset.,I really loved the walk up to Runyon Canyon to watch sunset. It's really beautiful up there and you get a great view of the LA skyline and you can see the Hollywood sign. I preferred this a lot more to the Griffiths observatory for the view. Although this is possibly because we went to the observatory in the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday and it was really busy whereas we went to Runyon Canyon on a Saturday evening at sunset.One thing worth noting is to make sure you remember and take note of the way that you came up as when we descended it was dark and there were a couple of times we weren't sure if we were going the right way (luckily we were).Parking is hard to find in this area and there are a lot of places that you can't park. Including the car park at the foot of the park. However it states that there is no parking during daylight hours. As it was almost sunset we risked it (as did a lot of other people) and it was fine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ciara19
50,"Amazing views of downtown LA, Hollywood Sign and Griffith Observatory","If you want some exercise while in LA this is the place to go if you like hiking and being outdoors. You are away from all the hustle and bustle of Hollywood. Its quiet and has amazing views.There is very little shade so bring plenty of water and sunscreen and morning is probably better than the midday sun.We hiked in the afternoon, parked off Fuller Drive at the top of the Hollywood Hills and spent a good hour walking some trails. There was plenty of people around so pretty busy.It's a shame that people threw their empty water bottles on the ground and didn't put them in a bin that was 5 metres away from where they were dumped! Lovely to see dog bowls around for our furry friends. A good place to walk your dog.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolep809
50,Sunrise on The City of Angels,Went for a couple of early morning runs in the park entranced via N Fuller Av water available at the gate with an honesty box just in case you forget went up the east trail which is runnable fantastic views from the top but last 200m very steep up wooden sleepers and can be slippy worth it for the sunrise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alansD6992LI
40,"Popular, But Excellent Views From Trails","This is kind of a popular hiking spot. A ""be seen"" at kind of place. There's a small dirt parking lot near the trailhead. Also certain spots along the street allow you to park. But make sure you read the signs carefully cause you will get a ticket. I came on a mid-afternoon during the week and was able to get a spot in the lot. The hike isn't really shaded so bring sunblock and obviously plenty of water. The real draw here are the views of downtown and the Hollywood sign. They really are pretty spectacular. The trails are maintained well. Signs warn of rattle snakes everywhere. I didn't cross paths with any. I'm guessing as long as you stay on the trails you'll be fine. Aside from the trendy aspect of it, it really is a nice way to spend some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms
50,One of the best hikes in the city.,"If you are seeking an active workout during your vacation, this is the place to be. Many locals / celebrities utilize this park daily. The path is well paved with 3-4 miles of trails that provides beautiful views of the city. Must do if you are an active person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fishking88
50,Awesome City View,"I hiked the east trail which did have very steep steps but overall not too difficult for me. I went around 5:30 pm on a Thursday the weather was perfect and not too crowded. Be aware there were several dogs on and off leashes. Wear comfortable shoes/sneakers, No flip flops. It's very dusty. There were several different points/views along the trail that you're able to sit and rest also if needed. The views of the city are awesome from here!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curiosity578716

40,A walk with the crowds,"Runyon Canyon was near our accommodation in LA so we decided to go for a walk. We started out about 9am Saturday and this was obviously a popular and busy time for the local people. As visitors, we were unsure of the trails and unfortunately there were no maps or guides posted to help. So we followed the crowds and hoped we were following good trails. During our 2 hour walk, we tried three different trails. These varied regarding terrain and condition. Some provided good views of LA and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryq848
50,Hike for the Views,Hiked the moderate trail to check runyon canyon off the bucket list. Went on a Sunday so parking was a challenge. Hike was more than challenging than I expected and it was a little hotter than expected. Definitely take plenty of water with you. Trails were well taken care of and plenty of people of all ages out. Lots and lots of dogs. Worth the hike to the top to see the views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/297NicolaS
50,Love that park - awesome views,"Love hiking that park. Can highly recommend that you park on the little parking side at the Mullholland entry of the park, much easier than finding a spot on Fuller. Your hike will bring you to amazing views of the city. We did it in three digit temps which was crazy and light headed of us, since there is hardly any shadow on the trails. If it is hot like that you will probably be covered in dust from the sandy trails. Wear shoes, not flip flops and bring lots of water. And do not bring pets when it is this hot. Saw too many gasping dogs, they can easily get a heatstroke - it happens so fast..... Last time I was here before I saw a French bulldog collapsing which was really horrible to watch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rennmaus111

The hike was easy for any age and gave you a great workout by the end.If you're looking to get out of the city, get some exercise and sunshine this is the place to go! It's an added bonus the view you get from the top sprawling the entire city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aliyb
30,Be careful of parking. Horrible if you are tourist.,Runyon Canyon is an excellent view of LA and the hollywood sign. But I had an bad experience here. The drive to runyon canyon your getting closer then you start seeing car parked along the side of the road as you get closer there is free parking in a vacant dirt zone but it was complete full and I cars parked along the side of the road but you have to READ THE SIGNS. The was a tow sign but it happen to be 2 signs and the cars are parked between those signs along the side of the road and if your outside of the those signs you will get hit with parking ticket like I did of 95 dollars or they will tow your car. Be very careful when coming when it comes to parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevind473
50,Enjoyable Hike,"Easy to get to, just have to decide where to set off from once hiking. The trails are well marked, and most are moderately strenuous at most. It is occasionally slippy when going off the trail and downhill.Beautiful views throughout the climb, especially at the top, which I'm pretty sure is the exact same view you see emblazoned on Dr Dre's last album cover, Compton. I could be wrong, and might be. Nevertheless the views are nothing if not captivating and you can keep discovering new vistas and viewpoints as you explore.Finally, it connects perfectly and you must if you have the time walk over to the Griffith Observatory.Also if you drove up, make sure you follow the slightly confusing for us brits signage. We almost got it catastrophically wrong, and thankfully arrived as the zealous parking authority began to tow the vehicle behind. Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/917partham
50,Almost died on this hike. I survived though!,"Almost died on this hike. I survived though! Barely. Our friend took us up the harder of the two paths at Runyon and we were all decked out in our cutest hiking gear. Quickly realized I looked like a fool in said cute workout outfit when I ended up having to crawl on all fours up the side of a mountain at times and also pause on at least one occasion to avoid puking. I'm out of shape, what can I say? Parts of the path we took are extremely steep and I wouldn't describe the route we took as particularly good for very novice hikers or people who are unsure of their footing or people who are very out shape. I had to stop multiple times and at one point I was even a little light headed (I brought a normal sized bottle of water with me but you'd probably want to bring a LARGE bottle if you can manage it). I loudly cursed at my friend who told us we'd be fine on this route. It's ok we're still friends :) Everything is very dusty so don't bring cute/clean or nice tennis shoes-- bring the ones you don't mind getting covered in dust. LOTS OF DUST. I was covered from my knees down by the end of the hike. Also, don't forget sunscreen. Seems like a no-brainer however there was a cool breeze the day we went up so the lack of heat made me forget the SPF and i got fried. So you might be wondering why I gave Runyon 5/5 if I almost passed out, got horrible sun burn and was covered in dust..... well, it was actually fun when it was all said and done. Don't get me wrong, the way up was hard for me and I didn't really enjoy it. However, once you get to the top you have the most beautiful and scenic panoramic view of LA and it's skyline and it's just gorgeous. We saw the Hollywood sign from afar and so many multi-million dollar mansions in the surrounding hills. We did not go down the way we came up, instead we took the unpaved easier route back. That was great cause I got to regain composure and also take in the stunning views and pose for lots of corny touristy pictures with my friends. When we got to the bottom we were saying how we would have loved to do it again the next day if our plans had allowed for it. I definitely recommend going for a hike at Runyon but like i said: don't go in thinking it'll be a piece of cake, wear grungy sneakers and lots of water and SPF and a camera phone!!! You'll have a blast if you're with friends who will save you from sliding off the edge when you're about to pass out :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjs07f
30,Awful parking but great hike,"It took forever for us to find parking and when we did, it was a biyatch trying to get in the spot. Somebody needs to invest in a parking structure in this area. I would've paid to get a spot. It's a nice hike which didn't take too long with very nice views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ango4
50,Great park in Hollywood,Runyon Canyon is one of the best activity in Hollywood! It is free and it offers breathtaking views of LA. You can enter from the top where celebrities live (Mulholland drive) or from the bottom (Fuller Ave.) . Parking space is difficult to find at certain time but it is 100% worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/571andreea
50,A Great Trail for Beginner Hikers and Pups!,"What a wonderful little gem L.A. has to offer.The best part about this hike is the off-leash climb and its dog-friendly atmosphere. It's hard finding a place that I can enjoy with my pooch, so I really enjoyed the fact that I could have my dog as well as other dogs explore the trail with me instead of simply by my side. Biggest downside of this--the park, especially the front end of it, reeks of piss.The smell aside, I love how there is a ""set peak"" that majority of Runyon's visitors are trying to reach. The peak seems to put you above the smoggy L.A. ground, even for just a moment. Having that goal while trekking up makes the walk/jog/hike even more worthwhile.Still haven't explored the little crevices and off routes that Runyon has to offer, but I'm excited to go back yet again and give those hidden routes a shot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hellomav
50,Great drive and views,Drive up the famous Mulholland Drive (where you can try to find celebrity houses if you're into that kind of thing). Runyan Canyon Park has a good trail that ends in some great city views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/114sama
50,nice park with great city views,"This park can be accessed via Mulholland drive. If you are there anyways, make a stop and enjoy nice city views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christy212121
50,Scene with a view,This a very popular local LA exercise hike/workout location. I enjoyed people watching as much as I enjoyed the view from the top. I recommend staying on the wide path for incline and decent. Some of the smaller paths were very steep and had loose gravel.Wear sneakers or hiking sandals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/warrenjaco
40,Best incline,"While some criticize runyon canyon because a lot of tourists like to check out the trails and it becomes more populated, the hikes are actually pretty great. The incline is tough and a great workout, not to mention the beautiful views. I do have to say be cautious of snakes, I have seen a few already. It is something you can do with friends, family or even alone. Views of LA and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/east0ne
50,A Good Butt Workout,"This was at one time Earl Flines estate (played Robin Hood during the silver screen area). There are a few trails here to try, but if want to work off your butt muscles, stay to the trail on your right side (if your coming in from Fuller Street) and walk/run a steep hill with other beautiful people and their dogs. No shade here, just dry brush, rocks and dirt... bring your hiking boots or good walking shoes, water and sun screen or hat when you do this trail/s. The parking is free, but not good, you have to park in the neighborhood or find parking wherever you can and walk to the entrance at Fuller Ave... there is another entrance, but I have not used this entrance from another neighborhood street. Enjoy this landmark and look your best as many people who do this trail regularly are in the best of shape and they know it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgonez
50,A Vigorous Climb to Great Views,"My daughter and I took an Uber to the start of the path. We went early in the morning (8am) on a weekday to avoid the crowds. There were some people, but not too busy. We headed up the East path which has some fantastic views. Some parts were a bit vigorous despite the fact that I am in shape. Very manageable, but expect to do some sweating in August, even early in the morning. There are several look out points that mean you better bring your camera! We continued on to the top where there is a residential neighborhood and then called an Uber to pick us up. I got such a kick out of calling an Uber and within 5 minutes they were there to pick us up. The guy even offered us a cold bottle of water! We were staying at a hotel in Hollywood and the whole take an Uber to Runyon Canyon worked out great. You will want to allow plenty of time to stop for pictures or to sit on a bench and just enjoy life. This is a definite must for any visitor to LA who enjoys hiking and getting outdoors for a needed bit of nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donna224488

40,Great views,"Nice walk up the hill, with stunning views of sprawling LA from the top. Interesting to see Californian vegetation, outside the concrete expanse of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/08Pab
50,Great place to hike. But bit crowded,"Went there the last weekend before it closed for maintenance. The hike is more challenging than that of Griffith for sure. You will have to be in better shape. Lots of people were there with there fogs and lots of shirtless dudes. Don't be surprised if you find yourself staring. I had to make a conscious effort not to. Great for people watching, and a great work out. Oh, and the views are also great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maybelater15
30,Great hiking... Terrible parking,The hike is great as long as it is not too hot outside. The hard part is finding parking. I like to park a couple blocks away and hike up to the trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matiasstof
20,basic hike too many tmz tourists,basic trail. good workout. but the hype is that celebrities come here. they dont. they used to but when word got out...its wanna be actors/actresses jibbering about auditions and tacky tourists hoping to see someone and ppl from the burbs who may as well be tourists.used to be great to bring your dog but too many dummies do not pick up after their animals so it ruins it for dog owner and all the others as well.better hikes elsewhere if doing it for exercise. scenery of city is nice if clear.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyW234
50,Nice views,Very good for a hike/walk/run but on a hot day it's a bit intense so be prepared if you're not into heat while trekking up a hill! It was relatively easy to find parking on the street and it was a great view once your start making your way up the hill! Worth a visit :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doniah926
30,An OK city hike.,"Meh, this place is ok. We usually hike in the mountains so compared to that, the views are REALLY meh. But this place is good if your intention is to have a quick & easy work out. LOTS of people considering this is in the middle of a big city. Probably not a good area to come if you do not like dogs since there are many off leash dogs on this trail. No designated parking area for this park, so you will have to fight for street parking....and this is NOT easy in this area. This is a very easy hike so everyone should be able to enjoy. If you want solitude though, this place is by far the last place you want to be. But hey, it's a casual city hike. What can you expect. :P",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jiro_Shiba
40,Crowded but an LA Favorite,"Runyon is a local favorite spot. The views are lovely - similar to Griffith, they're right across the freeway from each other, basically. It gets crowded and parking is rough. There's a paved road side of it and a trail side of it. Some people don't like the trails there because they're a little steep. Sometimes there are celebrities there. There are multiple entrances, also. Hollywood side and Mulholland Drive side.Overall, it's a nice hike, less naturey than others around but nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kateoS8832HT
50,"Great views, people watching, exercise!",Wonderful spot to get some exercise and to people watch! Great nature escape from all the craziness in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethp938
50,Great place for hiking,"Runyon is a great hike with different trails. Amazing views of LA and Hollywood sign.Pets are allowed so you will be on the trail with them.Parking can be a challenge, and read the signs for street sweeping or you will get aTicket.Overall it's a great workout. I have seen a few celebrities too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/722Lola88
50,GREAT walk/hike but hilly so be prepared. Amazing LA views!,This was a great hike for our family. We parked on Mulholland Drive entrance and walked down the path for a mile. I recommend going early because there is no shade and can get hot. Lots of people walking/running and lots of dogs. Great wholesome family expedition. Bring water and wear sneakers because its hilly and hot. Can go as little or far as you need. Offers amazing views of LA. A MUST visit when in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaimelovebug

50,Great place for an escape from the city for a hike,"This is a great hike from Studio City into Hollywood. If you start in Studio City you will go down the mountain, and then will have to walk back up. Don't do it mid-day when it is hot outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amykowal
40,Really nice hike,"Bring your pet, parking van be challenging, as can too many people, but this hike is a really good amount of workout. And the view at the top is gorgeous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Webisan
50,Forget Hollywood Blvd... the place to see the stars!,"Let’s face it, many come to LA, and especially Hollywood to see “the Stars”. But, you’ll not find them on Hollywood Blvd., or putting their feet and hands in cement at the Grauman's Chinese Theater, or even eating at many of the iconic Restaurants. No, now-a-days, most like to stay home, or move around up in our magnificent hill trails and parks. Funny, how so many people, when they think of Los Angeles, think of a flat crowded “Disneyland”, filled with those iconic Studio arch-way entrances. But actually a big portion of the city and county are surrounded by hills on three sides!If you want to see “stars”, both TV, movies, rock, fashion, reality-show, celebrities, DJ’s, sports figures, etc., etc., the best are going to the places where they are walking their dogs, at some of the “dog trails”. The two most popular being one above Griffith Park Observatory, and perhaps the best: Runyon Canyon, right above the heart of Hollywood. This is 160 acres of trails, outcroppings, parks and fields. And it’s one of the most popular places for the “rich and famous” to get take their dogs out, especially early in the morning for a brisk walk above the city that they have conquered! It may not be easy to recognize them at first, since this is one of the only places that they will come out of the house, au natural… without makeup, or hair done… wearing the most un-fashionable sweats, t-shirts, hoodies, baseball caps, and shoes. And, for reasons that only the Gods of Showbiz know… for the most part, the paparazzi leave them alone up there.The park has amazing views of Hollywood and beyond, and not only are dogs welcome to walk the trails, but there are even some leash-free fenced in sections. So you can also find the beautiful people sitting on benches as their dogs intermingle with the masses. Of, of course just regular LA folk will be up there as well, since not everyone in Los Angeles is a celebrity. I’ve found that everyone, celebrity and “common folk” alike are especially open and friendly up there. You can actually carry on a conversation. And many keep their iPhone in their cars or pockets, and wonderfully there are areas up there where the reception isn’t very good, so people are forced to related to each other, one on one without a text, a twitter or an emoticon!One note of “heads-up”… at the moment of this review the City is doing some substantial work up on the trail, both replacing underground pipes, and redoing sections of the trail itself, so as of April 2016, the trail (except for the Yoga park… yes, they offer free Yoga up there!) is closed, and is supposed to be closed until at least the end of summer 2016. So easy to go online and see when it reopens,.When it does open, parking is also free and plentiful (which is not the case at the Griffith Park Observatory and trails… it’s free there but fills up almost immediately)… and is open (they have entrance gates that do lock at closing) from sunup to sunset… so from about six AM to six PM every day.Oh, just don’t ask for autographs, or ask for selfies!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heywoodf307
50,Live like a champ!,"This is the first mountain that I have ever climbed and I could not be prouder. It isn't the easiest to park and you need to carry at least 1 bottle of water but, you can climb an urban mountain!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610katherined
50,Morning hike,Start early to beat the crowds and the heat. Were hiking shoes instead of running shoes. Bring water and a camera. Both are great to have.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tlwilson11218
50,Wonderful Views of LA,"If you are looking to escape the hustle and bustle of crazy LA then head up to Runyon Canyon. There are many different trails you can take depending on how far you want to hike. Parking is horrendous, we had to park on the side of a road and we were lucky not to get a parking ticket. Great place for celeb spotting and dog-walking and a great place for a little calm. I loved it!! The Blonde B blogs",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharbeanBurt
50,Good trails,great view of LA and pretty people running and exercising every day. You can't get lost there because there are many people there. Just bring water so you don't dehydrate. Parking can be a problem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b0gardc
50,Great Place for Hill Walking & Running,"If you like walking and/or running hills, Runyon Canyon is a great place to do it. The trails are (mostly) wide, and there are many of them, with some offering wild 180-degree views from Downtown LA to the Pacific to Beverly Hills to Century City. Weekday mornings are best if you prefer solitude. Or, if seeing sweaty celebs is more your thing, then by all means, hit it on a Saturday or Sunday morning. (Note that if you run with a dog, Runyon is off-leash, so prepare for some quality canine social time).My favorite trail is Western High Way (the western-most trail), because it is varied in terrain, with some very steep climbs, plus a couple of nice rock and hardpack scrambles, and it is less crowded than the main trails. To access it, run up N. Vista St. to the top (which is a grueling ascent from Hollywood Blvd), enter Runyon park, pass through the main gate, then take the first hairpin path entrance on the left from the main trail.If you really want solitude, also try the Trebek Open Space, which is just northwest of Runyon. You can access it by running up Curson (a nice street hill by itself) until it hairpins to the left, turning into Wattles Drive, then just keep following that. (You'll come to a metal gate that will be unlocked -- push through the human-sized door and keep on going). You'll find fire trails galore. My favorite trail requires a scramble up to the right (about 200 feet after you first hit dirt), after which you'll be treated to some of the best views of L.A. anywhere... To find it, Google Trebek Open Space, and look for the fire trail that joins up with the paved Astral Drive. Happy running!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScotchWichmann

40,Sunday was great day for hike.,"We are naive visitors from New Zealand. We do not have snakes in NZ. Near the top of the Canyon you could come across rattle snakes. We saw none, only squirrels.We went right to top and was very easy terrain especially as it is paved. Does not take too long but please take heaps of water on a hot day. Suck in the view & can take photos with Hollywood sign in distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bart_thompson
40,ROUGH & FUN,My first time visiting this park and I didn't think I would make it! So glad I went! It was an amazing experience. Great workout. It's really good if you go with family or friends to get your work out on. Be sure to take water and sunscreen. You will definitely sweat and get a tan if you go during the summer. We went early morning 5:30 A.M. I believe. We finished before it got to hot. It was great.I would definitely go back again!Tips:Bring waterWear shoes with good tractionStay hydratedGo early in the morning (you will find parking and beat the heat)Enjoy and happy hiking!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsTia79

40,Fun hike,A great way to get out of the city without getting out of the city. This is a busy trail but the views are worth it. There is street parking but it will take a while to find one ... make sure you brush up on your parallel parking skills 🙂 Also highly recommend going clockwise on this trail (start on left).

50,Excellent LA Hike,"Runyon is one of my favorite LA hikes because the views are nice, people watching is great, and it's a good workout. It's mostly direct sunlight, so best to go early am or evening. The route off of Fuller is pretty challenging because it has a steep section, but one can easily avoid that by starting on the route closer to vista. In a clear day, the ocean is visible. Also a great place to walk dogs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaureenRiley44

Once you enter, figure on about one hour round trip -- plus parking, with 20 minutes of semi-serious cardio about 10 minutes into it (the stairs stretch to the top). Also, there's the possibility of star-gazing, if you're into that. Usually see at least one celeb I recognize, esp on weekends.

50,Great thing to do in LA,I love visiting Runyon Canyon whilst in LA. It's definitely an experience to do whilst you're away to go on a massive hike where you can see the Hollywood sign and other landmarks in LA. It's definitely a must do if you want a local experience but also to get away from the touristy things once in a while. It's not too strenuous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILVNY

There are 2 main mountain trails to climb one not so bad and one pretty difficult ( at the top peak you are basically hanging off the edge to get back down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! cannot believe they allow that ).

50,Great City Hiking Opportunity!!!,"This has been on my fitness bucket list for years and I finally made it. What a great hike! Entered the park at the Fuller entrance, parking down a side street off Fuller. The climb from the side street up to Fuller into the park was from one large hill to another and a workout in and of itself. The gates were inviting and reminiscent of the mansion that previously stood on this historic property. The earlier the better for a hike - we arrived at about 730a. There were definitely a decent number of folks on the trail, but I wouldn't call it overwhelmingly busy. Lots of dogs as well, but they were more interested in their counterparts than looking for human attention. Saw people of all abilities on the trail - from runners to the elderly (in good shape). It was of moderate difficulty on the trail (off to the left after getting into the main gate, past the fenced in area on the left), but it was a steady uphill grade, about one mile. The more steep and difficult climb is the main path with its on a large hill that you'll see as soon as you hit the park (with the infamous steps that Runyon is known for). We decided to trek back the way we cane since we were told it was very steep up and down - however, there were multiple people running this route. This trail also has a nice vista at a lower point if you're looking for a shorter, easier hike, but IMO, it's worthwhile to go straight to the top on the steady uphill trail (slightly steep when you near the summit).So glad we got to go up before the park closed. Speaking to a local resident who has done the hike up daily with her dog for the past 20yrs, she stated that the park will be closed for 3 months to fix piping beneath the concrete paths. Get there before the closing time in April!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theOneiricTraveler

30,Dog-friendly hiking spot in the midst of Hollywood,"Pretty vistas and a fairly non-punishing hike. It's about 25 minutes uphill, 10 or 15 down. Much of the path used to be paved, so it's easy to walk on. It is crowded - not packed, but you're certainly not going to have any privacy. Certain areas allow dogs to be let off their leashes. It was a cloudy day, but the views are still pretty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCtravelbug12
50,Great little getaway in a big city..,"Been coming here for years , great vistas and great people.For an easier start to the trails continue past the entrance gate and head straight for 300 yards until you see the trail to the right start heading uphill.Views of the Hollywood sign to follow.If you want to start at a more challenging pace once thru the entrance take the trail 50 yards in to your left. There is a small steep portion that requires one to get low and slow and is most easily navigated going uphill from the trailhead that begins to the right.The terrain is rocky and at times slippery, trainer's , tennis shoes are not optimal.Parking: Good luck ! 101 Frwy Highland exit , North on Franklin until you see the throngs of people, see a spot , grab it. Do Not inpede a driveway or park in any questionable manner, the dozen or so Parking Officials will be happy to write you a friendly reminder to not do so again ;)Insider tip: We always finish our day with amazing food at Aroma Cafe on Sunset Blvd. If you are polite and explain that you are ""running and errand,doing business in the neighborhood, be back in a few"" AND will return for a delicious meal soon AND show your reciept for said meal you may be able to Valet park in a safe and easily accesible local to the park.The Park will be closed for the Summer , yay Snakes ! Department of Water and Power wil be replacing some aging water pipes so get out while you can and Griffith park is a great alternative this Summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/459jamesp459
40,"Great Hike in Hollywood, a little crowded","This is definitely the most popular hiking trail in all of Los Angeles. Families to aspiring models litter the paths. Quite a high level of dog traffic as well. If the occasional pile of excrement doesn't bother you, you'll love this place. Top tier people watching while working out. Better than the gym.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drew_Drucker
50,On the top of LA,"We loved this hike. We took our 6-month-old daughter and most of the trail, you can climb with a stroller, there is a beautiful, steep climb that must be breathtaking, but we couldn't do it with the baby. It can be really difficult to find parking, we had luck. If you like nature and have a bit of time, don't miss this park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melindam84

50,Great Place for dogs and nature lovers!,"My dogs love this park! The hike is easy, the people watching is fun as you sometimes see celebrities. It's a great place to take the kids too so you can have family time surrounded by nature and it tires them out! Only the complaint is that the parking is terrible - very little so better to go when it isn't so crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eileenandmarkk

50,Runyon,It is so close to the city with lots of So Cal nature and amazing views of the entire city. It can be a bit crowded so I recommend the harder hike if you're up for it. It's the trail to the far left. As you come up the pavement after the fencing take another left. Mush harder route but far less people. Enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayla044

50,Great hike,"My husband and I loved hiking Runyon Canyon! It was a great way to spend the morning/early afternoon. The trails are pretty clean and easy to follow.If you love dogs, this is a great place to meet them. We made a whole bunch of furry new friends every time we sat on the benches.Bring water! There is no where to get any in the trail, and use the bathroom before you head out onto the trails. Also, bring your camera! The views are incredible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/200ashleys
50,Great hike and great views,"Took about an hour and a half to hike the largest, more difficult loop including some stops for pictures. The counterclockwise direction was straight up when you first get onto the trail and when you are almost finished it is straight down. I think the clockwise direction would be wiser as there are more foot holds in what would be the end of the trail going down than when you go down at the end on the counterclockwise hike.All in all a great morning hike with lots of dogs (heads up if you are afraid of them, it is an off-leash park)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/877alic
50,Beautiful views,Be prepared to spend at least 2 hrs. If you want to experience all views of the city. If you have a dog it is a great place to take them without a leash. You can also see a great view of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyV_11
40,People and mansion watching while working out,"Great place for a run uphill and for observing the local life. A great way to feel integrated into the L.A. way of life, with great views of mansions of all sorts around the hills. Great fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esthero1
40,Great hiking spot overlooking LA,"We made the windy drive up Mullholland Drive to Runyon Canyon during or recent visit to LA. There is a small parking area at the entrance to the park and we lucked out to get a spot when some other hikers were leaving. Be careful parking in the no parking areas on the main roads. Parking enforcement was busy writing tickets outside this popular trail.The trail starts out on the private (gated) road and winds around the hillside. We chose to hike up the gravel/dirt trail and were rewarded with gorgeous, panoramic views of the city. There were lots of other hikers enjoying the gorgeous weather and numerous people brought their dogs. We heard what seemed to be a rattler off the side of the trail at one point and kept going. We didn't come across any other wildlife except for the hawks and smaller birds soaring in the sky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mojo_Sailor
50,Fabulous urban local hike,"Take the short loop or the challenge loop (climb higher, longer and be fitter for it). Runyon is a wonderful example of how lovely a local hike can be. You'll see locals! Lots of them! Dog walkers, LA socialites, Ben Stiller might run by you, but the real reward, as you climb from the flats to Mulholland Drive, are the views of the city from the top. On a clear day you can see from far east of downtown all the way out to the Pacific and beyond.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unprocessed_cook
50,Great hiking place,"I go there often as i am living 20' walk from the entrance. Great place to hike. In particular the west trail, coming down with the east trail. Count 2h without stopping too much. Many people on week end, go early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arielmomo
40,Nice view of the city coupled with an excellent workout! Dogs EVERYWHERE,"Runyon is an excellent way to work off all the delicious food you'll eat while in LA. You get an excellent view of LA, while also experiencing the (little bit of) nature the city has to offer. For dog lovers - this is a great spot! You can let your dog off leash and enjoy a hike, while seeing all the cute pups!It might be a little smelly as you first walk up (due to all the dogs). But, the smell quickly fades as you hike higher into the fresh air!NOTE - this is the location of the original Hollywood sign. During your hike you can still see some of the metal structure that held up the sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilya691

40,The earlier the better...,A nice place to walk-hike with great views and an interesting drive. Arrive early or else there may not be parking. I would recommend real athletic shoes; I had more casual sneakers on and wished I wore something more substantial. I also regretted bringing my coffee with me as I felt I needed my hands free more than once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurengineered
30,Steep,"This place is popular here, so parking is a challenge. You can take a picture of HOLYWOOD sign or this sign as your background.You can see a lot of Hollywood if not polluted. I think it’s popular, because there is no other park around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/k0za
50,Fun Hike!,"It was our first time in LA and we've heard about Runyon, so it was on our list of things to do. We didn't do the full hike- only one of the routes (not sure which one) but we got to the top and the views were out of this world!!!!! We we hoping to maybe spot a celeb, but we didn't. Bring a water bottle and good shoes! Parking can be tough we were lucky enough to find a spot. I highly recommend this hike, it has the best views of LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niicolestravels
40,Easy or challenging course,"A really nice change of pace in LA. We had a beautiful walk up the canyon, there are a couple of ways about it so you can make your walk longer or shorter. A lot of dog walkers, so if you don't like dogs this might not be for you. Great views of the city, houses and Hollywood sign too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B267GJjenniferm
50,Amazing Views,This place is amazing but not for the faint of heart. wear real good hiking boots-we stopped as a curiosity on our drive along the pacific coast highway and were not dressed appropriately so our time there was limited-what we did see however was spectacular-next trip to the West Coast will definitely include this park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brooker813
40,"Took the wrong trail, no big deal!","Easy to get to, no parking if you're wondering. We stayed at a nearby hotel and walked there. There are so many trails....we had no clue where to go. We took a super easy hike up, and ended up going down the steep trail. Wish we did it the other way around. Next time we will know. The views are awesome! So many people were hiking...it is definitely a popular area. No celebs, though :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfedele85
50,A great place for a hike,"I love Runyon Canyon. It's a great place to get away from the concrete jungle of the rest of Los Angeles and get out into nature. It's a good workout and the views at the top are spectacular. It's crowded, but that's part of the fun honestly, as the people watching can be pretty great. Parking can sometimes be difficult, but it's worth it to battle for a spot because you'll be rewarded with a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heatherh0p

40,Excellent views,"This is a great walk. Keep your eye out for celebrities, I didn't see any but it's a number one location for spotting celebrities. Amazing view and surrounded by amazing houses. This is true Hollywood.There are two gates, one down in Hollywood and one from mulholland drive. The latter is the best entrance. The best part of this walk is that you can make it as long or as short as you want.It can be as difficult or as easy as you want.You won't believe the view, it's amazing. You can see the Hollywood sign and views of downtown LA.If you don't have a car, it's only a cheap uber ride up here.It's perfectly safe, lots of people around during the peak of the day time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ero40

The many people---from models, and wannabemodels to top trainers and everyday folk from all around the globe. And the great views---hollywood sign, emerging population of love locks, the Pacific Ocean, DTLA and more on a clear day. Come back cause it's iconic Hollywood ""wild-ness,"" you'll get a decent workout if you keep a good pace and it's fun.

40,Nice hike with options,This Can be as easy or as hard as you like. Lots of well behaved dogs off-leash on the day I went. Limited parking on N Fuller but we walked from our hotel on Franklin. A good way to stretch the legs before a long flight home. I imagine it would be quite hot and sticky in summer and timing would be important. Nice views and a good change from the boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingBeeBrunei

40,Hard work on a hot day,This was one of the first things we did in LA as we wanted the famous Hollywood sign pictures. The walk is hardwork and hilly so be prepared and take water with you. on a hot day as it was when we went it was hardwork walking up and to get the top it did take us around an hour or so- although we were stopping to take pictures of the skyline and sign. the walk down was a lot easier!the views at the top are worth it of the city and then of course the hollywood sign. Just be prepared for the walk and the hills! wear comfy shoes/trainers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natalienikita28

50,Best way to start the weekend in LA; Good people watching,"The classic west hollywood weekend morning is to crawl out of bed and hike up runyon canyon. The walk has a short (keep right as you enter the canyon), medium and long version, with the short being about 50 mins if you are fit, but not trying hard. The medium and long versions can be added to the short at the half way mark easily (this is obvious once you get to the decision point). The views of LA are great.Parking is a bit of a pain on nice days, so taking an UBER is a good option.At the Fuller St entrance there is always a cart which supplies a bottle of water for $1, which is necessary on most mornings.After the hike, it's a downhill walk to lots of good breakfast options on Sunset/Santa Monica/Melrose.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAOXON
40,"A Great Workout, Especially with Your Dog","This is a great hiking spot, in the middle of Hollywood. Bring your dog, as they will love it more than you.The only negative is parking is hard to find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349darrylh
50,Fun hike with great views,"Runyon Canyon is a nice hike right by Los Angeles. There are several points that give you wonderful views of the city and the main trail is wide and clear. There are a few different loops varying in length and difficulty, but there are always people there willing to tell you which path to take. The only downside to Runyon Canyon is parking; there is none. Or very little at least. You may have to begin your hike a few blocks away just to get to the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gaf1717

50,Awesome Hike!,My family and I went for a hike here. It was an beautiful day to watch the beautiful people. It seems like everyone in LA is fit. What a great experience to look out and see the view from the top. Okay well almost the top. You have to go walking or running in this Park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stacye2016
50,Beautiful views of the city!,"A wonderful place for a strenuous hike. There are various loops in the trail so you can choose a shorter, easier trail or the longer, more rugged loops. Be sure to wear good hiking shoes and take water along. The higher parts of the trail are treacherous and require climbing over rough rocky areas. There are wonderful views of the city from various angles, especially beautiful at sunset. It's not a problem if you don't get down from the trail before dark; the glow of the lights from the city provides enough light to make the lower trail safe for walking. Many hikers were still on the trail after dark on Christmas Eve when I was there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manddymill
30,One beautiful view from here,This was a fun hike for the family. Spectacular views from the upperparts of the hill. The one thing that was odd was how many of the locals walk their dogs here and let them run loose without a lease. I worried a bit about my grandkids who wanted to pet every loose dog.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/766donalds
50,Beautiful,"Really enjoyed coming here with a friend and my 3 month old. We hiked up to a beautiful view. I did have my baby in her stroller and had no problems.

Other then that, beautiful place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoniAnnette
50,My favorite hike,My favorite place to go hiking. We go 3 - 4 times a week in the mornings. I was at 200 lbs last year and just by hiking here i have lost 10 lbs.

Remember to not leave anything valuable in the car....last week there were 5 break ins.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/80pranavm
40,My friend tried to kill me,"So I am not in the best shape. Used to live in SoCal and mountain bike pretty often. While visiting a friend in Hollywood over the summer he suggested we go for a hike in Runyon. Said is is nice and not too far away.I didnt pack any shoes for hiking so I borrowed some of his. I wear a size 12, he is size 10. It was going to be rough. We arrived and were lucky enough to find a spot. We started out down the hill and things were great. It was mid morning and the sun was up and already getting pretty warm. The views of the city were nice albeit the smog was there as usual. After a rain the view is probably great but the dirt trail I would imagine is awful. The trek down wasnt too bad. We saw plenty of people and some with dogs. Was a nice time.eThen we got to the bottom. The car might as well have been parked at the top of Mt Everest for all I cared. The hike back up was on a different trail. I ran out of my water 1/3 back up. I had a full liter. The sun was getting super hot now, a tree or a shrub here or there was the only shade.The ascent was grueling and even my friend who is in way better shape had a few rough moments. We finally made it back up and stopped at the water fountain where we filled our bottles with the freshest most lukewarm metallic tasting water around. Ahh!Covered in sweat and trail dust we made out alive, and proceeded to make a mess of his new car. It was his decision. In the end after all the griping and complaining... a day with some exercise is always a good idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998drewb

40,Great views and beautiful people!,"If you are into beautiful people watching while getting some exercise, Runyan Canyon is a must see. The park itself is not very well maintained.....it's more of a natural experience. The pathways are unpaved in parts and the smaller walkways are mere dirt paths. But you will not find a better people watching park anywhere and because of the steep assent, the visitors tend to be people in great shape. Lots of 10's minimally dressed walking their dogs or hoping to spot a celebrity. Parking is difficult but worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmW421OZ

50,Great Place to Hike if you can find Parking,"It's a great workout, the people are hot, and you might spot some celebs. Great view at the top of LA. BUT, the parking sucks. You have to find street parking in the area. Try going off hours. Also, there are lots of dogs so if you're allergic, stay away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saikoxpooh
40,Some good hiking if you don't mind dogs or dog poo.,"From the Hollywood side, park on the south side of Franklin to avoid getting a ticket. Walk up Vista to enter the park. If you hang a left and take the first dirt trail you see, that's a pretty steep hike but really fun. There is a little climbing and you must have really good shoes. That's what we call ' the adventure way' or 'the devil's butt****'. Otherwise, follow the paved road all the way around and you will end up where you started. Good times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/377peggyd

40,Packed on the weekends,"This is a great run, and walk during the week, but during the weekend it is packed with people walking, taking pictures, walking their dogs, and visiting. Many people bring their families here for the views. So if you are exercising seriously, pick another place.. If you are showing off your body, then this is the place to do it:) There are honor snacks at the bottom of the hill. The parking is very difficult to find, so if you don't want to wait for parking, park down by the main roads and walk up. It will warm you up for the hills. The views are amazing, and on a clear day, you can see most everything from downtown to the West Side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/battmast
30,La's IT hiking spot,"This place is a madhouse sometimes.. And it starts with parking. There are many spots you can choose from but if you can figure out the puzzle of parking signs, then you're good! There are 2 entrances, so you don't have to use the main entrance to hike. This spot is very popular amongst la natives, so plan accordingly. What's great about it is that it's short and you get a great workout from the uphills! Thigh burn, bum burn, everything will be sore!From parts of the hike, you can see the Hollywood sign and the Griffith observatory from afar.Tip: no public restroom or portable restrooms either, so empty your tank before getting here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahlY4469SM
50,Kill 2 birds with one stone. Greats views + Great workout~!,I was skeptical at first as hiking was never my forte. But if you are also an amateur and not looking for something too hard core this is a good start~! It is a motivating reason to get a good work out while capitalizing on the view. The surrounding area has a bunch of trails and you can kill a few hours easily~! Bring water and take a rest room break prior. Parking is available on the street but ensure that you respect parking signs to avoid hefty fines.Happy Hiking~!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drewysta

50,Amazing Nature Hike!,"Runyon Canyon is such an amazing and serene hiking adventure. Each time that I enter into the gates of this mountainous land - it's like a brand new experience... I see and feel nature in a way that I never experienced. I take a hike at this location every morning, and every morning - I discover new wonders of nature in this sacred place. Oh, did I mention that I was afraid of heights - yeah, but I dare it all for the beauty, peace and calm of it all!

50,Cause everyone's doin it!,"Let me preface this review by saying that Sundays are my cheat days...well sometimes the occasional Saturday too but for my point's sake, let's say exclusively Sundays.Last Sunday I was invited to hike Claremont Loop which is not a leisurely trek by any means. Anyway the inclined loop paired with the sweltering IE temp pretty much justified my bingeing on more than enough food for myself and my tapeworm.Anyway, my friend invited me to hike Runyon with her and within seconds of acquiescing, I started looking for my post-hike meal with zero guilt. I think this hiking thing and I are going to get mesh like peas and carrots.Parking is a bit of an issue as others have noted before. A lot of the residential streets are permit only so unless you want a 70 dollar ticket pasted to your windshield, drive yourself down Hollywood Blvd and secure yourself a spot there. Trust me, the extra three blocks is going to be easier to stomach than offloading 70 bucks.Once you conquer the parking issue, you have a choice of routes and trails to embark. Each path is designed for both inexperienced and hike-savvy folk. You can take your sweet time or jog the entire course. Be vigilant that you don't step into the dogshxt. The only negative aspect of the dog friendliness here is that many owners don't pick up their dog's shxt.Everyday, on a certain schedule, yoga is made available to everyone for free! They have a bevy of other activities too so be on the lookout.There are many great things to say about Runyon Canyon. You'll never get bored and the view is beautiful. Bring your pooches. Bring your loved ones. More importantly, bring your sense of adventure (oh yea and your appetite too -- for later of course)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rh0k
50,Fantastic view,We walked up to the view point of the Hollywood sign or should I say climbed lol as we thought it was the easy way but it was longer but we certainly had a sense of achievement. We got to the same view point if we had taken the wide path easy route. So great to see the sign. Wear sensible shoes and take water it makes sense. Obviously no toilets about just so you are aware. I love Hollywood .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad5522

Parking is a nightmare, people are getting ticketed left and right and the trails are overcrowded with irresponsible people who let their pets poop wherever they like and don't clean up after them",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/603lailar
50,Very exhilarating and invigorating!,"I wouldn't say its an easy hike but then it's not the most strenuous hike I've done either. I did wake up the next day rather tight and sore, I'm not going to lie!Beautiful and panoramic view from the top so take your camera or iPhone. Also lots and lots of cute dogs walking with their owners which I enjoyed seeing as I was missing my dogs in Australia.Your shoes will get very dirty with fine red coloured powder, so possibly don't wear your brand new white Converse All Stars. The dirt will wipe off but I would imagine it would leave marks on light coloured footwear.Also I would recommend leaving either early in the morning or late in the afternoon. We hiked up as the park opened and by the time we came down about two hours later the mercury was rising rather rapidly.If you are in the Hollywood Hills area and have a spare couple of hours then I would say go check it ut, you may even spot a celebrity!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuxAdventureTravel
50,Hike,"Parking is hard to come by. Park further away- you're going on a hike, so a short walk to the park shouldn't be a problem.Hike starting from the trail on the right (the side with the stairs or flatter trail). It is much easier going up this way than going down. Both starting points will lead you back to where you started. The stairs may be tough going up, but it's a good workout and you'll definitely not slip on the way down.Be sure to wear good shoes- saw someone wearing converse trying to get down from the sandy stairs. No one wants to get hurt and don't be that person that blocks the flow of traffic in both directions. Lose lose situation.The trail attracts a lot of dog owners and hikers. The initial part requires your dog to be on a leash until a designated point.Hydrate!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/291laurym
40,Hike,Super views of downtown LA and Hollywood sign. Two paths both somewhat strenuous but worth it. Nice to have a nature hike in heart of LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulat242
40,Awesome views,"Did the hike up the canyon and it was great. Went up the easier east path and down the west. A bit of scrambling on the way down but nothing too difficult. You read a lot about whether this is a ""real"" hike and the kinds of people and fashion you see on the trail. My advice is ignore all of that. Enjoy the exercise and the views. Take water though, there's none on the trail itself. There was a little cart with cold water and snacks like granola bars etc by the Fuller St entrance. Amazingly it was on an honour system for payment. Not sure if it's a regular feature, or what the hours are, but it was certainly appreciated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1146VHchriss
40,Popular sunny trails,"Always rather crowded (with pedestrians and their dogs), maybe drawn by the rather tree-less bright sunlit trails, maybe drawn by the great eye candy (these trails are easily accessible for the Hollywood locals so there are plenty of actors/models and the occasional celebrity sighting).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652rayq
50,Make sure you have water!,This was an amazing experience! It certainly is a desert experience so make sure you bring water! It was 35 degrees Celsius at 11:30am when we did the run. There isn't a lot of shade and it is very dry and hot. It was an amazing LA experience that was one of my highlights. The views are stunning and it's a great opportunity to check out the real LA locals!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaLake
50,Where The Plastics Play,"Okay so this trail is AMAZING! If I lived in LA I would workout here at LEAST 4 days out of the week! I can't believe that I am just now doing a review on this trail. Now what I will say is that yes It could be a tad bit over rated and yes some people have lost their minds with the kind of attire they wear up the trail but if you are here for the right reasons than it makes it all so worth it! YES people really do come here to take pictures for the ""gram"" and post on Snap chat! I love the fact that there is 3 different courses you can take and that no matter which one you take you are guaranteed to get a nice work out. Literally every time I complete this trail my legs are that good kind of sore the next day. CAUTION on the dog poop and people running around! I have seen some bad accidents and some are life threatening so I would always suggest that people wear some shoes that have a nice grip. Certain parts of the trail are steep and if those rocks slide from underneath you, you are done! Other than that have fun :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BugattiBoi88
50,"The perfect ""Saturday Morning""",When i arrived on the Top of the Runyon Canyon i admit that i was a little tired. It's a long walk through the nature and you have to hike a lot of path...but it worth it.The view from the top is stunning! You can see all the City of Angels!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiadaP1988
40,Tough on the knees!,"Its a good walk, hike that will burn a few 900 calories in a single walk! once I got to the top the views were stunning, the trails seemed long at times however it was good celebrity spotting and stopping to look at the views from many different sides. I got a taxi down to the bottom!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/253natashaw
50,Loved Runyon,Runyon was great! I'm so lazy but i loved it. The views are incredible and just doing the hike made me feel better. The way up at times is a little scary but people go there with kids and dogs so nothing to worry about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luluxlou
50,Must do activity when you are in LA,"This a must do item on your list! The views are stunning, the run is gorgeous. Make sure you go early or later in the evening as it was very hot. Wear comfortable shoes and clothing because it is a hike up hill. Take a camera. The Hollywood sign is just at the top and you can see the entire city of LA. This was highlight of our girls trip and it gets very busy on weekends (we were told) Be careful where you park on the street. They ticket you and it is about 80 dollars per ticket. It is also all up hill so make sure you bring water and dress the part. You can also take the trail by horseback (ranches along the way where you can book). The park is free to enter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KamiK747
50,great hike for exercise,"My wife and I hike regularly in the san Fernando valley to keep in shape and relax. Every once in awhile we go to Runyon canyon ( we usually hike fryman canyon). Runyon has great views of LA and is a bit strenuous, especially going uphill and in the direct sun( no cover on this hike).You can access it from the Hollywood side or Mulholland drive side. Either way a round trip hike gives you 3 options for levels of difficulty. Go for it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinkQ7630MZ
50,Perfect Sunday Hike,If you're looking for something to challenge the moderate exerciser look no further! These trails can be strenuous but the exertion does not last long. I would recommend going during sunset & maybe not on a weekend. Parking can be horrible since you cannot park anywhere near the entrances to the trails (need a permit for those spots). Very dog friendly and very populated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandradG5207JI
50,Stunning,"All of these parks and canyons in LA have the most beautiful views all the way up. A lovely walk through but, be aware there are A LOT of dogs",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmm73
50,I totally love RC,If you are up to the advanced walk the views at the top are breath taking. Best times to walk are either early morning or later afternoon. Either way take water but do try and avoid midday. I am a huge fan of Runyon and if you are fortunate you may get to spot some celebs too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/litzb2014
50,Amazing views in Runyon Canyon!,"Did a hike through Runyon Canyon recently. I entered on North Fuller Ave, parking on the street. There are many hiking paths to take from easy to hard. Great place to jog or hike and you can bring your dog with you! There are places your dog can go off leash to get exercise. It was so much fun and free to boot! Make sure you go to the bathroom before you start as there are no bathrooms in the canyon. In addition take some water with you. Great fun exercise! One of my favorite places!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dunnmeister
50,Great LA hike with a view,"This is a must-do hike if you are in the LA area. We added it to our list as we heard about the views of the surrounding area. The view from the stop is really neat. You can see downtown LA and the Hollywood sign (but it's so tiny!). It's definitely a hike you want to do with proper attire, and your shoes might get a little dusty! Hope for a cool day or some cloud cover! I hear you can even spot a celeb here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thefamilythattravels
50,Beautiful run!,"Great place to walk or run, gorgeous views and you may even see a celebrity or two. A little dusty so be sure to wear shoes that are not white!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/296rr

50,Surprised and what a find!,My wife and daughter and myself were driving around looking for a place that overlooks the city… And boy did we find it! What a nice little hike/walk with a great view of million-dollar homes and Los Angeles/Hollywood. It's free! Take water if you're going to hike or walk far.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/razomatic
40,Anybody can!,"Nice walk uphill but it is worth it to see the view! We did it while the sun was setting and it gives an amazing view of the city. It is difficult to park near the entrance, so be aware that you may have to do a bit of walking before entering the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendyy_brink
30,I was expecting more,"The Runyon Canyon Park is a very popular place for locals for running and walking their dogs. I read that the views of LA are great, and indeed the views are not bad. The hike itself is nothing special, as the park is quite dry. I understand it as an escape place for locals. But also having in mind the very limited touristic attractions of LA, this can be a good option to spend some hours of your free time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jac-and-Jek
40,Great hike,"The Pros- great hike with incline trails. The view of Los Angeles are beautiful here and it is a good place to take photos.The cons- parking is bad. If youre out of shape or have children, it may be difficult to do this hike.Overall, we will definitely hike here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tingyangs6
50,The best work out ever with fantastic views!!,Ok people this hike is NOT for the faint at heart! I am an avid runner and biker and even I had to stop to take a break or two! The breaks were also great excuses to take some excellent scenery pics! If you love cardio and breathtaking views then this is definitely the hike for you!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leolisa44

50,City of the angeles,I'm a big fan of both walking and hot weather. LA may not be my favourite city but it's amazing to have the opportunity to watch it from the sky. I was a little bit sad with the fact that there are no restrooms in the park. But I had a really nice company and I'm sure that if I was living in LA I would spend a lot of my mornings up there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JullsDizi
50,Great!,"My husband and I hiked this canyon early morning on a weekday and it was great. Full of people which is nice, but leaves you no where to park! We parked 3 blocks down and walked up. Bring water there are not water fountains besides upon entering, as well as no restrooms. It is a beautiful view and experience. I think the trail all the way through was less then 4 miles. Oh and it is dog friendly! There are dog water bowls about every mile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/80raneema
50,perfect morning to hike Runyon canyon,We enjoyed the spectacular views of Hollywood & perfect weather! We wish we had more time but were thrilled to see part of it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sallyb220

50,Amazing place!,"A beautiful place to exercise in or just take a walk - with or without the dog. We were here to enjoy the nature on recommendations from our landlord, who use to walk the dog here. It's very beautiful and have some good uphill walks if you are starting from the city side of the park (nearby the Sunset boulevard). We loved the atmosphere and will bring better shoes next time we visit LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malin_o_Jonas
10,Check opening hours before starting out,Advertised as open till dusk but was closed when we walked up a good 90 minutes before dusk. Was looking forward to the views over LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/424jeans
50,Great exercise location....but parking is rough,I hike here all the time. Great for beginners and pros because of 3 tracks but in actuality there are 6 options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deadpool
50,Walkers dream,"We walked from one of the higher car parks on Mulholland Drive to initially one opeak, then down through the canyon to a more southerly peak. Bth were relatively easy to get to, though the second one had a small rock climb involved. Both were brilliant for taking photographs of the sprawling LA vista",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pippin1960
30,Nice for people watching only,"Seriously if you want to get exercise, go to another canyon. There are lots of celebrities and people here - it gets crazy busy on the weekends. But everyone is here to check each other out and talk talk talk... lots of dogs which means there's dog poo all over the sidewalks leading up to the park... in addition to the park itself. But you should check it out just once - don't take my word for it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philb760

50,Great views... of the city and people!,"Definitely a hip hiking spot for Los Angeles. The liklihood of seeing celebrity or a beautiful body is very high. Lots of different awesome breeds of dogs here too. All that aside, this hike is legitimately a great workout with breath-taking views at the end. Getting here is easy but parking can be a pain. Be sure to bring water on your hike for the warm days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelinh1

40,Good and fairly vigorous hike,Beautiful views of the Hollywood Hills and of downtown Los Angeles.Its all uphill and then downhill but not too difficult. In fact the steepest part is from the streets where you park--if you can find a space--to where you enter the park. At that junction I almost stepped on a six foot snake that was crossing the road so be aware.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardLBrown
40,A great escape from Hollywood mania,"A nice hike up to a rewarding view. It was crowded when I went, but fun to watch dogs, yoga class, maritial arts practice, young love, family dynamics, overanimated teens. I was surprised to find it in the midst of LA; it seems enormous once you're there but the city is blocks away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSfromMaine
40,Breathtaking views outweigh the inconveniences,"Location is key for this park. While it is often over-crowded, provides little-to-no shade, and parking is very tricky, you can't beat the views and workout you'll get climbing to the top of the Hollywood Hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoLocal
50,A must for runners!,"Visited here whilst on holiday in LA. Was ideal for my morning runs, great trail with amazing views. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/377JenB
50,Don't tell anyone!,"I'm not going to review Runyon Canyon because I don't want out-of-towners to know about it. This is OUR local treasure. It's an off-leash hiking area with great city views. And a great place to see the young and fit. Local legend was that it used to be Errol Flynn's house but I don't think that's true. There are a number of different ways to hike the Canyon, for beginners and for more advanced. There's also a top part of the Canyon Park that you can reach from Mulholland. Great place to hike, even without a dog.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814charlesz
30,Visit At Your Own Risk!,"Very breath taking but very scary if you are clumsy like me! I went on a hike with my friends and our kids. Hers were in a stroller mine was 7. It was a very terrifying thing to try to keep your kid on the path closest to the mountain so he doesn't roll off any of the sheer 50 foot plus drops. I am probably just a freak show everyone else seemed fine but it was not for me. I need flat hiking. I think that is just called walking. I saw people running it. I took a different, hug the cliff and try to crawl down approach it took forever to go up and down because I went so slow and almost had a heart attack when my kid kept pulling away from me to walk on his own through the loose gravel. I did see a bunch of celebrities but still wouldn't go back far to much anxiety.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ecmd92
40,Great quick city hike,"This is where you want to go when you want to bang out a 1 hour hike without leaving Los Angeles proper. And you want to see the Hollywood sign. And you want to see plenty of half-clothed super buff bodies, and you want to pet lots of random dogs, and you want great views of Los Angeles. Not exactly a ""nature"" hike, and not a super challenging hike (though it is definitely an steep incline at times), but still good, and definitely part of the LA experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annelovescoffeemore
40,Scenic hike from people watching to city views.,"Great hikes to a nice view of Los angeles. Great for people watching. Hot people working out everywhere. You may even see some celebrities. Girls put on there best outfits & wear full make up on these trails. It's hilarious. Busy, but fun. Not the best hike option if you want to soak up nature. I'm more of a nature girl myself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mistyo123
50,Great gem at the edge of the city,"I went to Runyon Canyon for an early morning hike. I would recommend arriving early (7:30-8:00ish) as parking is limited (and it is cooler). Be prepared for a good hike. Just be aware if you enter from Mulholland that you will begin your hike downhill. Make sure you know your abilities as you will have to hike back ""uphill"". It was a refreshing walk and took a little under an hour to do the loop around the east trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avg_traveler_man
40,Good hiking trail with beautiful city view,"If you are interested in going for a good hike, its a nice trail very near from walk of fame. Best place to go is just before the sunset for a beautiful view of entire LA city. Looks awesome in dark for scenic pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deepak1708
50,Simply breathtaking,"The most beautiful views to see, we took the hard route up and the easy route down. Be sure to take lots of water and get there as early as possible. You can buy water at the the bottom of east side entrance for $1 very reasonable. Lots of dogs on the route. Really lovely place to go you can make it as easy or as hard as possible, not much shade on route. So take precautions before you go. Very friendly people on route to take photos and chat to. Lots of people too so you wouldn't have to worry going on your own. Overall a must see for LA tourists and locals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TillyB228

40,Escape the city,The walk was magnificent. My partner and I walked Runyon Canyon in the morning and the views at the top are spectacular. The walk was a nice change from the hectic city of Los Angeles. It is said to be a bit of a celebrity spotting area so that made it even more exciting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasjohnmagee
40,Great hike,"Walking up Runyon Canyon was difficult at points with the summer heat in LA, however very rewarding for the beautiful view of LA at the top. If you're not an experienced hiker, then take the right route up the hill. Expect lots of dogs running around!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyvwiddicks
20,Any other trail,"With so many other trails within a stone throw's radius, why bother with this cluster? On top of risking being bitten by many of other patrons' uncontrollable dogs, the parking is a nightmare. Locals HATE that there are so many visitors. Try any other trail you will thank me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D9047CQsarahw
40,A different side to LA,I went up the canyon at both mid day and just before sunset and if you are looking for a better view there is definitely less haze in the early evening.The paths are well maintained and although steep in places are manageable for most abilities. The views are well worth the hiking.Make sure you take a bottle of water with you!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mollyy92
30,Most overrated hike in LA,"Runyon is perhaps the most well-known hike in LA, due to it's history of celebrity sightings. While the loop is a good workout and the views are good, there are so many more better hikes in LA. If you're in the area then it's decent, but I would definitely seek out other hikes. Runyon tends to be a scene, gets overcrowded, the parking is annoying and limited and since it is so dog friendly, it literally stinks when you first walk in...that's where all the trash cans are located. Gross. Runyon is just whatever to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mermaid17383
50,Beautiful,"A beautiful place, good to take pictures. But no rastroom, no food, only the montain and the nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anepriscila
50,Feel-good hike,"We really enjoyed this hike. We waited until around 7pm due to the heat and it took around 30 minutes to get to the top. The walk was quite strenuous but anyone with a reasonable amount of fitness can make it with breaks. At the entrance I was surprised to see a really well stocked refreshment cart with drinks and fruit with an honesty box for payment - fantastic idea. The view from the top is fantastic and we were really on a high when we got there. I was a little nervous about going up so late and then coming down in the dark but there were so many people up there, including young families, that I felt very safe and we waited until darkness fell and watched the lights of LA come on. Everyone was friendly and all the dogs well behaved. People were still coming up as we started our descent down in the dark, no problem finding our way. Would definitely recommend this feel-good hike, I can see why it is so popular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shazmo2015

50,Fantastic place to walk and explore with children,We went here to do the walk to the top of Runyon with our two children. It was a popular park and area with lots of joggers and dog walkers. The walk itself was quite steep at times but we kept going and even though we did struggle a bit especially our 9 year old the view when we reached the top was worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sianclarkuk
50,Great Views and Respite from the Sprawling LA Landscape,"I've done this hike a couple of times and really enjoy it. It's a great way to get the out-of-city feel without really having to leave. It's a solid hike, but not too strenuous. The real bonus is the spectacular views of LA.I didn't do it with kids, but they could easily handle it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanyaw147
40,Great views & a great hike in the middle of LA!,"Runyon Canyon is a large piece of ""wilderness land"" right in the heart of Los Angeles, easily accessible from Hollywood (lower gate at Fuller Avenue) or the Hollywood Hills West (upper gate on Mulholland Drive).At the lower level, just inside the entrance gates on Fuller Avenue in Hollywood, there is a fenced-in grassy park for picnics, frisbee, and even yoga/fitness classes (regularly offered, bring your own mat and/or towel). Dogs are not allowed in the fenced-in grassy area, but are welcomed throughout the rest of Runyon Canyon. In fact, most of the trails (many of them paved) are designated as off-leash areas for dogs, and many dogs & their owners enjoy exercise & bonding time here.There are several trails, ranging from very easy to very challenging. One ends at a scenic overlook point with spectacular views of Downtown Hollywood & Los Angeles. Also clearly visible is the famous HOLLYWOOD sign & the Griffith Park Observatory. Bring your camera(s). You might also spot a well-known actor, model or other celebrity enjoying a nice walk or a fitness hike!The entrance gates to Runyon Canyon are open from dawn to dusk every day, but parking is almost always a huge problem (whether entering at the top off Mulholland or at the bottom from Fuller). Weekends are especially crowded, and there are no toilet facilities anywhere within in the Runyon Canyon boundaries (that I know of).Best of all, the park, with all its hiking, views & photo opportunities, is completely free of charge!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941evanb

50,Great Hike!,"Great views of the City and an overall fun hike! Whether you want to take a stroll around or run a more intense hike, this is great. Took us about 35 minutes to do the 2.5 mile trail, so it won't take up your whole day...unless you want it to. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J770
50,Beautiful and agonizing at the same time !,"This is a great hike, but you must in shape. Trails are wide and up and down. Works every muscle in your body. Lots of people with dogs on and off leash. All dogs I encountered were friendly and well mannered off leash. TAKE WATER, TAKE BREAKS, and most important, take in the beautiful views of Los Angeles. A definite for visitors, or anyone wanting a good outdoor work out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyg554
50,"I came, I saw, and couldn't conquer",I am not fit and felt defeated. I struggled just to get to the park. The incline is no joke. I'll be back to tackle this. To be continued. This is a beautiful park. I enjoyed the short time spent here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iJennine

50,Checked off my bucket list!!!,"I'm not a marathon runner or anything close to it but I do enjoy a nice run often and I've always heard of Runyon Canyon Park so I knew if I ever visited California I would try it out. Glad I did!!!! Someone has a nice little stand setup before you enter the park with a nice honor system they have water, bananas snacks and dog treats and you just take what you need and leave the money, so if you forgot your water this is your last chance to get one before entering the park. This trail is huge I got far up and still didn't get to the top. Be ready dress according to run/hike and get dusty have water and take breakers some of the uphill isn't easy especially if your only used to flat surface and watch out for the dog poop. People walk there dogs mostly off the leash and the two days I went to the park I felt comfortable everyone dog basically stayed near or listen to their owners so I didn't feel like the dog was going to attack me or anything some came close and wanted me to throw a ball or stick. Even if you just walk the trail enjoy the views and have fun!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Noch90s
50,Amazing,"The canyon park is amazing. I visited as a tourist with family. There is a diverse group of people at the park. Some people working out, tourist taking pictures, and causal walkers. I didn't go for a workout I went for the view. The view is amazing and you can get a good workout in if you want as well. I will return here every time I come back to the area. Loved it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/619miamiluv662
30,Views & Smells,"The views are awesome. I am not at the top of my fit game, so it required some pit stops to get decently high up. At the very beginning though, the smell of dog poop is overwhelming! I have owned a couple of dogs myself, so I am not stranger to the smell, but my god, it just smells horrible down there, they need to either be more strict on owners who bring their dogs, or have someone maintenance it more often!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marilyng394
50,Worth the hike!,"Excellent view of the city. I didn't hike the whole thing I kind of cheated because I was dropped off at the mullholland drive entrance and hiked to the highest point from there. I'm not a hiker I just went for the view and it was great. Wear shoes with good grip, you're gonna get a little worked up so bring water and pace yourself. I loved that there were different views of the city on the way up....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jojoo562
40,Gets crowded but go early - great hike with a dog,Good spot for an early morning hike - gets very crowded as the day goes on - but definitely worth going all the way to to the very top where you can see downtown LA from behind the Hollywood sign - amazing view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattm54
50,Enjoy LA city views and get a great work out.,"Perched atop Mulholland Drive, is one of the entry points for Runyon Canyon park. It is frequented by dog owners whose dogs are both leashed or unleashed. Many celebrities also participate in the rigorous walk which starts out downhill and becomes a great uphill workout when you are returning to the top. I personally have spotted Pamela Sue Anderson, Lawrence Fishburne and years ago, Gwyneth Paltrow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RajiR_12
30,Too crowded and no parking,"This had long been one of my favorite hiking places in LA. It was quiet and serene. The views are spectacular and there's interesting ruins from an old estate, where Errol Flynn lived, but it has now become a dog park which and there are about a thousand people every day and there's no parking so one has to park several block away.The parking is so bad someone is offering valet service -- so you can walk your dog.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/habitatp2014
50,This is No CakeWalk !,"A great place to hike and get your work out On !Do not try to be ""Rocky "" though c'mon now !Take a water and go in the evenings or mornings !They do lock the gates at night too, for those mid-night runs.. so do not get caughtinside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deanomuellerstudio
50,Good exercise and good view!,Runyon Canyon Park is north Hollywood of LA and this hike is nothing like you ever done before. This is not you average walk in the park or treadmill jog at the gym. This hike has you challenging yourself to climb steep hills in a sand/rocky terrain. Runyon pushed yourself to keep going with its many obstacles. To get to the very top can be challenging but once you arrive there the reward is amazing. The very top you are greeted with fresh air and city wide view of all of Los Angeles. I recommend wearing comfortable clothing and shoes. Don't forget to bring a camelbak or some water bottles as well. If you are ever visiting LA and want to get a good view of the city then I'd recommend waking up early and taking this hike. You wont regret it and once you finish you feel like you can take on the world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JosephCortina
50,Great views of Hollywood and LA,Really nice way to spend a morning walking the short loop with a couple of great viewing spots out over Hollywood and LA.We followed the path from the south entrance at fuller avenue not really knowing where we were heading. We followed the path straight on and up round to the right which meant we walked up the steep part of the walk and followed the loop round to the left back down to the south entrance.Fairly easy walk although the steep section gets your legs working if your not use to much exercise! Quite a quick trail which took us 30-40 mins.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oven09
50,Easy to moderate hike,This place is amazing!! Seeing the smoggy city and good trails. The downfall is the parking. You have to get lucky or live in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisssmee
30,Crowded: Go Early,The hike was challenging but enjoyable. I think this was because we went early because it started to get busy when we were finishing up. I prefer to hike with less people so this is not my favorite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vball13
50,Get amougst the local way of life!,If you're keen for a bit of exercise and possible celebrity spotting then head up the Runyon Canyon and enjoy an amazing hike in the Hollywood Hills! Popular spot for celebrities to workout and great views over LA - brilliant!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maeviiebabiie
40,A Good Hike with the Locals.,"If you want to see 'Real' Los Angelenos in their native environment and get your exercise on then this is your spot. It used to be a seedy area back in the day, stunk of dog urine and a steady supply of crack. Alas time have changed, the neighborhood got gentrified and the crack is done, but the dog urine continues to waft through the smoggy LA air.The best is in the morning, the air is a bit damp and cool, you can get to the top with a bit of a hike and see a great view of the city. I actually saw Bob Barker on his morning walk once and Mel Gibson. I doubt Bob does much hiking these days, but you may be able to catch Mel tagging the abandoned houses up with swastikas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VonBlanco
30,Runyon Canyon is great depending on what you are looking for in it,"I wanted to hike up the Canyon purley to see the Hollywood sign... so many people told me i would have a great view.. even people in Hollywood. The hike is very steep to the out look where you can see the sign. And when you get to the top you realize its not a great view of the sign. You can see it but its so far away. However the view of LA is amazing. If you want to hike to see the hollywood sign, i suggest you do griffith park.. much better of view. Oh and parking was rough in that area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hgolding2005

50,Great view of LA and beautiful area to enjoy the outdoors.,"This is a great place to hike and to enjoy the fantastic view of Los Angeles.

30,Not sure it's worth the visit,"Stopped off here from a drive on Mulholland Dr, only to take a pause and look around. It has a great location offering good views over the city. But if you are a tourist, and not a local resident, I am not sure this is worth the trip - or even a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripasucks
50,Get sweaty with the stars,"Yeah. You actually have a really high likelihood of seeing a celeb when you're hiking these trails. But heck, even if you DIDN'T spot any stars (and we did – Brook Burke) you'll still be hiking up in the hills around the stars' homes. I suppose if you're industrious enough, you could just hike up there and check out the properties.And let's say you just want a gorgeous place to go exercise at no charge. This is the place. Best place to exercise in Hollywood, I'd venture to say. Best views of the Los Angeles city skyline. Awesome place for people watching.Put it on your list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaddySnake
40,"Steep hike up, beautiful views","Lovely park with beautiful views of Los Angeles! Pretty steep ascent and a nice long easy descent back. Bring lots of water, but there was an honor cart at the start of the trail where you could purchase drinks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10DawnG

50,"A climb, clean air and other friendly climbers!","You'll enjoy the journey through one of LA's favorite canyon climbs. This is a place that it feels like all of LA knows about, yet when your there you'll find your own quiet space. Definitely worth a space on your LA ""to-do"" list! You might even walk amongst ""the stars!""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/291annei
40,Great for dogs,While Runyon can be a bit too crowded and sceney for me at times it is my hike of choice because they allow dogs to go off leash for a large portion of the hill. Parking in the area is difficult and you have to check the signs because the parking rules change from time to time. The views are great and the hike is moderate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phil_ibuster15
50,Great hole with great views,A good hike that gives you a break from the city. The trails stay pretty busy and is a dog friendly park. Just need people to pick up that dog poop. Maybe there should be places on the trail to throw the poop away or something.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottiemfg
50,Bring lots of water,"As its very hot in LA, make sure to bring a good amount of water with you and definitely wear comfy shoes. It was so worth the hike, the view was amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katelynk973
50,Beautiful sight seeing!,"Runyan canyon was a challenge for my friends and I who hail from Florida where everything is flat but it was amazingly beautiful and well worth the sweat and sun burn!!! You can see the Hollywood sign from one of the shorter trails (a little over a mile) and they offer longer and more advanced trails for the more experienced. Some areas are very steep so I wouldn't advise this for families with really young children but you can always turn around and go back since the trail loops around and some parts of the trail are really easy to climb.Words of advice, bring alot of water!!! It gets incredibly hot and dry as you elevate. The only issue I had was with parking, it's all street parking but it encourages more walking so that's OK too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gvd123

40,Very pretty view,"Really pretty views you'll get from here. It's a lovely park with lots of dogs wich I really liked (no worry for dogpoo, they all clean it up).If you're from a flat country like I am, prepare to be exhausted and take some breaks, cause it is steap. But so worth it! Must do, must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SentinaS

30,Lots to see,"It's great for views, an intense hike (some very steep inclines), and lots of people/dog watching. It's completely exposed to the sun throughout the trails, so wear sunblock and bring water. There's also a little water and snack stand at the main entrance, so bring some dollars if you want a drink or small bite.And don't forget a camera or phone if it's your first time.

40,Avoid the dog poop for some killer views!,"Great views and a fun challenging hike to the top of the canyon. You'll need to side step some of the land mines left behind from the furry friends, but its cool that dogs can enjoy it too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smackie66

40,Nice views,I've only been on one of the three main trails and I was able to park on the street but be aware there is street cleaning on Mondays so you have to move your car by 11:00. Not as easy for parking compared to Griffith but you get a different view of L.A. than in Griffith.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5357RZlauram
50,Best walk in Hollywood,"I love this place, we used to hang out here before it was Runyon. I went to Hollywood high and we called it Fuller estates ninth 80'S . The view of the city is breathtaking, the California chaparral is perfect, and the history is great. This property use to belong to Errol Flynn and many Hollywood parties were hosted there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seeralon
50,Best Hiking views in the city...beware of Parking situation,"Best hiking in the city. Get your work out on and the reward when you get to the top...an amazing birdseye view of LA. I love the fact that it is dog friendly and there are water stations for my pup to get hydrated during our hike. Parking situation sucks though! Too many people, not enough parking spaces. It would be so beneficial to have a parking structure nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RinaTravelsWorld
40,Great people watching,"The hike is probably 3-4 miles depending on if you do the add on up to Mulholland or not. Its a long set of steep stairs up from Fuller and if you're not in shape, its not easy. But its fun, and you'll see all sorts of walks of life here - from celebrities, to work out fanatics, to tourists, etc... you'll overhear hilarious conversations and the view at the top is very cool. Just note it might take you 20 minutes just to find a parking spot, and you need to be aggressive to grab it before someone steals it from ya.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcharlotte
50,#1 Thing to do before you die!!!!,"One of my favorite places in Los Angeles. Just 30 minutes walk up the hill, so you won't be exhausted to the max. When you are at the top, you can enjoy an amazing view.. From one side ""Hollywood sign"" and from the other ""The Pacific ocean"". Take a seat on the bench on the top of that hill and you will fell like that you are the luckiest man/woman on the planet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/480marekk
40,Gone to the Dogs,This is a nice park if you are a dog lover. Couldn't believe the skill of the lady walked 13 dogs at once. Folks are in their zone so not very friendly. The view of the city is spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PetroleumRox

40,Quintessential Running/Hiking Trail in Los Angeles,"Easy to access trails in Hollywood, overlooking much of Los Angeles. Popular trails are easy and have lots of hikers and dogs. Harder trails progress farther into the hills and are steeper and less trailed. Parking is sometimes limited, and can be crowded on the weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tute66
50,Refreshing and sunny,A great walk or some run it. I just about made it to the top need to be fairly fit. Only to realise most people were going the other way round?

50,Awesome way to spend 2 hrs,"My wife and I drove down to Fuller Avenue and parked upNear the south entrance to the park. The trails are full of tourists andLocals with a really nice atmosphere. It is about a 6km hike in a big circle, parts of it are quite steep so you would need to be reasonably fit. The views of Hollywood hills and LA are fabulous. Lots of people watching opportunities also. Great way to get exercise and see the sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bd100
40,Great Hike with lots of people,There are three trails with 2 crowded ones with dogs. The third (hardest trail) is great and not as crowded with great views on a clear day!One of the hardest things is trying to get a parking spot and it can take 30 minutes or more to find one on the streets around it so carpool if you can,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wonderaroundtheworld

50,Great views while getting a good workout!,"Hiked the canyon and it was great. Looked daunting at first, but worth the sense of accomplishment afterwards and the great views. I would suggest sunscreen for sure, water, and to take the steeper path (right from the entrance) on the way up, as it's much harder to do descending and slippery on the dirt going down. Otherwise, very do-able for the average healthy person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CuriousJulieEvents
50,My Doggie Park,"We love the views and the idea of dogs having a place, too. This is by far the best Doggie Park in LA. The views of the ocean, downtown LA, Hollywood & the Westside are spectacular. Cloudy days are the best, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FoodieinNOHO
50,Great trails for people and dog watching,If you want to hike in the Hollywood Hills (sorry no where near the Hollywood sign) then this is the place. Parking is kind of a mess but the trail system in this urban hillside park is extensive and very heavily used. The non-stop parade of people and pets is almost as interesting as the scenery itself. Bring your own water and be ready for a hot and healthy hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Resorteye
50,escape up above LA,"It was steeper and hotter than i expected, but only half an hour to get the best view possible of LA. You won't get lost, there's really only one way around it, and you can't miss a great view of the Hollywood Sign from near the top. We entered from the lower end - North Fuller Avenue - and were lucky to get a free parking space quite near. People are coming and going all the time so if you cruise about it you should find a space. It was 10am on a Saturday morning, and the traffic in the area, and to get there from Santa Monica, wasn't too bad at all. Didn't see any celebs, but there were some very fit looking people and some great dogs. Overall a great trip, well worth doing if you're in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JinnyJones1982232a
30,Poop Everywhere,"I can't tell you how disappointed we were to drive there, walk to the top and encounter dog poop everywhere. Come on California dog owners, be responsible. It's disgusting, bad for the environment and it's irresponsible to leave your dog's poop in a park all along the hiking paths.It's worth going to if you have extra time but I wouldn't go out of my way for this. Hiking can be steep so be prepared and of course look out for the dog poop all over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BloatedBelly

My kids love hiking too, so we spend a nice day here with the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargeryRob
50,Local Perspective - Runyon is part of the Real L.A. Experience,"I've lived in Hollywood and West Hollywood over the last 15 years, and Runyon Canyon is my church. My townhouse is about 1.5 km away from the Fuller entrance, and I am up there at least once a week with my athletic doggie. It's a haven for dog lovers...wide open with tons of space and largely unspoilt. It offers a variety of trails at varied degrees of difficulty from the causal tourist just taking in the ""Hollywood"" ambience (you'll hear lots of banter from wannabe actors, producers, agents, and whatnot) and the spectacular views of the city...all the way to the fit Angeleno trying to get some high impact cardio and escape the congestion and craziness of the city.If you're trying to spot celebs, don't bother...I have seen more rattlesnakes here than celebs (and, I have only seen two over the years...they won't hurt you). This place is FANTASTIC for dog lovers and not really kid friendly. So, if you don't like dogs or you are looking for a place for your kids to run and play, you should probably avoid (it's way too strenuous for small children and their whining and crying from being tried and bored or scared of heights really gets in the way of the peacefulness factor).The only cons really are that a) the ""ghetto"" factor (folks being loud and obnoxious with their sound systems) has been a disturbing trend in recent years and the fact the some of the investors in Hollywood Hills real estate are plotting to make this place less appealing for hikers and park enthusiasts. Neither of those has been enough of a factor for me to rate Runyon any less than five stars though. Make it a point to visit when in L.A. It's free and incredibly rewarding. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackulas
50,Amazing park,"The views here are amazing, and the hike/walk up is a good one. Also in walking distance to hollywood, so I'd recommend doing both the same day if you are far form the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_and_Hedge
40,Great views,"Very crowded! But otherwise good. The views of the whole city are amazing.I went on one of the shorter trails and it wasn't too steep or difficult. It's a good exercising spot but the shorter trails are also good for tourists if you just want a nice walk and great views.And don't expect too many celebs, there were none when I was there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cle182
50,Great views and great trails,Great views and great trails. You never know who you are going to see and it's just a great experience. Definitely recommemded. Tale the Fuller entrance.

20,Totally Over hyped -FAR better hikes in Los Angeles,"I always tell people not to waste their time with Runyon these days, it used to be a low key cool neighborhood spot, but has now turned into a over crowded and over hyped hike. There are far better hikes in Los Angeles and ones that will still give you a great view of LA- the Hollywood Sign hike for example. This place has turned into a ""trendy"" spot and in my opinion very annoying and not enjoyable. It also smells like dog pee from the over crowded groups over people taking their dogs up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dreamontravler
50,Beautiful views while exercising!,"This has to be one of the best places to hike in LA. Great views, everyone is nice on the trail. A must visit when in LA, along with the Griffith Observatory and if possible the Bradbury Building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DWPKRLVR
30,Crowded - but look your best...,"A great spot to celebrity watch. They're there - in droves. And dogs. LOTS of dogs of all sizes and shapes. Great for pet lovers. Not so great if the owners of said pets don't pick up the droppings! If it's a hot afternoon it's going to smell.Also, if you're afraid of dogs off leash - not the best walk for you. If your pooch is skittish around other dogs - skip bringing Fido and enjoy the workout on your own.Parking is tricky on both the Hollywood side entrance and Laurel Canyon side, so be prepared to do a mini pre-hike to get to your hike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorettac188

40,Great hike with some minor issues...,"...It's a dog-friendly route with everything both good and bad that's connoted. It's not the dogs' faults...chalk it up to the few bad owners that don't clean up or let their less-than-trained dogs run loose. If you get past that, it's an invigorating hike with good elevation changes and excellent views of the Hollywood Hills and downtown LA. There are probably similar/better hikes without the dog issue...will explore next time and report back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mcx-PA
50,Hiking the Hollywood Hills,Awesome Sunday hike in the hills with awesome views of the city of LA's skyline and surrounding area.

We made it to the top of the one hill by pushing/carrying the bikes. From the top it was ok to ride.Even though we had some surprises we really enjoyed the park and wished we had some more time to explore further.The park was full of people - running, walking their dogs. Just a great place to spend some time outdoors. Right in the middle of the city and the views from the top were amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DancingKooDoo
40,great hike and wonderful views,"only hiked part of it as we did not have much time and really didn't prepare well. moderate hike up, if you go to what I call the first elevation stop, trail to the left, that is not long but the views of LA are Fantastic. worth the climb.The big hike also looks moderate. go early as it gets hot quick.lots of people come here and their was even a guy selling water at the entrance. looks like there are a few trails if you wanted to explore more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karyn2323
40,You can see Katy Perry's house from here,"No joke.Other than that it is Hipster Central in spandex. A pick up bar in Nike's. Tinder on a dog leash. Grindr on hands and knees.Be careful you don't get your car towed though, or when they say 'Do you want to come home with me?' they might really just be trying to be nice because you are totally stranded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elwood_Seattle
50,Great workout and views,"Popular place and to do thing when in LA , hiking while chatting with a friend and excellent views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrielaMedelllin
50,Great hike in under an hour with some steep inclines.,Great workout for about 20 minutes. You can really start to pant on the way up! Pretty chill on the way down. Wear shoes with traction since it can be easy to slip in the dirt.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unicornsandrainbows
30,A Park for Dogs,"If you like the smell of dog poop then this is the park for you. Great place to go hiking, but lots of dogs and people who don't pick up after them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jet7777
50,An enjoyable Park,"I did enjoy trekking around this park, all the way is awesome, even though there are some crowds. However, you can get wonderful views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/antoniofP5385ZC
50,Nature at it's best!,"Runyon Canyon Park is only blocks from Hollywood Blvd. The hike to the top of the mountain is about 1 1/2 miles. It's a steep climb at some points but much of the climb is flat. There are benches when you reach the top. The view of Los Angeles at the top is spectacular! The park is dog friendly and no leash is required. Park also offers yoga classes. At the entrance, water and snacks are available. Whether you hike or not, to experience the serenity and beauty of the park is worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gailp736
40,Nice views,I really enjoyed my time at this place but it was a bit dirty. A really nice place to bring your kids for a good hike but it can get a bit tireding if you aren't in good shape.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/111stefaniad
50,The view from the top makes the hike!,"Runyon Canyon is at the top of my list of places to see in LA...as you walk up Fuller Avenue from Hollywood Blvd, you pass through a gate where you can slip a dollar bill into a slot to pick up a bottle of water before the hike begins...a lovely outdoor yoga studio is set on a secluded parcel of grass surrounded by bushes and yoga classes are held there throughout the day....once you walk past the yoga studio, the hike really begins...there are various trails that you can take but the main trail winds around to the right and then up to the first viewing spot...and then the cardiovascular portion of the hike commences....as you climb up a steep series of steps....the Hollywood sign beckons from across the canyon to your right as you ascend the hill...and once you get to the top, the panoramic view of the entire LA basin is one of the most dramatic vistas that you will ever see...on a clear day you can see virtually every tall building in LA from the snow capped mountains to the east all the way to the beach where the Palos Verdes peninsula and Catalina Island sit majestically in the Pacific Ocean...and for me, the most special part of hiking Runyon is going back down the steep face of the hill with this amazing panoramic vista dramatically in your view with every descending step that you take...there is very little shade on this hike so i would not recommend hiking Runyon in the middle of the afternoon on a hot day...the sunsets are best during the winter months when the sun sets directly into the ocean...dogs run free in Runyon Canyon without the need for leashes...yes the best things in life are free....and it won't cost you a penny to feel free on your hike through Runyon Canyon...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maitaifine
40,Great short hike with views,This is a great hike accessible from the centre of Hollywood and takes about 1hr30min return via the hard route and back down the major path. Challenging up the hard route but worth it for the higher vantage point with views across Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign too. There's also free yoga in the park at the entrance if that's your kind of thing ! Bring water as only a fountain at the bottom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peachiepagan

50,One of LA's Best Hikes,"On the weekend, you might feel a little like you're on the 405 because of so many people, but that's part of the fun. You have all different kinds of people taking this very challenging uphill hike. You probably should be a dog lover since they are all over the place. It's fun to name how many different breeds you see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelaFoodTravelGuru
50,Great for trail lovers,"1. Jeans and flip-flops are not recommended. I speak from experience. However, it can be done. Fortunately it was cool and overcast when we went. Bring water!2. Take the long route - trail to the left - and go all the way up to the top!! You might not believe me, but you will on the way down: This appears to actually be the easier path. The other route has huge, steep steps which you'll go down. Remember to thank me later.3. You'll have fantastic distance views of Los Angeles, the neighborhoods all around you, the Hollywood sign and Griffith Observatory during your walk. There were a lot of joggers and hikers and lots of well behaved dogs on the trail.4. Ignore the people who say to go to Griffith Observatory instead. Do both!!! This trail is fantastic for day-views.5. Parking can be a bear. Just find a spot in the neighborhood by the park entrance and enjoy the walk on pavement. There are no bathrooms, and water fountains are only at the entrance of the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seaLoves
40,Great View,"We went on a Wednesday at 9am and it was so busy! parking is a little tricky to find and you feel like you have already hiked by the time you walk from your car to the park :-) When you walk in I highly recommend that you take the path to the right. We took the left path and while we are not experienced hikers, we are fairly active and my gosh it was a little tricky. it is a dirt/rock path that is very uneven and quite steep in places, the view gets more amazing a lot quicker than the right hand side but we were only able to walk 1/3 of the way before having to turn around and make our way down (which is a little hairy) The Right hand side is a fully paved wide path/stairs that looks a lot easier to walk. I wouldn't say its the best view in LA but its a nice way to experience the LA Hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alisha88
50,Best view!,"It was my best hiking experience ever! Its a great hike up. Just make sure you have some water with you. You must go all the way up. You get the best view in LA. during the hike, you'll see the Hollywood sign, beautiful houses, Downtown LA, and my favorite, the cutest dogs! Also great place for pictures! Bring your cameras!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillV90
50,THE BEST!,"Quite simply, this is a gem - a wilderness in the middle of Hollywood. You can do the easy or the medium hike and explore the canyons of the Hollywood Hills quite easily. This is also a park where actors and actresses - or wannabees - go to be seen. It's not unusual to see female hikers in bikinis! This is where the ""Hollywood Sign"" scene from ""Seinfeld"" was filmed. The views of Hollywood are outstanding. It is also right above the ""Ozzie and Harriet"" Nelson house. It is literally a five minute walk from the Hollywood hotels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonphil
40,Great Hike!,"Love this hike, great way to view the city without being directly in it. Make sure to bring plenty of water and sunscreen, it can be very hot during the summertime and there's little shade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347summerw
50,so pretty and fun,"a must visit when visiting LA, feel like a local... and there's a chance you'll see a celeb:) it's dog and kid friendly! tere's even yoga in the park below!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryl083171
40,Tough Hike,"Short or long, It is not an easy one, b ut great people watching for sure. There are two directions, the hike up the stairs first is definitely the hard way",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tyjlevine
40,Get back to nature,"In what seems like one of the only refuges from the polluted skies of LA, Runyon Canyon is a great place to escape the concrete and smog! There are several different trails and paths to take and there's a lot of room even if it does feel like there's a lot of people.My only suggestion would be a couple of signs to let you know which trail you were on and where you were going - small wooden unobtrusive signs no taller than 3 foot.Tip: if you're new to the area, have a map on your phone so you can work out which path you've taken!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeStrachan
50,One of LA's Best Free Day Trips,"Runyon canyon is nestled in the heart of the Hollywood Hills. A favorite spot for locals to walk dogs and for hikes. Set just below the Hollywood sign, the more intrepid hiker can walk up to the ranch at the top of the canyon, which is the location of many famous films and rich in Hollywood history. Continue on past the ranch and walk the bridal trails along the ridges, connecting with the San Fernando Valley and the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O637PXmichaelp
50,Celebrity sightings,"Good place with varying terrain to run, walk, stroll, walk your dog, and spot celebrities. However, don't try to approach them- they are there to get their alone time too and might not seem that friendly, hence the ball caps and over sized sunglasses. ;)Great place to get great views of the city and get in a good workout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LinK29
40,Great views - good little walk ...,We went for a walk up Runyon Canyon as it is very near to Hollywood Boulevard and it's a great place to see panoramic views over the whole of LA on one side and the Hollywood sign on the other. There are different routes depending on how fit you are and I'd recommend taking a bottle of water as it got quite hot. You can also park quite easily in the surrounding streets - Well worth a go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaiofherts
40,"Great hike, views, etc., for you or old (if reasonably fit)",We went here as a family.... youngest was 16 and oldest was 65. It was a great hike with excellent panoramic views of the city. My only caution is that it is best done early in the day to both avoid the crowds and the heat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mitchelllafrance
50,Best part of my trip,"I visit every year and are sure to include this hike in my activities each time! It is an easy (what I would call) paved hike. I love the view as you hike overlooking the city and along the Hollywood sign. I take the same trail each year, but do know there is an easier option as well.Being from out of town, it is important I feel safe and I always do here, as there are usually so many people walking at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/515gailh
50,Great place to exercise,Runyon Canyon Park is a great place to get some exercise and enjoy lovely views of LA. One can choose a quick hike up to one of the many viewpoints or a more elaborate loop. We found parking a little challenging as there is no parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/936christianew
40,Neat spot,"Interesting spot - canyon with a bit of a view of the city - not the most scenic hike, but lots of city folks getting exercise. Worth it for a quick bit of exercise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fish_and_chips6
40,Where Hollywood Celebs go to hike,Off leash dog park which is very popular with locals and visitors. At a certain point dogs can be off leash and there are several hiking trails. Gets crowded on the weekends and parking can be a problem but great views on a clear day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mazkira
40,Great way to stay active and take in the view!,"Hiking Runyon Canyon Park was a fun way to stay active and get to see the spectacular views of LA and Hollywood, including the Hollywood sign. It was clear enough the morning we hiked that we could even see Catalina and the Pacific Ocean. We did the full loop with a stop or two in about an hour. It's a moderate hike with a couple of more challenging spots. Some areas were more crowded than others, but we had the trail to ourselves a few times and it was really peaceful to be away from the city hubbub. It was noticeably more crowded when we left the park mid-morning, so I would go earlier to avoid the crowds. I recommend wearing sneakers or comfortable walking shoes - it was pretty dusty when we were there so closed toed shoes are probably your best bet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478amyh
50,Beautiful trails and scenery!,"There is a great reward at the top of the hill at Runyon Canyon! Gorgeous views of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign...But be sure you bring comfy shoes, water, snacks etc. and are in ok shape to climb elevated trails. The trails are sometimes paved and sometimes dirt. They aren't necessarily well-marked but just follow the crowds. We went on a Friday afternoon so it wasn't too crowded. Lots of locals/tourists working out. The incline was rather steep at times so lots of huffing and puffing but it was worth it. There are rattlesnake signs and we saw a snake in the bush on the way up but don't let that deter you! The trails sometimes have rocks on it so just watch your step. Again, a great way to see LA from above!Parking was easy for us on the street...2 hour parking limit for free in front of an apartment building...It was a week day so I've heard it gets busier during the weekend but we had no problem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LP707
40,Great views - get there early for parking,"This is an excellent place to hike. Spectacular views. Parking area is just outside Katy Perry's gated home but get there early - it gets full. And DO NOT park in the no parking zones - we saw a group of girls come out to find their car towed away. We didn't see any celebrities (that we recognized, anyway) but apparently plenty live in the area. It's a well worn path - very urban for what is otherwise kind of a rural/residential canyon area - very high foot traffic, even on weekdays. Not really a ""getaway"" place if secluded hiking is your thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCgogirl
50,Had a blast!,I had a lot of fun walking up the trails. I was a bit lost as to where to go. I did see a trail map but it was hard to read. Go for it! Its an adventure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/455humberton
50,Perfect view,"Love to hike there in the morning, the only problem are the ""Actors"". Without a shirt at 7am in the morning hiking up Runyon: Sorry my Actors, at that time there is no talent scout, try around 11am",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/175benh
50,Amazing views,"If you are looking for sweeping views of Los Angeles, grab your exercise gear and hike here! The views from the top are incredible and definitely worth the hike. There are a couple spots that are really steep so be warned. We entered on Fuller and hiked our way to the top, but you can enter on Mulholland too at the top. Parking is pretty limited and it gets really sunny with not a lot of shade so go early. As people have mentioned, there are a lot of people and dogs on the trails. The dogs were all well behaved and adorable so I didn't have any problems. The whole hike took about an hour and a half stopping for pictures at the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/filinsk
40,Upwards hike with killer views the higher you go!,"I liked the views. The higher you go the better the view. You can see all of the LA attractions from up there. What I didn't like is that the hike can get steep and tiring. If you are a dog lover, you will enjoy the off leash dogs that hike here wit their owners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanneEnnaoJ
20,Better hiking with better views with no dogs and less people....,"People talk about this place like it's Mecca for hiking - I disagree. I used to live half a block away - corner of Franklin and Fuller - so I didn't have to fuss about parking - a complete nightmare and worsens everytime there is a celebrity sighting.Yes, it's steep, yes you get a good workout, yes, you can take your smelly, drooling dog, yes, celebs do go, yes, the views are fine - I had the same view from the roof of my building without the flies, dogs, cellphones and people....I have been dragged up regularly- every time I go, I swear I will never go back.If you insist on it, park on Mulholland and walk down - the Hollywood side is nightmare for parking.If you are desperate to feel like you're somewhere trendy, have the urge to have your dog sniff the butt of half the dogs in the city, and you love to hike in a pack - go for it....If you prefer to have fresh air to breathe, peace and quiet, with no dogs - avoid this place like the plague!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneM806

50,Awesome Hike but Beware,"Wonderful hike, but we kept going and going, and before I knew it we had to hike up some pretty steep hills and then come back down. The views were worth it! Sad to see all of the smog that looms over the city. Being from the midwest it was quite a shock. They need better transportation in that city to at least try to put a dent into the pollution.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/495elained
40,I Always Love Bringing My Dog On A Hike Here,"Maybe not five stars because it can be a little dry. But I love to bring my dog and hike Runyon Canyon. It's pretty friendly and a good workout. Not the best, but very good. Fun to go with friends, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outofdodge_10
50,Hike to a view.,It is a tough walk uphill but when you get there the view of the entire LA basin is incredible.. Go with someone who can point out the high points.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266jerryp
50,Great hiking and walking place!,We went because I've always wanted to hike a canyon plus I heard it's a good celebrity spotting site. No celebrities; but a great workout. There were lots of people walking and hiking which made me feel safer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/threepowells
50,The views are awesome!,"Very nice park with some challenging terrain (going up/down the east side?). The trail goes from loops from east to west and was a lot of fun. The views of the hills, city and Hollywood sign were very nice. Parking may be a little difficult. We went in the morning and were able to find a spot on the street which was free until noon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoyntonOU
40,Fun hike near the city with varying levels of difficulty,As many of you know this trail is popular with the celebrity crowd so it tends to draw more people than it might otherwise. With that said it is still a very nice hike and I like the fact that there are different trails to choose from depending on your level of conditioning/desired effort. Those of you that have dogs that are friendly will really enjoy bringing your pooch here as they are allowed off leash and able to explore freely. If you don't like dogs this place might be your cup of tea. It gets crowded on the weekends and you must be very careful of where you park. Make sure you read the signs as the ticket police are always going up and down the streets leaving their wonderful $70.00 happy notes on all the cars that didn't read the signs properly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottyS353
40,Good hike and awesome view!,"We left the Hollywood to do this instead and we were so happy when we got here. The hike around the mountains is alot of fun and once to get up to the top, the view of Los Angeles is just amazing. The city is sooo huge. Well worth getting sweaty for the view!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SwedishMartin
50,Beautiful scenery and great walk,My partner and I were so pleased that we visited Runyon Canyon. A challenging but enjoyable walk with great scenery over the large city and beautiful houses in the hills. A popular dog walking spot too. Highly recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccamD1613JA
50,Favorite Part of My Trip,"Amazing to me that there are these incredible trails to hike right in the middle of L.A. Great views with a mountain getaway feel. It was busy with lots of other hikers, but I think this is good for safety--who wants to be alone in a deserted park in a big city? My friend decided to see the sites on horseback on a hill a bit closer to the Hollywood sign, and had a great time too. I parked about a quarter mile away on Mulholland Drive. I'm glad I did because there were lines of cars for closer spots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElSojourner
40,Great Place to Go If It's the Right Time,"Yes, the views are amazing, you can take great pics and get in a workout. They have yoga on the lawn near the entrance Saturdays at 10 a.m. I believe. There's usually someone selling snacks & water near the entrance. Yes, it's possible that you might have a celebrity sighting while there (I've had 2).But, here are some things to know before you go:Try and go early! Because it is well known, tourists, dog lovers and neighborhood residents flock to this place. Depending on the time of year, it can get pretty hot and the sun can be intense (be sure to take water). Dogs are allowed to be off of their leash almost everywhere in the canyon. So, be careful where you step because everyone doesn't pick up after their pet and don't go if you're afraid of dogs. And lastly, know that there is only street parking (another reason to go early). Parking is VERY challenging during peak hoursPlan accordingly and you can have a great time :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaD888
40,Nice walk with great views,This is the ideal place to go if you want a walk in the Hollywood hills with the possibility of catching a glimpse of the Hollywood stars houses and possibly a star.The views of LA from the canyon are awesome so don't forget your camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/966gareths
50,No joke!,This hike is quite a workout for a 45 year old mother of 3 who only walks on level surfaces!! But I did it! There is a steep way with slow decline or you can walk it the other way. We did steep up to enjoy the way down. So glad we did because the surface on the downward area is covered in sand and you need to have excellent shoes to keep your footing. People were slipping on the way down as we were walking up.You can get a beautiful picture of LA as well as the Hollywood Sign on this hike. Also keep your eye our for celebrities. Saw one jogging. Dog allowed on path and many places they are allowed off leash. So there are a lot of dogs on the path. Happy Happy dogs!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/croppingfool
40,Not a leisurely stroll,"Loved hiking along the paved trails - the views were spectacular! It was nice to see all the people with their dogs. I was a bit surprised at the erosion of the trails and that there was no discernable parking lot - we had to park on the street very far away and then hike up to the park entrance. LOL - if you're out of shape - it's a workout to just get to the entrance. However, totally worth it to look down on the city and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheNaprapath

50,Walking Trail,Best trail in Hollywood to see Stars walking on the rail. Not the easies trail to walk but the views are awesome. See downtown LA and Hollywood and the Hollywood sign in distance. Parking is limited at Mulholland Drive but is the best place to start your walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LarryM812
50,Best views in Los Angeles,"We have been to a lot of cities and this is by far the best urban hiking we have ever experienced! It is like a daily mud mudder but with out the Mud! It has three levels of trails. 1st: easy is the center trail that goes right through the middle and and is paved and goes from the bottom to the top at mulholand dr. 2nd: medium level, it has some steps, steep incline and goes half way up the mountain to a bench.3rd level is the hardest, it goes from the bottom to the highest point in the park with views of LA from downtown to the ocean and also views of The Valley and Burbank. This one is just short of rock climbing and you will slide and use your hand to grip as you conquer this trail, it has many steps and few flat surfaces. Take lots of water with you and don't stop til you get to the very top where the benches are! It's well worth going the extra distance ;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/737travish
50,Very hot but great views of LA,"We hear alot about Runyon Canyon being THE place to go for a jog. Well it's very hilly but lovely views.

Not suitable for anyone with less than decent fitness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Australiafair2013
40,Great hike and viewpoint but needs major restoration,Griffith has better views of Hollywood sign and parking is very difficult on local streets...but the hike is good (i recommend going clockwise starting on the pavement first off of Vista Ave)...on a clear day...amazing views...and the hike is not easy and has almost no shade..1.0-1.5 mile roundtrip so bring water and take your time especially if not in shape,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshW768

50,"Great view, great hike","When I went to LA this was my favourite place. I went on a quick hike up on a few occasions during the week I was there and I loved it so much. It was a great view. The first time I went up I just followed a lady and ended up on top of the hard trail and then had to walk back down... getting down was definitely the tricky part because I thought I was just going to slip down. The second time I wanted to go on the medium trail and ended up on the easy one and then I got it right. If I had been in LA longer I would have taken a lot more time to explore this area, however my days were very busy so I only had a short time in the early mornings. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves a good walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rowenav484

Lots that shouldn't be seen and should stay home.Real shame LA limited the parking in the area so ride a bike there if you can or be prepared to walk a mile + if you even find parking, that is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IllTryAnythingTwice1
50,Hike up Runyon Canyon,"WOW! This was quite a hike! I thought I was relatively fit, but I had to make a few rest stops. The scenery blew us away. Our daughter lives about a half a kilometre away form the canyon and hikes there on a regular basis. We loved the fact that this exquisite natural park is right in the heart of LA and the views are spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skincarejen
40,"Awesome Views of the City, and the Hollywood Sign","It's a little crazy to realize that this amazing canyon is in the middle of a city of 3.8 million people. The hike up will definitely challenge you, but the views from the ridge are worth it.The park attracts all kinds-- from families on their morning walk to models. You really see the cross-section of the city population, because Runyon Canyon attracts 'em all. There are also lots of people with their dogs, and sections of the park are unleashed. So if dogs make you uncomfortable, this is probably not the spot for you.I would suggest getting there early in the morning, if you can. Not only will you beat the midday heat, it is easier to find parking on side streets around the park. I found free two-hour parking on N. Vista Street, but it was before 8:00 am.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinetv
40,Wear good hiking shoes,"What an oasis, in the middle of such a built up area! Three great walking tracks, one quite easy, one intermediate, and one, not for the feint hearted. If taking the ""walking"" track to the left, make sure your shoes have good tread, as the trip is thwart with sand, dirt, and small rubble that is difficult to grip on the way down.The view is stunning! Take a bottle of water, and wear a cap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisav323
50,Best unspoilt view of LA,"You have to work for this one- no cushy touristy shortcut. Car parking is a bit of a challenge but worth the perserverance.7km round trip hike into the HollywoodHills to some of the best views of Los Angeles. Need good walking shoes, sunnies, sunscreen and a hatWe went in February on a clear sunny day- pretty hot by the time we got to the ridge- but so worth it! Beware no toilets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mudda33
30,Need parking.....,We saw some look out points but we're unable to hike at all due to insufficient parking. We drove up and down the hill but found nothing. Gorgeous view though:),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rphsweet
50,Its a hard downhill but good practice if you live nearby. Lots of Dogs and Locals,"For some reason I'm always here mostly during the summer months when it can get extremely hot out in the park. Bring some water and plenty of sunscreen so you don't burn.The views here are some of the best you will get of the downtown L.A. skyline. Perfect for pictures and gets you close to the HOLLYWOOD sign. Its for hikers of all fitness levels however you will enjoy it much more if you are in good to great shape. Occasionally you may see some celebrity but mostly you get locals, tourist and lots and lots of dogs. There is a water station area where you can get water for you and your pup but plan on bringing your own water just in case.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FicoUCF
40,A workout with a view,"There are several different ways to climb Runyon. I take the hard way up, cursing the whole time, and the easy way down, making an oath to return soon. You can take your time with the climb and pretend to check out the view as you catch your breath! On a clear day, you can see from Culver City to Downtown LA. You can also catch a good view of the Hollywood sign and of Griffith Observatory. And when you're done sightseeing, you can look at the amazing hillside homes and wonder whether or not you'd want to live there. In the Spring, it stays pretty cool and the hills are lush and green. For the most part, people are friendly and, for those with pups, you can bring your dog to hike along with you. But bring water - for you and your pup - and, of course, bring bags to clean up any pooch droppings. And don't forget to put on sunblock, no matter what time of year. The sun burns bright in the Hollywood Hills! Parking can be a pain, especially Mondays and Tuesdays because of street cleaning in the area. Try a Wednesday or Thursday morning, around 10 or 11, and it'll be worth the sore legs the next day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J2920IRdawnl
50,Amazing Dog Friendly City Park,"If you are near Hollywood and in need of some nature but not wanting a long drive, Runyon Canyon is for you. Offering a number of trails at varying levels of stamina required, it is a great place to get away from it all without having to drive too far. And, if you are with your four footed best friend even better. It is a very friendly place to take your dog and get him some exercise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidkX4558TE

Lots of people around so you do not feel isolated and many hikers brought their dogs. It's a gorgeous place to hike and mix with the locals!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/920annmarieg
20,Too Much of A Scene,"This is a great place to hike with dogs, and it's a great place to bust your butt on some steep uphill climbs, it's also a great place to rubberneck at the random celeb if that's what you go hiking for. I don't. It's a struggle to find parking, often crowded, dog crappy, and obnoxious to hike behind people shouting into phones or loudly going over the details of their lives. Some are oblivious, some seem to just want attention. Since my ridiculously sniffy dog is not a good hiker, I leave her at home and hike a clean open trail that I'm not going to mention here (sorry, I know, that's a jerky move.)Runyon is a great workout, and I'm glad to have gone a couple times. I heard a hilarious filthy joke from some guys walking in front of me, and it actually was a bit of Hollywood fun to nearly smack into Ben Stiller and his wife.If you want a real LA city hike, this is the perfect place for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flymonkey

50,Hike the Canyon,"Runyon Canyon park is the perfect place to get outdoors and walking/running. The park offers perfect views of LA and the Hollywood hills.Take water with you and some comfortable shoes. You can spot the odd celeb or just watch all the model like people running around the park.I've seen earlier posts regarding dog mess but we didn't see any at all, and all the dogs were well behaved.This is a park area, but there are no toilets/restrooms so go before you visit the park.Go early to get a parking spot, but people are coming and going all the time so you shouldn't have to wait long or find somewhere sensible to park.Will make Runyon Canyon a regular part of our LA visits from now on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MQ85

50,Best Place to Hike in LA,"If you have 30 minutes and you need to clear your head - head up to Runyan Canyon from Hollywood Boulevard. It's a real scene and it can be as challenging as you want it to be, with the different levels of hikes available. Evenm the 'easy' one will get you sweating on a cool LA day. And the bonus is, once at the top, you can take a deep breath, look at the Hollywood sign and the snowy mountains, downtown LA and take in Palos Verdes and the Pacific Ocean. That's when you can really appreciate how beautiful LA really is!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3574MTmichaelt

Also, watch where you step - lots of dogs and if you have little ones who are afraid of dogs - DO NOT COME! Dogs are allowed off-leash.Nice exercise if you are trying to get into shape, good incline but lots of folks checking each other. Lots of younger folks, even movie/tv stars at times. Hard to find on-street parking but not impossible.In the heat of summer, come early and enjoy the view or come very late and enjoy the sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollyK263
40,"Great views, good workout, too much dog doo!","Runyon is a great hike up the hill to amazing views of the city below. Unfortunately, it's a bit over-used, both by persons and dogs.

50,Great trails with stunning views,Always wanted to hike in LA and finally did it in summer. Definitely recommend it. Plenty of different trails and something to suit everyone.Here is a blog I wrote on my experience and parking options and other attractions near by:https://www.travelblog.org/North-America/United-States/California/Los-Angeles/blog-870689.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovetravelll
50,Nice hiking in LA,"There is a plenty of routes in the park and it can be a nice walk/run. You can also see Hollywood sign from there, but if you also want nice picture of it you should have a camera with good optical zoom or go to some other place.Btw. there is very small parking lot. So I would advice you to go there in the morning when it is much easier to park there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrikb273

50,"Peaceful spot, magnificent views and great for hikers and runners.","If it wasn't for my hiking tour with USA Hostels Hollywood, I would have never found this park at all. I also wouldn't have booked the tour if I knew how much of a hike it would be in the middle of 30 degrees Celcius.However I saw runners going up and down the hill, as if it was a piece of cake and even though I was well prepared with my sneakers and outfit, I really thought it was hot. I don't regret taking the tour anyways because it was a real surprise once you got on top of the hill.No toilets up the hill of course but there are enough bushes around because you will need to go after drinking lots of water on your hike. You really need to drink a lot because the heat even in October for those that aren't used to it, can be tough unless you drink well. Bring some Gatorade as well because water alone won't be enough to feel fit.After climbing for about 40 minutes max, you get to see LA the way you won't expect it. You can look far across the horizon untill the smog blogs your view. Our tourguide explained to us very well what we saw and I took some amazing pictures from the top. Going downhill was a challenge for me as I am not a hiker at all. It was quite steep but not at all dangerous other than that you had to really pay attention to the trail.The steep part wasn't long and we took the short road down the hill which we also could have taken up the hill. Even though it was much hotter than I am used to in Valencia, Spain I enjoyed this hike more than I expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Escobana
40,Great views from Inspiration Point,"This trail can be approached from both sides but the right side is the fastest way to get to Inspiration Point. For non-hikers, that is a destination in its own right. On a clear day, the view is amazing. Continuing on leads to a difficult section that has a number of stairs of assorted heights and has no rails to help support you during this portion. Once past that the trail is once again a dirt path. This is also a leash free park for dogs and if you love dogs, you could just sit at either the bottom or at Inspiration Point and just watch every conceivable breed of dog go by. One drawback is there is no parking lot so you must find parking in the street. The streets have a greater incline than the park trail so it is a strenuous effort for people who aren't used to walking on hills. Well worth the time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pineaway
40,Nice loop trail hike for average hiker..great views...limited parking,"This is a very nice park with a nice loop hiking trail (about 2 miles round trip with 700' elevation change) in Hollywood. The main loop trail goes from the base of the ridge to the top and back down and is great for average hikers. There are side trails. One steep one goes higher up the ridge and a flat one goes to the end of the canyon. You can park in Hollywood which is very limited and hiked up to the top and back down or park at the top off Mulholland Drive and hike down and back up. There is more parking at the top. The views are nice on a good day. Once pass the entry point, dogs can run off leash but remember to put them back on leash before crossing back into the entry points of face a hefty fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tennessee50plus
50,Rustic retreat in heart of Hollywood!,"I've spent my entire pathetic life living in L.A., but only recently found out about this awesome place. It's dog-friendly, and most of it is off-leash, so bring your loveable canine. I have a gimp parking permit (you don't?), but for normal peeps, parking is challenging. Read the signs, and be prepared to walk several blocks.Great place for girl watching, as there's some world-class tushie in them thar hills. I suppose there are handsome men as well, but that's not my thing (not that there's anything wrong with it!).Anybody who gives Runyon less than 4 stars has a negative outlook on life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mavenbay

Incredible views of the city and ocean, beautiful hill side homes, lots of fit AND TALENTED people climbing with their pets . . . just a great and fun activity. If I lived there, this would be on tops list of fun things to do especially exercise wise. Do not get in over your head if you go to peak as way down may not be fun for the inexperienced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SalGold
50,Amazing views of LA,"This hike has two entrances, if you want something a little more challenging, start at the bottom. It's full of dogs, both leashed and unleashed, but all are friendly.

40,Great Hikes and Views including Hollywood Sign,"Hiked Runyon several times in 2014. On a clear day, you can see the ocean and of course, even not on a clear day, the Hollywood Sign is visible. The trails are pretty steep, more of an intermediate level hike, but one can go for about 15 minutes to a viewing point before the stairs and steeper climb. The first trail on the left was a little more strenuous (coming from Hollywood, not Mulholland). Bring lots of water and sun tan lotion. Also, it is a dog friendly off leash park so if afraid of dogs, keep that in mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelfourless
40,Lovely views and great exercise!,We entered the park from N Fuller Ave because it was a block away from where we were staying (the bottom of the hill) - it ended up being a great idea to go uphill first and then cool down while going downhill on the way back. There are some nice views but it does get really hot so be prepared for that (appropriate clothing and lots of water)! We went on an early morning mid-November - it was scorching hot but a nice way to start the day. There are some benches here and there that are nice for when you want to take a break or simply take in the views of the hills/city. We noticed that there is a small snack/beverage stand at the entrance on Fuller that seemed to run on an honesty basis. We didn't bring the car but noticed that there are various parking lots along the trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/990christinag
40,"Scenic views, steep hills","Great place to walk. Te views are great and it is a great workout. There is an area of the park for dogs to be unleashed. Surprisingly, they walk to the edge and know not to go over. The hills are steep so make sure to bring lots of water. The only negative of the park is the parking in the area is difficult. Even if you find a spot, you can only be there for two hours.Overall, a nice place for a hike/workout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Norjeff2
50,Great hike for a self proclaimed indoors girl,"There are a few routes you can take, but none of them are too strenuous. The views are incredible and it's a nice uphill walk.

50,Great views!,"We went Christmas Day so it was very busy with people and dogs off leash..which I loved but crowded. The views are amazing of the entire city of LA plus out to Santa Monica, also gorgeous houses along the hill sides. The hike is easy and you can pick how long you want to go but it's a bit rocky at parts. An absolute must on a visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaK05
30,"Nice hike, lots of people",If you're looking for a hike without people this isn't for you. Its a very popular trail and does give you a bit of a workout getting to the top. If you take the whole circle going to the left to start is a easier way up. Going the right it quicker but much steeper. It offers nice views of La and you can see the hollywood sign off in the distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/539samt

50,Nice day-hiking spot,"I love how L.A. has all these great hiking spots. I've hiked here a few times and always see a lot of people and a lot of dogs. It's an uphill climb, enough to get a little winded. You get a good view at the top. It's a dirt trail and the way down can be a little slippery, so don't wear smooth-bottomed shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingyogi

50,"Yoga in the park, 2 or 3 times a day--great workout","I enjoyed staying in an apt. close to Runyon Park. I did yoga in the park every morning, but there were late morning and afternoon classes, all for free--and the yoga was decent, not 'namby-pamby' pretend yoga. The Canyon is a pretty straightforward place to hike. Lots of dogs so if you don't like dogs off leash (well behaved ones), stay home. The canyon slopes look intimidating but it's really easy for those in decent shape to do the 2 mile circular hike, and you DO get a great view of the Hollywood sign along the way. Other canyon reviews say that everyone goes there to 'see and be seen' but I saw plenty of 'normal' people just like me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmwhitt
40,Great view of LA,"We started our trek up from Fuller. There is a honor system drink and snack at the gate and I suggest you get a bottle of water if you don't have one. If you want to make a complete loop, start your walk up the right side trail which has steeper climb as you ascend the hill. As you climb the right side you will be able to see the path on the left that we used to descend. We found climbing the right path better because going down the steeper path looked very treacherous.We enjoyed the beautiful views of LA and the cool weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dustbusters
50,Perfect morning activity,"Parking wasn't a problem at all. We arrived about 10:00am and there were several spots on the street. From the time we left our car to the time we returned it took about an hour and that was with frequent stops and picture taking/view admiring. When you walk into the opening, I would suggest taking the trail to the left on the way up so you can make the circle and take the trail to the right on the way down. The trail to the left is a slope while the trail to the right is stairs (easier to go down than climb up). Spectacular views and fun, free activity. bring a camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurenleal

50,"Fantastic views, great workout","I lived in LA many years and never knew about this hike, and what a thing to miss! As other reviewers noted, the views from up on top are fantastic -- a panoramic view of LA, from downtown through all of Mid-City and the West side. It's a great way to understand LA geography, and where else can you hike mountains smack in the middle of US metropolis?. It's also a bit of a lesson in LA culture -- you can't help noticing that so many of the people hiking look ""beautiful"" -- meaning, they work at it to consciously look physically appealing; we're talking guys with muscles in all the right places (shirtless, of course), young women straight out of magazines with just that right shade of blonde. I actually rarely notice that posing in LA (despite the reputation), but it's definitely on full view up in the mountains.Also to repeat a few recommendations mentioned by others: start at the bottom for the full workout and gradual views of the city; don't be in a rush -- enjoy the nature and views (and posing) at a leisurely pace; and bring something to drink, as it gets hot, and I didn't notice any water along the way...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/914bj
50,Great hike!,"I really enjoyed my hike at Runyon Canyon's Eastern trail. There can be crowds, but if you start early in the day (I got there around 8am) they are smaller and the heat isn't so bad. The views from the top are phenomenal- make sure you keep pushing your way all the way to the very peak- lot's of people peel off early after it plateaus for a while. The last bit is worth it!I took the eastern trail, which wasn't too bad of a hike though I wouldn't want to do it around 1pm on a hot day. Bring lots of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichDC87
50,Great Way to Start Your Morning,"With temperatures rising to the upper 90s, we wanted to get to Runyon Canyon early. We certainly weren't the only ones with that idea as it was really hard to find parking nearby and there was plenty of activity on the trail. We did the shorter, easier inside loop, which was still challenging, especially with the temp rising and the sun beating down on you. But it was a great reward when reaching the overlook. While its sometimes nice to have more isolated hikes, it was also fun to see so many Angelenos in their natural element: exercising.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffb293
50,Saw Steven Tyler!!!,"I'll start by saying, I did zero research prior to hiking Runyon Canyon. My friend said let's go hiking today and I said, sure I'm up for it. Well, for starters bring a lot of water, I mean a lot. I think I saw one fountain for the doggies, which is much needed because it was pretty warm up there.I'm no fitness guru and hiked several different places in Arizona, and there's a part going uphill at Runyon with steep steps, that I found to be extremely challenging. At first I thought, ok it's just me and I'm over-exaggerating the steps. No, no, no! After the first section of steps, I thought I was going to pass out. Then the level of embarrassment settled in when I was being passed up by other hikers staring me down while I was trying to find any ounce of shade. Well, I continued on and finished! This random guy walked up and said, ""You got this! That section of steps is challenging, I do it three times a week.""There's several different entrances and routes to take. If you're not up for the the step challenge, start at the top and work your way down. If not, start at the bottom. The views are amazing! You can see the Hollywood sign and all the beautiful homes in the canyon.Keep an eye out for the celebs... Within five minutes of our hike, we saw Steven Tyler!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColorOfTravel

50,Nothing like hiking in Ohio!,"We came here based on the recommendation of a co-worker who had visited the area in the past. I'd never heard of Runyon Canyon before or did any research before we went hiking, let me tell you this place was excellent and would go again in a heartbeat. BRING WATER!!!! As others pointed out, there is no parking at the site, you have to park on the street, but we went during the week it wasn't hard to find parking for us. We entered at the Fuller Ave entrance. I would recommend going up the path to the left, at first we where 2nd guessing ourselves for making that choice because we could see people hiking at the top of the ridge and that looked like a great place to see the view. The advantage is the we where on was a very gradual incline, if we where to to have gone the other way we would have had to climb some very steep ""stairs"" if that what you want to call them. We had the advantage of coming down those stairs, which was still kind of difficult. As for the views at the top, they where worth the walk. We stopped several times to take pictures as we where hiking and the view seemed to keep getting better. Also you can easily see the Hollywood sign from the top if you look over the other side. Overall it was an awesome experience and would recommend to anyone definitely one of the highlights of our trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SilverFox81
40,what a congregation of beauties,"it seemed like anyone who wanted to get fit in downtown LA was here at Runyon Park.We were there for a stroll, but from the likes of it, there were two types of park users.the fitness guys, and the non leash dog walkers.everywhere you look, beautiful ladies keeping themselves in shape.we did a half hour walk upto one of smaller peaks. but hey! we were on vacation, no need to push it!when we realised that we would be tired all day if we made it to the top, so early in the morning, we decided to do something smart, we just went back down and drove to the top!!! :D :Dhave fun, lots of beauty in this part of town!There is a major parking issue here. you cant just park anywhere you want, there are permits and limits everywhere, and the parking attendants are on it all the time! so watch out!also, really cool was the availability of poopy bags to clean up after your dogs, free for everyone! now that is what you call community involvement!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fahym
50,Bucket List,"I've read a lot over the years about hiking up runyon canyon and it's certainly something I've always wanted to do. I read up about it before my trip and was aware of the different entrances and routes. Unfortunately on this visit time was not on my side and I couldn't hike from the bottom as I would have liked but I was desperate to experience it in any way I could. I'd read online there was parking on Mulholland Drive so put it into my satnav and found it easily. Parking is definitely limited but we got lucky. I noticed people come and go regularly so don't be too hasty. I'm not too sure what I had in mind about this park or what I expected, I just wanted to say I'd been and hiked in LA! The walk from here is SHORT and in no way challenging but still busy enough and if you are short on time or not feeling fit enough you can absolutely do it! It 100% is still a workout. It took about 10/15 to get to the very top but we stopped for pictures. It was extremely hot so water was a must. The view from the first flat piece of ground was lovely - mansions on the hills, downtown LA skyline and most importantly the Hollywood sign! Continue walking and you come to steps - these were challenging for my little legs but still doable and the view was so worth it. I sat reflecting from the benches on top and felt so happy and peaceful. Looking down I could see others hiking from the bottom and the traffic downtown and more mansions. It was so quiet serene and warm and I am so glad I did it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovetravelll
40,No slackers on this hill!,"Runyon Canyon has a beautiful path to hike on. This is not for the beginner, or the mid-westerner. Well, I was able to handle it, but was expecting a path that had some shade and a place to picnic. This isn't that kind of park. I wouldn't recommend bringing a dog. This is a hike for fit people that like the hot sun. Beautiful views here. Bring a camera and a lot of water. Parking kinda stinks too-- so plan extra time for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnsgirl29
20,dusty and views of smog,"Maybe it's because I'm not a city girl and was raised in a more rural area, but this was not a 'hike'. so so dusty and the views of LA just make you realize how polluted it is. there were a lot of people slipping on the steep areas of the trail because it was so dry. apart from this, it was definitely a good workout but get there early because there is limited parking and a line waiting for your spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilyc209
40,Great spot to hike in LA,I went with some friends and it was worth it even though it was summer and super hot. The trails are nice and really good to exercise or just have a nice view of the city! Totally recommended specially if you are close to the walk of fame and want to do something fun without spending a penny...just make sure to bring enough water!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicolasRuiz
50,Phenomenal Views of Los Angeles,"I'd like to start off by saying that I am a fairly advanced hiker, and that the more advanced trails were the perfect challenge. I do have some advice;1. Wear a hat, there is barely any shade of there and it's extremely hot, and the sun is powerful.2. Bring lots of water, I'm so happy I did or it would have been quite the struggle3. Make sure you go to the washroom beforehand, it's not easy to sneak off in the bushes, considering many of them are cacti.4. Where shoes with a lot of grip. Since it's so dry up there it's not really dirt anymore, it's dust. Some parts of the hike are very steep, and I slipped a few times.Other than that, this hike provides amazing views of the city, you can see as far as the smog will allow you, haha. My favourite view was being able to see the ocean, and seeing the planes landing and taking off from lax in the distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/914leanad
40,Great hike,"If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of LA, a short drive to this Park will do just fine.It's a gentle hike with some great views. Parking is available as it a port-a-potty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pampemt
50,Great hike!,"This is a great place for a fun nice morning run/hike. Gorgeous views and lots of fellow hikers! The earlier in the day you go the cooler it will be. Make sure to bring water with you, I didn't notice any water fountains on the trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLovesToVacation
50,My new favorite hiking spot.,"First time at Runyon, very easy hike, pet and kid friendly. Will definetely go back for more, but next time without the grand daughter. I loved the hike, it was moderate, but pushing a stroller uphill is no fun at all. Did enjoy over all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/572luzs
40,its crowded causes its cool,"I hike Runyon a few times a week... but that's because i live right there. If you want to take the ""hike"" you've seen in countless movies, you'll have a great time. On a clear day you can see from downtown to the ocean and visibility is always best after a good rain. On an average day, you can see a great reminder of how much smog there is in LA. There are essentially three trails from the bottom (the iron man, the almost workout and the stairs, ). The iron man is the most western trail (tough throughout), the almost workout i(almost a workout) s the center trail and the stairs are the eastern most path (tough for ten minutes only). If you have more time on your hands, hike in malibu, Fryman or griffith. don't go midday as it gets hot and crowded. if you have a dog, bring one. if you see an idiot yelling after his dog ""bobdylan! bobdylan!"" that's me. So say hello.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravellingWorm
40,Great Hike!,Drove up the hill to Runyon Canyon Park. Hiked a couple of the hills for about an hour. It was great to see so many different people get up there to get some exercise. Would definitely recommend it if you feel like being healthy! Definitely go early in the morning before the sun starts beaming down (we went around 8-9am and it was good)!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AS5000
50,Great hiking canyon just off Hollywood Blvd.,"After braving the crowds along Hollywood Boulevard and the Walk of Fame, we walked 2 blocks North to Runyon Canyon entrance. The trail runs in a loop that starts near street level and raises up to the top of the canyon. It was a pretty good workout for us but there were joggers and a few mom's pushing strollers. Once we looped around at the high point, we had a nice view of the Hollywood sign. Good photo op of sign and the opposite direction of downtown LA. Running shoes recommended...I wore sandals and had blisters. There was a cart at the entrance to purchase water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrunaF150
40,Great Hike with Great Scenery,"We were on an extended vacation during Late June 2014 and enjoy staying active and seeing new and different places. We had heard that parking can be fierce here so we decided to get their relatively early and go during the workweek while others were hopefully at work. We arrived shortly after breakfast, and went to the Mulholland Drive entrance to avoid climbing up the entire canyon. Parking was tight, but we did manage to find a spot. However, there were always people circling the lot looking for a place, because spaces are limited and street parking is rumored to be risky due to ticketing. The hike itself was easy to moderate in difficulty. There were a few hills and steps to climb, which I would consider exercise, but it was by no means strenuous. We walked for about 2 miles round trip and made it out onto one of the overlooks, which provided us with a great view of Downtown LA, Hollywood, and some of the homes in the Hollywood Hills. I would definitely return and explore new trails and other overlooks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Im-Batman1971
50,Great way to feel like a local!,"Great hike to get fit and see views of the city. Keep in mind there's a few entrances, each higher and higher. Parking is easier to find midway up the hike where there is a parking lot, otherwise its tricky finding a spot in the residential streets. Regardless its still a fair hike up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/810jennyl
50,Awesome views within minutes of Hollywood,"Wherever I go -- city, town, wilderness -- I always seek out great places to hike and bike. I wasn't disappointed in Hollywood, when I found this park on the map just a few blocks from the busiest part of Hollywood.Take Hollywood Blvd. west to La Brea Ave., then north to Franklin and a block west to Fuller, where you turn right. You come to a dead-end street where the park begins. Such a quiet, pleaceful place with amazing views of Los Angeles if you take the trails even halfway to the top. If you're lucky, you may even see someone famous, although I didn't. And I went three times. The trees in this park look like giant pineapples, which is really interesting. And you will find other people using it no matter what time of day you choose to go. It's a little dry and dusty, so don't wear white shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freed0mt0travel
50,Beautiful,"Runyon Canyon is a beautiful place to hike or run anytime of the day. Beautiful views, brilliant atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Claire1157
50,Great hiking for people of moderate abilities,"My husband and I spent a few hours hiking here and loved it. The trails are good for people of moderate abilities. It was HOT so be sure to pack lots of water. We got very dusty too, so make sure a shower is soon to follow when you're all done. The hiking itself was great. Lots of little trails to take which will eventually bring you to nice views of LA, the houses of Hollywood Hills and the Hollywood sign. If you're lucky, you may spot a celebrity or two along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MandyJennifer
40,Beautiful view of LA,"Fairly new to hiking having only hiked the Grand Canyon I thought this would be a walk in the park. Boy was I wrong.I went around 8am on a Thursday. I entered the park from Mulholland drive after reading the reviews abt parking nightmares along the Fuller and Vista entrances. Parking was a breeze, got a spot in the lot right away. The hike to the highest point was abt 5 mins for me. Gorgeous view of LA minus the early morning smog. I could even catch a glimpse of the Hollywood sign.My journey should have ended there but the adventurous side of me said keep going. Long story short: I made it down to the vista entrance then realized I had to hike back up. No water or food on hand. Bad planning on my part but since I had a big breakfast I went for it anyway. Good thing I had on a hat.Hiking down the canyon wasn't bad. Some uneasy moments but no biggie. I completely ignored all the signs abt unsafe conditions. The incline coming back was pretty serious and steep. I don't know what trail I was on but it was unpaved and I met some stairs along the way. I took several rest breaks, unshaded unfortunately. All together it took me abt 2.5 hours to complete. By the time I made it back to the top the smog had diminished and the Hollywood sign was clear.Advice: wear appropriate sneakers or hiking shoes to support your ankles and with a supportive toe box. I can see how easy blisters can occur with the steep declines. Bring water. Wear a hat and some sunscreen. Don't forget your camera(s). Enjoy the beauty of Gods creation.PS: I ended up going back a few days later to catch the sunset! Breathtaking reddish-orange hues! My guess is that sunrise is even more beautiful bc it would overlook the city as opposed to the sunset overlooking the mountains. Either way it's a must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Syreena

40,"Big Walk, Big Views","Runyon Canyon is an awesome place to visit if you're holiday takes to Hollywood. We stayed on Hollywood Blvd and the Canyon is within walking distance. The paths can be quite steep and physically demanding in parts, but the views from the top are definitely worth it. From the top you can look out to downtown LA, Century City and Hollywood immediately below you. We stayed in Hollywood recently for 3 nights and did the trek twice, it's that good. Very popular with tourists and locals alike, so be prepared to share the tracks with others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/372willl
40,Hike is straight up but the views are worth it!,"I recently did an early evening hike here and the time could not be more perfect. Started out about 7 p.m. with a 8:08 sunset time. We had plenty of time to reach the top to take in amazing views of the Hollywood sign, downtown LA, Santa Monica and the observatory. Tips would be expect a good incline hike, bring water, good traction shoes and a hat/sunscreen. Lots of people so a very safe hike and the four legged guys are pretty well mannered here too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli

Great views of LA and distant view of Hollywood sign. Gets hot so be prepared with water and choose your time of day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/231brendanh
50,Top of the world,One of the things I miss about living in Los Angeles is taking a hike in this incredible park to the top of the mountain where you can view the city in its immense size. Fun thing to do is watch the planes land and observe the freedom the dogs who frequent this park enjoy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cool4lfe
50,Yoga & hiking,"We started with a nice yoga class on the front garden, you can view the schedule on the Runyon Canyon yoga Facebook page. We then went for a hike up the hill, it took about 30 mins and was seriously hot, but a great way to see the city, and good views of the Hollywood sign. A great workout too, make sure you bring water, there are fountains to fill up at the bottom. Don't park on the closest side of Hollywood Blvd - we were confused by the signs and thought it was safe to park but luckily we saw a warden who told us it was permit only, and a lot of people got tickets. We parked on Gardner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LFKK000
50,If you like to hike,If you like to hike this is your place. With a view of the city in the background and several summits that you can get to the top of and take in the view this is a great place. Also the distance and degree of elevation this is not for beginners you have to be able to hike to be able to do the whole thing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrentJ293
50,What an experience!,I walked Runyon Canyon a few years back with my nephew who comes here frequently. I thought I was in good shape until I was making my way up.

40,Run on into Runyon!,"An exercise place to see and be seen. People bring their dogs too but I can't tell if they really bring them for the run or for an excuse for cute attractive people to talk to them. Seriously though, the hike is substantial and the scenery is nice. The parking is sparse but somehow you always find a space before you want to give up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deabs8
40,Something Genuine in L.A. to Be Proud Of,"I'm a native Los Angeleno....I'm in my 60's and yes, my city, no, actually, some of the people here deserve the negative press they get. Growing up here in the 50's and 60's I remember how much more nature there was then. Now, we have traffic and way too many transplants.Fortunately, we have Runyon Canyon. No, it's not perfect, but there are days when it's spectacular. On those days, when it's clear, you can look west and see Santa Barbara Island nearly 60 miles away. You can look east and see the show capped San Gabriel and San Jacinto mountains as much as 100 miles away. To the south you can see Long Beach harbor and southwest LAX. In between all of this you can see the entire L.A. basin and all of its landmarks. To each their own. The views are only part of what Runyon offers.You can access Runyon canyon from the bottom near Vista street, but parking is difficult as it is a residential area. Best to park a few blocks away and walk or take a cab or bus. I live in the hills, so I access Runyon from the top entrance on Mulholland drive. There is a parking lot that fills up quickly on nice days. You can park on Mulholland, but take care to obey the no parking signs. From the city side, take Outpost up from Franklin and make a left on Mulholland.There are a few routes to take up and down that can become loops from about 2 1/2 to 3 1/4 miles. If you start at the bottom be ready for a fairly steep climb. It can be very tough if you want. I chuckle a those starting at the top and running down at the thought of the look on their faces as the deal with the steep return.Bad stuff.....Dogs are not the problem, it's their owners. While the vast majority pick up after their animals, enough don't and that creates quite a stench on warm days. It's disgusting. Rattlesnakes....yup, we've got them, so venture off the trails and roads at your own risk. Water. Bring water. Closing times. Be sure to read the posted hours and be extra careful not to get your car locked in the lot. Drive carefully on Mulholland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/powerharp
40,Nice place for a walk,Nice quiet park for walking. Not a place for sitting down and relaxing. Good view of LA and the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidwP2580FS
40,Surprising hike in tourist heaven,"I wasn't expecting much from this urban hike. and was pleasantly surprised. There are 3 main routes through the canyon: easy medium and hard. Hard involves steep, dusty trails but also the best views in the park. All three are dog-friendly. Im a fairly avid hiker, and did about 4 miles in this park in 2 hours wearing sneakers, jeans shorts, and carrying a purse.Great views of LA, Hollywood, and of course THE sign.Warning: there's no parking at the southern end of the canyon. Parking is very limited at the northern end. You'll be lucky to find street parking anywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellej869

50,"Afternoon hike, awesome views of the city","This was a great hike and had beautiful views the whole way up. We took the steep way up, and it was a good way to break a sweat. Once getting to the top we started taking the longer, less steep way back down, but ended up exploring more trails. Spent an entire afternoon hiking around Runyon. Definitely recommend if you're visiting LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scyrn

50,Great hike with amazing views,"This hike can be as easy or as competitive as you want it to be. The shorter route takes about 45 minutes. If you want to go all the way to the top, expect about 2 1/2 hours. It is totally worth it! Beautiful views and a good possibility of a celeb sighting. If you start up the right side, it is a more difficult climb but it has the best views of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunTravelsfor2

40,Excellent views but a little crowded,"While visiting L.A., I would recommend making a morning out of driving Mulholland Drive and going to Runyon Canyon for a hike. Be prepared though, as parking can be a problem. There is a small lot and we had to wait a bit for someone to leave to get a spot. It was a longer trail than we expected if you do the whole thing. If you are not a serious hiker or in regular clothes, you can go an easier way to the left on a paved path and enjoy the views including awesome houses, the city, and the Hollywood sign. If you want exercise, there is a longer hike with lots of steps in places. There are more people than we expected hiking and lots of dogs. We did not mind, but if you are not a dog person keep that in mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbarrentine10
40,Perfect for Dogs,"This trail is great if you are a dog lover. If you are not, then I would not recommend this hike for you since most dogs are off leash and you can be bothered by them. Most of them are well behaved and won't bother you, but my friend got caught up as he was running up the trail in a canine wrestling match. As a result, he scraped up his knees and the worse part was that he was trying to beat his record. This is a overcrowded trail, parking stinks and Parks &Recreation as well as other moving vehicles drive around. Not my idea of a peaceful hike. I enjoy the peace of hiking Yosemite trails like Glacier Point where you rarely see any people in site. My Lab loved the hike!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Guapastravel
50,Great Workout,Great hike and view I suggest wearing good shoes. On the way down the canyon it has an extreme slope and you can fall. There also a lot of dogs out on a nice day so if you have a problem with dogs being off leash this might not be for you,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chad54321
50,Hike in Runyon Canyon Park!,"We really enjoyed a hike in the hills at Runyon Canyon! It was a great spot. It is a good hike to the end and back. There are great views of L.A. and all around. Lots of beautiful houses and you get a great view of the Hollywood sign. We went to the 'Runyon Canyon Park' entrance and hiked from there. It was a little tricky to get a parking spot on the street but we found one after a few trips around the block. Watch the parking signs. There are parking rules for different days of the week. There were a lot of people going for a hike. People with their dogs, families and friends. There was also a small stand at the entrance to buy snacks and water but no one is at the stand. You are expected to be honest and pay for what you take. We loved that! It was a great way to spend time in the sunshine in L.A!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulaCanada4

50,Great morning or afternoon hike/intense walk!,"Me, my wife and our newborn daughter went to Runyon Canyon on a Monday afternoon at 2:30 PM. It was definitely intense for us. My wife hasn't gone on something so intense since the baby was born so it was was challenging but she made it through most of the trail. I am a runner and my legs were burning from it. The views are gorgeous, the weather was perfect. Great place for walking dogs or going for a trail run.Not so easy to find parking, even in the middle of the day on a Monday, but you can always find something eventually.This is definitely a great place to go if you want some fantastic views of Los Angeles, and you may even bump into some celebrities (we didn't see anyone).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerSBen
50,Awesome views,"Hiking trails...Medium and hard, We didnt plan on hiking to the top as we were not dressed appropiately. We had on jeans, regular shoes and nice shirts. Just went up to take a couple pictures. Glad we went to the top. The views over Hollywood and Los Angeles are well worth it, breath taking. very dog friendly",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CChristie966
50,Not just a dog park,"Almost three decades of living in Los Angeles and I only just recently experienced Runyon Canyon. I always thought of it as a dog park--and it does have that reputation, and I did get knocked over by an exuberant mutt--but it is so much more than that. Accessible from the Hollywood area, a round-trip two-hour hike along any of the paths of this park will provide you with majestic views of the city from numerous angles. Unlike Griffith Park--which I also love, but which can sometimes feel intimidating by its sheer expanse, Runyon Canyon is very manageable. It is easy to see where you want to go and how to get there without feeling like you're going to get lost or end up in a longer trek than you were planning on. If dogs bother you, however, Runyon Canyon is not the spot for you. There are a lot of doggies in this area and for much of the park they are not required to be on a leash. Also, the park is popular and generally quite populated so don't expect seclusion. Do, however, expect a nice bit of exercise and an extremely nice view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/picsoflilyblog
50,Still one of my favorite hikes in the world!,"I've been hiking in Runyon Canyon since 1994 when I lived right down the street. Back in the day when there might be a dozen other people in the whole park at any given time. This canyon is now quite a bit more popular, a tourist attraction you might say with lots and lots of people there at all times of the day, but it's still the same really great hike with the same spectacular views. Runyon Canyon is not only a dog friendly hiking Mecca, but if you take the time to check into it, there's some really cool history behind it all.One thing I am bummed about... They used to have one big wooden park bench at the top that was set up on concrete blocks so that when you got to the top, your ""prize"" was to sit on the bench with your feet dangling like a little kid, soaking up the incredible views of the city.Now, presumably based on volume of hikers, there are two metal benches, ground level, and you're lucky if you get a spot at all.Regardless, I love Runyon Canyon! The meditative energy, surrounded by Palm trees, brush, singing birds and views of everything from the Hollywood sign and Griffith Park observatory all the way to Century City andLos Feliz. It's a fantastic way to get some good exercise for you and your furry friend, as well as take in the sights of the city from above all the madness. Please don't take this away....it's a true gem that needs to be protected!Oh...and good luck finding parking! You'll need it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyM265
50,I see starz,"Runyon Canyon, whenever I end up hiking at this location I see all kinds of movie stars. From Tom Cruse, Cameron Diaz, Nicole Richie, Charlize Theron to up and coming celebrities. You can enter the canyon trails from below in Hollywood or from above starting from the all infamous road, Mulholland Drive. If you looking to not be alone on your hike then this is the place for you and everyone else! Remember to bring your own water, water, water and if you bring a pet bring plenty of extra water for your pets too. ;-)Happy Trails,Shoe leather express...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyM164
40,Good walk,"We walked from the Hollywood and Highland Centre - about a 10 min walk (at times uphill) - to the Fuller Street entrance. Not carpark - all residential street parking - but you may have to park a few blocks back if you drove. We took a left at the entrance so walked up the paved hill (very strenuous at times) and came back down on the steps which are scary, uneven and extremely steep. Have to be careful not to do yourself a nasty injury on them. There are no railings and just cliffs on either side. Don't know whether it would have been better to go in the other direction as those stairs are very high to have to walk up. Either way you need to be careful of the knees and ankles. Path is shared in both directions by humans and dogs alike. Hoping to see a few celebrities but lucked out on the day we were there. There are a few trails to do but if you're doing the big loop up to the point at the top, take some water as it can get quite hot and wear comfortable shoes. Great views of Hollywood, the Hollywood sign, the big homes in the Hollywood Hills and LA off in the distance (through the smog) but well worth the trek.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jetsettingaussies
30,Nice place for a run and great views,"The park wasn't anything special, but if you're looking for a break from the city and a place to breathe some fresh air (relatively), this isn't bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougg738
50,Great hike with beautiful views,"We walked to Runyon Canyon from the Hollywood & Highland Center. It was just under a mile to get there and we did not have to deal with limited parking near the park. We entered the park through the Fuller Avenue entrance.There are several trails in Ruyon Canyon. We did a loop around Inspiration Point and back down the west side of the canyon. These are the yellow and green trails on the map (available on the web site).The views are fantastic and the hike was not too strenuous. Bring water, especially if it's hot. Expect that there will likely be a fair amount of wind. Otherwise, this hike is absolutely worth doing when visiting the Hollywood area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/radx4
40,More an elevated park than a hiking mountain,"Ok, we have the French Alps so that's what I consider hiking. However, that said, Runyon Park is a nice surprise in the middle of the city. Parked a few blocks away, be sure to validate parking ticket! Walked to the Fuller St entrance and took the path on the right. This leads to the steps which are pretty steep and require good footware. Sports shoes are fine but flip-flops are a no-no. At the top of that you can climb further up to descent to the left or cut straight back through the middle on a paved road/path. We did the last, flight to catch..It took about 50min and was a nice bit of exercise. Comfy clothes are best, jeans might not be best. The views are pretty good so take the time to enjoy. There is quite a bit of dog-poo lying around but not disturbingly so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inkahiti
40,If you don't like dogs this is not your tree to bark up,"Once you FIND a parking spot, you get to enter this park in the middle of the city. It's SO cool because not ONLY is it like a WHOLE new world smack dead in the city but when you hike to the top to the back of the park you're in another city in the San Fernando Valley. Amazing, the idea you can walk from Los Angeles to the valley FASTER than you can drive just tickles me.So the hike, there is an ""Easier"" side an the ""harder"" side as well as a nice asphalt paved path in the middle.There are areas where dogs are allowed off leash, and MOST owners pickup after their pooches. However, you have those who are oblivious their pups poo stinks, and no one wants to step on it.When you get to the top of either trail, you have a magical view of the city. It's so wonderful.Also there are off the beaten trails that you REALLY have to climb through. I don't recommend it...I've tried it. Not the easiest thing to do.There is a nice person who has cold water, granola bars and fruit out for people. Each item is $1 and is on the honor system. So be honorable. WONDERFUL a nice person would do that for everyone.Either way it's a GREAT outdoor exercise and if you only take your time and pace your way up the short incline just to the first platform of the easy side it's a WONDERFUL picture op.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowbuxlux
50,BEAUTIFUL,"I took a walk from my hotel to this location. I was aware that it was a dog park(unleashed) so I had no problem with that. Be please, make sure you're in hiking condition for these trails. They are really steep and long. But I must say, once you get to the top, the view as absolutely AMAZING!! I would definitely do it again and go maybe to the higher peak.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missnfo
40,Very Nice Park.,"I can't comment on the nightmare parking because I walked here from my hotel at the Hollywood/Highland center. It is a short pleasant walk. Hiking bloggers refer to the park as to easy. Less experienced say it is really hard. Confusing. The lower park is beautiful with gardens and a free yoga compound. Going up the east (easier) side of the park is a moderate hike but has some very steep grades. Great cardio. It can be taken around to loop down about the center of the park but I chose to come back down the far west (rugged) trail. Be advised this is a ""rugged"" trail and I recommend suitable footwear. The views from the higher elevations are great from all sides.If you are driving, there is a north entrance off Mulholland Drive that appears to have ample parking. Be aware this is a dog park. If you have issues with dogs you might pass.I would have given it 5 but there was no restroom to be found. Go before you go.At the Fuller St. entrance there is a honor bar snack table with chips, energy bars, water, juices, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventurousAmy77
40,Good hike take the path,If you are looking to get away from the city but not leave the city tis place is perfect and you may even get a glimpse of someone famous. Great scenic hike. Perfect for photos of the Hollywood sign and of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/408ChrisB
40,"Los Angeles, Hike","Not for the faint of heart, this hike is a climb and great cardio. I felt like I did 40 minutes on the stairmaster. Parking on the Hollywood side is challenging though I've had luck even on a Saturday. I understand the other side off of Mullholand has a parking lot so a better bet for most folks. The views at the top and along the way are awesome. Remember the sun screen and water, it's hot and there's is no shade! Also free yoga classes 3-4 times a day on the Hollywood side of the park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerindaT
40,Parking tips,Parking is a nightmare around Runyon Canyon. Beware of the Permit holders only parking. If you're very very lucky you may find a free space on the street a few blocks away but don't bank on it.Alternatively try parking up on Mulholland Drive at the top of the park.Or the Hollywood and Highland Centre which is a secure car park (max is approx. $13.00 per day). The walk to Runyon Canyon gate entrance is about 15-20min.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJ_Traveller2010
50,Great Off-Leash Hiking for Dog Owners,"There were two separate entrances for dog owners: one on-leash & one off-leash. It was a little confusing, and we accidentally took our dog to the on-leash entrance (on the right.) No one on the hike had a problem with her being off-leash though, as she is well-trained, so that was nice. Our dog had a great time running up and down the trail during the hike.Runion Canyon is also great hiking for non-dog owners. There are trails all over the canyon; all had a view of the Hollywood sign too. I would recommend this park to anyone visiting LA who wants to get outdoors & be active.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alit1313
50,Magical hiking experience,"Yes, parking is a challenge, but any of the web info sites tell you that so it shouldn't be a surprise. If you mind walking a couple of blocks to get the the trailhead then you're really not going to enjoy this hike. As to the dogs, that is what makes this place so unique, there are very few off leash areas anymore and I did see owners cleaning up after their dogs, never stepped in anything :) I am an active hiker (2-3 miles per day, 5 days a week, hills always included) and this hike was challenging. BRING WATER, more than you think you need. Wear proper shoes, no flip flops. The stairs are a butt buster but the views when you get to the top make it all worthwhile. You will be glad you had this incredible adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redpatch7
50,Love this Hike!,"I was recently visiting L.A. for a few days and found this hike as one of the top hikes in L.A. Went on a beautiful, late Friday afternoon and it was gorgeous. Lots of people, dogs (but not too many) and a challenging hike. Nice, wide fire roads much of the way. Just perfect. I enjoyed it so much that I went back a couple of days later with a friend, and we went further into and up the canyon to the top. So glad I found this, and I've recommended it to several people since. I love the neighborhood too. Street parking wasn't too difficult either time, though you need to watch for signs with limited parking (2 hours?). My friend and I had a nice lunch on Sunset Blvd. after our hike. Will do this again on my next visit to L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sed
50,Put this on your to-do list,"If I lived here I would take this trail everyday. Skip the paid attractions if visiting LA, the hikes are free and you are rewarded with amazing views.PARKING:Got here at about 7 am on a Friday. Absolutely no parking on Fuller Ave. We parked about 5 blocks away and squeezed into a tight parallel parking spot. I hear that there is extremely limited parking also available on N. Vista. We did not have to pay for parking, but I am not entirely sure what the rules are for different days/times.MAPS & TRAILS:No maps are provided on the trail.Visit this website, to get a detailed map of the different trails/loops you can take:http://runyoncanyon-losangeles.com/?page_id=16I just took a screen shot of it on my computer and then printed it out & took it along with me. We did the smaller loop and it only took us about an hour to complete, and this was with a lot of lolly-gagging & picture taking. ---If you choose to do the bigger loop or any of the detours, it will obviously take longer than an hour.The loop we did was easy, since we did it early in the morning the sun was not beating down on us yet. There is no shade though, so if you go in the afternoon you will want to bring sunscreen or hat. We did bring one water bottle each and that seemed to suffice.WHAT TO BRING:The view is absolutely amazing. Bring your camera.I wore a regular pair of sneakers, and it presented no problem for me. You will most likely break a sweat, so wear work out clothes, or at least a t-shirt that quick dries. Don't attempt the hike in jeans.There are no bathrooms or drinking fountains available. At the entrance of Fuller Ave, there was a table & cooler set up that had new unopened water bottles (like the Aquafina kind) and a few snacks available for purchase. It's based on the trust system, so please don't be a jerkface & take without paying.POPULATION ON TRAIL:At 7 am, there were a ton of people on the trail as well as their dogs unleashed. We saw quite a few women running the trail by themselves, so it seems to be a relatively safe hike (though I do not recommend you do any hike by yourself). There were trash cans available to throw out your dog's poop. There were a few spots where people left it on the trail, but it was could be easily spotted and avoided.IF YOU HAVE A DOG CLEAN UP AFTER IT! YOU RUIN THE TRAIL FOR EVERYONE ELSE BY LEAVING IT.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeksTravel
40,Avoid if you dislike dogs!,"This was a great hike with wonderful views! The negatives (and there are plenty in my opinion) are: 1. Limited parking, no bathrooms, no signs / maps along the way, TONS AND TONS of dog messes everywhere. It's amazing how disrespectful people are thinking its ok to clean up after their dogs. Definently bring water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caroline1851
50,Some of the most beautiful views of LA,"I am lucky that I work two blocks away from Runyon, so I do this hike weekly. If you start on the Fuller side you will find more of a challange asbyou go up the stairs (my preference! ). Once you're out of breath and sweaty you'll be mesmerized by rhe beautiful view of the city. ...if it's a clear day, you can see downtown, the Observatory, and more. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karula76
50,Great paths for city views and exercise,"We checked it out on a Monday morning before 10. We found parking no problem, got out and hiked some moderate climbs to the highest part. Saw the city from a fantastic vantage point and hiked down some of the easy flat roads towards the bottom. Recommendations are to wear sunscreen and a hat and bring water. We will miss this when we leave. It's a great place to stretch your legs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresat31
40,"Great hike, but parking is difficult!","Runyon Canyon is a really great place to hike in Los Angeles. I love that it can be as easy or challenging as you want - You can just walk on the paved part or on the more rugged, non-paved part. Views of Los Angeles are amazing! You can see the city, the great houses in the hills, and the Hollywood sign. Only issue is parking - It's always hard to find a spot, even on a weekday! Wish they could do something to make parking easier but I guess that's part of being in LA! Still a great trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackie178
40,Great hike!,"I ran/hiked the canyon solo when I was in LA for business, and didn't have much time for site-seeing. Excellent hike and way to see the city! View from the top is amazing! ..... Definitely wear good hiking shoes. Some of the terrain (especially near the top) is dusty/slippery and very steep. I wore typical running shoes and wished I would've worn hiking shoes with more traction. And definitely take some water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karlyg498
40,Great view from top,"It's a place many people bring their dogs. If you do, please bring a bag to clean up after your dog (many people didn't and the end of the trail was quite smelly.)There is a variety of climbs for different levels and a very nice view from the top. Interesting to find something like this in the city. It can be dusty in the dry summer so I would suggest bringing H2O. People say that you may run into a celebrity there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jean705
50,One word AMAZING,We knew we would see great sites of L.A but never did we anticipate everything else. Runyon canyon is public park where you can exercise. As its literally a park of hills you can trek the hills ... Which are extremely steep. Be mindful to wear proper running trainers or hiking boots.It gets really hot so as expected make sure you have a bottle of water to hand . Wear light exercise clothing and bring a hat and sunglasses. You can see some of the best sites of L.a from here for absolutely 0dollars! There is no charge to enter the park so make sure you make the most of it. You can also clearly see the Hollywood sign and many of the Hollywood hill homes which look amazing! We also spotted a celebrity (won't name him) so keep one beady eye open! Took us about 1.5 hours to scale the whole park but we didn't go to the highest peak :-/ !! ... Its located within a residential area and there is 2 hours parking on from wed to fri so make sure you get there between 11-2 for that :) ......10/10 and a must see when you come to L.A,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissK87
50,Hard work but beautiful views,An easy walk from Hollywood Boulevard up to the entrance of Runyon Canyon park. Be prepared for a steep uphill walk to the top of the canyon - wear comfortable shoes & take lots of suncream & water. Beautiful views over LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lrnnnn
40,Nice Trails and Views of LA and Hollywood Sign,"The park is located along the eastern end of Mulholland Drive and has a surprisingly extensive trail system through the hills that takes one to good views of LA and the Hollywood sign. The highest trail does not have the best view as it is partially obscured by high tension power lines and their towers; one is better off with one of the lower trails for an unspoiled view. Also, the often hazy skies of SoCal can reduce the view so time your trip for a clear day, often after a weather front, if possible. The greatest difficulty in visiting is finding a parking spot as they are very limited so visiting on a weekday is a good idea as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve5863
50,Worth the Workout,Great place to relax and walk up and/or down the Runyon! People were friendly as they would walk/run pass you! Dog friendly and beautiful view of the city as well as houses! It honestly takes your breath away!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsHoops3
40,Great Location and Vantage Points,"This is a great spot to get a healthy hike in an easy to get to location. It's right in-between Hollywood and West Hollywood with free parking (not ample but it's there). The views are great. You can see the Hollywood sign, Hollywood, Downtown, Westwood, Century City and canyon views. There are trails for everyone; some are very easy some hard so you can go for a workout or leisure. The only downside is it can be pretty crowded at times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lrc357
50,Good work out and great views on a clear day,As other reviewers have said there are a number of trails up the canyon. Try to choose a clear day to make the most of the awesome views. Early morning and late afternoon are best as there is not much shade. There are water dishes for dogs but not humans so take water with you. At the gate there is an honor box to pay for water and snacks which is nice and not expensive so take some dollar notes if you want to buy water on the way in- only a $1 a bottle. A great place to people watch. Be careful coming down on some of the trails as the dirt is slippery and the incline steep with some cliff drop offs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/55gailh
50,Great Views of LA,"We went straight to Runyon after arriving as we wanted to stay awake and avoid jet lag. Great little trail, full of people jogging, walking their dogs. We took the trail up to the top, great view of the Hollywood sign, very close. Fantastic views of LA. only 10 min walk to Hollywood Bvld.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GSD14
50,Lots of trails. Choose your battle. Awesome way to stay fit.,"From moderate to challenging trails. On and off-leash areas for dogs. One trail called the ""spine"" is more of a scramble. Really gets your adrenaline pumping!! Up is hard, down is super tricky. We hike every weekend and still fun this one to be challenging.Interesting sights. Lots of variants. Be adventurous. Try new trails. Being water. Only downfall... No bathrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HedyvonRibbonTroff
50,The essential Los Angeles experience,"Runyon is a moderate loop trail located in the middle of Los Angeles that offers scenic views of the Valley, the Hollywood sign, Downtown and gorgeous athletic bodies … It’s the exercise capital of Hollywood that attracts hikers, runners, yoga enthusiasts and weightlifters because it’s so beautiful and so LA! Catch the loop from either Fuller Avenue or North Vista Street. Either way, it’s a mostly gradual ascent. Come early to avoid getting sunburn. Runyon is the essential LA experience. Bring your camera. Exercise your patience while looking for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tatianng
50,I'm there almost every day,"Amazing to have such a beautiful canyon complete with native vegetation, deer, coyotes, rabbits, raccoons, squirrles, etc...in the middle of a metropolis like Los Angeles. Trails that veer off the main trails, if open to pedestrians are an adventure, but watch out for coyotes - really! (Oh and rattle snakes too). But don't let that deter you from at least visiting the main trails and plateaus of this stunning piece of woodsy prickly pears to poppies, semi-arid canyon gone urban!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/topjoe
40,Nice place to be active and take a break from the city...,"Obviously, most people who are visiting Runyon Canyon are walking or running, but it's also a nice place to get a different view of the city. Parking can be tricky on Saturdays or evenings, so if you find a spot on the way up, don't think you can get closer, just park there. :) It will save you a lot of time.Also, it's best to go early in the morning or in the evening. Less crowded in the morning and not as hot as the sun is going down. There are several photo spots with the Hollywood sign in the background on the way up, so if you're looking for the typical 'LA' shot with the family, then take your camera and get to hiking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethK941
50,On Top of Los Angeles.,"This is the place where you can escape away from the noisy city of LA. On top of the hill, you can take a deep breath to feel the nature, and you can take a break from the City. Forget about what is happening down there in the city, here you are now at the top of LA, take a nice walking or running on the trails. Let's feel the freshness of Mother Nature. Keep it in mind, there is no food no restroom, make sure you take care of all the problems before heading there. Have Fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJnish
40,great view,my friend challenged me to a steep hike! it was brutal for me because I'm not in shape to hike like that but the incentive was a beautiful view of the city from atop. It was worth it. Will come back when I'm a little more fit. ;),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cooky23
50,Groovy place to run with stars.,"I do not run. I think running is for emergencies only, however, I have gone here for fast walks many a time. This is THE place to get exercise while star spotting. Beautiful views and challenging slopes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HongKongTania
40,Nice break from the city.,Runyon Canyon Park offers beautiful trails and hikes for all fitness levels. Dog friendly with beautiful views. Make sure you bring water with you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boots900
50,NATURE AND HEALTH RETREAT,"This a trendy park that everyone I know loves. My daughter takes me often to force me to walk and do exercise. I'm not much of a land person, but I'm trying, so I go. I'm never disappointed. Who can dislike all those green trees and spectacular hillside views? Just the same, keep in mind that most trails are on an incline, but everyone can find a little trail to follow for at least a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mermaidsylvia
40,Rewarding When You Get to the Top,"This park essentially offers 2 main trails to hike, yet there are a few off paths leading to perhaps farther or other trails. The trails are one moderate and one easy. Finding a parking space could be quite annoying, but I could always find one south of Hollywood and within few blocks of Fuller within 10 minutes. I figure that a little walking (~10 mins) would be a nice warm up and I could avoid getting stuck in cars trying to find or wait for parking spaces. From my experience, the best time to be there is before 9 because, one down side about the park is that it could be crowded on the weekend. However, following the crowd somehow keeps you motivated to keep going if you ever find it difficult. There are two entrances/exits to the park, one from going east of Runyon Canyon Road through Vista Street and the other is just going north on Fuller Avenue. I prefer the former because it gives you the access of both trails, moderate trail to the west (left) and easy trail to the north (straight ahead) when you enter the park on Runyon Canyon Road. The easier trail is already quite rewarding when you get to the top because you will have a nice panoramic view of LA. The harder trail offers a steeper challenge and there could be chances that you might need your hands to help yourself to get on to the peak. This peak is higher than the peak on the easier trail. There are a few paths you can hike to get from easier trail to harder trail or vice versa. Once you become familiar to the park, it is possible to plan your way into a loop to include both trails. This park give you the freedom to explore it in your way. Overall, the hike is quite rewarding once you get to the top, but how rewarding? Get out there and find out yourself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CKC206
50,Love it!,"You should absolutely go up Runyon Canyon if you're in LA! It's beautiful! We went late afternoon with an organised trip from the USA Hostel Hollywood so we walked and it was so nice to do something like this. It was a bit of a hard trek up in some places in the heat, but occasionally there are steps which makes it a bit easier. The views are crazy. You get to see the famous view of LA you've probably seen on tv or on postcards. This was one of my favourite things that i did so check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarah_11e
50,"Amazing, amazing, amazing","This place is gorgeous. Tough finding a parking spot, so arrive early! We got a great workout and could see for miles and miles. Definitely will be back. The people are very friendly and there are a lot of dog walkers. Such an awesome place to be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyGypsy1988
50,Incredible views,"Wow and double wow! If you visit LA you have to do this walk. It was a bit of a hike in the heat but well worth it. You will not be sorry when you reach the top, sit back and enjoy the incredible views. Go early morning or later afternoon to avoid the mist that will over the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seabreeze88
40,"Lovely (and unusual) way to experience Los Angeles and Hollywood ,,","My daughter lives right below Runyon Canyon Park - and is blessed to have both the vista and the exercise opportunities of Runyon literally at her doorstep. When visiting her, I go there every day. There are frequent publicly available yoga classes - free or for nominal fee. The hiking - several different paths offer different levels of difficulty and height - is fun and often social. The views are spectacular - a different view of Hollywood, for sure! Feels almost like you are miles from civilization - even though not infrequent sightings of celebrities (who, for the most part,want to remain anonymous - and appreciate not being ogled) make you realize you are in the midst of a metropolis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjeanp
40,Fun day hike... Lots of sights to see. Good work out! DOG FRIENDLY.. For young healthy dogs.,"Fantastic views of million dollar homes, the hollywood sign and downtown skylines. Many variations on trails... Routes and where to park to enter. Out and back or loop... Depends on the trail you choose. From moderate to challenging. Wear hiking shoes. We spent an hour and a half and skipped the most challenging trail because we had our little dogs.We usually do the hike to the Hollywood sign... Which is more of a long endurance hike. Runyon offers more adventure and variation. Larger variety of plant life and foliage. Much more populated.Crowded on weekend afternoons so plan accordingly... Some tricky trails to have hikers at your heels. If you don't mind a crowd.... Or enjoy people watching. This is the hike for you. If not....Head out early or during the week or try the Hollywood sign hike!! Enter at the end of Mullholland.. Bring water or buy some at the Honor System stand just before the park entrance. Apartments line this street, follow the ""crowd"". I didn't see any restrooms so again.... Plan accordingly.Saw a young lady with an older dog who was really hurting. Big lab having a terrible time trying to get up... panting. Broke our hearts. Please consider your dogs age and fitness level before bringing them along. Or keep the oldies off the tough trails. Our dogs may not know when to say when. My little senior rides in a pouch in my chest. :)Get out and have fun!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HedyvonRibbonTroff
40,scenic,great views but definitely not the place to go when it is hot. best time for the view is just after a rainfall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188RobertT
40,Outdoor exercise beyond the beach,"If you're in the LA area and either its too cold for the beach or you're just not in the mood for water sports or beach bumming, then hiking in Runyon Canyon is a must. The pros- free parking, no entrance fees, pet friendly,great views of the city including the famous Hollywood sign and a moderate 3.5 mile loop. The cons-can get crowded, may need to park on the dirt road, pets are in abundance so if you're afraid of dogs or allergic it may be a problem, no water fountains or vending machines or state park info booth or multiple exits. Just one entry/exit point.All in all a fun activity to get exercise while sightseeing and spending a few hours at no cost except ofcourse the gas cost to get there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ish21
50,Great park in the middle of Hollywood,Just minutes away from Hollywood in West Hollywood this park is a dog and hiker's dream. The easy trail is still challenging and i hear the difficult path is very challenging. But all in all the whole hike (up and back) took just over an hour. The views from the top of the canyon were worth the trek. Lots of good people watching and dogs can go off lesh soon after your entrance to the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David4advice
50,Awesome view of LA,"The hike is moderate! It can be hard to find a parking since the entrance is located in residential area. You can try to find parking on La Brea and walk there... Although some of my friends have taken taxi to get there ! (Seriously!)There is two loop up the two peaks. The Runyon Canyon loops and the Trebek open space. When you enter the park entrance, I would suggest to take the far right hike up. It is a bit narrow and rough trail but the scenery is breath-taking! When you get down on the other side, the trail is paved and much wider... Much easy to get down... But there is no view!Bring some water, good hiking shoes, and a friend.... You will have fun and stay in good shape while visiting the city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kukulimoku
50,Staying fit in the middle of the city is easy with Runyon Canyon,"I love Runyon - I'm here at least 4 times a week, either by myself, with a friend, or with my dog. When you enter past the yoga lawn, you can select your path. The steep stairs are to the right, the steady walk-up is to the left. I usually take the steady path when I am with a friend, so we can chat as we hike. The stairs have become a bit slippery and weathered due to very high foot traffic, so I have been aprehensive about taking that path lately. In either way, you will be awe-struck at the top of the mountain, when you look down to see Los Angeles in all its glory! It's a great feeling to climb up to the top of the world, and feel that fresh cool air in your hair. I strongly recommend runyon to all city-dwellers. The only drawback is that there are no restrooms nearby, so you have to remember to save your water for after the hike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dashatravels
40,Endless trails and hiking opportunities,This area for hiking has endless trails and routes. Views of the Hollywood sign throughout the hike. Parking is very difficult but if you are patient you can park in the limited space parking lot in the park. Warning to street parkers if you are not within the white lines you will get a ticket as we observed first hand. This is a well used set of trails with great views of La and the hollywood sign. Great workout and even some scrambling up at the top. Watch your step as people do not pick up after their dogs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/me1300n
50,"Great walk, see all of LA and maybe a celebrity...","Can get a bit crowded, but if you go on one hike in the Hollywood Hills this is the one to do. 30 min maxim, also good for running.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClifandMelLondon
50,Adventurous,"If you're in the area, you might as well take this hike. Or part of it, like my friend and I did. We had some time to kill before our flight so we hiked part of it. I saw the Hollywood sign and all of LA from above for the first time ever. Definitely worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZoeM622
50,A different way to see the sights,Another option to get a glimpse of the Hollywood sign while getting a workout. Took advantage of a 4 mile hike and got some fantastic shots of the sign and the Hollywood area. I wasn't expecting to see this side of the area and was very glad to have taken the hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vamosalbiceleste
20,Dog Poop Canyon,"yes celebrities and wannabes walk here, but there are SO many better and better-smelling hikes around town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ttopaster
50,amazing spot for a hike,"We loved going for a hike here, its super close to downtown LA & Beverly Hills but feels like its a world a part. Rolling hills, steep canyons and great views of gorgeous homes. An amazing spot for a hike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kattrins
50,Amazing views,We started the hike from the Fuller ave entrance and chose the more difficult hike.It took around 20mins to get to the top. The views over Hollywood and LA are amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Muffsta
40,Great workout for a great view!,We decided to do a leisurely walk of Runyon Canyon. Ooops there is nothing leisurely about the walk. It is a work out. The payoff is the spectacular views of the Los Angeles skyline! We went on a Sunday late morning and it was crowded (lots of fit locals). If you want a place to walk your dog - this is the place - dogs everywhere but don't worry - if you are not a dog lover it won't spoil your hike!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhondaA646
40,Great urban hike,This is about a three mile loop up a hill with outstanding views of the LA basin and great people and dog watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ankiandlarry
30,A good work out,"Runyon Canyon is great if you want a quick good work out outdoors, and especially if you have a dog! But I thought it was funny the amount of people walking around with their starbucks cups while ""hiking"". There are some hiking trails off the main loop, but the main loop can be crowded at times. I think there are better trails in the Hollywood hills with less people, less dogs, and less starbucks. But it's great if you're close and just want to get out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahD359
50,Great for single traveller,"Definitely a great walk. At noon, it can be quite hot in November. It's hard to get lost, there are no signs but if you just ask people along the trail which way leads to which and which joins up, you won't get lost. I asked for the route that will take me to the highest point. It took me 1-2 hours Also, bring lots of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kazarina12
50,A great escape from the cement jungle,"Loved that we made time to walk Runyon Canyon, we saw the Hollywood sign and the sun setting over LA. Spectacular! It's by no means an easy walk - it's steep and gravelly, but mind over matter and you get there (others were running it so it depends on your fitness level).Celebrity sightings are possible here, we saw Isabel Lucas (an Aussie actress). You can walk here from Hollywood Blvd - about 15-20 min walk up Fuller Avenue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacJac82
50,Morning hikes,"Morning hikes up Runyon are the best way to start your day in LA. It's best to go in the morning or early evening, and it gets BUSY as it's a very trendy hiking spot. A good alternative, if you want a less busy trail is Franklin Canyon in the Hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiaMoretti
50,Runyon Canyon Hollywood,"While visiting Los Angeles last winter one of my best experiences was hiking the trails of Runyon Canyon. The panorama view is wicked of Hollywood and with downtown Los Angeles in the distance, and of course it was great exercise!The location of Runyon Canyon is very cool, only about a mile from the most famous part of Hollywood Boulevard. But it seemed to me like a hidden gem tourists hadn’t discovered – or maybe tourists in California just don’t want to climb mountains! Whatever the case, there weren’t many people on the trails that day, and it was a Sunday, so you would think that there would be.Here is a link to read more about Runyon Canyon with details about how to enter the park. There are a few different paths that you can take. I entered the park from below at the Fuller Gate, and then walked up the Star Trail that is mildly difficult, and then took the gradual walk down the Runyon Canyon Road. My hike took about an hour in total. No star sightings though!For more visit http://withlovegabrielle.com/runyon-canyon-hollywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WithLoveGabrielle

40,get you hiking shoes on!!,This canyon is great but I would not recommend this to people who are going on their first hike. You must be ready to go down steep trails and up steep stairs. So once your in shape you can take this place on and enjoy the beautiful scenery and while you getting a workout.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dee_dee818
40,Beautiful Hiking in the Midst of LA,"I’m always amazed by the beautiful canyons in the midst of the city of LA, and Runyon Canyon is one of my favorites for a nice outdoor workout. There are 3 levels of difficulty in hiking to the summit. As you enter the park from the bottom, the middle path is easiest, the one to the right is mid-level, and the one to the left is the most challenging. No matter which one you choose, the view at the top is extraordinary…especially on a smog-free day! Beware, there is only street parking in the area, so read the street signs carefully…they are quick to ticket in that neighborhood. And if you forget your water, it’s nice to know they have a nice little “honor” stand outside the entrance, where you can purchase bottled water, fruit, etc. And finally, an insider tip…if you go during a weekday when most 9-5ers are at work, you have a great opportunity for celebrity sightings! Just don’t bother them, please…they enjoy a nice, anonymous workout, also!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuenaGirl
50,Great hike. Better on week days,"This is a great space. Hiking & views are above par. My first time was on a Saturday, and it was crowded. Kind of fun people watching, but the serious hiker seemed a little frustrated by the crowds. Parking is a little tough in the area, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kknew
40,Great views!,Did the hike at the canyon one afternoon. Lots of people and dogs taking the hike to the top. Many different hike levels available (easy to hard) depending on what you are looking for. Great views of the city and the Hollywood hills. Takes about 30 mins if you really book itnto the top. Highly recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paco1paco
40,Dog Heaven,"This park is probably the most popular with walkers/dog owners. Big crowd on the weekends and okay for well behaved dogs off-leash in most areas. Love this place, its fun and social, L.A. people at their glowing outdoor best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToriN622
50,Amazing views,"Good workout adjustable to your own pace with the benefit of fabulous views at the top. More than one route to the top, and back so you can go over and over again. Parking can be challenging however.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurieM327
30,"If you can get over the smell of dog urine, watch out for the jumping fleas","This place allows dogs to go off leash which is nice and all if your dog obeys you. Not so much if it goes off doing it's own thing and the owner is no where to be found. The place really smells bad, especially after a light rain when the odors are released. There are nicer places to go for a walk in So Cal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SilverLake2TheWorld
20,Celebrities & Poop,"A great place to go if you want to occasionally run into celebrities and don't want to stand in line to be 5 deep away from them on the red carpet. The only problem is that it's filthy! No one picks up after their dog and when you're done walking, you feel grimy. The place smells like urine, it's hard to find parking, and all the rattlesnake warning signs just makes my skin crawl. For a better experience, climb any of the trails at Griffith Park, which is cleaner, greener and has an exquisite view of the city, plus you end the hike at the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Babbbles
50,Amazing views,"Wow-I had no idea what i was getting myself in to when i showed up. This is a serious hike! You don't need to be in great shape, but certainly fit enough to go up and down steep hills. The views are so amazing, you don't feel like you're exercising. You can even see the Hollywood sign. Highly recommend for those that want an enjoyable exercising experience. Bring water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9alexg9
50,If you like to walk/hike,"Then this place is for you! It's also dog friendly, so feel free to bring the furry one. Beware, though, as this place can get crowded earlier than the beaches; you can often catch quasi-celebrities out for a stroll, and it's definitely the see-and-be-seen type of outdoor park. But the views on a clear day are unmatched, as you can get a glimpse of the entire city (including the Valley) and even Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbucka
50,Awesome views,I love this place. I love dogs so it's great to see all these dogs running around freely! They all seem so happy! It's got the best views. I could hike here all day if I could. There are so many different trails you can take and vary up your hike each time! Parking is difficult though. Good luck with that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nlee1220
50,Unsurpassed views of the city lights,"Great trails and hikes, and a FANTASTIC place to see the sunset and lights come on. Bring a beverage or two, and a snack so you can relax and soak in the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trrydms
20,For dog owners and tourists only.,"I love to hike, and in LA there are many places to go and weather that allows you to most of the year. Runyon Canyon is my least favorite place to hike. While the view can be nice, your immediate surroundings consist of lots of people, lots of dogs, and dry, dusty scenery. Barely a tree in sight. Just as close, and much more ""forested"", is Fryman Park, or Tree People park, or whatever the park is called across from Tree People, at Coldwater Canyon and Mulholland. These parks are much less crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogamom65
40,Fabulous views and a great workout,"A unique way to see the City. Allot at least an hour for the walk up and back. In summer, try to do it in the early AM or evening, to stay out of the heat. Lots of dogs running off leash and dog guardians running off their mouths. This isn't a quiet back-to-nature experience. It's a way to experience how the locals take advantage of their own City and eavesdrop on a lot of typical LA conversations about physical fitness, screen tests, and relationship drama.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Style_Buff
40,"great view, nice walk","we just happened upon this park and had heard about it so got out and took a walk. great views and nice to get some exercise and feel outdoorsy. ok, we didn't walk long but it was fun to do, would recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TinaH7575

50,"Get your workout done at Runyon, not at your hotel gym!","We stayed in West Hollywood for the weekend, and Runyon Canyon was maybe a 10minute drive away - what a perfect place to get some sun while getting a great workout in. The main trail that most people do is as difficult or easy as you want it to be. It's good for everyone - go at your own pace and you will find beautiful views up at the top! Other reviewers stated there was a lot of ""evidence"" from the dogs, but we did not experience this. Just note that leashes are not required on that main trail so there will be dogs running around but they're not disruptive and they stay near their owner. We got there around 10am Sunday morning and out by 11am-ish after walking the trail one time around and taking our time with pictures and enjoying the view. During this time of day, there wasn't an unbearable amount of people that it got annoyingly crowded. Everything was just right, and it's great for people-watching too. Bring your sunscreen and a bottle of water. Parking is tough to find. You may find yourself walking 10-15mins from your parking space just to get to the entrance, and keep note of the signs as some streets are permit-only or no parking allowed on the weekends. Overall, we will be back to Runyon each morning when we come back to LA, it was definitely one of my highlights of the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NinaSteph31
40,Entertaining and challenging,"If you need to find an agent, date, or maybe even get in shape with a few hundred of your LA friends this is the place. I love to come here because with all the dogs having the time of their lives and actors practicing lines with their trainers you hardly notice you're actually getting a really good workout. the veiw is amazing of course and it's quite literally in the middle of everything, perfect for that after hike mimosa brunch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CignoNero

20,"After searching for parking, a park of dog poop and sweat","Runyon Canyon was amazing when I'd go there in the 90s. I went with friends who recommended more recently when we wanted a central point after work. We got there about 6p with everyone else in the city. Yes lots of great bodies but too many to move comfortably, even in a park of this size. The greater problem however were the amount of dogs and those owners who didn't clean up after them, further bottling movement as we had to circumvent those parts, along with holding our noses. Skip this hike unless you can go off hours, preferably early morning. Too bad the views are incredible and the hike lower and upper (with steep rock) is incredible, but I'd prefer to find some solace to unwind after a long day - something you won't find here.If you go, be mindful of parking. There's a ticketing cop that sits here often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluesycamore
50,Visiting LA? Start here!,"I've lived in LA for many years and just the other day, my boyfriend and I decided that if a person only has one day to visit LA, then a great place to spend the morning or afternoon would be to hike Runyon Canyon. Wear appropriate shoes though! We feel bad for the tourists we see in sandals or dress shoes. Don't make that mistake... you need running shoes/or hiking shoes/etc.It is the best way to see the city (assuming it's a clear day) all at once. The hike is fairly easy (depending on which path you choose), and the people watching is awesome. You will get a real glimpse of Hollywood here... the fitness freaks, sometimes celebrities, tourists (yes, but not too many) and interesting people of all sorts.I recommend starting from the Hollywood side on the street ""Fuller"" and taking the path to the right (it involves steps... ask someone if you like, they will direct you). This is not the easiest path, but if you can handle moderate hills, you'll be fine. Then descend the sloping path (easier on the knees!). Some people prefer to do it in reverse, but coming down the steeper side looks difficult for some people. Either way, make your way to the bench at the top where you can see the whole city... and often times these days, you can see the ocean (that wasn't always the case a few years ago!) It's a great way to get a real feel for the layout of the city... from the mountains in the east (plus the Hollywood sign, of course) to downtown, to Century City, and to the beaches... AMAZING.If you are a good hiker, and don't have time to get to some of the more difficult hikes in the LA area, you can take the steeper path that starts in the same area, but you take the path that veers up the side of a hill (sharp left). More people are taking that path these days, so you will see people heading up that way. Proper shoes are definitely required though ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avideno

30,Good Hike,Runyon Canyon is off of Mulholland Drive in the Hollywood Hills. I run this canyon every Saturday morning. Its not a whimpy hike but its not easy either. The hill is about 1 1/2 miles down and then you have to walk back up. Its a steep hill so it will burn calories and get the glutes working. If you prefer a little more strenuous hike then take one of the trails that run parallel to the main hill. One side of the hill will have a steep climp via stairs the other just a very steep climb. The views of Century City and Downtown Los Angeles are beautiful and on a really clear day you can see the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christmastree15

If you enjoy hiking and want to get away from the hustle/bustle of the city, this hike won't disappoint!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoisSedona
20,It is what you make it,"The clue is in the title. Runyon Canyon. It is a dry and dusty canyon where people walk their dogs. It is LA, don't wear jeans. Really this place is nowhere to go out of your way for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Colts_tooth
50,Celebrities and Dog poo!,"It s a great place for a hike. Can do an relatively easy uphill hike or a more strenuous, cardio workout. Either you see celebrities and smell dog poo",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HnLA
40,"I Go Early, I Go Late",As with many of the MUST SEE/DOs youll find in big cities I try to go when others are not... after a night of rain is the best to drive or trek up to the top of Runyon and enjoy the perfect views of LA... Clear views as they rain keeps the Fog/Smog...etc away for a little bit. Bring some water and take your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BHughes6
40,"great workout, views, people & dog watching","First and for most this place is a workout. It is in the Hollywood hills and it is a canyon that you walk up. It is a good workout so be ready. There are a lot of people with dogs which I think is fine and I enjoyed the people & dog watching. The views are nice if LA has a clear day. The property has some history too - it used to be the Errol Flynn estate. At the bottom of the hill you can see where the house was, now just a old foundation + tennis courts. It is a very cool place.If you do not like dogs or lots of people - do not go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y7762JAgregs
30,Overrated. Go to Griffith Park instead,"If your idea of a fun hike is to trudge up crumbling, steep, rutted paths polluted with dog poop, crowded with hordes of people with yippy dogs, then you will love Runyon Canyon Park. On the other hand if you prefer solitude, tranquility, shady hillside groves and some space to yourself, you might prefer the quieter corners of Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superplex
50,Get ready for a workout,"Great place, if you do the whole trip around it was brutal for me, because I am on the fat side....the view was fantastic and my dog loved it. Plus now you know where the pretty people are in the morning with the exception of me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louiebmayer
40,Great Free fun!,"What a great way to get a flavor of LA for free! You get nice views of Hollywood and lots of people/dog watching. You might even see a celebrity. I haven't yet, but a friend of mine has seen several. This is good exercise as well as the trail is fairly steep and lengthy. If you've been working out casually you'll be fine, but I wouldn't take your 70 year old grandparents unless they are active. Have lunch at the Grove afterword and you will have had a great start to your day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeathCalabasas_CA
50,A different view of LA - literally,A reasonably hard hike - but with average fitness you'll be fine - whose attraction is the view of the city from the Hollywood Hills to Long Beach. Take water and note there are no public toilets. limited parking available at the gates of the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brick_one
50,The best excercise in LA!,The perfect way to start your day. Excellent excercise. Parking can be a bit tricky but worth any hassle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJBNYFL
50,So worth a trip!,"If I lived in Los Angeles, I would come here all the time. I recently went on a hike here with my sister while visiting her and absolutely loved it. It's a beautiful trail and very well-groomed and clean, you get a good mix of sunshine and shade, it wasn't super crowded so we could go at our own pace, and gave me enough of a little workout to feel like I earned an In and Out Burger later ;-)Also, the views of LA are unparalleled: if you're deciding between this and the Observatory, and you only have time for one I'd recommend Runyon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annanas28
50,Great Workout & Great People Watching,"No where else in Los Angeles can you break a sweat next to Matthew Mcconaughey, porn stars, models, poodles, pugs, and normal folks. The view at the top is a must see, and everyone who hikes is wonderful. Several trails at different inclines let you workout at your own pace, and push it as hard as you want to. Wear proper shoes, and bring lots of water!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harris_of_Hollywood
20,Overcrowded,"There are many, many better places to hike in LA. It was mobbed and not fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pflagdad
50,Hike till you drop1,"Once is sunset, the view is amazing & beautiful. I love hiking, but can't stand the smell of dog doo doo. I am big animal lover, but I just hate seeing dog crap everywhere. I wish some of the dog owners are more responsible about picking up after their dog. Once you enter that park, the first thing you smell is dog doo doo. But other then that, it's a great park to hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hiketilludrop
40,"Good hike, but you better like dogs","Loved the: excellent workout, great getaway from L.A., gorgeous views, good opportunity to chat with a buddy (assuming you're not out of breath from the climb) -- did I mention the climb?Didn't love: all the dogs and their dog poo. Of course, if you're a dog lover, you will disagree. Also, to be fair, most people did pick up after their pets, but ... not all. Also, sometimes a bit too crowded, like a mountain climb meets one of those conveyer belt walker thingies in an airport. Finally, can be tricky to find parking.But you half to go at least once. There's sometimes yoga in the park at the base of the climb, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiaVonHB
30,Good hike in the middle of Hollywood,Good hike to get away from all of the Hollywood tourist traps. Fairly good workout (as hard as you want it to be). Pretty exceptional views of Los Angeles below. Would definitely recommend doing it if you're in the area an have a few hours to kill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJM604
30,Celebrity park,"There's nothing in this park that's extraordinary or different than most LA parks. Good for walk, jog or run BUT the location is on the hills where lots of celebs have homes so it's common to see one of them around. If that's your thing, then it's a must go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ragdias
50,Amazing views and challenging workouts!,"There really isn't much to say about this unless you experience it for yourself. The level of intense workout you will receive here is equivalent to boot camp. This is a great place to walk and enjoy views of the city as well as running or biking if you dare. Also, pets are a favorite here, but I suggest bringing the leash since there are so many dogs ranging from small to big.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wrldtraveler365
50,Exercise in the Hollywood Hills,"Great way to start your day. Parking can be a bit of a hassle. Just have patience, and be aware of parking signs. Best if you can visit during the week (monday and tuesdays are street cleaning, so be aware of that). The weekends are much busier. Great views from the top of the hill. You will be sore from this hike....highly recommend good tennis shoes, and water. Also fun to see everyone with their dogs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rayray581
40,Nice place to see dogs &people.,"This is a wonderful park for runner,walkers,dogs and kids. The only thing I did not like were so many big dogs were off their leash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaVistor19460
40,Make a spot for this in your vacation itinerary!,"My boyfriend and I went travelled the coast of California for 2 weeks, staying about 3-4 days in each location. Runyon Canyon was a place I had wanted to visit while we we're staying in L.A. (mostly because I had done some reasearch and heard that a lot of celebrities head here for workouts! ... don't judge me, I wanna see Zac Efron okay?? haha) but it was our last day and we hadn't gone yet. Then I heard someone from our Hostel say he thought he saw Jessica Alba there, so we put on our hiking shoes and walked over. From our hostel, which was like a 3 minute walk to The Chinese Theatre, it took about 10 minutes to get to the entrance of Runyon Canyon. I was immediately glad we came! It looks like you're walking around Jurassic Parc. There are many trails to try, some much more difficult that others. We are by definitely not people who go hiking often, but we went on a slightly more difficult trail...and although we we're able to complete it mostly without problem, I was pouring sweat! However it was still a very enjoyable walk. Come here to get some of the BEST VIEWS of L.A.! Completely unobstructed and uncrowded. And you can also get some great views of the hollywood sign!I was really glad we decided to visit Runyon Canyon before the end of our stay but I really wish we had gone earlier, to try some of the different trails!I absolutely recommend visiting Runyon Canyon if you are looking for a little nature-break in your trip to L.A., want to see some great views and are hoping to spot a celebrity!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Olivia_L49
40,A little bit of nature for the business of LA,"This is definitely a little gem of a place for those like me who crave being out in nature. It was a bit stinky at the beginning. There are hiking trails as well as a paved walking path. Not being familiar with the park I chose the trail to the left which I guess is steeper than the right. With the LA sun beating on you make sure to bring plenty of water. While ascending you will get views of the city. It is a sandy path up and challenging enough to get your heart rate up. This is a busy place so don't come looking for quiet tranquility. Oh yes, and dog friendly. Lots of dogs. All in all for being in the back yard of LA it is wonderful to have a place like this to go to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mictrav2
40,Celebrity Sighting and amazing views,"This is the spot that celebrities come to hike. In this one trip alone I saw 3. A lot of them were not easily recognizable at first glance (B &C list actors), I kept saying ""What show was he/she on?"". You can get a beautiful view of the spread of the city of LA proper and on a clear day (w/o smog) see the ocean and the edge of Catalina Island. Lot's of dogs so beware dog poop and some owner let their dogs roam without leases several feet in front of or behind them. Recommend going around dusk, but not too late that you get stuck in the dark! For health buff, it's a great workout with the inclines. For those just looking for a decent hike even if you aren't in shape, Runyon Canyon is good for you too- nothing to fear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweetenergytravel
50,Hidden Surprise,"Great hiking, fantastic views of Hollywood and L.A., and a lot of fun. Kind of hidden gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iamjasonmills
50,NOW THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT LA,"I love to workout and often seek places I can go to sightsee when away from home while I'm challenging myself to some hard core training. Well this is certainly the place! The view up the hills are amazing and once you arrive at the canyon there are 3 different hikes you can take with varying degrees of intensity. The paved hike RT (round trip) is the easiest. The paved one-way route down then turning left heading up the unpaved hill is medium intensity. It's an a$$ kicker going up, but the reward is the absolutely gorgeous view of LA at the top. It's an absolute MUST DO. The toughest route is the paved one-way route down then turning right headed up the unpaved monstrous hill which at times may require both hands and feet working simultaneously to climb that BIG DADDY. Again, the view is so AMAZING!! I wouldn't recommend doing this one unless you are in excellent shape, have no health issues, are not afraid of heights and are willing to get down and dirty. It's a BIOTCH, but the sense of accomplishment you feel after completing any of these hikes is so exhilarating and worth every ounce of sweat.We (two ladies in good shape) with 2 boys (ages 10 & 12) did both levels 1 and 2 a day apart. The boys bailed on us the third day so we conquered level 3 just the girls. Boy were we exhausted and dirty!! The thighs, butt, arms and hips got an extreme workout and quiet as kept it was a little scary on this terrain and at this height. It's NO JOKE so I took it much slower than I did the other two routes. However, it was a bonus to see all the beautiful people (including many celebrities) and lots of pretty dogs out there enjoying the day and the Canyon.SMALL TIP - Start early in the morning (between 6-7am) when it's cooler and less sunny because you are in rattlesnake territory. There are warning signs all over. They like to bask in the sun so you typically see them (and the gophers) once the sun's in full force. There are TONS of snake/gopher holes and the baby rattlers are the worse since they are harder to see/easier to step on if not careful, but quicker to bite (and they are venomous). The adult rattlers typically try to avoid people so unless you intrude on them, you'll be fine.And if you don't like to be around dogs, don't bother going because Runyon Canyon is a very social setting for both people and dogs. Enjoy!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravelSnob
50,Breathtaking!,"Runyon Canyon is breathtaking in its GORGEOUS views and also its physical exertion. Not recommended if you are not used to some type of exercise. Lots of dogs, friendly people. A highlight of our So Cal trip!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OhLoveNYC
50,Best view of Los Angeles!,"This place is awesome! Beautiful hike and beautiful people! Lots of celebrity sightings!It's a nice dog park, great workout for your butt!Free yoga daily! I love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeckyRN00
50,The perfect way to spend the day,"A couple of friends living in L.A. told me that they love Runyon Canyon and that I must go there during my visit. I was skeptical because I was thinking, ""this is just another city park; boring."" To my surprise, this was the highlight to my trip. To see people come out in drones and enjoy the day hiking and playing with their dogs was awesome. And I'm from the Midwest, so there aren't any trails where you actually hike to hike up steep hills!! Definitely a treat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrvlingFoodie
50,Breathtaking,"I just came back from LA two weeks ago. I travel there about every six months. Everytime I go, I make sure I go to Runyon Canyon for my workout. The view is amazing and the workout is great! Very high and the canyon has different pathways for all different types of hiking levels. If you arent a big mountain climber, there is a gravel pathaway, but for the mountain climbers, very high and steep inclines. I would advise wearing an old pair of shoes considering the mountains are very dusty and it will get all over your white shoes. It is nice to see all the different dogs that people bring and you will always see and meet very friendly people. Parking is limited so make sure you go very early or mid afternoon because I had to park 3 blocks away and walk up a huge hill to get the entrance. Once you make it to the top, you will never want to go back down. The view is amazing and you can see all of LA, the hollywood sign, and very pretty houses. This is very nice for couples and friends to do to take a break from the normal activities like shopping and eating, it allows for alot of communicating and provides a great day of fitness!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kay922
40,Great hike,"The area is easy to find and parking was found a few blocks from the park's gate. After a short steep walk, the trail has a steady incline with beautiful views of Los Angeles, if you can get past the smog. It is a 3 mile loop that also has views of the Hollywood sign and some mansions up in the hills. Dogs are allowed off leash and all were well behaved. I would say due to the steepness of the first part of the walk, its more of a moderate workout for those who have not been recently active. The 2nd half takes you back down so it could be hard for those who have bad knees.Safe to do alone as it is very populated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/airbear2116
50,"Great Hike, Amazing Views, Free Yoga!","Just got back from a week in Los Angeles, my husband and I go often and love to hike.We stayed in Hollywood Hills and hiked daily in Runyon Canyon. It was a huge benefit to find free yoga daily as well! AMAZING place, beautiful views, plenty of celebrity sightings too! Best view in LA LA Land!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LulabelleToronto
50,Old Hollywood still exists,"Not only is Runyon Canyon a great place to walk a dog or hike. It houses the old tennis court of Silver Screen Star Errol Flynn. The veiw is simply the best, you can feel the presence of Old Hollywood all around!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Passport25441
40,my day at ruyon canyon,I like runyon canyon a lot but its so difficult to walk andim thin but its quite a workout.. I see other people walking it and they dont seem to be having as hard a time as me. But for the most part Runyon Canyon is great and I recomend it to anyone who is intrested in going. It`s go for the doggies also as long as you dont push them too far.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Go22825
40,great for dogs,"Runyon Canyon is fun and challanging. It is a big old mountain that you can hike up and then down again on several trails. You can go for a short walk or for a strenuous 3 mile hike. Beware, it is hot and dry so bring water. It is also a huge dog park, where dogs are legally allowed to run around- leash free! I love it!",
