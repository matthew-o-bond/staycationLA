40,Los Cerritos Center,This place is called Los Cerritos Center and local residents call it Cerritos Mall. I just love it there and it is a wonderful place to hang out with friends! I went there last month. I like the design inside the mall. It makes me feel free and fresh. There are many good chairs and tables that I could just chill out on and watch people!! I went to the Apple Store to repair my iPhone. I would recommend the mall to others and my friends because I want to hang out with my friends over there!,Amy
40,Los Cerritos Center,This place a good place for the middle of the road type shopper. It is nice and clean. It is located adjacent to many awesome eateries and an outlet like shopping area. Parking is decent but again it has many wonderful varieties of restaurants.,hrhcerritos
40,A fine mall with a good selection of shops,"Went here one morning, as the mall had the Apple Store closest to our hotel in Buena Park. Arriving relatively early, we could easily get around, and I soon got what I came for in the Apple Store.We then strolled the mall looking for other shops and easily found some shops to get the last items on our extensive shopping lists brought from home.We used quite some time in Dicks' Sporting Goods, which had many things not found in the normal sport shops. We found some quite nice thermo mugs in different sizes.In Macy's we managed to find the last few items - so in addition to my new iPad, it was a quite successful day.",LarsDane
40,New Additions to a long standing mall,Lots of major improvements in the past few years with your standard high and mid range stores and restaurants in the vicinity and a new theater.,motocyclo69
40,Leisure shopping,"Great mall in Cerritos with a full variety of shops including fashion, restaurant, cinema, department stores etc. Nice environment to spend your day without the heat outdoor.",nancy p
40,An Excellent Mall,"This mall is a cut above but not at glitzy as some in SoCal, which gives this more appeal. It's been maintained and updated well over the years. Parking, however, is pretty tight, but if you don't mind a bit of a stroll, just aim for the fringes and you'll be fine.",Paul T
30,"Indoor mall, average selection","Cerritos mall is a basic mall with the usual Macy's, Nordstrom, food court. Easy to maneuver, and indoor !No Ann Taylor, but Loft. Food court had- Haian barbecue, tried the spam roll, nice and differentUsual chicken and Italian eateries.Loved the green crush cantaloupe drink with slivered cantaloupe pieces, very refreshing with a cane sugar. Lime cucumber was equally nice prices rangreasonable. They also had green juices and smoothies. A nice, healthy alternative. Easy to get samples from the friendly staff!, a must try",conjuror88
50,Awesome Harkins Movie Theater!,"I'm unsure if the actual mall property is called the Cerritos Towne Center or the Los Cerritos Center as it appears to have had some major renovations done.Nonetheless, this review is about the Harkins MovieTheatre which is attached to the mall. Wow! This is the best movie theater I've been to in awhile and I would go see more movies if this was the standard. It was clean, well maintained, and all the staff I interacted with or saw were neat and professional. The layout of the ticket office, main entrance, concession stands and rest rooms was simple yet roomy and efficient for crowd movement.Kudos to the decorator for the color choices in the bar area lounge. That's right, I said bar! You can sit and have a cold draft or glass of wine while waiting for a movie to start while watching sports on the large TV monitors. They even allow you to take your drink into your show!For parents who would like to watch a movie without their 3-8 aged kids, the theater has a supervised play-center (child care) area that has crafts, game and kid couches for the little ones to watch movies. What a neat, provided service.The adjustable recliner seats are comfortable and linked into the stereo system so you experience the bass and vibration of the movie. Another wow for that added touch. All in all a great movie experience at this theater. Highly recommend you try this Harkins.",John B
40,Not your living room!,"Nice, clean renovated common spaces until the people who think it is their personal living room arrive. They monopolize the seating and don't have manners. 3 anchor stores, specialty fashion stores, new movie theaters and many places to eat both fast and sit down meals.",MominOC
40,Nice mall in Cerritos,"Visited last in August 2015. Smaller mall, but still some good stores like banana republic, Disney store, guess, Nordstrom, and Macy's to name a few. Theatres inside the mall. There is a food court, but there are also some restaurants in the mall separate from it such as red robin. About a 15-20 minute drive north of Disney area. We were here to pick up shoes on a sale rack that another Macy's store confirmed were still on the rack in the size needed. One of many malls close to Anaheim. I would say mostly locals shop here.",mariedesjardins
