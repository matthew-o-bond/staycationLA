50,Absoultely Gorgeous,"Before making our way to the Tehachapi Loop we decided to go see the poppy blooms. The drive through Lancaster wasn't bad except for the locals driving like bats out of hell, to get there. Guess speed limits aren't for them.Anyway of course the Reserve was closed due to the Virus, they had a ranger blocking off the entrance. But there are many fields around the outside of the Reserve that everyone was flocking to.Lots of people were trampling and laying in the middle of the fields to get selfies. Very very inconsiderate.These fields aren't patrolled so people just run amuck. It's a shame.Beautiful. We can scratch that off our Bucket List.",L L
40,Vehicles running over poppy flowers off walking trail,"We enjoyed the breathtaking seas of poppy at the California Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve yesterday (3/31/2020). However, we were sad to see SUVs and pick-up truck passing through walking trails, passing other vehicles by getting off the trail and running over thousands of poppy flowers. One even parked in the middle of the trail with its driver relaxing in his lounge chair for as long as we were there.I hope the park ranger would set up roadblocks at Lancaster Road and the road parallel Lancaster to the north, so these inconsiderate individuals cannot do this in April and May.",Tom
50,"Poppies are popping, beautifully!","Poppies are popping, beautifully! Some years are better than others. Depends on rain and climate conditions. This year it is a spectacular display of poppies. Do spend the $10 and park in the parking lot. There are great trails through the hills to view the flowers. There are smelly outhouses, typical for hiking in the hills.",Cavydad
50,Mother Nature at her finest!,"If uou are anywhere withon a two hour dive you need to go. I have been to botanical gardens in the USA, Canada and Japan but no amount of human gardening can compare to the effortless and carefree landscapes from God. Last year with heavy late winter rains the poppies were spectacular on a background of bright desert flowers. Go during the week if you can because the weekends are insane with cars and people which makes it harder for great pictures but if it’s the only time you can go—go anyway.",Lawrence V
30,Beautiful place to visit in May!,"The hills at the reserve are gorgeous WHEN the fields are in full bloom. But, when, is the operative word. Every year is different depending on rainfall and weather conditions. Visitors should be aware that this is out in the boonies and there are no gas stations, flood, or rest rooms close by. Visitors also to be wary of snakes if they get out of their cars and walk thru the fields. Traffic can also get heavy on the weekends. But, if people come prepared it is a wonderful sight.",H8900IJdonnap
50,Beautiful sight!,I’ve never been here despite living only 10 miles from this gorgeous location and it was really breathtaking! The vibrant colors are amazing and I will come each year now!,Patricia C
50,Beautiful!,"You MUST visit when the poppies are in bloom. The poppy fields stretches for miles, as far as the eye can see! Yes, there were crowds, but if you go around 10am it is manageable. Definitely worth the drive.",compcrzy

20,"As with everything in California, Too expensive!","The surrounding area after a rainy winter is covered in yellow, gold, blue and green flowers. Skip the expensive fee park and drive around all sides then walk and enjoy this riot of desert color.Highly recommend the surround area but not the expensive park.",Commercialtourist
30,Poppies all over,"The Reserve does have a mildly interesting museum and other information for those interested but the poppies last year appeared to be better elsewhere in the Antelope Valley, as long as the solar farms don't continue replacing the poppies.",Debbie H
50,One word...Beautiful!,"If you want to see beautiful fields of poppies, walk planned trails, and be one with nature you should definitely visit the AV Poppy Fields. It's definitely worth the journey!Make sure to bring water, and wear comfortable clothes and shoes. Go to the visitor center to learn more about the animals in the area.",Marisa
50,wonderful,This place is absolutely breathtaking when it is a good year of blooming poppies... Check the bloom before you go to make sure the bloom is on...each season is very different... 2019 was fantastic,jenjetmd
40,Amazing,So much traffic. Took an hour in traffic to get to a full parking lot so had to park way down on the street on walk in. Be prepared with sun protection and water and for a lot of walking. The flowers were so spectacular and the trails were so fun to walk. Probably the earlier the better but the flowers only open in daylight and they close when the sun dims.,Xandra M
50,Beautiful Place,In the wet years in Souithern California the Antelope Valley Poppy Preserve is absolutly gorgeous. This year was one of those years. Last year we visited the preserve and the weren't any flowers. This year was phenomenal.,thibbs1955

40,Poppies are everywhere...,The best time to visit probably at early spring. We were there in May. At that time poppies are still there but with closed heads. Still lovely,Mikhail D
50,Golden Spot!,"It rained so much this year and read from the newspapers that the time is perfect to explore the California Poppy Reserve and experience the orange beauty with our own eyes and we were not disappointed. We heard the weekends are so crowded so we decided to go there on a week day were there is less crowd. The GPS led us to the Angeles National Forest Highway. It was a relaxing drive thru the mountain passes emerging to the orange glow in the horizon. Thousands upon thousands of California Poppy blanketed the mountains with golden glow. It was beautiful, it was picturesque. We paid $ 10 parking fee although you can also park by the road for free. The reserve has more than 8 miles of trails that loop around in different directions. The Tehachapi trail was the most picturesque and the flowers glow from the horizon. Don't forget to visit the Visitor center for souvenir. The hike was easy on paved trails that meander to the fields of dreams. Definitely worth your while.",Anthony I
50,SPECTACULAR,"I was elated to have had the pleasure to witness the hills in Antelope Valley painted with flowers this Spring. An awesome wonder like this comes rarely. Not only the poppies were in bloom, but also yellow wild flowers blanketed entire fields. Wow! The abundance of color was even more beautiful than I remember in 1996 (or thereabouts) if memory serves. If you had the opportunity to see the poppies (etc.) this year, you were lucky too. If not, be sure not to miss it next time Mother Nature decides to show her splendor.",madsigntist

30,A really beautiful area,"Fields of color. This was a particularly good year for the poppies as we had a lot of rain this year. Frankly, once you've seen it, there's nothing much else to do. I live in the Antelope Valley and at the end of Avenue M and 75th St W there was an equally beautiful display of poppies which could be seen for free. Not a fan.",marvinfrederickb

50,Worth seeing when in season!!,"Came to Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve in early April. Pictures do not do this place justice!!This place can best be described using any synonym of the word BEAUTIFUL!!!!! Is it beautiful year round? Probably not because the poppies do not bloom year round.There are about 8 miles of trails to hike, and PLEASE stay on the official trails!! That way no damage is done to the habitat. We want to witness this beauty of a park for years to come.",ExpoNationals
50,Poppies are everywhere!,"My wife and I have recently visited the Poppy reserve and found that there are more poppies this year than we've seen in quite a few years.it's definitely worth the drive out, so to see all the beautiful colors that nature has to offer.",Richard H
40,Super Super Super bloom,9 April 2019 It was amazing! We stayed outside the park. There was a long line to get in. The flowers were also outside...everywhere! It was a once in a lifetime spectacle!,Ana B
50,Orange Field,Stopped here to see the poppy flowers since CA had a wet winter. Got to the fields a little too early so get the full poppy effect. Walked the grounds and spoke to staff. They were very friendly and answered all questions. Nice visitors center/gift shop.,SRL2007
50,Amazing super bloom,"The bloom is absolutely amazing. I went last weekend (Apr 21st), and the hills were covered with poppies! It was a little windy when I was there... and though it was sunny, the poppies didn't open until around 9 or so. They also close fairly early, around 3. The hike within the park is lovely (the north and south poppy loop), and there are some poppies on the other side as well, but even along the road leading to the reserve, you will see huge swathes of poppies, which are even more accessible for people to get close to.We did see a lot of people trampling over poppies and sitting on them(!!!) squashing the plants in the effort to get the perfect selfie. It was very sad to see these things happening in spite of the number of signs to stay on the trail. Please be mindful and leave the place as you found it for other visitors like you to enjoy.",Nandini V
50,BLOOMING SUPER STYLE!,This is worth the drive no matter how far. The bloom is going to end soon ..so don't miss it! I could have stayed for hours but just glad I saw it. It was very very windy so the blooms were closed and still stunning! It was $12 to get in per car. There are bathrooms on site. Bring a picnic and eat in one of the picnic shelters. The valley is just beautiful with ranches and big open fields. People need to stay out of the fields...many areas were beat down.,Pammy B
50,Worth the drive,"It's quite far off the highway so it's a bit of a trek to get out there, but definitely worth the trip. We arrived around 9ish on a weekday and the wait for the parking lot was already around the hour wait time mark. Luckily there is parking along the street and the walk isn't very far. If you see long line when you arrive, just drive past the entrance a little and you'll see parking on the right-hand side. No restaurants or shops in the immediate area so make sure you bring drinks and snacks. Nearby towns are good for a meal though.",Melissa G
50,Poppies For Miles,We stopped along the road with several other cars and walked on the trails through the poppies. Plenty of photo opportunities. I hope people realize what a great place this is and don't feel they have to develop it. Like they've done to the rest of Southern California.,Don C
50,Beautiful!,We thoroughly enjoyed our weekday visit to the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve. The bloom was magnificent!,Michele H
50,Stunning view of California poppies all over,"I dont think we can get as spectacular a bloom in Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve every year. This year is really special because of the rain.Forget parking inside, the walk in to the park is only around half a mile .The reserve at spring time is a sight to behold !",GintamaZ
50,Spring Break,"I heard about the Super Blooms on the news and saw images from NASA so I wanted to visit during my Spring Break.There are various paths to follow, some go left, some go right, some are short some are over the one-mile hike.The best way to enjoy the wildflowers is yo arrive early and take at least a couple of the one-mile trails. Bring water, a camel-back type for carrying water is better than water bottles, if you have it. Some used umbrellas for shade from the sun. There are benches along the trails.There is handicap parking but the paths are not designed for wheelchairs.The toilets are the outhouse style. Kind of gross to use and get filthy and lack toilet paper quickly.As you drive to this place the wildflowers and poppies start showing up in abundance along the sides of the road, cars tend to stop for pictures occasionally.It's an experience one needs to appreciate.Super Blooms only happen when there is enough rains, sometimes once in a hundred years in some places.So many people commented that they never knew this place was here.It's still in bloom but not for long.",Alejandro O
50,late March in the afternoon,"The hills are golden in California poppies in late March. The flowers do not open early in the morning or on the cloudy day, so the best viewing is in the afternoon on a sunny day.",Laura G
50,Beautiful,"Truly beautiful. I was in Lancaster area on an unexpected trip and I decided to check out the poppy reserve as I've heard about it here and there. It's the only thing of note in this strange desert outpost, but it's worth a check. Overall, it was a pleasant trip to Lancaster and to top it all off the Poppy Reserve was gorgeous. If they put more things here in Antelope Valley, I could even see myself living here. Probably not, but who knows?",Josh L
50,Super bloom beauty!,"Traveled through the last week in March and the poppies at the reserve were spectacular. We ended up parking on the roadside because the lot was full and as one vehicle left, another was let in. Short walk from the road was fine. We did the Tehachapi view side and even though there were people, most of the time we wer by ourselves.i guess most visitors went the other direction. Where the poppies contrasted against yellow and purple flowers was stunning. Beware of the winds though, my camera ended up with fine dust on the sensor and a cleaning was needed afterward. Two weeks later found us in the area again. We didn’t need to visit the park because there were miles and miles of poppies along the 138 roadside that weren’t there in March. Well worth the visit! We spent almost 2 hours at the reserve walking around at a leisurely pace.",196CindyJ196
50,Awesome!!!,"We drove by here last year and there was absolutely nothing. Park rangers told us to follow their Facebook page for the most up to date info on the flowers.Thank goodness for their advice. As soon as we saw pics posted on the Facebook page this season, we planned our trip.Made some sandwiches and brought some snacks and water. Driving there was absolutely stunning!We parked on the street and walked in. (There is parking inside the park for $10). There was an over abundance of poppies!!We hiked around for 4 miles just to enjoy the flowers. Wear comfy shoes, sunscreen and layers.Had our lunch at one of the picnic tables on site.A perfect day enjoying our beautiful California.",R4CERFR4N
50,The time is now!,"If you wait even a couple weeks, I think you'll miss the peak. If you are going during the peak, go during a weekday or go very early. Otherwise you'll likely have to park outside the reserve and hike in a half a mile. But, the other thing is that the poppies are fickle. They don't open up until mid morning, but by mid afternoon the show is over. They also don't like cloudy days and they don't like high winds. Good luck scheduling a time when both you and the poppies are available!",gregsf11
50,Superbloom is beyond spectacular,"Great swathes of poppies shimmer and dance in the wind. I couldn't have understood the scale of the superbloom without seeing it. I now understand why it can be seen from space. The electric orange is dazzling.I understand there is an official area, which most people refer to in their reviews. We just parked on the side of the road, along with many others. If you don't require the official facilities, there's no need to go in there. We arrived at around 9:30 am on April 15 and there was an abundance of flowers and plenty of street parking. The buds were still closed, but were open within half an hour. I don't know if it's sun related or temperature which causes them to wake up, but it was a clear day, with no cloud or haze. It was breezy and the terrain is sandy underfoot, so dress accordingly. There are some small hills which don't require any specialist footwear, but those with mobility concerns would probably want to bring a walking stick. I can see how some people might not stay as long as we did, but I think most would find the superbloom a spectacular sight, and it can be seen for free.",QueenCherryUK
50,Nature in its perfection,"The natural beauty of California's Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve is possible once a year, only in the first month of spring. The park is easily accessible. Situated on the hills above the Antelope Valley, it is very well organized with a single purpose to allowed the lovers of nature to fully immerse themselves in this orange fairie. When you are in the middle of this sea of orange, playful wind and endless sky blue, the feeling of another planet is irresistible. Touching the uniqueness of nature in its infinite expressions will fill you with positive energy and as a piano chordor will tune up your senses. Antilope poppy reserve is a natural wonder you have to experience.",Krassimir G

40,Orangee...,"It's a must visit, if you living / visiting the region around this time, of the year. The bloom is there from March to May. This year 2019, its called the super bloom due to the right weather conditions.Getting There - You need to drive all the way there no other option.Parking - Theres a paid parking offered by the state, but most of the time its generally full and crowded. The best thing is to park it around the trail and walk to the reserve which is about a 20 mins slow walk.Food - No eateries available and bring snacks as much as you canWater - Theres plenty of water stations but no bottled waterRestrooms - There are enough rest rooms for the crowd, but the state could do a better job in keeping them clean, thats the only reason for giving 4-starShelters - Theres some open shelter area at the start of the trail and thats good enough to hold the moving crowd",Caballero500

50,"In full bloom, a bright carpet of orange","We arrived at the Poppy Reserve a little after 10 AM on a Friday. There was a line of about 20 cars waiting to enter the park but there were still spaces available in the parking lot. On the weekends during the seasonal bloom, you must arrive early or be prepared to park on Lancaster Rd. and hike in.The wildflowers were only partially opened at 10 AM. After it warmed up, the flowers were able to fully open and show their color. It was a dazzling display of orange with splashes of yellow, purple, white and blue wildflowers.When we visited in mid-April, the most dense bloom was on the North and South Poppy Trail Loops just to the West of the visitors center. On the upper elevations of the Antelope and Lightning Bolt Trails, the some of the poppies were starting to show the beginnings of wilting... The flowers should easily last until the end of the April unless there is a heatwave.We hiked the trails and brought our lunch... it is a great way to spend the day.A couple of suggestions:-Bring water on your hike.-Stay on the trails, the flowers are fragile and there are rattlesnakes out there.-Protect your skin, wear a hat and consider sunscreen.-Bring your camera",lwj
50,2019 Super Bloom,"Visited the Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve Saturday Apr 13 2019. Took Palmdale Blvd West from 14 Fwy, lovely drive through picturesque farms to Elizabeth Lake. North on Munz Ranch Road with panoramic views to Lancaster Rd, then 2 mi west to park entrance. I arrived at 9:30AM, and the parking lot was already filled! I parked along Lancaster Rd with everyone else, and walked 0.5 mi to park entrance, and then another 0.5 mi to the parking lot. GET THERE EARLY! Walked slowly up the hill to the first two vista points, taking lots of photos along the way. You can close your eyes, snap the shutter, and all your photos will be ""keepers"". The poppies are brilliant gold and yellow, with small purple flowers intermixed. Gorgeous carpets of gold are laid out for you as far as your eye can see...blanketing all the hills and valleys in every direction you turn. If you close your eyes, you may hear Julie Andrews singing. I ended at the Information Center for some air conditioning, a much needed cold water for $1 from a very friendly ranger, and a full service bathroom. In the midst of such beauty, everyone is very excited and happy!",Don Feeney
50,Eye popping flower fields,"At this time of year the poppies are in full bloom. The preserve is a great way to see them though weekends are way too crowded. show up early to get in without long traffic back ups. if you can't make it in drive around the area including the back side of the preserve to see the same sights. This year, after lots of rain and now sun, it is a superbloom, still blooming.",Lawrence W

50,Color that did not disappoint,"I have visited the Reserve numerous times over the years when i lived in So Cal. When I was planning a visit to So Cal recently, I noticed on social media all the photos of the super bloom going on in various places in So Cal. My daughter and I decided to visit Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve in hopes that flowers were still ongoing. Wow, we wandered in a sea of orange poppies on the easy trails over and around the hills. Looking up close one could see a variety of white, blue, yellow and purple flowers mixed in among the orange. The air was scented with the perfume of wild flowers....sweet but in a spicy way that is different than the scent of flower shop bouquets. The visitor center was as I remember, staffed with friendly people that could answer my questions. There is a nice film about the preserve, and also some great gift items to take home. I had to purchase post cards to send to friends back home in the midwest to show them the natural beauty of California. The drive from Los Angeles was beautiful too, through the mountains on route 14. This Reserve is well worth the drive!",gardengal61659
50,Poppy fields make the hills look like they are on fire!,"I visited the Reserve twice, two weeks apart. The warm weather really brought out the poppy blooms on my second visit. Expect crowds when things are in bloom. You can park for free and walk in. Well maintained trails. The gift shop offers many poppy-related items: mugs, shirts, note cards, seed packets. Well-worth seeing if you're in the area in spring.",librarianlorraine

50,Nature’s Paintbrush,"We were there for the Superbloom and it was spectacular. The poppies extend for miles outside the preserve Turing the hills red and gold. Don’t miss the view from Munz Farm Road, drive to the end and turn around as you descend the hill there are several places to stop and observe the entire landscape ablaze in color",Jim K
40,Painted Fields,As you approach from the west you start seeing patches of orange and yellow as if someone threw paint on the fields in the distance.You see small and large patches of orange and yellow along the road and you find people pulling over to snap pictures.When you arrive at the reserve you will want to turn around due to the traffic. Wow. Lots of poppy fans all around. But wait - don't run the other way.If you're here to enjoy the splendor - just park on the side of the road and hike around - it's a walk - not a hike.You can get wonderful pictures - close ups and panoramic - of the fields and hills of poppies.Was it worth the drive?

50,Beautiful super bloom.,We were here on April 2 and it would appear that the flowers were at their peak.The entrance road was backed up half way to the highway and it did take a fair amount of time to get in. Only one side of the entrance station was operating - in the afternoon both side were in operation and the line was moving much faster.We walked most of the trails. Most of the visitors seem to congregate near the parking lots and the two vista points near the parking lots. There is one short paved trail - all the rest are dirt/gravel.If you do the 1.2 mile trail on the west side or the Antelope Butte Vista Point you will lose most of the crowd.The flowers were amazing - even better than the Carrizo Plain National Monument or Grass Mountain in Santa Ynez. Many flowers besides the poppies were also out.It was extremely windy when we were there - so windy it was hard to get the car door open. The website said it was usually windy in the spring and they weren't kidding.Bring water - I did not see any place to fill a water bottle.,B L
50,Spectacular views - One of the most beautiful sites ever,"We visited on April 8 from 10:30-12:30, the weather conditions were perfect, warm with a light breeze. The poppies were open and along with the other wildflowers made the landscape spectacular. No photos do the super bloom justice. All those little flowers bursting with color, covering the hillside and the valley is so very beautiful. The bloom starts miles outside of the park and people pull over to take photos all along the road. It is one of the most stunning sites ever. The park is so popular that by 12:30 on Monday, the park closed the gate to cars. You can park outside and walk in. Check the weather conditions and the park’s website before going because the area can get very windy. The park is well managed with flush toilets that were clean, nice picnic area and visitors center.",Maryam N

50,Planning Ahead To Make The Best!,"As readers mentioned, avoid weekends if you can to escape the crowd and parking madness. Arrive early, not too early since poppies may not wake up. Carry water. Park inside, pay $10, to save energy to walk along the poppy trail! See the pictures illustrating the beauty and parking madness.",elixirpost
50,"Gorgeous, but pay attention to reviews and info!","We visited this morning, and it is absolutely gorgeous!! Well worth the visit. A lot has been said about the beauty of this place, so instead of talking about that. I would just like to lease some tips to enhance your experience.1. If visiting during peak season on a weekend (mid March -April), arrive early. We got there at 7 on a Saturday, and there was a line, but only because people couldn’t figure out how to self pay for parking. I would say be there by 7:30 for the best parking experience, and after eight, you’ll probably be parking on the road.2. Try to park by the visitor center. It’s worth the $10. There are tons of walking trails, and the less walking you have to do to get into the preserve, the better your experience will be within preserve will be.3. Another reason why you should arrive early is to avoid the crowds. There are tons of people trying to take “that perfect picture” for social media. It can make hiking and walking less enjoyable. When you arrive early, you don’t have to park to yourself, but it’s much quieter.4. Arriving early will be less stressful, but you probably won’t see the poppies open. They do not open when it is windy, or really cold. By about 930 10 AM, if it’s not too windy of a day, and the sun is out, the poppies will open, but the park is massively crowded by then. However, on a great. Loom year, the colors and flowers are still gorgeous.5. It is intensely windy and cold in the morning. I was wearing yoga pants, and a hooded sweatshirt, and I wish I had a beanie and maybe another layer of clothing. Also gloves. However, after about an hour, you get used to it.",JoyNCH
40,Lots of pretty blooming poppies.,"We have not seen such a large bloom in a number of years. Plenty of trails to hike. Even though we came during the week, the parking lot was full andwe had to park on the street. No big deal, just walked the ½ mile into the reserve.",RDaveR
50,Glorious Scenes in a Desert Spring,Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve is one of the most beautiful sights we have ever scene. We went on April 1 and 2 and both days were superlative. April 1 PM had poppies in full glorious bloom. April 2 AM was very windy and poppies were somewhat more restrained but overall scene was jaw dropping. This sight in California ranks with the very best and would be a treat for anyone who loves flowers or magnificent colors.,Charles S

50,You Must See for yourself,"In 1991 I made my first visit here, for what we now call a ""super bloom."" This doesn't happen every year, and in fact, there may be a number of years without one. 1991 was one and I was worried that my memory didn't fit actuality. I live about 8 hours away, but not knowing when there will be another one, I went. If anything, reality was better than my memory. Yes, it was crowded; it took me about 20 minutes to get in, but as I can't walk as far as I used to, it was well worth the wait. The visitor center is chocked full of good info as well as a nice selection of appropriate books and gifts, and the volunteers are GREAT! The trails take you through the entire area. Some are fairly easy and I saw people on crutches and wheelchairs. But PLEASE!!! These flowers are here for ALL to see and enjoy. Many people there didn't seem to care about the flowers per se; they were there solely to take a selfie. It seemed to be about THEM, not the flowers. The volunteers do a very good job of keeping people on the trails, but they can't be everywhere. I had to tell a number of people to please stay on the trails (Yes, there are MANY signs there) but some people care more about their selfie. Just outside of the park I saw MANY people not only traipsing through the flowers, but they would plop down right on the flowers just to get a selfie of them there. People, this is the desert and the habitat is FRAGILE! Is a selfie really worth destroying these gorgeous flowers? Please use some restraint.",Bob M
50,Lovely outing,Poppies and other flowers in full bloom. Very windy so bring a jacket. Didn’t go to main entrance. Parked along the street. Beautiful flowers just outside the car with walking path!,Marla L
50,SUPER BLOOOOOOM!,It's an extraordinary time in Souther California Spring 2019 with all of the flowering flowers! This place was incredible.,SaschaFFFF
50,Worth it.,"I recommend an early arrival to beat the crowds. That being said, we got there around 10:30 and were able to find parking along the road. Last weekend the poppy blooms were abundant. What a sight to see a carpet of orange bathing the area.",Alan A
50,AWESOME!,"Well worth the drive! Be prepared for lots of people and a little wait to get in, but spectacular views.",Lisa S
40,Amazing during Late March.... Bring a WINDPROOF jacket.. very windy!,"Great place to go and visit. You can park on the side of the road and walk all the way up to the poppy reserve. There are many trails, though the walk/hike is not very intensive and is relatively easy to do. There are benches every few hundred feet to sit down and take a break if needed, otherwise, one cannot sit or walk off the trail.Going in late March, it was extremely windy, highly recommend a windproof jacket",Moti L
50,Amazing Must See,We were slightly disappointed when we went 3 weeks ago. I gave it a average review. I had said it was too early and the poppies needed more time. Well we went again yesterday (April 1) and it was amazing. The images are burned into my memory. Just go see it. I suggest you park outside on the road and hike in which is what we did. The parking line getting into the park is horrendous.,Aleka2
40,Super Bloom Extraordinaire!,"The poppies this year are spectacular! Billions of little orange ""flags"" waving in the breeze (for there seems to always be a breeze). There is also a good showing of purple, yellow and white flowers with the occasional appearance of butterflies & birds. There are a number of paths to choose from. You can pick up a ""trail"" map from the park or download it from their website. The car line to pay for admission & park is pretty long in the morning hours, shrinking some in the afternoon, but they allow parking along the road outside the park if you don't mind walking in. This is wide open with no shade, so be prepared. Also no food services but there are some picnic facilities. Expect lots of people; double that for the weekends! Small bathrooms at the visitor center with several porta-potties available along the parking lot. Bring water.",Sonshine2000
50,Amazing!,We went to see the Super Bloom & it was totally worth it. We pulled off onto a side dirt road and avoided the crowds. Saw amazing poppies everywhere. It’s supposed to be good through the end of April - give a call to their hotline before heading out for a bloom update.,Sharon O
50,Poppy Palooza - Go Now!,"The poppies are at peak bloom and after the unusually wet winter, the profusion of blooms are at a level that may not be seen again in decades! The peak will probably last only a couple more weeks as the blooms rapidly fade when weather gets hot in the desert. It is best to go on a calm, sunny day as the poppies open each morning to greet the sun and may close if the winds are cold.Undoubtedly, you will be far from the only person that has come to see nature’s spectacle and one will likely need to park along the road in front and hike 0.5 mile (0.8k) to the visitor center and the poppy fields, or wait in line for an hour to get a parking spot in the lot, even during midweek, as was the case for us on a Thursday visit. However, with 1800 acres and 7 miles of well-maintained trails, there is plenty of room for all once inside although the visitor center can be very crowded. The park has added a number of porta-potties to help accommodate the large number of visitors but a wait is still likely.While we found sharing in the spectacle with the crowd was part of the experience, if you rather not, there are plenty of poppies outside of the park – simply head towards the park and one cannot miss numerous blooms along the road when one gets close; just be sure to respect private property and do not trample or pick the poppies.",Steve5863
40,"Great Flowers, Too Much Company","My wife and I spent several wonderful hours at the Poppy Reserve on a recent Saturday. It was an easy less than 1 1/2 hour drive from LA. When we arrived the sun was shining and the hills were aglow with vibrant oranges, yellows, and purples. The clouds came in quickly and definitely muted the show, making the purples especially hard to see. The trails were well-marked and easy to see. The crowds were understandable but a definite negative. Even at the edges of the reserve you always had some company. Parking was very difficult as the lot was full so we had to park on the road. The closest spot we could find was about 1/2 mile from the entrance road. At least that made the trip free as we did not have to pay the $10 parking fee. The gift shop was small but friendly with a selection of appropriate and reasonably priced merchandise for sale. We bought a couple of lovely flower prints to bring back as souvenirs. All-in-all a worthwhile experience while the flowers are blooming.",DT355
50,"Amazing! But, PLEASE stay on the trails and don't pick!!","Truly amazing. We went March 29th. I have never seen anything like this.Please be kind to the flowers - don't pick, lay on the flowers, kneel in them or step in them just to get the perfect Instagram pic. Leave as many flowers for the next generation please and thank you!!!",traveler21132655
40,Two pieces of advise: Don't go on a overcast day and don't go on the weekends,"We were just there, March 18, 2019. It was beautiful but it was an overcast day and the poppies were pretty much closed up. Even so, there was a huge display of golden color on the hills. It took well over a half hour to get into the park People were friendly and polite and everyone was taking pictures. There are bathroom facilities but they don't have flush toilets. No dogs allowed in the park. The one thing we were surprised with is they were not giving out packets of free poppies at the center. We thought that would be a nice thing to do. If you don't want to pay the entrance fee, you might be able to find a parking place along the outside road but the walk in is at least a mile.",Blooms65
50,Spectacular Blooms for Easy Walkers and Serious Hikers,"My favorite thing about this place was how accessible it is to all types of people. The fields stretch for literal miles and you can walk/hike as long as you want making various loops to suit your desires. Only the furthest hills would be considered steep but only slightly so. The dirt is pretty packed so dust clouds and slipping are minimal with a plain tennis shoe.Don't be overwhelmed by the size! You don't need to see every corner unless you truly want to. Bring snacks and water and have a sit on the numerous benches along the trails to reenergize. Trails are clearly marked with distances so there are no mileage surprises.Driving past is one thing. Walking among the flowers and seeing just how many are in a single square foot? Quite another you won't regret or forget.Tips: Come EARLY, leave EARLY. As in, be at the entrance at 7am (yes they open that early, we asked). We arrived at 8:05 and the second lot was already half full. Parking is $10 per car, carpooling is greatly appreciated by others and the planet. Stay for 2 hrs, then leave by 10:00 to avoid the mile long backup of cars waiting to get in. You will also have more open paths in which to enjoy nature and take photos without Instagramers getting in your way.Skip the long lines at the PortaPotty and use the bathrooms at the visitor center. They are empty as people think the outdoor ones are the only option.If you plan to park along the highway to avoid Carmaggedon and save $10, come EARLY for 2 reasons: it's a 3/4 mi walk from the road to the entrance and after a long hike in the flowers (average 4 mi), another 2 mile walk will feel brutal if you parked far away; best to leave before the parking line is so backed up you won't be able to turn back on the road to actually leave.At the entrance, first go to the flat trail to the RIGHT, walking eastward. These flowers are the most in bloom and are more densely populated than the higher trails. Start here for the best use of your time, also the easiest for gentle walkers!",Crystal
50,Peak season is NOW !!,"We drove up from Southern California and stayed in Lancaster last night so that we were only 15 minutes away from the poppy reserve.You absolutely need to get there very early. We were there at 9 AM in the parking lot was closed and people were already parked on the street which was at least a mile from where the poppy visitor center is located. They said that they wait to get into the parking lot would be at least an hour.We could see as we were walking up in the hills the traffic coming was absolutely crazy and continued for the entire day with people literally walking for miles just to get to the visitor center and trails.There is a large group of people who dominate the people here who go to this reserve and many of them have no respect for the rules to do not stay on the path!!Follow the rules people !!! You speak English but you feel like you can do anything you want! Not acceptable at all.This review was written on Saturday, March 30, 2019 and this week is the peak season for the blooming. There are several walkways, a.k.a. trails that you must stay on! My suggestion is it to go early and be there before 9 AM and if possible go on a weekday. We work so we were not able to go during the week.As you approach the small visitor center the trail that goes off toward the left has a lot less people and after doing both trails, the trail to the left we think has much more and better flower density to take photographs.We spent 4 hours walking the trails and it was absolutely awesome! We have never seen anything like this before.Take food and water. There is neither there or anywhere nearby at all. You will need to bring lunch and water to stay hydrated.As for bathrooms, there are porta-potties in a couple places going up the hill but once you reach the visitors center there are a couple bathrooms there, men had no wait; women had 5-10 in line.The visitors center is very small without much but had rangers to talk to. There is no food or water sold on site.Go now and enjoy the amazing fields - please just stay on the trails!",ItchyFeet

It's a good idea to look at the forecast for wind conditions as well; the poppies get blown closed when it is windy.",Evan T
40,"Crowded, poppies closed up due to cold and wind",Drove for almost two hours to the park on Saturday (23). Park was very crowded. Many people left cars on the side road and walked to the park.Poppies season is definitely in peak. Unfortunately it was cloudy and windy so all flowers were closed.,BOROHA_
40,Beautiful,"Beautiful, with several miles of hiking trails easy to moderate, so accesible to all. You have to time your visit right. Poppies were just starting to bloom in mid March. The peak of the bloom varies from one year to the next, follow updates on the park web site or social media before you go. Go early. There is a long line to enter in peak season and parking lot gets full after mid morning.The weather was perfect.",ElenaT3
40,Blazing Hills,We are visiting from Indiana. The weather was great and the hills were so pretty with all the flowers blooming. Just go ahead and park outside the Reserve on the side of the road. It is a small hike but saves you the fee. Be sure to visit the center for info.,A3368UKwendyt
50,Poppies are in bloom,"We went to the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserveon on Tuesday March 19. Much of the poppies were in full bloom. I suggest that if anyone plans to go. They should try to go early. When we gpt ot the reserve, there were a line of cars waiting to enter and the parking lot were full. We had to park in the over-flow lot. There were several good patches of fully bloom poppies on the way to the reserve. Many were stopped to view the freshly bloomed flowers or take pictures. One can get close up pictures at these patches because you really get close to the flowers. I do recommend that you go to the reserve. The wait was not too bad, in my opinion. The reserve offered walking trails to view the many patches of flowers. The trails go all the way to the top of the hills that offers panoramic view of the Antelope Valley as well view of the many poppies in the reserve. This once-a-year trip to view these beautiful flowers are well worth the trip.",Francis P

It was an easy drive from the San Fernando valley, you can get there either using the 5 or the 14. There are plenty of poppies along the drive, just watch where you park if you are stopping along the road, some area are sandy and you might get stuck. Be sure to bring water and use sunscreen and there is a fee for parking in the preserve.",paulsa
40,See the Poppys,About an hour and 15 min.easy drive from West LA. I had an enjoyable afternoon hike to view the poppy's. I would recommend it and do it again. Beautiful!,Eddie N
40,A Good Year That Will Probably Get Better,"We visited the Reserve on March 19th. It was worth the trip. There were large numbers of poppies in the portions of the park closest to the Interpretive Center and parking lots, but I know from prior visits that the numbers of flowers and areas covered don’t match the bestshow that the Reserve can present. While walking several of the various walking trails I noticed that there were a great many as-yet unopened buds on the plants; I’d thus guess that the show is going to get better and better about as quickly as the weather (the immediate forecast is for rain and colder temperatures, apparently not a poppy’s favorite weather) allows.Give it a few days; it could be a rare treat.",ARA49
50,Poppies and more poppies!,"It doesn’t happen every year, but if it rains enough, the hills are alive with fluttering poppies. Drive a few miles west of Lancaster on Avenue I and park in the parking lot ( $10) of the Poppy Reserve. People parked on the road were getting tickets, so watch out! The trails meander around the park and vary in length and slope ( mostly quite easy, no need for special gear). There are wide vistas and plenty of photo ops.",liliana h
50,Going again!!,"We visited on March 9... not quite blooming yet, so we're going again this weekend. This park is so beautiful, even without the poppies. Beautiful, well kept trails. Benches along the way. Vistas to stare at for eternity! We did ALL the trails, about 7 miles of them total.The visitor center is so inviting. All the volunteers are super friendly and informative. Fun stuff to purchase. I think they could update the film with an HD version!Can't wait to go back.",CarrieTravels
40,Beautiful,Absolutely beautiful. There are about 10 buds for every three flowers so my guess is another week it will be even better. We arrived on a Tuesday Monday morning at 11:00 am and the wait to get into the parking lot was crazy. We ended up using the porta potties and turning around and just walking up from the road side.,Brendavig
50,Wow! Perfect way to herald in Spring,"The poppies are BEAUTIFUL this year We are new residents to CA and we were excited to replicate our New England seasonal habit of looking at Fall colors, California Spring-style. Antelope Valley is a bit of s trek- out in “nowhere”, but certainly worth the adventure. The poppies are stunning- beautiful rolling hills. The facilities are well maintained, staff helpful, and nice trails. A refreshing and picturesque way to spend the day.",MaryAnn S
40,"We visited March 13, and the cold wind kept the poppies from opening","We were told by a volunteer that the very cold wind kept the poppies from opening up. Very nice trails and views, helpful staff at the gift shop and the visitor center. We found many open poppies on the road leading to the Reserve. Nice picnic area. Lots of parking.",simivalley1699
40,Not Quite There Yet,"We visited the Poppy Reserve on March 16th. While the flowers that were present were pretty enough it will be probably be best to wait a while longer before making your visit. According the park personnel, the poppies should be in full bloom toward the end of March through April.A word to those who visit: As we were driving away from the Reserve we noted large numbers of individuals TRESPASSING on the private property adjacent to the Reserve and along Lancaster Road; trampling the poppies and other wildflowers growing on those properties, It is disappointing to see how many have so little respect for private property and the plant life on those properties. If you are visiting the area, please do so with respect!",LuvToCruise4001
10,Way Too Early-Forget It,"Went March 14, cold windy and the only blooms were a few along the roadside outside of the preserve. First week of April might be a better show. Elizabeth really should revise her review.",profjohns
50,Worth the Trip; Even Better if Poppies and Flowers Out,"We traveled here last weekend mid-March. As there has been lots of moisture it would be a good year for poppies. It turns out the colder weather in February has delayed what will be a magnificent display by mid-April. However, it was stilll beautiful. The small interpretive center is nice and the walks and views of the Antelope Valley terrific. This is pretty far out there, so leave time for the travel, but as an opportunity to see more of what makes California great and to learn a bit of what the state looked like 200 years ago this is well worth it.",Douglas T
10,Major Disappointment,"Went to the Poppy Reserve region at the below noted review of Elizabeth who said to ""Go now!"" There were more poppies in bloom in the hill behind my house in Riverside than the 10 miles surrounding the reserve. It was horrible. Clear skies and low 60's. I would say it was several weeks too early. Waste of my day. Stay at the lower warmer elevations.",NeilinSCal

30,"Gorgeous, with a caveat","We went to Antelope Valley during the 2017 super bloom. It was spectacular! But, we had a small dog with us and dogs are not allowed in the preserve, not even if left in the car! Also, it's high desert and windy and can be quite chilly in spring when the flowers are in bloom. If cloudy, the flowers may not be at their best (open). There is an uphill hike. Nevertheless, if you can get there in a super bloom year, GO! Go anywhere there are wild flowers. Nature truly is the very best artist.",ptryph

After finding this site, I'm going to contact the dept responsible for the poppy fields and ask if they are even aware that sPower Solar is doing this. It has turned me against solar power completely.

30,Oops! Don’t Pick the Flowers,OK every year the city of Lancaster and Palmdale get together and hold a poppy flower festival. The intentions are good the view sometimes is fantastic.! And the organizers have a good intentions of bringing together the community for a local resource that they hold near and dear.However! And but! Along with flowers and beautiful scenery that California is used to be famous for. It is all depended upon one natural resource to fall from the sky‘s! It is called RAIN!!!! Yes we used to have it seasonal rains but lately it’s been a crapshoot. It’s sad to see but the seasonal changes in California have changed over the last 20 years and now we are in a semi constant summer with maybe three months of cooler temperatures and a little rain.Not to deter from this beautiful scenery but to offer you another chance might I suggest you go up Highway 58 which is approximately 10 to 15 miles north of Lancaster and follow it due West towards Bakersfield. once you leave Tehachapi going west you will see the most incredible site of wild poppy flowers that I’ve ever seen in my life! Sorry until the weather changes with the rain start coming more frequently and consistently this will be a dud.,Steve
30,When blooms abound there’s no need,"There’s plenty of places to go see poppies without paying at the reserve -except where the fields of poppies have been taken over by solar panels. However, if you want the tour or displays in the facility you’ll pay a small fee.",kirkh84

30,FIRST check online for blooming,"... because the Visitor Center is kind of sad so it only pays to enter if you need to use a bathroom. It is not big enough to swing a cat around by the tail without getting hair in your mouth. Mostly a gift shop, very little in the way of natural history exhibits, but a sizable wall of images of the person the Center it's named after. The goods are uninspired. There is a poor resolution movie in the style and narration of 1st gen nature docs, the ones that set you napping in elementary school. (And this from a nature documentary nerd. I will cut a nature doc more slack than anyone I know) . The best thing about the visitor center is the fact that it is built into the side of the hill (lowers AC cost) and is architecturally interesting.",Donna D

40,"No poppies at this time, but lovely in a wild and free sort of way nonetheless","This just isn't the year for poppies, but we enjoyed the drive and being at this location nonetheless. We were in Lancaster and had been wanting to see the Reserve so decided to visit. It only took maybe 20 minutes from town. The reserve is in a remote location. You are required to pay $10 parking ($9 for seniors) but there are numerous trails on which to walk and explore. It was EXTREMELY windy when we were there, so much so that my husband refused to go out walking (very unusual for him) but I ventured out anyway. Directly above the parking lot is a lovely Santa Fe style interpretive center with a small but nice museum and gift shop and a smiling and friendly lady Forest Ranger. We arrived close to closing time (4 PM on a Sunday) so did not have as much time as we would have liked to enjoy the museum. The landscape consists of rolling hills as far as the eye can see - very pretty. There is a main path that is paved part way but do be prepared for walking on a sandy soil and dirt path when the pavement ends. We saw people on hilltops far in the distance but due to the extreme wind even I did not persevere to be outdoors hiking for long. Instead, I turned my focus to the waving grasses and sporadic wildflowers which were beautiful. As I mentioned in my title, it was a very wild and free sort of place. I do recommend that you visit here. We had THE BEST luncheon in town not far away at Don Gus. The welcome was warm, the service and food excellent. They also have strolling musicians on Sunday afternoons which was truly delightful! We used our GPS to get us back in the direction of Santa Clarita from the Poppy Reserve and it took us on an incredibly beautiful road for the better part of an hour through canyons and mountains. It was so very interesting! So do visit the Poppy Reserve to spend quiet, reflective time in nature. Tip: Eat first as there is no food available here. There are primitive restrooms available in the parking lot.Enjoy!",travelgirl93463
50,Beautiful and tranquil,"Visited for a safe place to run on my own when in Lancaster for my son’s Robotics tournament. Poppies were not in bloom, but it was beautiful nonetheless. Most visitors seemed to be staying close to the visitors center so I had the trails that were further out all to myself. Wonderfully peaceful with beautiful views of the surrounding mountains and joyful birdsong. I can only imagine how stunning it must be when the poppies are in full bloom.",Charlotte J
50,Bright gold flowers,"As of April 5th, we saw large clumps of bright gold flowers, with an occasional half-open poppy here and there, so it’s not poppy season quite yet. But this was a lovely place to walk around, with wide trails climbing up gentle slopes, and benches so we could sit and admire the views. It was very windy while we were there (which explains the windmills nearby), so you may want to bring a warm jacket and a hat. There’s a $10 entrance fee per car, and flush restrooms at the visitor center (doors are on the outside).",travelerfromsj

40,Timing is the key,"This was a beautiful park. We visited in mid April, 2017. Poppies were mostly gone. Local folks said best season is depending on the weather, so you could either closely check weather, or be lucky if your trip date is already set. I was told end of March is good so we may visit here again next year. If you walk the longest trail, it'll be about 2 hours of walk. So, it's a good exercise as well. There are several other places within 100 miles from this place. We visited a couple and flowers were pretty dense here.",NorCalSFO

50,"2017, Best Year Ever","Tip #1: I wouldn't bother with the expensive parking lot -- it's easy to walk in from the road, and there are usually better flower displays on the way, anyway.Tip#2: Don't go by the website's flower report or the phone recording, they tend to be very inaccurate. Visit their Facebook page instead for better updates. Sorry, website person, we've been skunked by your report three different years already.Tip#3: If the flowers look sparse at the preserve, try driving to a higher elevation -- the corner of Elizabeth Lake Road and Muniz Ranch Road in Leona Valley is another famous hillside stop for flower photography.Tip#4: Print out a map of the area and try driving around the sides and top of the park boundary, where there are few people and lots of opportunities to wander the flower fields without crowds.Tip#5: Be prepared for windy or hot conditions. If it isn't too hot, you can still get pretty uncomfortable if you don't have a windbreaker, and a hat to keep your hair from constantly blowing in your eyes.Tip #5: Watch for pedestrians and drive slowly on approach to the preserve when it's busy. Pedestrians constantly wander into the road to take pictures and it's super-easy to run someone over if you're not watching carefully. Cars and motorcycles can pop out of the parking lot suddenly, too, so be warned.Tip #6: In flower season, or ""peak weekends,"" don't go on a weekend at all -- you'll experience bumper-to-bumper traffic. Go on a weekday instead.",SoCalRambler

50,"Really, Really Seasonal. (Plus a Safety Tip)","The poppy bloom is very dependent on how much rain the area gets in the winter. The bloom can also get killed off easily by very hot weather. Before you go, it's worth it to check the official website at the CA Dept of Parks and Recreation. They are very good at updating the status of the bloom each week in the spring.You may have been drawn to the reserve by pretty pictures on social media of people laying in a bed of flowers. That's not allowed in the official reserve. (You can't even step off the trails because it hurts the flowers, officials say.) People take those special photos on the road outside the reserve, which is actually private property.That said, rangers warn that rattlesnakes really like hiding in poppies.

It was lovely to walk around and see all the California poppy's and the other wildflowers. Going into the reserve there are poppy's all along the road. When we left there was a long line of cars waiting to get in. I think it is the best of humanity that there are people who would wait hours for a chance to see wildflowers.",Sally B
40,Fantastic!,"First time visitor. We finally made it down to Lancaster in time to see the awesome display of blooms! We got there around 9 am on a Wednesday and paid $10 for parking in the lot. I wouldn't suggest getting the reserve any later than this. When we were leaving (around 11am) there was an incredible line of cars waiting to get into the park. That being said, the poppies and wild flowers looked beautiful so early in the morning!There are plenty of trails around the park; pick up the free map in the gift store before you head out to give you a better sense of what trails are available in the park.There are many warning signs for rattlesnakes and plenty of snake holes on the path; having a phobia of snakes . . . Unfortunately people think that they should be allowed to go off of the trails to take pictures - hello?

But, please keep in mind that parts are private property so be cautious on where you tread. The parking at the preserve is limited so get there super early or you will be waiting to park at the preserve or end up parking on the side of the road. Make sure you look at signs when street parking. Some areas closest to the preserve are no parking zones and there was a tow truck that was driving by when I was there. The preserve itself has limited shade areas, bring a hat. Limited restrooms, even the port a potties have a line. The trails are marked and you are not allowed to go off the trail to preserve the flowers. Make sure you bring your water and snacks if you plan on staying for more then 4 hours. There is a few picnic benches under some pergolas. It is a nice short day trip especially if you have never seen poppies.",Tucuxii

We had seen it on tv but the extent of the flowers on slopes and valleys was beyond our expectations. Just beautiful!We took many pictures and enjoyed the information center.It is important to stay on the paths so it can be hard to capture the amazing poppies. We were delighted to learn from another visitor that there was an adjoining Poppy field that was not part of the Preserve.

40,Beautiful Fields of Poppies But Only If You Are There At the Right Time,"If you love flowers and wildflower viewing trips, Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve should be on your list. This protected area harbors the most consistent blooms of California golden poppies, the state flower. The intense blooming season for the California golden poppy falls during the late February through the end of March. The flowers can blossom into April depend on the weather conditions. So it is wise to check the official website of Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve for a wildflower update before visiting the place. The website has their updates starting in February (when the flowers start blooming) until May (when the last flowers are gone). Blooming seasons are also dependent on the amount of rainfall during the winter to early spring.In addition, golden poppies are very delicate and fragile flowers. These flowers are so delicate that bad weather conditions can easily destroy them. They don't enjoy strong wind or heavy rain. The flowers close their petals during windy or cloudy weather. They open the petals only when the sun is strong (mostly 10 am - 3:00 pm). Therefore, you need a good plan for your visit if you want to view the golden poppies at their best.For wildflowers viewing trips, time is the key! So check the weather, check the wildflowers reports, plan your schedule so you will have the best experience or you will be disappointed (which is not the flowers' fault). They are not waiting! You have to catch them if you really love them!With the previous wet winter, this year the golden poppies at Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve had a spectacular bloom but that was in March. It is not a good idea to visit the Reserve now but you may still have some time left to catch an even more spectacular wildflowers show at nearby Carrizo Plain National Monument.With the previous wet winter, this year the poppies really bloomed well but that was in March. It's kind of late if you are planning to visit in late April.",IheartZephyr
30,Your Experience Depends On When You Catch The Bloom,"I rated this in the middle because if you hit the peak of the bloom it's 5 Stars, if you're too early or too late it's only a 1 star attraction. The best blooms were in a field just outside the Reserve in a private field that apparently got some irrigation. Inside the Reserve the hill were tan colored with sparse poppies. Two weeks ago I read that they'd had an explosion of poppies and it was a better year than expected.. (I have been here when the hills were thickly covered in orange blooms.) You just have to be lucky enough to hit it right. There are wildflower reports on the internet which track the spring bloom, I'd start following them in mid-march to see what they''re saying about this place.",Bruce G
40,Superbloom ? by mid April it s near faded,"Quite a long drive on a late Friday afternoon to check out the carpet of golden poppies.We arrived late evening almost at 530pm and the patchy blooms have their petals closed.If you are still planning a trip here in mid to late april, it may not be worth the long drive to see patchy and fading blooms.Google map says it s 1 hr 20 mins but it took us 2.5 to 3 hrs with the crawl out of LA esp the after 2pm traffic in LAContrary to reports the season is short and depends on earlier pre bloom rains .Somewhat disappointed !",Highadventurer
50,Fabulous reserve,"We missed the peak bloom but still found there were more poppies than I've ever seen in one place. It was really, really, really windy when we were there (and surprisingly chilly). Do as they suggest and wear layers, and also stay on the trail! We DID encounter a rattlesnake on the trail! A marvelous education center, ample parking. All in all a lovely way to spend an afternoon.",Beth C
30,Not worth a long drive now,"Based on the website saying there was still bloom on the west side, we drove 3 hours to the Preserve on 4/14/17 since the website says it is less crowded during the week, and early or late in the day. I agree with the previous review that it's the end of the bloom, but the website doesn't indicate that. We arrived at 4:30 pm while there was still lots of light, but there was a driving wind, and the poppies that were there were closed. We saw only two lupines, total. Afterwards, we did discover the charm of downtown of Lancaster where we had dinner. That and the drive up on Angeles Crest Highway saved the day.",TooMuch2Do
40,Almost the end of the bloom,"It's not close to anything or anywhere, so make sure you check the latest updates on the bloom. It was nearly gone on April 13. There was one slope still covered, and it made the journey worthwhile. The rest of the reserve was turning brown. My best advice-check the website for the latest bloom report, dress for windy weather, go early in the day during the week, and avoid visiting on the weekends...unless you have no choice. If you must go on a weekend, go very early to avoid long parking lines.",CMM_1963

30,Understated,"It was a beautiful sunny afternoon and staff at the info desk told us that the flowers were in full bloom. The drive up back roads was delightful and the poppy field we viewed before the park were more impressive than those in the reserve.

There was a very long line to get in even on a Tuesday so we parked on the road and walked into the Reserve. This gets you past the $10 cost. There were lots of Poppies even along the roads around the reserve. A great day.,Arnieonthego

The vibrant swaths of orange, yellow, and purple were magnificent. Yes, there will be crowds. Yes, the parking fee is $10 to an org that needs it. But it's all worth it when you see nothing but rolling hills of beauty. Bring lots of water and a hat/umbrella for shade so you can enjoy the show at its fullest.",jperoni
40,Amazing to see the poppies in the sunshine and wind,"2017 is a super bloom year, and so the poppy reserve is getting many more visitors than normal. To be honest, I didn't even know about it or poppy season (March - May), and I've lived in LA cumulatively for about 12 years. Before and after that, I was in nor cal, so the drive down I-5 is a regular thing in my life. I never before took the slight detour to the I-138, but it's so worth it!The reserve is about 30 minutes off the I-5 main highway, in Lancaster. It's worth the day trip from LA or the detour on a LA-bay area road trip for sure. This year, there was a long line of cars to get in and park. Parking is $10 ($5 if you are disabled and $1 off for a senior in the car). Bathroom lines were equally long at the porta potties in the parking lot and in the visitor center. I think in non super bloom years, it's much more manageable. You can also park along the main road (Lancaster Road) leading into the reserve and walk in to save your parking fee.Once in the reserve, there's two main trails up through the hills. There are signs to stay on the trails to not trample the flowers and to allow them to grow up the next season. Many people don't listen, unfortunately. There are some rangers who walk by to check, but not enough to monitor everyone. The trails lead up to look out spots and to other trailheads that wind all around the massive reserve. Make sure to wear tennis shoes or hiking sandals -- the trails are dirt and can be a little overgrown. Also, make sure to bring a hat, water, sunscreen, sunglasses -- there's no shade!That said, the poppy is such a beautiful, unique flower. The flowers open and close daily, so catch them at the right time. Definitely worth a trip at least once!",lilicedt
50,Nature at its best,"Couldn't reach the park to find out what to expect or when the best time to go. We could only go Saturday which on hindsight not a good decision . The road in is two lanes and we never made it to the park itself. People were parking along side the road and walking it. It seemed a long way to walk and not recommended for small children (unless carried) or mobility issues. We finally gave up and went to a stretch on the side of the road that had poppies, not as much as the park but still beautiful to see. Worth the effort. One of Mother Nature' gifts to us.",LYNDA T
50,Glorious,"The Antelope Valley Reserve and interpretative center were nice. We arrived about an hour before the 10 am center opening. Parking costs $10 and the lot is fairly small. The center itself is also rather small. We suggest reading the free literature to learn more about the poppies and the woman the center is named after. Restrooms are few so they had put some portable potties by the parking area. The reserve has about 7 miles of nice hiking trails.We recommend driving to Avenue D outside the Reserve. Some locals told us about this, and it was along that road we saw the very best poppy displays. Dirt roads accessible to the many power poles make for great driving closer to the flowers. Do NOT walk through the fields.You want to protect the flowers. Also, Mojave green rattlesnakes live there. We saw some on the roadside. The snakes, which are the same color as the grass, are highly venomous.",CLC48

We took the lower trails to the right of the parking lot by chance and saw the fields of blooms.The blooms open further in the sun, so be patient. Watch out for snakes and stay on the trails. It got very windy be 10:00 am and there was a line of cars to get in the park.Don't miss the loop trails on the back side. They aren't as busy and the views are amazing 🌼",socforward
50,Blankets of orange poppies,"We had been warned by previous reviewers not to go to Antelope Valley on the week-end so we went on Tuesday and it was fine. There were many people but it was not terrible. We started to get in line for parking at the Reserve and there were about 20 cars ahead of us . We knew that we were not going to spend a lot of time hiking the trails so we got out of the parking queue and backtracked to where we had seen people walking among the poppies, just before the Reserve. We parked on the road, enjoyed the poppies and had a wonderful afternoon.",jauchzet
50,Some tips if you are visiting in the near future,"Some suggestions based on my visit on Wednesday, April 5. The park is open dawn to dusk; it is the interpretive center that opens at 10. The warmer/sunnier it gets, the more the poppies open, so get there early to park and watch the show as the sun gets higher in the sky.Driving in from Lancaster to the east on Lancaster Road, there are several places to turn in and get out of the car and walk among poppies near the side of the road. If you want to take close-up pictures of yourself standing in poppy fields, this is the place to do it as within the park you stick to the trails to avoid trampling the wildflowers.And getting bitten by Mojave Green Rattlesnakes. We were fortunate enough to see two within two feet of the walkway, warming up in the sun. One very close to the interpretive center, one to the far east on the South Loop.At 9:30 when we arrived there was no line and plenty of parking. We had two cars full of travel gear and felt happy to pay $10 to have it within sight of the park service agent taking the parking fee.We noticed most people heading to the eastern trail following the 10-day-old information on the park website dated March 26. We went to the interpretive center staffed by very helpful volunteers (selling some nice gifts) who suggested heading to the east over the lookout point and back on the South Loop. About 1.5 miles total and a very leisurely easy-to-moderate walk on mostly dirt. One person had a stroller and did not look too happy about it.By 11:30 when we left the line coming in to park looked to be backed up perhaps 20 minutes. We went north on 110th and saw a few more areas to turn out for pictures, but nothing quite like the Reserve. The reserve is not a Wizard-of-Oz poppy field experience, or the commercial density of La Conner or Keukenhof, but the wild fields of poppies and other lovely wildflowers will make you smile every time you look at a poppy ever again and I am very glad we did it.",KB1070
40,Too many people but lots of poppies,"Lots of waiting to pay at entrance, because of many visitors. Kind of a a drag but what can you do? Lots of trails to get away from people and see the poppies. Well maintained trails and benches as well. There is a store to buy mementos and an interpretive center too. A one time visit for us. Too many people.",travelagentreplies
40,Yes its a pretty sight,If you love and enjoy flowers blooming brightly its worth the drive. Expect crowds even mid week. Weekends could be worse..bring your patience.

50,An Experience to Make You Smile,"I left LA about 7 from Topanga and avoided the traffic (it was all going the other way) and stopped in Lancaster for breakfast. As I approached the Reserve I saw the apricot stain on the mountainside from as far away as 9 miles. That's when I began to smile. I arrived at the Reserve at 10 on a Wednesday. There were 3 cars ahead of me. When I left at noon there were about 60. I had read on their web site there was an 11am docent tour and I wanted to take it. It was well worth the wait. The docent pointed out all the wild flowers (lupine, fiddler neck, goldenfield were some I remember and, of course waves of poppies! She took us on a path straight up, chatting all the while. She explained that the poppies were spent on the east side and opening on the west.The views from that height were spectacular in orange and gold It was a beautiful, Memorable experience. So glad I took the time!",Joy S
40,Wonderful poppies but facilities leave a lot to be desired,"Every year, for approximately six weeks or so in March and April, the poppies in California bloom. So people head in droves to this poppy reserve. And on weekends, there are huge crowds and heavy traffic. So on a Saturday or Sunday, probably best to get here is early as possible. And there are only a few bathrooms. So the lines can get very long. In fact when we were there, many women were using the men's bathroom. Also, there is really no need to drive into the reserve itself and pay $10. Even on crowded days, you can Invariably find parking on the road near the entrance gate. There is a small visitor center but it is not up to very much. And there are beautiful poppies outside the Reserve. Be sure to check them out. Oh, and it gets hot and there is not a great deal of shade. So bring plenty of water.",vincemc

10,Expect disappointment,"Expect to see carpets of wildflowers? Not this year. What you'll be seeing insteads are crowds and dust. Parking is a nightmare, especially during the weekends. Many park outside along the two-lane countryroad. And that creates a messy congestion. Long line for bathroom and strong gusty wind are also what you'll be expecting. So, now if you enjoy the crowd and strong wind blowing at your face, then this is the right place. If not, there are many other spots along the road that you could enjoy without massive traffic and gusty wind that is notorious in the hills of the Reserve.",Julia M

We left west Los Angeles at 8:30 AM and got up there at around 10:00 AM, but we were still caught in close to 45-50 minutes of traffic on Lancaster Rd, everyone waiting to get in. That aside, an amazing day walking amongst the poppies. Right now, you may feel that there are better poppy fields just outside the park, as you are approaching the park entrance. People parked on the side of the road and saw wonderful fields that were thick with color, without the parking hassle and easy access to the fields themselves. Colors include the poppy gold, fiddlehead yellows and lupin purples. Make sure you bring a camera with plenty of space on the flash drive. Best news yet - this could go on for weeks to come.

40,Poppy fields for ever,"Went to Poppy reserve in Lancaster last weekend. Beautiful!!Monet or Van Gough should have visited there.This is a high desert field that I wanted to see. I guess the lower desert fields (Anza Borrego, Diamond Valley, Lake Elsinore,…) are just as good. That will be my next trip.Took the 14 hwy and got off on Ave “I” heading west. Catching Lancaster Rd. I was worried that I won’t see much, joking to my date that I have address of a local flower shop just in case. I actually felt that way until I got closer to the distant orange patches on a hill.Got closer, scenes got better and better.Road got packed, no place to park and we were not even at the entrance yet.Found a spot off the road on the side, on the dirt and got out.Climbed the hill into orange fields (on the trail of course) and commuted with poppies and fellow revelers. Yes, it was crowded, their joy did rub off on me and I totally enjoyed it.Only way to see the poppies in on a hill, I convinced myself right there, where no desert bushes can block them from my view. And on that hill I could see the traffic jam up ahead on the road toward Reserve entrance. Moving at snails pace!The hill I was standing on was thick with poppies and as far as I can tell, just as good as the Reserve (speculating from distance). So I decided to enjoy the flowers here and skip the mal feeling of traffic ahead.I had my fill and headed back. East on Lancaster Road. At 130TH ST I turned north to catch hwy 138. Half way up, noticed that poppied are everywhere and lavenders and mustards. A cacophony of colors. Orange, purple, and yellow. Turned onto dirt road (smooth…) with my Prius with low clearance. Nobody around, only dust clouds are from my car. Flower field goes on for as far as I can see. All for me and only me.Nothing like seeing poppies on a plain that goes for ever and ever. This is only way for me to enjoy this (..well presently..). Only way to top this is with some wine, cheese & cold cuts and slides of fruits. Popped the trunk and got them (And beer and corn chips for me, other things are for the date.).So, Just go. Don’t worry about Picasso like scenery before you get there and don’t worry about the wind that can blow you toupee away. Did to my, but I was happy and did not care.Enjoy.",TJungleL
40,"Beautiful, but expect crowds","I'm glad I drove out there, but half of LA also visited the same day. I never actually made it into the preserve, as the traffic was horrific. Fortunately everyone seemed to be pretty laid back and I was able to turn around and get out of the crowd. We stopped along the roadside (there's plenty of roadside parking) and climbed the hill. There were plenty of poppies there, and I could see the golden fields of the preserve.",foxtail1
50,State Flower in its glory,"Amazing blooms were on display on March 31st 2017. This was our first visit so I cannot compare from previous year but we were so glad to make this trip.Orange poppy and other wildflowers are on display not only within the reserve boundary but also along the Lancaster Road ( Highway 138). There were several fields along the highway and connecting dirt roads and inside the reserve the south antelope trail had the best display at this timeWe hiked along several trails and saw poppy displays, other wildflowers and great views of the antelope valley. Trails are mostly flat with some sections of uphill/downhill path, few place bit steep.",Tulika
50,Beauty,Absolutely gorgeous! Stunning views! Pets aren't allowed but there are so many poppy fields outside of the actual park that you and your furry companion can play in! Go to Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve!,BristolPistol423
50,Good bloom this year,Miles of poppies! Gorgeous and something you won't find elsewhere. We were there on a weekday and there was a line of cars waiting to get in at 10 a.m.,sndovale
50,A fantastic display of nature,"We arrived early morning - 9:00am on a Tuesday so parking was easily available. The poppies were just opening up but all opened as the sun warmed up. There are multiple trails to take so allow at least 2 hours minimum. Some trails have a steep incline/decline but are still manageable. The views from the upper points were spectacular with the orange poppies mixed with yellows, blues, and purples in some areas. Some areas were a carpet of poppies, others were less densely filled. It was a beautiful display of nature no matter where you looked. The website said this year was a mid-level bloom which is a good description. The east side of the preserve was the heaviest blooming area. You can only imagine what a high-level bloom would look like! Stay on the trails so you don't destroy the plants. There are lots of opportunities to take pictures. The trails are quite wide so it is easy to get around people. When we left at 11:30 there was a line of cars out to the road and lots of people on the lower trails so early arrival was best even on a Tuesday!",Winnie S
40,Spring 2017 - not to be missed!,"The poppy fields are gorgeous, but some advice if you're going there at peak season (late March / early April) on a Saturday or Sunday: (1) unless you arrive before the park opens, forget about getting into the parking lot; you'll have to park out on Lancaster Road and walk about 1/2 mile or more to get to the entrance; (2) try to stop somewhere to use a restroom on the way to the park. The lines for the very few bathrooms (including the 3 porta-potties) are about a half-hour wait! and (3) there's no food available at the park, so bring your own food or snacks if you think you could get hungry. Trails are short (the longest is a 3 mile loop) and easy, but I recommend wearing shoes which have some traction / tread (downhill trails can be slippery). And please folks, NO DOGS are allowed on the trails, and don't put a phony ""service dog"" vest on your dog and try to pass it off as a service dog, as many park visitors were doing.",SusanGinLA
50,Well worth the drive!,"We drove 3 hours from Orange County, hiked for 2 hours, drove 3 hours back home and it was worth the effort!. The day was warm and sunny with only a slight breeze so the poppies were wide open and glorious. There were a lot of other wildflowers as well which created great combinations of color. Hiking to one of the vista points is a must! We were there March 29 and it must be close to peak bloomWe followed the website directions to take Highway 138 from I-5 but returned home via SR 14 which was much more scenic. The return was only 5 miles shorter.",Lonnie H
50,the lovely poppies are out.,"Poppies are blooming at AV this year. Come out and see the Golden state flower. The poppy reserve hills are surrounded with these orange colored flowers. So pretty, picture perfect. Bring your jackets/sweaters it's so windy at AV most of the time. The flowers closes when it's too windy. So check the unpredictable weather. Lots of trail for good long walks but for a person with walking difficulty, several spots for picture taking along the way, and other desert flowers are also blooming. Parking is mostly along side the road.",EdnetDime
50,Wide open spaces always apprecieted,"This was hands down the best solo adventure I have ever taken. I can not even tell you how refreshed I felt after this visit. The poppy fields were spectacular. Truly a rewarding experience. The trails were clear cut and allowed multiple routes. **TIPS: go early, park opens at sunrise. Bathrooms available but trust me- bring hand sanitizer. Bring plenty of water. If you arrive early don't be disappointed because poppies are not 'open' - once warms up poppies open fully i promise. So for me, around 9am. Dress in layers, its the desert! 7am-40F turned to 60F 2 hours later.",Vanessa T
30,"Badly overcrowded, permanent high cold winds","1) As I noticed after 3 days at Lancaster, there are permanent cold winds there, interfering with any outdoor activity. Hint: windmills are there for a reason.2) The reserve is a nice place to visit: parking lot, restroom, walking paths. NO picnic or any shaded area, though. But crowds are so bad, that it can take hours just to get into the parking lot in the midday ON MONDAY! Many cars turn around.Advice: drive on R-138 around Lancaster. Do what most people do: jump out of the car, take pictures, get into the car. Take 3-4 stops and go home. Weather is not predisposing to walking anyway: 50F in midday, cold wind and scorching sun.",Cattty
40,Amazing Day at the Poppy Reserve,"It was an amazing day! We had never been before, but always wanted to go. The views and the flowers were so pretty. The pics don't do it justice.We went on a Monday, arrived around 11:30am and the line was long, but there was plenty of parking. We left around 2pm and people were still coming into the Reserve.It was extremely windy, but we warm enough in our sweatshirts. We wore sneakers. Some parts of the trail are steep, but we did fine. I would not recommend sandals. We did see a rattlesnake on the edge of the trail, so keep an eye out.There are restrooms, picnic tables and a small visitor center. It's $10 to park, but well worth it.",Christieann R
50,A Bucket List Item!,"This has been on my bucket list for some time and I finally made it. It is every bit as spectacular as you have heard about. The riot of colors is amazing, dominated, of course, by orange everywhere. There are lots of great trails to hike around on, which is good because there are sooooo many people there during the poppy blooms which are generally mid-March to mid-April.Couple of tips: Follow the official suggestions on the Preserve’s website: Try to avoid weekends, get there EARLY because by 10 a.m. on a weekend day at the peak season there will be a long line of cars waiting to get in. Took me half an hour in line in my car to get in the parking lot. Also, avoid windy days. The wind typically comes up about 1 p.m. on any given day, but if the weather report says high winds, don’t go, or at least don’t take little kids. They don’t like it! They cry and you have to carry them.If you are a photographer, you will be in heaven. Regarding the wind: not good for camera shake, and not good for still captures of your flowery subjects, hence another reason to avoid windy days.All in all, amazing, even with the crowds!",Sue H
30,The State of Ca is not Prepared for Visitors this Year.,"We went on a Saturday, which wasn't a good choice, but it was the only day that worked. We were in by 9:30 and the line was already forming at the entrance kiosk. Not bad, I've seen worse.We got our gear and started our trek. It was a pretty good bloom, a sea of orange and yellow in several directions, with numerous photo ops. By 12-1, the crowds were getting thick and were making it difficult to traverse the trails in some areas. We went on the loop to/fro Antelope Butte Vista Point and headed back to the truck for a quick snack bite.It's a Catch-22, you NEED to hydrate, even on a mild day, BUT the restrooms are not pumped (it's a ""super bloom"" year, be prepared, CA!) in a timely fashion, so half the restrooms are closed because they are full and lines for the others are a good 100'+ long. UGH. So, it was at this time that we decided not to jump on the other loops and get outta there, lest we'd have to stand in a 30-minute line for the restroom 1-2 times before ending our day. Pretty frustrating.We did see great coverage and vibrant colors, but I'm fortunate we didn't drive *too* far for this experience.",CheekyMonkey12
30,"Pretty, but have seen better years","I went on a Friday very close to peak bloom. The poppies were lovely yet not clumped together as much as I have seen in the past. By 10:30 a.m. there were 50 cars waiting inline to pay the $10 cash entry fee. Only one attendant. Many cars lined Lancaster Rd and the people were able to walk up the hill to enter. Because I am a photographer, I like to go when there is the least amount of wind as the poppies shake in a breeze. They even close up when it is cloudy and with strong wind, The hiking trails are wide, clear and well maintained. While I have read poor reviews of the porta-potties, the one I used was for handicapped people and it was exceptionally clean, Although I didn't visit the Visitors' Center this year, I have enjoyed it in the past. In addition to information, it had books t-shirts and other items for purchase. Close to the east side of the poppy preserve, there are several nice poppy displays on the hillside banks of the road. They also can be found on Munz /Ranch Rd.",Susan M
40,Very pretty,"A small collection of trails through an endless sea of orange! There were some places where the poppies were so thick in the distance it looked like a neon orange carpet. Really nice way to spend an hour or two walking around.When I went it was unbelievably cold and windy, check the weather and also check the park's website for wind and weather reports and dress accordingly.It's important to stay on the paths for obvious reasons, you don't want to crush the wildflowers but there are a few places where you can step off path to get those photo ops! You'll notice the places where countless others have gone off path and there are no flowers.The parking lot cost $10 and there are nice bathrooms and running water. When I was there (late March 2017) the poppies were not blooming near the parking lot and we had to walk quite a way to get to anything worth seeing. I would imagine that different areas bloom at different times though so other travelers might have a different experience.All and all it was very pretty and nice. This is not a must see destination but it's worth giving it a peek.",Sara L

40,Beautiful hike,"Please know that you are hiking on desert trails. Wear appropriate shoes, sunscreen, bring water. Aside from that, it's beautiful. We saw layers of flowers and hiked up and down sand and gravel roads. Parking on site was $10 or $9/senior. I recommend it, but many waked the extra mile to avoid the fee. Porta potties are in site, but not very nice.",lindaeddie

40,Nature at its best,"Visited Mar 12, and there was small patches of flowers in bloom along the eastern loop. Rangers anticipate a later bloom than normal due to the late rain we got this last winter. Blooms will most likely reach their peak in 3 weeks.Watch out for rattle snakes. They are out - ran across a baby rattler on the trail so keep your eyes out and listen, they will most likely alert you if you are paying attention.Looking forward to going back in a few weeks to see the change.",Wendya01

30,Poppies,This is a seasonal weather dependent attraction. when there is enough rainfall the poppies are abundant. unfortunately rain is not always the case in the desert. This year was no exception. we went out before the festival and we were disappointed that there was not as many poppies as there were two years ago. This place is a good photo opportunity when there are flowers.,johnjerim
10,Hardly any poppies.,"My husband and I went in April (2016) and there was hardly any poppies to be seen. One of the other guests said it was just a really bad year for poppies. And about the wind, it is really bad. So take a jacket.",JaniceSeagraves
40,Beautiful location!,"Went to this location on a senior bus tour. It was a beautiful location, but sadly due to weather conditions, there were hardly any poppies visible. I can honestly say, that there were more poppies along the sides of the road heading into the Reserve, then where actually inside the Reserve. As an FYI, the California Poppy is a federally protected flower, and it is illegal to pick them from the Reserve. However, you can purchase a packet of seeds to grow your own.However, if you take the time to truly look, you will find wildflowers everywhere. It is a very peaceful place to visit. If you have hiking boots, I would suggest wearing them. If not a good pair of walking shoes would work too.I had my hiking stick with me, and it made it so much easier to hike some of the trails there. Take your time to take in the beauty of the Reserve. Some complained that there was nothing to see, and went back to the bus. For us adventurers, we hiked and found beauty! For me, I loved all the wildflowers, some so small, if I was not looking, I would not have seen them. But the beauty of nature was all around us. One lady even came across a snake (I'm glad it was her and not me, don't like snakes).Stop at the Jane S. Pinheiro Interpretive Center (Guest center / gift shop). You can see pictures of the Reserve at times when it was in full bloom, or see some of the wildlife that roams the Reserve (the wildlife was not killed, but they were road kill and saved and stuffed), or maybe buy something nice for yourself. The docents that work in the center are very knowledgeable and can help you with any questions you may have.I would suggest visiting the Reserve early in the year such as the beginning of March through the first part of May, or late in the year such as mid-October through December. Any other time of the year may be too hot.Again, should you choose to go, please call ahead to check on the temperature, and if you want to see the poppy fields, you may call to find out if they are blooming.",charlottesl

50,A must see for those who love nature,"Go to this during the peak season for maximum enjoyment. The peak season is between March and May depending upon rainfall, etc. If you go to the parks department website, you can see when the poppies will be at their peak. Bring your cameras, sunscreen and a picnic lunch for maximum enjoyment. It is a long drive from the main highway to the reserve, but it is certainly worth it!",EllieRKay
40,"No Poppies, drought. But a good tip from worker.",I understand the droughts that are unpredictable. There was one little poppy by the building on the hill. You have to pay 10 dollars to park to walk about 1/3 mile to see poppies and wildflowers. But there were none this time. Also the gift shop and informational display building is on top of a hill that is a short walk.The 10.00 charge became worth it when we talked to one of the gift shop workers and she told us there were poppies along the road going west of the poppy park. We drove it for about 25 miles and saw lots of poppies and other beautiful purple flowers along the roadside and in some pastures.I gave this a 4 rating because I am sure it is beautiful and worth it when they are blooming but is a lot of walking for someone like me who has a hard time with it must less up hills.,jb34756
50,Not many Poppies,"I went last weekend, March 19, 2016. There weren't many poppies but it was still a nice place to hike around. There were other desert flowers and we even saw a gopher snake!

40,Nicely maintained,"I visited this past fall/winter but unfortunately due to the drought there were literally about 5 poppies in the entire area! However, the landscape is beautiful, flowers or not, and it's very well maintained. Wear good walking shoes (I don't recommend sandals) and bring lots of water and a hat when it's warm as there is no shade. I will always pay for the park area because I know keeping preserves like this is expensive and I want to do my part to contribute to keeping these amazing parcels of land for future generations.

Carry LOTS of water, no shade in the trail. I think the poppies close up in the evening, so it might not work if you wait for the sun to go down. There are a few sweet smelling flowers like the grape soda lupine and birds like horned lark and lizards and caterpillars etc. along the trail which makes it a nice experience for kids.",Abhi

The whole road leading to the reserve had cars pulled to the roadside and people were snapping pictures of the lovely vistas and blooms. It was beautiful and we pushed to the official ""site"" assuming it would afford something that the regular road couldn't.Well, it did, but that was merely a flushing bathroom.Don't get me wrong, the visitor center was lovely, and the bathroom was necessary - but if you just want to hike and see flowers you're paying $10 to do that on the back side of the same road.The drive, the vistas and the flowers you'll see are all lovely - but you can achieve them merely by tracing Lancaster Road the span of the reserve.",Leigth M

30,Not much poppy flowers in the reserve March 2015,"Although some parts of Antelope valley had huge patches of California poppies blooming profusely, the poppy reserve itself this year didn't have much poppy at all. We were there on March 12, the volunteer working int the reserve told us what we saw was probably the best the park gets this year, which was disappointing. However, there were lots of lacy phacelia blooming along the trail on the top of the hills, the flowers had very strong sweet fragrance, which made the hike to the top delightful. There were some gold fields in the reserve too, however, even the gold fields were not as impressive as the ones carpeting the valley floor just few minutes outside of the park.The open panoramic view of the surround hills and valley floor from top of the hills along the trail was still very beautiful and impressive even without much poppies this year.The park has a shaded picnic area close to parking lot, but visitors will need to bring food and water. The public restroom by the parking lot is reasonably clean, and water for washing hands has to be pumped via a foot paddle located underneath the sink.",pochaco

There are rattle snakes in this area. It is not far from the town so, if you don't want to bring lunch and picnic, it a short drive (I think 20-30min) to fast food and restaurants.",Graceracer
50,AV Poppy Reserve,This is a great place to take a hike and stretch your legs. The paths are well kept and are easy to walk on. They even have a path for handicap persons. They also have picnic tables and benches along the pathways. Some of the views are breath taking when the poppies are in full bloom. A camera is a must since there are so many photography opportunities to be had!,Diane L
40,"If there is rain, then there are poppies...","Poppy season is in the spring...And you will have a show of not only poppies but Lupin and other lovely desert beauties.The Lancaster Poppy Reserve is a great place to go you get a good view from the higher elevationand the info is very educational. Best to go on a weekday not so crowded and once you leave the reserve it's nice to dive along the 138 or also known as Ave. D.The thing you have to remember if it's warm there are snakes so, you have to pay attention where your stepping and if it's windy they won't open.It is wonderful experience so, pack a lunch and bring a camera or iPad what ever you use for photos and snap away. Don't forget sunglasses the orange color is intense.",Mitch L
30,Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve,"High desert vegetation with colorful poppies makes for a nice walk along trails for 1-3 hours. Reserve also has a small museum and gift shop as well as snacks and bathroom. If you just want to take a selfie with poppies, we can stop at many places on the road to the reserve to do that without having to pay the admission charge to the reserve.",Sidney G
50,Beautiful vistas,"We have visited the poppy fields in this area many times over the past 2 decades. Most recent visit was not so spectacular, because of the drought, but every one should take the chance in spring to see this natural wonder.",KALAMARIVERRAT
40,Poppies in the Spring,"When there has been a good rainy season, the Poppy Reserve is the BEST place to see them. I've lived near the Reserve for 11 years and Im always amazed at how beautiful the flowers are. If it not a windy day the best time is from 10am to 3pm.",hsosner
50,Poppy Reserve in Lancaster,"The poppy reserve is the home to ""The wizard of Oz"" which shot the famous sleeping poppy fields here. A must in April/May each year, the poppies are the CA state flower and only come out in spring. Photographers from nearby states, scramble every year to take the best photos of the rare poppy, and some years of drought make them even more scarce. I suggest going West on Avenue I (off the 14 freeway) until you reach 100th street west or so.... pull over just about anywhere in the region for photos in the vivid colors of spring. Visit the official Poppy Reserve park, and see trails and sitting areas in the huge park. I love to take my kids every year, put them in the center of a good patch, and shoot annual poppy pics! You will not see orange and pink colors like this in any other field! One hour north of Los Angeles, it's worth a drive.",Tonia_Crews
50,Beautiful experience!,"You should at least see the poppies in bloom once in your lifetime, if you can. It's a gift from the environment - but only in the spring especially after a wet winter.",Eancheta
50,Desert Flora Depends on Rain,"California is in the midst of a severe draught. When we have rain in Feb/Mar, we have poppies in April/May. Last really beautiful year was 2010. Since then, the poppies have been sparce. You can see more poppies and giant lupines on the roadsides or private fields than at the poppy reserve. That said, the volunteers at the poppy reserve are knowledegable. The gift shop has unique, poppy-themed items. If it rains this year, come on out!",Karen C
30,beautiful!,"Come at around mid April, they are so beautiful. For the last 3 years they are not much of the flowers due to the changes of weather, as shown in the picture. But If you are in a right timing.. they are so amazing . between 8am to 9am they bloom so beautiful.",bethfeli
50,Beauty within the Beast!,"First time traveler's to the harsh and hot environment of the Antellope Valley would be had pressed to find an Oaisis in the middle of the desert. Look no further than beyond the California Poppy Reserve. Miles if picturesque floral beauty contained within the untamed beast of the desert. Each time that I visit this serene site, I am immediately transported to a place of peace, tranquility and serenity. I personally use the term ""nuetrality"" to describe the devinely inspired beauty. A place where one can exit the busy freway of life and take a moment to ponder, not moving forward, backward, or in any direction, just enjoying the moment of ""nuetrality"". Allowing for reflection, prayer and mediation, while absorbing the beauty of God's creation. So come one and come all in order to experience the Beauty within the Beast!",RAYMOND B
40,The Time is Right,poppies are the state flower and they are beautiful to witness if you see them here in full bloom. The trick is you need to have good timing. Not much else to see up here but it is worth the trip. April 2011.,ocjohnyb
50,Absolutely Beautiful,"This is a great place to spend the afternoon. They have several different paths of different lengths. If you stop in the gift shop, the folks are very friendly and helpful. They will even point out where you should go to see other flowers or really good blooms. The whole experience was delightful.Take the time ... wonder the trails ...",Nicole S
50,One word: Beautiful,"Due to the long drought we have had the past few years, we didn't expect to see a lot of flowers. However, we were quite lucky. The flowers were blooming quite plentifully this year. The big rain in late February and some more in March helped to prolong the bloom. The weather was very nice in spring although it was very windy and thus was hard on little babies (My daughter kept her face down on daddy's back the whole time). The trails were easy even though you would have to hike up and down hills all the time no matter which trail you took (There were many girls walking on high heels - that's how easy the trails were). We had wonderful time enjoying the flowers and beautiful surrounding scenery.One thing to keep in mind was that the best time to visit the flowers was between late noon to early afternoon (probably between 11:00 am to 3:00 pm). If you come too early, the flowers haven't opened the petals. If you come too late, the petals already close.BONUS: Red Rock State Park is only 1 hour north of Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve and Fossil Falls is another 30 minute north of Red Rock State Park. A little further to the north east is Death Valley National Park. A little further to the north west is Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park. The area is packed with State Parks and National Parks for parkaholic like us.",IheartZephyr

50,Poppies Galore,So many poppies are here this year that it looks like an orange carpet. Some of the areas adjacent to the Reserve are better then the Reserve but it is all beautiful for viewing. Many different flowers alongside the poppies make for beautiful pictures.,Richard S
50,No Words Needed,"No words needed, just look at the pictures. We traveled on April 14, 2014. The day was warm and windy. The best view we found was near Elizabeth Lake. I thought it would be awesome for some wedding fashion photo shooting. We picked the right time, just before the festival. Have fun!",Tatiana G
40,Visit during mid Spring,"When we've had recent spring rain, the Poppy Reserve is literally so full of flowers you cannot find space for anything else. This is a large wide open area where you can walk some simple trails and see the beautiful wild flowers. During dry seasons, this isn't that interesting of a place but if you enjoy nature and being away from the noise...it's awesome. Bring water, wear comfortable shoes and keep an eye out for the wildlife. This is their home.",Tvincentdavidson
50,Beautiful,When in bloom this place is beautiful with color. Great place to bring the family for pictures or even a picnic.,Mrsboggs

50,Poppy Fields,"The first time I visited the Poppy Fields I thought to myself that this place is beautiful, my kids love the place and said that its beautiful also. Its a great place for hiking and just to get away from the house to be outdoors, long story short, I love this place.",Michael T
50,Awesome if you get there at the right time!,First time I saw this poppy field I was so lucky t all the poppy flowers bloomed and that was June 2006. I keep returning every year almost the same month and year but it was disappointing. If you live very far please check the weather and try to call first and ask. The poppy flower don't open up when it's too cold too Windy or too hot. And when they are not open it's not an amazing sight. And you will be lucky if the shepherds are herding the sheeps on the hillside. It's the cutest thing I've ever seen! Again call first before you travel for miles.... Angie,Michiko T
40,Beautiful,"This is a beautiful place for a hike when the poppies are in bloom. It looks like a blanket of orange. Sometimes there are other wild flowers in bloom which creates an amazing display of color. Watch out for Mojave green snakes though, they are out the same time as the poppies.",Jennifer R
50,A great family outing,Be sure to check out when the Lancaster Poppy Festival is. After you leave the park go to the Poppy Reserve and drink in with your eyes one of the most beautiful sites to see. The heaver the rain in the winter the more lovely the Poppies' are in the spring.,A_V_Wedding_Lady
30,Changes every year,It can be awe inspiringly beautiful or dull brown. It depends on the winter weather I think. Some years the local mountains are covered in a beautiful blanket of orange. Other years you're lucky if you can see a few blooms in a field. Some years there are more flowers in town than at the reserve.,Khattykathy
40,I wouldn't miss it! Good family fun!!,"The poppy fields are so pretty. Then there is a festival at the parks with vendors, Which means food and shopping and poppy planters everywhere. I will be happy to see them next season",fancithatt
20,If you like fields of orange flowers??,The title says it all. there's not much else to see at the Poppy Reserve. Just rolling hills with what looks like a orange carpet. It's a morning trip and usuallly not too hot at that time of year.,SgtMikes
50,Great to see - but you have to come at the right time,I was there in the spring of 2011. Almost no blossoms ! Just make sure you check out the state park web site before you come.,VoyageurUSA11
50,A Sea of Orange,"I always love coming out to the AV Poppy Reserve. Whenever I am here I think of being with my mom and brother when we used to sell ""I Gave to Save"" poppy posters and decals in order to raise money for the then proposed Poppy Park. Saving the poppies in an area for all to enjoy certainly has come a long way...Way to go Antelope Valley!",Joni S
50,California Poppies,"This is a must see, in the spring of the year however the for those that can't make it during the spring of the year. However the poppy reserve has a nice trail and visitor center that is worth seeing.",inspectrdad
50,"disappointing poppy festival, due to years of drought","Due to the prolonged drought the poppy festival is just now what it used to be. fewer and fewer flowers, and a lot less visitors.",anthony c
20,No Flowers,Well because of the lack of rain in southern California. there are no flowers to be seen. But they still want to charge you to go on the reserve. I guess if there were more information we would have not made the drive.,JohnEllis3
30,Lack of rain kills poppy season,"We drove quite a ways to see the poppies yesterday, only to find dry dirt with blooming Joshua trees.Unfortunately, there was nothing to see there. We took a short hike in the desert and on my return to the car, found that I was covered with small gnats. Can't imagine how I got them!!!They are still advertising a poppy festival for April 21-22.Fair warning. There are no poppies this year. Not enough rain.:)!",MaryA32248
40,Poppies?,"This is an interesting preserve. I went several years ago when I first moved to Antelope Valley, but assumed that the Preserve would be in bloom at the time of the Lancaster Poppy Festival. Wrong! A lot depends on the amount of rain received throughout the winter. At the time of my visit, there were more poppies blooming in the field across the street from the preserve than were blooming in the preserve!",Connie S
50,Beautiful Spring flowers as far as the eye can see,"You can drive into this area and all of a sudden find yourself surrounded by so many wild poppies, it is hard to beleive!",GloriaD121
50,An amazing natural spectacle,The Poppy Preserve is only a small part of the natural beauty on display in the Antelope Valley. Quail Lake Road (138 I think) from the 5 fwy on into Lancaster and the 14 fwy takes you through the heart of this amazing spectacle. There are many side roads and plenty of places to get out and stretch your legs...plenty of parking...and it's free! You'll see so many more flowers than the poppies (which are everywhere) and all kinds of colors. If you look at the ground you'll find a gazillion tiny flowers with incredible colors. It's a great day out.Now...sorry for those of you who didn't catch the 'perfect' day...this is a natural occurrence not Dismal Land...so if we didn't get a lot of moisture (like this year) it's not going to be as wonderful as it can be in a wet year. Sometimes the poppies start germinating and there's a snow...no flowers. Hang in there...it's a great day trip...and if you catch one of the 'big' years it'll be a memory you'll treasure forever. We have had several!,Jack C
50,The hills are on fire....,"This is an article I wrote for Yahoo... thought it was a perfect review...A splash of orange is on its way, The Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve located in Lancaster, Ca is a sight that everyone should see once in their lifetime. When I moved here to Edwards AFB, CA from Louisiana I was a little home sick. Leaving the south and its beauty and driving smack into the desert left me wondering, where's all the color? Well between the months of late February thru mid May the color orange is sprawled out over the hills of Lancaster, CA. On a morning where the wind has not taken control in the Antelope Valley you can make the drive out to the reserve, hike through bright orange poppies and owl's clovers. On your way out to the reserve if you are driving down HWY 14 look towards the reserve and the hills come alive like they were on fire.Thousands pour in every year to take that hike through the reserve and take those perfect family pictures, enjoy family picnics and the children well let's just say it's a moment they soon won't forget. My family and I have been back every year since the first time and I am always waiting on that one perfect picture, but in the mean time I love enjoying the beauty that takes me back to my southern roots.",strongea
30,nice trails,"Though the hiking trails are lovely and well maintained, there were not any poppies to speak of this year, and the price to get in was mighty steep for a poppy-less Poppy Reserve ($10 per car). Hopefully next time it will be better, but I would check out how good of a year it is before paying the money to go in--just look by the side of the road and you'll know! Wish we had then!",Leigh N

50,Antelope Valley Poppy Preserve State park,"When the poppies are good, they are very good! Some years nothing, some years orange that can be seen for miles! Nice visitor center and paved trails from it, or wander anywhere in the area for great photos",Janet W
30,"Lots of flowers, boring background","In a good year, the Antelope Valley poppy fields can be spectacular - if you just look at the flowers. The overall landscape is however less than inspiring. One can enjoy equal or better floral outbursts most years in places like the Grapevine section of Interstate 5 down into the area of Arvin (CA), or in the Kern River Valley where the surrounding mountains are far more attractive.",Robert W
50,Breathtaking in a Good Year,"When there's a full bloom, the sight is absolutely stunning. You might think, ""Yeah, they're flowers; what's the big deal?"" But it can almost make you giddy to be SURROUNDED by orange blooms like this. You have to experience it for yourself to appreciate it.The best years aren't necessarily ones with the heaviest rainfall; they're the ones that have rainstorms spaced weeks apart over the winter. Always check before you drive up to visit. If you take SR14 (Antelope Valley Freeway) and drive west to the preserve, you may see other blooms along the way as well. And there are often blooming fields off 90th Street West.You can park alongside the road and don't necessarily have to pay the fee to park in the preserve. But you'll have a hike up the hill if you do, and your fees support the preserve.",Gail1Marie
50,Beautiful place!,The poppies are vibrant and great for picture taking. Make sure you go during the peak season and check to see if there has been enough water for plenty of poppies to grow. Quiet and breathtaking area.,marikesh

Very much disappointed! It's our mistake that we did not check the latest poppy news or call the visitor's center. This year, there is almost no poppy in the reserve. We were really very unhappy. Next day went to the festival ground as Lancaster but decided not to go inside, did not look like very lucrative. We then started to heading back home but stopped at California Poppy Reserve on CA-138. There was plenty of wild poppy ! The trip was not totally bad at last.",Calcutta-girl

One magnificent view after another. Park your car beside Lancaster Blvd., get out, and you'll find the rolling hills east of the Reserve covered with blue, purple, white, and yellow wildflowers in addition to the brilliant poppies, but pay the $8 fee to enter the Reserve, too. Miles of wonderful trails, easy hiking, with even easier trails for wheelchairs and the elderly.",funseeking70
40,Wonderful day trip just outside Los Angeles. Pack a picnic and go!,"The Poppy Reserve is a delightful outing if you are in the Los Angeles area. It's a little over an hours drive from L.A. but it's like going to another world. You can see the poppy covered hills from about 11 miles away. The brilliant orange is so outstanding against the hills. It is a Reserve so there is an $8. charge which includes parking, use of the restrooms, picnic areas and interpretive centre. There are maps which guide you through the various hiking trails around the reserve. Most trails are moderate although there are a few really steep ones if you are so inclined (haha). The poppies are only in bloom for a short time of the year and when the wind blows, which happens often up in that area, the flowers close up and there is no color so check the website on the morning you plan on going. Also it's the perfect place to pack a picnic and enjoy lunch in the great outdoors.",billiejoe
40,Poppies as far as the eye can see,"This year (2008) the winter rains brought us a virtual cornucopia of wildflowers. The poppies appeared to be in full bloom the last week of March. Among them we also saw carpets of goldfields, a few pygmy-leafed lupines, and a few other wildflowers to add contrast to the orange hillsides. Scattered bunches of grape-soda lupines really stood out on the Tehachapi Vista Point Trail.We took the shortest of the loop trails with a view, which was the aforementioned Tehachapi Vista Point Trail. I had to keep my 20-month old in a stroller or the hike would have been to much for her at approximately 1.4 miles. My 8-year old made the trip with no complaints. The path is paved for the first 100 yards or so, and the trail afterwards was compacted dirt and occasional sand. I wasn't the only one pushing a stroller on the trail, but I imagine it would be quite a workout for someone pushing a double stroller or wheelchair. There are benches strategically placed along the way for the weary to rest.There are two areas with restrooms. There are pit toilets at the parking lot (noticeable during the peak season by the long lines) and flush toilets up at the visitors center. There is also a picnic area near the visitors center, but it was too crowded to be of any use to us once we arrived just after noon.It can get windy at times, so it's best to bring a jacket and dress in layers. Also wear comfortable shoes and check the maps at the visitors center so you can make sure your trail of choice matches your schedule and stamina. The longest loop trail is over 3 miles. If you have the time and energy, the views at this time of year are worth the trip.",Shiroh
