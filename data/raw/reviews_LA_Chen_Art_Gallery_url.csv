The art varies in type from furniture, jewelry, pottery, sculpture and paintings. I enjoyed the collection of snuff bottles and porcelains.

40,"Beautiful collection, overlong tour","The Chen Gallery in Torrance is a hidden treasure. The collection of Chinese art shows a great deal of knowledge, taste, and understanding of Chinese history. Ancient ceramics, rare Buddhist art, as well as furniture, snuff boxes, jade, and much more. It was a pleasure to see these works in such a beautiful setting. However, I found the tour overlong at two hours, and the tour guide, at least in the beginning, hard to take. The beauty of the pieces speak for themselves. Our tour guide was very knowledgable but also had the demeanor of a cheerleader. She was less so as the tour progressed, and I came to appreciate her extensive background. Also, the tour is free. Well worth a trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_ivypruett

Lots ..... but probably both the jade and the snuff bottles edge it (although my wife thought the ceramics were great too!)You do need to book ahead; no children allowed, but it is FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobandJosie
50,Hidden treasure!,"A friend arranged a private tour of the Chen Art Gallery and it was wonderful! When we went, there was a Picasso exhibit which was so interesting.

You have to go through a lot of security but it's worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janad63
50,What a Gem!,"Toured the Chen Art Gallery with a group from my club. So spectacular! Incredible art to be found in a private collection and locally...The tour lasted almost 2 hours and there is no place to sit so you need to be fairly hardy..They do allow canes, folding cane/stools and wheelchairs. In addition to the Chinese art, they now have a collection of Picasso etchings - so special to be able to see them",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kardex2dog

50,Amazing 'collection' (under the radar),"I read about this on Trip Advisor before visiting in Torrance. I have NEVER been disappointed from fellow TA reviewers. Our guide was excellent and had a wealth of knowledge to impart. Who knew that jade was more valuable than gold?! This collection is certainly the envy of many museums of art and exceeds many museums in value. There are also botanical gardens outside but by the time we finished our tour they were closed. If you have any interest in this type of collection, PLEASE don't miss it. You'll truly be sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaniceBlair
50,Hidden Treasure,I was really surprised at the items this gallery displayed. It all was so fascinating. There were so many really priceless artifacts on display.

The emperor robes were elegant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliforniaViv

I expected much smaller collection for a free gallery, but collection is impressive and includes emperors' furniture, pottery, porcelain, clothes, etc from 5000 years period.

50,Great collection of Chinese artifacts,"We were surprised by the extensive collection of Chinese art pieces in this hidden museum. The collection has items from the neolithic period up to contemporary artwork, and everything in between. There are more things here than we've seen in many other museums. Also, you are given a tour of the collection. Our guide was Holly. She is very knowledgeable, and her enthusiasm for the museum and art there was obvious. We really enjoyed this tour and will be back for sure when we're in the area.

50,Well Worth Visiting -- Make A Reservation,"This is a rare GEM, well worth making the time to visit. Dr. Tei-Fu Chen has spent 30 years collecting rare items from China. He allows visitors a chance to glimpse into Imperial China some that are 5,000 years old. There are beautiful objects from the various dynasties, we could understand the differences between the styles from one dynasty to the next.The only way to see the gallery is through a guided tour made with a reservation (highly recommended) and free of charge. Holly was our guide and she provided so much interesting information that gave us more of an appreciation about the life during that dynasty and the artists who created such exquisite objects. The only wish that we had was that we had a little more time to linger a few minutes longer so that we could fully appreciate all of the collection. We were also able to visit the garden located a block away from the gallery. The garden shows the herbs and flowers that are used for medicinal purposes. There is also a Koi pond, waterfall and gazebo.The gallery is open on Tuesday through Friday from 10am to 4pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveller1615
