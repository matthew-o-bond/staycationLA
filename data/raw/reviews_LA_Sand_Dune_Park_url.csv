50,Toughest Workout Ever,"If you fancy yourself an athlete you owe it to yourself to run up the sand dune in Sand Dune Park. Not many can make it running the whole way. If the sand is too tough you can take the steps, still a good workout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlO6141HK
50,A Great Place For Excercist,"This is a wonderful place for muscular and cardio workouts. Nestled behind the residential neighborhood of Manhattan Beach, you'll find this hidden gem. I first visited the Dunes in or around New Year of 2004. I had done a New Year's Day family workout with my best friend and two relatives. There had since been some restrictions placed on the times and hours that folks could visit because local residents had complained to the city of MB that exercisers were loitering. However, if you're respectful of the community and considerate, there's really no issue. I can't say that I've been here in the past few months but the last time I visited, I had a great workout just the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rokce
50,Nothing quite like it anywhere in Southern Cal,"Walking up and down Sand Dune park is a work out. People come ritually every morning, afternoon, or evening, for a walk and exercise. Some kids play on the dune, but it mostly exercise. It is STEEP. This year in 2017 the city is trying to limit the number of people at any one time, so busy weekends will actually require a reservation. If you have never hiked a san dune, this is the place to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickellFamilyTravel

50,One of a Kind Workout Fun,Challenge yourself or your family members to walk up/slide down the sandy hill for many times. I was there several times and made a 4-round trips up and down the sand dune. I was told by a young lady that she did 14 round trips for her weekly workout routine. That's way beyond my ability!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142SusanR
50,Nice Park to take the Children,"The Sand Dune Park has a fenced in area for children to play & climb on different play things like swings, Slides, a push go-around and a few other things to play on. They also have tables & benches to sit on outside of the play area or have a party. There is a person at the dunes to tell you if one can climb the dunes which is a very large hill but usually one has to make a reservation. They also have bathrooms at the park. It's a nice place to sit to read while the children play in the play yard on a sunny day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SOCal71
50,Humbling Workout!,I am a local and discovered that working the sand dunes or stairs adjacent to the dunes have improved my workout and made a difference. Challenge yourself. Try it and you'll keep coming back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gordanav284
50,Need to Get Your Heartrate Up?,Great place to run up a moderate hill and get your heart rate going. Make sure you take water. Safe and easy for little ones also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sallygutierrez
30,No free access to the actual dune,"I'm one of those who remember the days when the dune was open to everyone. No more. Access to the actual sand dune is very restricted bye the MB Parks dept, and requires paid reservations. The adjacent staircases are free for public access. So ore people are using the stairs for their exercise routine than the actual dune. The staircase closest to the dune has the most steps. The paths that wind up and down at mid-way points provide nice breaks for those that can't or don't chose to do one of the full staircase all at once. The stairs themselves are a great workout. If you visit this area please respect the neighbors and keep your voices at a reasonable level, especially in the early morning hours. The sound travels easily and the locals do not appreciate hearing about your personal life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EAWH77
40,Grueling Workout,"Located in the Tree Section of Manhattan Beach sits Sand Dune Park. The sand dune has been a workout venue for locals and a few college and sports teams for decades. Because of it's popularity in social media and because of abuse of the surrounding neighborhood by a few visitors, the park erected a fence, began charging a $1 fee for adult use, and set up a reservation system for use of the park. Parking is somewhat limited nearby but if you want a grueling workout this is the place. You literally try to walk/run up the sand dune to reach the top abut 80 yards away, turnaround and run down. After a couple of attempts you have had it for the day.Nearby is a children's play zone with swings and climbing structures. Picnic tables are nestled in the nearby park area. Generally, the local area is very quiet especially during weekdays. Parking is free and the beach is only a few blocks away (up another hill though).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobWE
40,Amazing workout spot!,"Sand Dune Park is a very tall sand dune in North Manhattan Beach. It is a great workout, but will cost you $1. It got too popular, and too many people came and abused the dune and the local properties near it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ace90266
30,Weird rules,"This is a great park with a nice tall fine, but the rules are weird.

40,Excellent Workout,"A great workout close to the beach in Manhattan Beach Ca. Can be crowded depending on time of year. Might need a permit depending on the crowds. Has a great climbing dune and set of stairs. Spectacular view once on top. My caution is 5he neighbors. Park only where you are allowed. Minimum parking at the dune so people park in the neighborhood. Neighbors are not friendly if you park by their houses.

A Great workout!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/695judj
40,Oddity with amenities,"I really wasn't sure how tall a 12 story sand dune is....well it's tall. Hike it if you want (there is a sign in form near the entrance). But do what the locals do....where socks and/or old shoes. If it's hot prepare for the sun to heat the sand. I had my small kids with so had to skip it. Lucky for me there is a great playground with shade, picnic tables and bathrooms there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/829gearym
